<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I inform the Senate that, pursuant to standing order 81, Senator Reid and Senator Spindler have each raised with me a matter of privilege and asked that I give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. The matter raised by the senators is that of Mr James Gaffey, which was the subject of the report presented to the Senate on 14 September 1992 by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The Committee reported that a charge under the Public Service Act was laid against Mr Gaffey in respect of his evidence to the Joint Committee, but was withdrawn when the Committee drew it to the attention of the Chairman of the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the relevant resolution of the Senate, I am required to determine whether a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee should have precedence, having regard to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter in question is clearly capable of being held by the Senate to meet criterion (a), and there is no other readily available remedy. Senator Reid and Senator Spindler have indicated that Mr Gaffey may have further evidence to present in relation to the matter. If this is so, it is an additional reason for giving precedence to a motion. I therefore rule that a motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee may have precedence under standing order 81.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I table the letters from Senator Reid and Senator Spindler. With the concurrence of Senator Kemp, I also table a letter which Mr Gaffey addressed to him. Senator Reid or Senator Spindler may now give a notice of motion accordingly.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 27 May 1992 on aspects raised by the Committee of Public Service Determination 1992/27.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Officers of your Department have since then assisted the Committee by appearing before it to speak to a paper and, after that meeting, by preparing another paper. The Committee considered that second paper at its meeting of 18 June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department's second paper covered various courses of action available in this matter. Under the heading "Conclusion" the paper advised that "the preferred option" is to deal with this problem by direct appropriation "through the current budget process". This confirms earlier advice in the paper that these arrangements "could be achieved in the 1992/93 budgetary process". The Department also advised, in a covering letter, that the paper would be the basis of a submission to you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would be completely satisfied if the matter was dealt with under the Department's preferred option. However, the Committee considers that another appropriate solution would be to amend the parent Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee emphasises its view that the present position for relevant officers, characterised by the Merit Protection and Review Agency as unfair and inequitable and the existence of which has been known for almost 20 years by the administering authorities, should be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would be grateful for your advice on proposed action on the Department's preferred option. It would be appreciated if this could be received by, say, the end of July, to enable the Committee to finalise its consideration of this matter by the start of the Budget sitting. Given that the preferred option is to operate in the context of the 1992/93 budgetary process we do not suppose that this will cause any difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also noted that Public Service Determination 1992/46 replaced the substantive provisions of subclause 11.1 of Public Service Determination 1992/27. Your Department advised that this was because "it was realised that subclause 11.1 did not have the intended effect". In order to preserve the options of the Committee I will give a notice of disallowance on this second Determination during the next sitting week.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the Committee would be completely satisfied if the matter was dealt with under the preferred option put by the Department of Industrial Relations in its second paper on the subject.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to previous correspondence about Public Service Determination 1992/27 and specifically correspondence of 18 June and 15 July 1992 between Senator Giles, the former Chair of the Committee, and you. You may recall that, in the letter from Senator Giles, she indicated that a notice of disallowance of Public Service Determination 1992/46 would be given in order to preserve the Committee's options while awaiting the final resolution of the matters of concern in Determination No. 27.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has noted from the proceedings of Estimates Committee F of 10 September 1992 (Hansard, pp F42-43) that it appears that your undertaking to the Committee is in the process of being fulfilled. Before giving notice of its intention to withdraw the disallowance motion in respect of Determination No. 1992/46, however, the Committee would appreciate your confirmation that its understanding is correct.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 17 September 1992 about Public Service Determinations 1992/27 and 1992/46. In view of the pending notice of motion to disallow the latter determination, you requested my advice about action to address the Committee's concerns on the anomaly in the treatment of recreation leave payments for certain officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to confirm that the Government has agreed to implement the option which had been foreshadowed to the Committee. Funding of $2.7 million for 1992-93 and $1.4 million for 1993-94 was included in the 1992 Budget for this purpose. I attach copies of the letters from the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance, for the information of the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in response to your letter of 15 July 1992 seeking my agreement to a scheme to correct under-payments of recreation leave in the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the actions taken by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to give notice or motion to disallow a determination under the Public Service Act relating to recreation leave, and in view of the issues of equity raised by the under-payments, I have agreed to the course of action outlined in your letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A one-line appropriation has been included in the 1992-93 Budget for expenditure of $2.7m in 1992-93 and $l.4m in 1993-94.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Peter</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter to the Prime Minister, which was copied to me on 15 July 1992, regarding recreation leave credits for pre-1966 Australian Public Service Officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree that the anomaly of recovering recreation leave credits at a 4 weeks rate rather than the 3 weeks rate at which the leave accrued should be corrected. This correction should be made retrospectively, to include those pre-1966 officers who left the service between January 1973 and March 1992. I note that it is not possible in this case to correct the problem through a section 82D determination. Accordingly, the scheme you have proposed appears to be the most effective method of achieving the desired outcome and will properly give Parliament the opportunity to scrutinise the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A one-line appropriation has the advantage, over the other options canvassed in your letter, of clearly setting out the purpose and amount of the payments in the Budget Papers. Thus Parliament will have been given the opportunity to scrutinise the scheme and, if it authorises the purpose expressed through the one-line appropriation, satisfies any concern that the proposed scheme might not have Parliamentary sanction.</PARA>

<PARA>In 1983, amid a lot of jubilation and fanfare, the ALP Government introduced and acted under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act to stop the Franklin dam. </PARA>
<PARA>In May 1988 the Helsham Commission recommended the nomination of Exit Cave for World Heritage listing. In doing so the heads of agreement that were worked out between the Federal and Tasmanian Governments, and signed by Senator Cook and Mr Ray Groom on 29 November 1988, fully recognised the possible incompatibility between a quarry operation and the values inherent in World Heritage listing. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth agrees that the operation of Bender's quarry within the Exit cave area nominated for World heritage listing can continue provided that acceptable limits are set to the scale and development of the operation. Should any financial loss result from any limits placed on the operation, the Commonwealth will pay compensation direct to the company concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1991, in a report prepared for the Tasmanian Government by Mr Kevin Kiernan, the operations of Benders Quarry were proven to have an impact on the World Heritage values of Exit Cave system. This information was contained in an hydrogeological report and in field survey notes. </PARA>
<PARA>Benders Pty Ltd prepared an Environmental Management Plan to support its continued operation of the quarry to which public submissions were invited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On  February 5 1992 Benders Spreading Services Pty Ltd was permitted to undertake some blasting under licence conditions drawn up by Tasmanian Department of Environment and Planning and endorsed by the Commonwealth. This was to provide a sample of limestone to form part of a tender for the supply of limestone to Pasminco-Ez. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my contention and the position of the Democrats that this should never have been permitted. It is at this point that the lack of responsibility of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) towards her World Heritage responsibilities becomes clearly evident. No further blasting should ever have been permitted following receipt of evidence showing that blasting was affecting the cave system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Monday 24 February, only three weeks after the `sample blast', the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Standing Committee assessed the Environmental Management Plan submitted by Benders Spreading Services Pty Ltd and concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">past and present quarrying operations have indisputably damaged solution cavities, sink holes and caves that are now known to be part of the Exit Cave karst subsystem.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that even under the strictest environmental conditions continuation of quarrying jeopardises the area's World Heritage values.</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation was to go to a meeting of the Ministerial Council which was to meet on 29 February to discuss the matter, but the meeting was postponed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear from comments made on ABC radio that the Tasmanian Minister, Mr John Cleary accepted the position of the Standing Committee but that he was concerned about the question of compensation. While this was a legitimate concern with which the Democrats would have a lot in common, it should not have stood in the way of a decision to close down the existing quarry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that same day I gave notice of a motion in the Senate which called on the Senate to note that:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)the Commonwealth Government to advise the Governor-General immediately to proclaim the Exit Cave system to be a property to which Sections 9 and 10 of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 applies, and</PARA>

<PARA>The World heritage listing obligates the Federal Government to do all in its power to protect the areas it nominates for listing. To sit idly by as the Minister did, Nero like outside burning Rome, while quarrying operations continued to eat away at the fundamental values for which the area was nominated for world recognition is Ministerial irresponsibility of the kind that has led to decades of environmental neglect and decay in this and other countries. But Minister Kelly sat on the problem and refused to budge, despite motions and speeches in this chamber calling on her as Minister responsible for managing our World Heritage responsibilities to proclaim the area and stop the blasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early May the Democrats sought to suspend standing orders to debate the motion that the Senate calls on the Government to immediately announce that it would use its World Heritage powers to close down quarrying, a motion which was opposed by both the Liberal and Labor Parties in this chamber. Yet later in the month the Minister announced that quarrying would have to cease. Although this was welcomed by the Democrats we were concerned at the absence of any concrete action being taken. We were also alarmed by the lack of detail in the Minister's announcement. The lack of detail led to speculation about what could or might occur at the quarry site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a couple of weeks later, there developed strong speculation that further blasting was going to occur. It had become abundantly clear that on environmental matters, neither this Government nor this Minister could be trusted. That blasting did not occur is probably due to the outrage that erupted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why then should we have any faith even in the Minister's gazettal notice of Tuesday 15 September which refused consent for further blasting by Benders Spreading Services Pty Ltd? Another Minister, or indeed this Minister could presumably just as easily issue another notice cancelling the order. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it is precisely the Minister's lack of commitment and decisiveness that has been the principal cause of the confrontations, anger and confusion that has been evident at the quarry site now for some weeks. She had not stated clearly and precisely her plans for protecting the cave system and upholding her responsibilities to manage and discharge her World Heritage obligations. Indeed I believe that the confrontations have been the direct result of the Minister's silence and inaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the answer provided to this chamber this week by Senator Collins does not lay to rest the fears surrounding this issue. Instead it highlights yet again the insensitivity and equivocation of this Minister. This week we learned for the first time that there is to be an independent adviser to supervise the rehabilitation work at the quarry. We do not know who that person is to be. And we still do not know precisely what rehabilitation work is required, nor who will prepare the rehabilitation plan. Nor is it at all clear why the Minister is to allow a further 9,000 tonnes of rock to be extracted from the quarry. How is that 3,000 tonnes of this is needed for rehabilitation work when there is yet no rehabilitation plan?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to my question, the Minister also informs us that a further 600 tonnes will become available for commercial sales. Is this the amount which the quarry is capable of yielding without further compromising World Heritage values, or is this the amount which was commercially `negotiated' to secure an agreement? The fact that any negotiations at all were necessary at this stage is entirely due to the Minister's earlier lack of precision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Exit Cave saga is another sorry saga in the Minister's performance of her environmental responsibilities. Simply put, neither she, nor her government can be trusted. And of course neither can the Liberals be relied upon to continue to protect the cave system. This Bill is therefore a necessity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be recalled that the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983, under which the Minister issued the recent Gazettal notice, is not regarded as an instrument for the ongoing management of Australia's World Heritage properties. The Act is only enabling legislation. It enables the Commonwealth to prevent damage to World Heritage values through the prohibition of prescribed acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a site to be subject to the Act it must first be an `identified property' and it must have be proclaimed by the Governor-General to be in danger of being damaged by some proposed activity. The activity must then be specifically prescribed by the Minister. This was done by the Gazettal notice of 15 September 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By advising the Governor-General to make a proclamation the Government is showing that it considers that the identified property is in danger of damage or destruction. The Minister should therefore be consistent and ensure that the proclamation and the Minister's subsequent refusal to consent to further blasting at the quarry should not be revoked or amended. The only way to now permanently do this is by legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we left this debate last night, we were discussing the financial failure of this Government as is evidenced not only in its appalling Budget performance, but also, of course, in these two Supply Bills which have come before the Senate. Just to recap very briefly on exactly how poor the financial and economic management of this Government has been, I need only remind honourable senators that it was only in August that the Government came before the Senate with a Budget that had a deficit on its own figures of $13.4 billion&mdash;$13.4 billion that this Government does not have; $13.4 billion of further debt for this nation. Of course, during this financial year there is a financing requirement in excess of that, a financing requirement of $18.5 billion. That is a financing requirement in excess of $1,000 for every man, woman and child in this nation. That is the achievement of this Government, its planned achievement in the space of just 12 months. That is what it is aiming to do. It is aiming to increase our indebtedness and it is aiming to further bankrupt this nation and the businesses that comprise this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disturbing thing is: where is the money coming from? Where is the Government borrowing the money that it is going to spend this year?  If one looks at the Budget Papers, one finds that most of the Government's borrowings will be at the longer end of the maturities. That means that, instead of taking short term money, it is going to be taking longer term money. It is going to be financing its operations on the basis of bonds rather than on the basis of treasury notes. This means that the sort of money it is sucking up into its spending programs is exactly the sort of money that is needed to finance new investment in this country for businesses from one end of the nation to the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is leaving all the hot money out there. It is leaving all the credit card money out there because it wants Australians to spend more on credit cards. But where is it taking the money from? It is taking the money from the deposits which would be available to lend to businesses or the deposits that would be available to lend to Australians who wish to buy their own home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this Government is engineering is not a real recovery; it is a phoney, short term recovery paid for with hot money. What this Government is going to do, of course, is seriously set back the prospects of real recovery, the prospects of economic growth, the prospects of new investment in the corporate sector, the prospects of operations, such as those referred to by Senator Tierney today in his notice of motion, being able to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the Government not been plundering the money that should be available for new investment, those sorts of companies and businesses from Cairns to Canberra, from Moreton Island to Marandoo, would be allowed to continue in this country. This Government has taken that money and put it in its own coffers. The Government could not wait to get its hands on the money that it intended to appropriate to itself. It could not wait even until the Appropriation Bills had been passed before it started spending willy nilly on this nation's credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has come before this Parliament and said, `In addition to the money that is in the Advance to the Minister for Finance, we want more. Please, give us more'. The Government has asked for another $170m, which it believes it needs now, before the Appropriation Bills come through. The Government cannot wait until Parliament deals with the Appropriation Bills. It is interesting to note that the Appropriation Bills were supposed to come on this month, but they have been held up yet again. If Senator McMullan, the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, could do his job properly, maybe we would not need these Supply Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Panizza says, Senator McMullan has a good adviser next to him. But where is Senator Walsh? He is relegated to the back bench. Here we find a situation where the Government cannot get its program right and has to keep asking for Supply Bills because it cannot get the Appropriation Bills into the Senate on time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that when we come to the end of this session we will see Senator McMullan standing over there telling us that there are a whole heap of Bills that now need to be considered as urgent, a whole heap of Bills the Government intends to guillotine through the Parliament without proper debate or consideration. We have the time available now to deal with the Appropriation Bills instead of the Supply Bills, but the Government has the Appropriation Bills languishing down the other end of the building. That is an example of how poor the management of this Government really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Government going to spend that $170m on? The $65m in Supply Bill (No. 3) is supposed to be for labour market programs and road safety programs and the $105m in Supply Bill (No. 4) is for local government capital works. In other words, this is the sort of money the Government wants for its phoney job creation schemes and it cannot wait until the Appropriation Bills get through Parliament to start spending the money. The Government wants to run out of this chamber, out of this Parliament, and spend, spend, spend to try to create some phoney jobs so that it can pretend that there is a recovery from the recession. It is interesting that just this week in the other place the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stood up in Question Time and steadfastly affirmed that not only is there not a recession but that we were out of recession long ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. That is a very good interjection from my friend Senator Panizza. If we are out of recession, why is the stock market continuing to go down? Why is it that this nation's economic performance makes Australia the sick man of South East Asia? Why is it that we have a country which used to be one of the finest and most prosperous in this region increasingly being looked upon, unfortunately, as a joke by our competitors and our trading partners overseas? The reason that situation has occurred is very simple: the Hawke-Labor Government of the last nine years. That is why our economic performance has been so bad. But here is a government that spends its time lambasting New Zealand and saying, `We do not want to become like New Zealand'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the opportunity to examine the track record of the Government in relation to New Zealand. Last year the Government congratulated itself on running only a balance of payments deficit, which means that we imported more than we exported by about $11 1/2 billion. It thought that was an achievement. The economy was haemorrhaging money at the rate of a billion dollars a month offshore while the Government congratulated itself on its performance. Yet it lambasted New Zealand, which actually managed to run a balance of payments surplus of $88m. New Zealand was doing substantially better&mdash;roughly $11 1/2 billion better&mdash;than we were, and the Government was saying to the people of Australia, `We do not want to become like New Zealand'. Why on earth not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a government that continued to see unemployment rise in the quarter to June 1992 while in New Zealand, a much smaller country, unemployment fell by 10,000 people. But the Government does not want us to be like New Zealand. Here we have food processing industries and plants closing, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, and New Zealand has a 30 per cent advantage over Australia in food processing because it has got its tax system right and because it has got its industrial relations system right. But this Government does not want us to become like New Zealand. I ask the question: why on earth not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should the Government be allowed, year after year after year, to continue to run down the economy of this nation without getting the condemnation it deserves? We now have the Supply Bills in front of us. The Government has come before us saying, `We would like you to give us $170m for our electoral campaign chest so that we can go out and spend the money in the hope that it might salvage the unsalvageable in Victoria'. We saw what happened in Victoria the other week. It really was unsalvageable. The people of Victoria realised that years and years and years of Labor government have wreaked their damage upon that economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The damage has been done not just to Victoria; it has also been done to the national economy. Last year this Parliament was asked to help bail out the State Bank of Victoria to the tune of about $1.6 billion. That Australian taxpayers' money was used to subsidise the Victorian Labor Government's economic mismanagement. Here we have the Government saying, `We need another $170m before the Appropriation Bills come through because we cannot wait to start spending the money'. What this is designed to do is to hoodwink the Australian people into believing that the recovery is starting and that the recession was over long ago. It is designed to inflate the national account figures to make it look as though the economy is growing. But all the growth in the economy is in one sector only. All the growth in the economy at the moment is in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has borrowed the money to pump into the economy to make it look as though there is some real growth. But out in real Australia, where the real men and women of this nation work, where the ordinary, hardworking, blue-collar workers are, where the struggling middle classes of this nation are, we know that there is no recovery. We know that the recession is still here. We know that unemployment, poverty and financial difficulties continue to abound and drive family after family after family in this nation to despair. We know that there are 600,000 children in this nation in families where neither partner is a breadwinner. We know that the Government continues only on its hollow promises, only on its poor rhetoric and only on its ability to disguise the real economic plight of Australia. But out in the households, out in the heartland of Australia, the truth is clear to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a time in this nation when hard work, honesty and thrift were qualities to be admired. There was a time when people were encouraged to work to better the lot of their families. There was a time when honesty was considered to be a good Australian characteristic and when saving, thrift and putting away for the future were also considered to be things that every good Australian should do. But what do we find now? We find conspicuous consumption. We find a government that has to spend and spend and spend because it knows nothing better.

I also rise to speak to the Loan Bill which finalises the prospective 1992-93 Budget deficit of $13.389 billion. This is the usual practice of funding the deficit of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Supply Bill (No. 3) and Supply Bill (No. 4) are unprecedented; they are additional to Supply Bill (No. 1) and Supply Bill (No. 2) which were passed in June to carry on with the usual expenses incurred by the Government, leading up to the end of November when the Appropriation Bills finally go through. But, as Senator O'Chee so ably pointed out, the Government cannot see itself as being able to get to that stage without looking for more supply for the unfunded promises that it may make in the future. The Government is certainly bringing these Bills on early. They have been introduced at the same time as the Appropriation Bills, which is very unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally, any shortfall is taken up as an Advance to the Minister for Finance. But the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, said in his second reading speech that that is not the right way to go. I have been following the proceedings of the Parliament for the last 30 years and that has always been the way to go. However, in his second reading speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reliance on the Advance to the Minister for Finance for these purposes would run the very real risk that there would be insufficient funds available to meet other urgent and unforeseen requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words `other' and `unforeseen'. Most governments can generally foresee what will happen from 1 July to 1 December but, obviously, this Government cannot. I think that `unforeseen circumstances' can only mean what the Government may promise between now and the next election. That is obviously&mdash;due to the results in Victoria a few days ago&mdash;a moveable feast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that these measures are quite so unforeseen; otherwise we would not have had the Supply Bill in so early. I believe that the Government did have an election date in mind&mdash;5, 12 or 19 December&mdash;when it brought these Supply Bills into the House of Representatives. I think the events in Victoria last Saturday have probably put that idea off to the last Saturday before Easter. We will see what happens in time. The unfunded promises between now and then will continue to grow. That is why the Supply Bills are out now and we might have another one before 1 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these Supply Bills are about the One Nation package and the One Job package. There has been a huge increase in spending coming up to the election and I believe that is just to soften up the electorate. Incidentally, talking about softening up the electorate, some of the projects that the Government proposed in the One Nation package&mdash;where it talks about the real jobs and real benefits to Australia&mdash;are not happening so fast. One of those cases is the promised amount for Australian Railways to improve the railways between, say, Sydney and Brisbane, Kwinana and Kalgoorlie and the South Australian section. </PARA>

I believe that having Supply Bill (No. 3) and Supply Bill (No. 4) brought in at this stage of the year with the Appropriation Bills is an admission that the Budget is already in a mess.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the Government's attempting to bring in money early. Using methods to bring money in early does not necessarily mean any extra money. There was the idea, which has already been thrown out in the Budget, that the Government would put a withholding tax on interest. Senator McMullan will remember this very well; it was one of the ways the Government was going to bring the money forward. What it did not work out and what it did not allow for was the fact, as I said, that this does not bring any more money in, it only brings it forward. All it was doing was taking the place of provisional tax. It was already allowed for in provisional tax. The Government was going to look at the idea of withholding tax on top of that on interest. Anyone who gets more than $1,000 interest a year knows that they have to pay provisional tax, so there was only that small amount that was not already covered between zero&mdash;or whatever it was&mdash;and the $1,000 that the Government was attempting to bring in early. Of course, when the tax returns were put in on, say, 31 March, a lot of that money had to flow back. The Government then worked out that the measure had failed. I do not know why it was put in originally, but the Government worked out that it had failed so it threw it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bringing in that sort of measure&mdash;or attempting to; it has gone out the window&mdash;is an admission that the tax file number has failed. We have got the tax file number; we were supposed to have an Australia Card which was going to fix any rorts on income tax in Australia, especially through interest, through rents and through other sorts of things. The tax file number was supposed to be the end of it all. We supported the tax file number as a workable instrument and here we are: the Government brought in a measure which it has since thrown out again. Either it did not think through the measure properly or it is admitting that the tax file number has failed. If the Government wants to improve the tax file number let it do so, but do not let it use other actions that might jeopardise it, rather than improve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the local government capital works program. That was a program that was thrown around to buy votes in the selective way that it was used. Take the example of Stirling in Western Australia: it is a rather well-to-do sector of Perth and, incidentally, a marginal seat. It received some $7m. Another local government, the city of Wanneroo, is right alongside it. I think it is the fastest expanding metropolis in Australia and it got zero. Where there is expansion one would think that this is where this sort of allocation would be needed. There was no rhyme or reason for the allocations anywhere in Western Australia. Kalgoorlie got zero; a small town not far away got some; Derby got quite an allocation; and Broome, not far away from it, got none. There was no rhyme or reason. These allocations created a lot of mickey mouse jobs; they were thrown around with no real reason except to get the votes where maybe this Government did not have them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I talk about mickey mouse jobs. Some of the money that was allocated in One Nation I certainly agreed with, especially with regard to the railways, the roads and the black spots and so on&mdash;though the black spots are not necessarily where unemployment is. But there were the ones that did create mickey mouse jobs. I said to a local government in Western Australia last week, `You got an allocation. What are you doing with it?'. They said, `Oh, well, we are going to do some cycle paths'. I asked, `How many people ride bicycles in this area?'. From my observation there were not many at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has to look at these local government grants and see whether this money did create jobs. With a lot of the capital works that are going to be done with it tenders are called. The firms that tender and are successful have already got their work crews. Worse still, the work crew generally come from somewhere else where that contractor is based. So without being too negative, I would like to know whether it creates jobs. I do not mean prop-up ones, those that prevent people going out of work. I suppose it is an advantage if the money does that, but does it really create jobs? I would like that one to be really looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told in the last couple of days that the recession is long over. If the recession is long over, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has stated in the last couple of days, I would like the Government to tell me&mdash;or anyone to tell me&mdash;why it is, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in the last day or so, that the Australian Stock Exchange is at its lowest point in 18 months. If the recession was over yesterday that is a different matter, but if it is long over one would think it would have caused a reaction on the Australian Stock Exchange. But no, it is at the lowest point for 18 months. Can someone tell me about that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the recession is long over, please tell the farmers who are onto me every day of the week with their problems. Also tell that to those on the job queues. The job queues have not shortened at all. If the recession is over, why should they not shorten? Also tell the school leavers. A lot of the school leavers of last year have not got jobs. The new term is due to start any time now, so there will be another lot of school leavers out there. Please tell them that the recession is over and tell them why they are not getting jobs. I believe that the way to go is for the Government to encourage small business&mdash;and even big business&mdash;because they are the ones that create the employment. Small business, as everyone knows and without my saying it again, is the biggest employer. We have seen a slight improvement in the numbers they are employing. They are the biggest employer of people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need the big mining companies and industries to take up the slack in Australia. Honourable senators would have seen the announcement that the mining project Marandoo in Western Australia finally has been given the go-ahead after about two years, 13 reports and three more reports pending. I believe a project with a capital structure of about $500m, creating some 4,000 jobs during construction, with 350 permanent jobs, would be welcomed by everyone in Australia as possibly being a turnaround, that this Government is going to see the light after all and not listen to fringe groups that want to stop all sorts of development. One would think it would be welcomed by everyone in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it seems to be not very welcome with the Australian Democrats. Senator Coulter yesterday put out a press release calling on the Western Australian Government not to go ahead with that project&mdash;that $500m project in the Karijini National Park. I will describe the national park a bit later on. But here he is calling for it not to go ahead. It is only a $500m project, but it will keep the life of the central Pilbara going for 20 years. It is very necessary to do that one, to get through the national park and extend the railway down to Mount Newman. But Senator Coulter is now on the record as saying that there is absolutely no reason to mine inside the Karijini National Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me describe that national park. In 1946, I am told&mdash;and I have read the history&mdash;it was still a cattle station. The owners abandoned it because it was not longer viable. It could not carry any more stock, it was short of underground water, and it was being taken over by feral animals. To fill the void that left, the Lands Department&mdash;in conjunction with the Government of Western Australia, no doubt&mdash;called it a national park. It is as much a national park as the Simpson Desert. I have travelled part of the Simpson Desert and it is far more hospitable than that section. I have been in there and travelled over it myself: it is an absolute wasteland. Yet here is Senator Coulter saying that it is one of the top national parks of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this, briefly, especially to the Australian Democrats, to show that not all Australia has woken up to the fact that Australia needs investment in small business, in big business, in mining, if we are to turn Australia around. I call on all Australians to look on development with favour and to take these developments on board, as they are cleared by governments throughout Australia, as being for the good of all Australia, without finding every reason to knock them over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excuse that this is a unique park has been used as a red herring all over Australia. The same unreasonable excuses are being used time and time again. We had a debate on whether there should be mining in Kakadu National Park. I believe that mining should have gone ahead there; I visited the park as part of an inquiry into mining in Kakadu National Park. At least part of the park was a top national park and would have ranked with anything in the world but a lot of it was not. Senator Evans, some time back, called it clapped out buffalo country. Even that clapped out buffalo country of Kakadu National Park, however, would be kilometres ahead of what exists at this former Mount Bruce cattle station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The station was abandoned as being unviable&mdash;no surface, could not grow anything, useless&mdash;thrown open and then turned into a national park, just to give it a go. I understand that there could have been a bit of play between a Premier of Western Australia and one mining fellow about using it to hold things up, but that is just a bit of side play. Here we are with a $500m project ready to help Western Australians&mdash;3,500 jobs immediately to set the mine up and 350 more, as well as the production that comes out of it in iron ore&mdash;yet we have the Australian Democrats trying to knock it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been three issues involved in the debate on Supply Bill (No. 3) and Supply Bill (No. 4). Very little of the debate has been about the substance of the Bills, although some of it has been. There has been significant debate about the process and some about the economic context, and the questions of process and economic context are those that are reflected in Senator Short's amendments. I will turn to those in a moment. Let me refer first to the substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills are essentially to ensure the availability of funds for socially worthwhile projects which will also create jobs, particularly in the regions of greatest need. So, to the extent to which the amendment says that these Bills are politically motivated, in the proper sense of the word `political', meaning that they are motivated by a desire to achieve agreed social objectives by the Government, that is technically true. As with every Bill that comes into the Senate, these Bills have as an objective to achieve a desired social outcome, and we are working through the institutions of government to achieve that agreed social outcome. So, in that technical sense, one could say that they are political, and no-one would apologise for it. That should be the case with every piece of legislation that comes into this chamber. If it is meaning that the legislation is simply partisan, that is a nonsense, and I will come to that in dealing with the question of process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a fascinating, if terribly repetitive, discussion about the inappropriateness of the process of introducing these Bills. I will remind people, in thinking about the process, to go back to the much more fundamental question of the purpose of these Bills and the substance of the Bills, because the two are related. It is true that the Government desires, as it has already announced, to make the money available quickly. One example has been used predominantly, including by Senator Panizza. I do not agree with his comments about it but he is correct in saying that one of the things that these Bills are designed to deal with is local government capital works projects. That is a correct and appropriate example to choose. We have already announced some projects for which funds will be made available. In fact, we have made offers to local authorities to fund particular, specified projects which have been announced, and there will be more announced very soon in accordance with the timetable outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three ways in which the Government can fund these proposals. The funds all come from the same pool of money. There is no extra money. It is the money in the Budget. In the Minister's second reading speech on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) he said that there are three Bills to provide the funds for these various projects: the previous Supply Bills, the Appropriation Bills and these Supply Bills. We are not appropriating extra money. This is part of the money announced in the Budget. There are three ways in which the Government can make this money available more quickly to enable the jobs to be made available more quickly. There is no secret about that. It is exactly why these Bills have been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said in his second reading speech on the Bills. It is so that we can start the projects more quickly and create the jobs more quickly, and I believe that is a socially desirable and justifiable purpose. Others are entitled to have alternative views and say that we should not be creating the jobs so quickly. I do not object to their saying that. I just wish they would be more explicit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three ways in which we can fund these proposals. One is through the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The second is that we can use exactly this process but call them extra appropriation Bills instead of extra supply Bills. Senator Short made some reference to that in the Estimates Committee. I do not know whether he did so in his speech in this debate. I did not pick it up if he did. The third is the mechanism that we have used, which is extra supply Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back to the AMF as the third of the three options. It is, in my view, more appropriate to deal with this by way of Supply Bills rather than Appropriation Bills. I do not regard that as a very significant distinction in terms of these Bills but they are essentially performing the function of Supply Bills; that is, making money that would otherwise be appropriated in the Budget available during this supply period. So I think that is a more appropriate nomenclature, although I accept that that is not a fundamental distinction and, had they been called `Appropriation Bills', the whole debate would have been exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short said that this is unprecedented, and as far as I can tell that is correct. I have to say in response to that, `So what?'. As far as I can tell, it is unprecedented to introduce extra Supply Bills on the same day as the Budget, as it would have been unprecedented to do that with Appropriation Bills. There is no precedent for that either. It is nevertheless an entirely proper process; the alternative was simply to turn to the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two reasons why I think that is not the appropriate course, one which was made explicit by the Minister for Finance in the second reading speech to these Bills and one which was made explicit by me in the Estimates Committee discussions. The first is that, as a matter of prudence, it is possible that making these large calls upon the AMF&mdash;calls now foreseen but not, of course, foreseeable at the time the original Supply Bills came in&mdash;may cause other urgent and unforeseen calls upon the AMF not to be able to be funded. Therefore, other important things for which the AMF is usually set aside may not be able to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza saw some significance in these terms `urgent' and `unforeseen'. They are the criteria that have to be met for an expenditure to be funded out of the AMF. That is why those words are used: they are the criteria that have to be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion, it is likely that we would have been able to fund all this out of the AMF. It is probable. I will just divert briefly to make a comment I was going to make at the end. Senator Bishop, in speech at the second reading stage, said that she was waiting to hear the answer to a question she asked at page 126 of the Estimates Committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The only reason she is waiting to hear is that she was not listening. The answer, relating to the amount of money then available in the AMF, was given by the officer, Mr Pearson, and appears at page 147 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for Estimates Committee B. It is more than likely, but not certain, that we could have funded this from the AMF but it would not, in my view, have been the prudent thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing surprises me about this debate. In my view, funding by the AMF would not have been the proper process because there would not have been this explicit bringing before the Parliament of the funding arrangements for a major initiative. This way we are saying, `We are not doing it by an advance that is subsequently declared to the Parliament. We are explicitly legislating'. It is entirely the proper process. It was my advice to the Minister for Finance that this was the better parliamentary process. It is of no political significance to the Government which way we fund it. We have the same amount of money to perform exactly the same function so there is no political significance in which way we do it. It is a question of proper process and prudence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a bit of enthusiasm from Senator O'Chee, in particular, for the idea that if we had handled the parliamentary timetable properly we could have done this via the ordinary passage of the Appropriation Bills. There is no precedent of which I am aware, as far back as I have checked, for the Appropriation Bills ever being passed by this date. These Bills will be passed today. I know of no precedent for their being passed by 8 October. So there was some necessity to have another mechanism&mdash;</PARA>

I take honourable senators back to the debate, which generated more heat than light, on whether or not Australia was in recession in the 1990-91 financial year. At that time, there was the articulation of the conventional criteria that measure whether or not an economy is in recession; that is, two successive quarters of negative growth. It is a matter of fact that that is no longer the case in Australia and has not been for some time. We now seem to be in the absurd situation where there are only two categories of economy&mdash;those in recession and those booming. I regret to say that is not the case. We can have a continuum of classification, but there is, at the very least, a third category&mdash;those that are growing, but growing too slowly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This piece of legislation is an omnibus Bill which was originally meant to deal with three separate items and now has had an amendment by the Government added to it so that we are dealing with a proposal to extend the life of the Automotive Industry Authority itself. We are dealing with a proposal regarding the Science and Industry Research Act and we are dealing with the most important part of this omnibus Bill which deals with weights and measures and the National Measurement Act. Added to that, and bearing no nexus at all, are proposed amendments concerning trademarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two parts of the Bill to which the Opposition is strenuously opposed relate to the Automotive Industry Authority Act and the National Measurement Act. I intend to deal in some detail with both of those proposals as the Opposition believes that these amendments ought not to be passed. I can say at the outset that the proposal to extend the life of the Automotive Industry Authority to the year 2000 is opposed by us for the very simple reason that we are winding down tariffs with regard to the automotive industry, and by the year 2000 we will be looking at a top tariff rate of 5 per cent. Thus the continuation of the Authority, in the terms in which it is proposed in this Bill, from our stance serves no point at all. Furthermore, we point out that to continue the Authority would have a financial impact on running costs of about $1.1m per annum to cover just administrative expenses and salaries, and a further $215,000 for annual property operating expenses&mdash;expenses which quite clearly we do not think are justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The automotive industry has shown that the Government's policy of picking winners&mdash;and the Button car plan has been just that; it has been a picking winners exercise&mdash;has meant that Australians have paid more for locally made cars. It has promoted an atmosphere where efficiency is not the thing the industry has sought to pursue. In spite of the presence of high tariffs&mdash;in absolute terms and in relative terms&mdash;to the majority of Australian manufacturing industries, industry protection has failed to make a winner of the car industry. It has added $4,000 to the cost of a car in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides this, the Industry Commission has found that the average replacement period for private vehicles on our roads is now 17 years. I can remember a time when Australians used to laugh at New Zealanders for driving old rust buckets. Now the boot is on the other foot and they laugh at us. In the OECD the average is between eight and 11 years, so we are exceeding even the highest figure of that average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the empirical evidence shows that tariffs&mdash;and tariffs are a tax; that is all they are&mdash;do not encourage efficiency. It is worth while looking at some of that empirical evidence. If one looks at the automation levels of our assembly plants and how they compare, for instance, with the NIEs&mdash;the newly industrialising economies&mdash;one will see that we are way behind those levels. It will be seen also that the industry has one of the highest rates of labour turnover and absenteeism, which is estimated to add $850 to the cost of each car manufactured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, our quality rate, in comparative terms, ranks among the worst in the world. I know that there has been an endeavour on the part of local industry to raise the standard and the quality of the cars that are made. Nonetheless, the empirical evidence is that the average number of defects per 100 cars manufactured in an Australian assembly plant is 150. In the newly industrialising economies it is fewer than 100 errors, and in Japan it is only 60 errors per 100 manufactured vehicles. In terms of quality, it is no wonder that imported cars are taking a greater share of the vehicle market. It is simply a question of quality and not a question of tariff tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our poor performance was confirmed in a study last year by the Swiss Lausanne Business School, which assessed the international competitiveness of the various countries manufacturing automobiles. Australia ranked third last: we beat only Brazil and Mexico. With this sort of record, one can only say that the Button car plan, a picking winners exercise, has been a dismal failure. This part of the Bill, which would seek to extend the life of part of that plan, that is, the Authority itself, is from our point of view a waste of taxpayers' money in spending that additional $1.1m a year to keep it in business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the Industry Commission calculations on the effect of maintaining the Government's policy, that is, to maintain a 15 per cent tariff rate until the year 2000, one finds that that would create an effective rate of protection of some 30 per cent, when the rest of industry in this country will be attracting a rate of only around 5 per cent. In other words, the pattern of picking winners means that the efficiency of the industry trails behind the other industries which are competing for capital and for labour. That, indeed, is why tariff tax and the policies of protection are so unfair: other industries in the economy have to compete at an unfair rate for capital and for human resources. Thus we will be moving to oppose the passing of those provisions in the omnibus Bill when we come to the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the omnibus Bill relates to the Science and Industry Research Act 1949. Clauses 12 and 13 are simply of a technical nature and seek to amend the Act. Clause 13 relates to the office of the Chief Executive of the CSIRO and provides that decisions about the residual terms and conditions of the appointment shall be made by the Minister rather than the Governor-General. This proposed amendment merely brings the CSIRO into line with other current legislative practice, and is not opposed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to, in my opinion, the most important part of the Act, which deals with the National Measurement Act 1960. Until recently, the question of weights and measures and the National Measurement Act had not attracted much attention, including mine. It has been an area that people might have thought was rather grey and not of interest. Yet, once one starts to go into the ramifications of these amendments, one sees that this is part of the new protectionism&mdash;the non-tariff barrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments, which are contained in part 3 of the Bill, affect the operations of the National Standards Commission. It was not until I was approached by the Weighing Industry Association of Australia that it was revealed to me just what over-regulation of standards in weights and measures is proposed and just how this can impact upon industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the Government has failed to appreciate that the inefficient over-regulation of measuring instruments leads to greater costs for manufacturers, who must either transfer those costs onto consumers or cut back in other areas such as labour, which can ultimately lead to greater unemployment. In the Estimates Committee meetings, where we asked many questions of Mr Birch, of the Commission, we received unsatisfactory answers. I am amazed to have received by fax today a letter&mdash;a nine-page epistle&mdash;written by the Minister, Senator Button, and dated yesterday, attempting at this late stage to answer some of the criticisms put forward by the Weighing Industry Association. The letter also fails to meet the objections that the Association raised to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this worst recession we are having&mdash;the one `we had to have' but which we have been told recently is now over, except that we have not bothered to tell the one million people who are unemployed&mdash;there cannot be a worse time to put further burdens on industry. Yet that is precisely what the Government is choosing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been the concern of the measuring industry that excessive time has been taken to establish Australia's uniform trade measurement system. The system has been agreed upon by the States and is to be coordinated by the National Standards Commission. State based legislation has been slow in coming, and the industry complains of differences in procedures between the States and excessive costs in some areas&mdash;all valid criticisms. In particular, there have been difficulties arising from variations between States as to fees, accreditation criteria, and availability of verification and certification test procedures. This Bill represents in its very worst form an attempt to achieve uniformity. By its regulations it attempts to bring about a system that is more stringent and allows for further overregulation by delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who sit on the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances are always concerned by the fact that we encounter from time to time, too regularly, the situation where regulations are doing what ought to be in the Act. When these regulations finally come before that Committee I will be making very careful scrutiny of them to see whether they infringe the principles of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current trade measurement system includes an approval of patent procedure, where each model and capacity of weighing instrument is required to be certified. Before the certification period expires, the procedure must be carried out again to ensure that the instrument conforms to current National Standards Commission requirements. This procedure amounts to overregulation by international standards, as other countries provide for a certification period of 10 years followed by a much less severe renewal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental concern of the weighing industry is that, although Australia is a signatory to the International Convention on Legal Metrology, that Convention is interpreted in an overrigid fashion in this country and is superimposed by further requirements by the National Standards Commission. At times, this has led to the absurd outcome where the Commission would not accept characters of 3.7 millimetres on legend notices and insisted upon 4 millimetres height. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The weighing industry was not even consulted in the preparation of this Bill. That became quite evident during the Estimates hearings. Indeed Senator Button himself, in a letter he wrote to the Weighing Industry Association on 8 September, recognised that there was no consultation. In that letter, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Association has also criticised the lack of consultation on the legislative amendment, and expressed fears that this is a means for the Commission to introduce a load cell pattern assurance scheme by stealth. I understand the Commission accepts that consultation on the legislative amendments was deficient and more attention will be paid to informing and consulting stakeholders in future.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a bit like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted. According to the weighing industry, the strictness of the National Standards Commission's interpretations of the Convention I mentioned previously, combined with the levels of approval fees and other National Standards Commission charges in the present recession, is putting excessive pressure on the industry, which is largely comprised of small business. Indeed, many of the firms are finding it increasingly difficult to remain viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give an example to back up that proposition, the weighing industry has been disadvantaged by the rigid interpretation of international recommendations relating to the humidity test, which is applied to instruments intended for use in supermarkets. A test of the duration of four days, at 40 degrees celsius, at a relative humidity at 93 per cent, has been required by the Commission. Surely that is an excessive requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposals for load cell sampling have also been put up by the Commission in a way that would be very costly in terms of time and resources. Not only was the standard itself excessive, but the National Standards Commission proposed to charge a fee of $1,550 for each sample load cell tested, irrespective of model capacity. Such strict tests are a costly impost upon business in the industry that ultimately transfers to consumers the high costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large part of the overregulation imposed by the Commission is brought about by the patronising notion that the National Standards Commission exists to protect the interests of consumers. Wrong. It does not occur to the Government, or indeed to the Commission, that there is such a thing as an overly accurate instrument or an overly rigid standard; nor does it occur to the Commission that the very best form of consumer protection is to enable freer competition to give consumers a greater range of choice at more competitive prices. It is not logical to accept that the measurement for trade use dictates the production of instruments capable of accurate results to satisfy worldwide requirements. There is a demonstrated demand for such accuracy. As a matter of principle, I believe that this will be provided via the market mechanism more accurately than by some bureaucratic determination of the Standards Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps some of these problems could be overcome by greater representation on the Commission of the measuring and weighing industries and relatively less control from those with a purely academic, scientific or bureaucratic focus. It does seem to be a constant criticism that the people who are actually in the business not only have not been consulted but also are not represented. Presently there is only one commissioner drawn from the measuring industry, and that commissioner is in the petroleum industry. There are no representatives from the weighing industry per se. Thus the composition of the Commission is out of balance, given that about one-third of the Commission's activities relate directly to the viability of the trade measurement industry. Surely this imbalance must be rectified. An overly scientific focus has been at the expense of firms that operate in the weighing and measuring industry. The losers at the end of the day are the consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill itself contains, amongst other things, powers that will enable us to search and seize. It has a very broad-ranging power to make regulations which, in my view, at this stage ought to be more properly in the Bill. We will see when they are finally made. The current arrangements for the checking of equipment, as I have said, and compliance tests are presently carried out by the State authorities and not by the National Standards Commission. The amendments are aimed at transferring the compliance tests to the Commission so that they become a laboratory function rather than a field inspection, which is not a sound practice for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's intention, as I said earlier, is in the committee stage to oppose these proposed amendments so that they would be effectively deleted. There is one further point I would like to bring forward with regard to this section of the Bill, and that is the question of cost. In the current appropriations, the National Standards Commission in the recent Budget gets an increase in operating expenses from $1.45m in 1991-92 to $2.17m in 1992-93. This represents a 50 per cent increase in operating expenses in one year alone. The Government should justify this dramatic increase. I assure the Commission that I will be pursuing this matter further in the Committee of the Whole following the Estimates reports. In particular, I would like some answers in light of the statement in the explanatory memorandum of the Bill before us today that there is no financial impact of the proposed changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the proposed amendments to the Trademarks Act, which were received subsequently by way of an amendment by the Government. They propose to toughen up penalties for counterfeiting and forgery of trademarks for falsely describing imported goods or goods intended for export. I have no argument with the need for laws to protect property, which includes intellectual property. The Opposition will not be opposing these sections. But it concerns me personally that we intend to have available a prison sentence of some two years, which would mean that somebody who prints a T-shirt with the words `Hermes' or `Chanel' on it and sells it in Paddy's Markets could go to gaol. That to me seems to be a sledge-hammer to crack a nut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment by the Democrats to increase the financial penalty to an even greater height will not be supported by the Opposition. As I said, we will not be opposing these proposed amendments, but I feel that they are excessive in treating the problem that they see needs to be rectified. I can only repeat that I find excessive the proposition of putting people in gaol for printing T-shirts and selling them in a market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, omnibus Bills of this nature I find poor legislative form. To bring together such disparate matters and put them in a single Bill, with the last one being tacked on only as an afterthought, I do not think shows that there is good management of the legislative program. As I said, the question of weights and measures is the most important part of the Bill, as it is onerous that it is not going to advantage the consumer and that it amounts to a non-tariff barrier. I have also said that this area of industry has not attracted much attention before. I would not like to see it overlooked again. When we look at the question of micro-economic reform and the need to make the cost of doing business cheaper, we simply do not need to be adding to the impost to business as we are by that section of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 amends six separate Commonwealth Acts. What seemed like an innocuous little omnibus Bill at first glance turned out to be bigger than Ben Hur. Lobbyists descended on to me like flies to bad meat. Rolls of fax paper have been consumed, printing volumes of letters and information. Lots of people have been getting into a tizz. In the light of my experience with this piece of legislation I would have to agree with Senator Bishop: I have decided that I do not like omnibus Bills. There are so many different issues covered in such a wide-ranging fashion. It would be much simpler for all concerned if some of these omnibus Bills were split up into their separate components, especially where very complex amendments are proposed and where the issues are very different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall deal with the proposed amendments in descending order of angst. Changes to the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 give the Minister the power to determine the remuneration of the chief executive of the CSIRO. This is a fairly valid and reasonable amendment and the Democrats will not be opposing it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, amendments to the Automotive Industry Authority Act 1985 extend the termination date for the Authority to 31 December 2000. This measure is in line with the Government's March industry statement correlating with the cessation of the tariff reduction program flagged in that announcement. The Automotive Industry Authority is charged with the responsibility of oversight of the Government's car plan, including the contentious tariff cuts. In the past we have said a lot about tariff cuts. We have suggested that in this time of high unemployment and in this recessionary climate there should be a 12-month pause in the Government's tariff cuts policy, but that has gone unheeded by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have expressed our concern about this accelerated policy of tariff cuts; but we necessarily feel, be that as it may, that the AIA has an important role at this time in advising the Government on this important industry sector. In our view, there is nothing wrong with sectoral industry policies. Indeed, many of the newly industrialised countries, and not a few industrialised countries such as Japan and Germany, have built an economy on targeted policies aimed at developing a comparative advantage in selected industry sectors. We see nothing particularly wrong with that. The Democrats will therefore not oppose this minor amendment to the Automotive Industry Authority Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that abolition of the AIA is the Opposition's policy, and that is the reason for opposing the amendment to the Act. I say to the Opposition that we will not be supporting its amendment at this time, but we will look at the issue of abolishing the Automotive Industry Authority on its merits if and when the Opposition gets into government. At this time we are presented with a fairly minor amendment to a government program that we have decided to accept, and we will assess whatever the Opposition cares to throw at us after the election, if and when it is elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to another four Acts&mdash;the National Measurement Act 1960, the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905, the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906&mdash;have some elements of controversy and have become objects of concern to industry groups. Over the past few weeks I have received strong representations from both the Weighing Industry Association and the Anti-counterfeit Action Group. The Anti-counterfeit Action Group has come to me in relation to those amendments to the Trade Marks Act and related Acts. I believe that there has been some justification for their concerns which I intend to examine herewith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Trade Marks Act and related Acts have caused a great deal of concern in the clothing industry and in the retail industry. Here I must make some complaint on my own behalf about lack of consultation. The amendments to the first two Acts appeared just a day before they were due to be debated back in August. They were not included in the original package of Bills and no <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> report was done on them, nor do they appear in the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report. They literally fell out of the sky. It would have been better for everyone if a little more time had been given to assess the implications of those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, amendments to the Designs Act were not given to me until the following Tuesday, 8 September. These were revised amendments that were circulated. I do appreciate that the Government has put off this legislation until now in order to allow honourable senators to have an opportunity to examine those amendments. However, at the time when it looked as though the Bill was on or off, it made it all very difficult to sit down and listen to the concerns of industry in a quiet and rational manner. It is very difficult to address legislation in a responsible way when amendments appear suddenly, especially when we are deluged by industry groups complaining about lack of consultation on their part and listing a whole raft of concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed fortunate that the Bill was postponed until today, and I thank the Government for having listened to the many representations made by industry. It has enabled all of us to give the legislation some serious thought. I am very pleased, I have to say, that the Government is addressing the serious problems faced by Australian manufacturers and importers of popular fashion items, who have seen their profits and reputations eroded by cheap copies bearing their labels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Trade Marks Act are based on the anti-counterfeiting forgery recommendations of the report of the working party to review the trademarks legislation. The report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recommended Changes to Australian Trademarks Legislation July 1992,</EMPHASIS> prescribes substantially stiffer penalties for forging registered trademarks and dealing in counterfeit goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act substantially increase the penalties under the Act. The amendments to the Designs Act were caused by two recent court decisions which had the unfortunate effect of invalidating many registered designs. This error has now been corrected. For far too long the Australian Government and the legal system have condoned the import, manufacture and sale of cheap copies by failing to implement substantial fines and gaol terms. Turning a blind eye to the wider implications of this trade, the Government has ignored the lost jobs, lost tax revenue, damage to small business and danger in the use of faulty counterfeit parts, particularly in planes and cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These three Acts are vitally important. This trade in fakes must be stopped. The footwear and clothing industry is perhaps the most visible sufferer from imported and locally  manufactured fake trademarks. Clothes can be imported cheaply from overseas and sold cheaply at markets, stalls and the like, thereby violating the intellectual and trade property of legitimate business operations. These amendments are an important non-tax, non-tariff measure which will protect Australian industry without passing costs on to consumers. Legitimate Australian businesses are finding it hard enough to survive in the recession without being ripped off by the unscrupulous use of fake labels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it stands, this Bill concentrates more on penalties for counterfeiting and forgery of trademarks and for falsely describing imported goods or goods intended for export. I have been advised that local manufacturers of fake goods would already be covered under the concepts of `forgery' and `falsely applied' used in section 98 of the Trade Marks Act. So at this stage there is no need to move further on that point. The Anti-counterfeit Action Group estimates that there are around 500 manufacturers of fake goods in Australia, and that an individual selling 1,000 items per week will earn almost $300,000 per year in cash, with minimum overheads, as these businesses are generally operated by families working a different market every day of the week. Multiply that by several hundred markets operating Australia-wide and the scale of the rip-off operation can be clearly seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this Bill came to my attention several weeks ago there has been quite a deal of media coverage of the problems faced by importers and manufacturers of popular brand goods. Overseas manufacturers such as Coca-Cola, Cardin, Rolex, Reebok, et cetera, spend millions of dollars protecting their brand names from fakes, yet they have still been unable to stem the tide. They quote as a major reason the fact that the law does not have strong penalties and that judges do not view this white collar crime with the same abhorrence as they view most violent forms of criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the judiciary will realise that there is a trickle-down effect with this type of crime that impacts much further than is immediately apparent. They need to impose stronger sentences and fines than they have in the past to deter these criminals. The legislation now before us will strengthen considerably those penalties. However, it is our belief that the proposed penalties are insufficient, and we will be moving more amendments to address this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment I shall move relates to the test of reasonableness in relation to knowledge of whether a trademark was registered or not. This amendment springs from concerns raised by the Anti-counterfeit Action Group that the existing amendment proposed by the Government could provide a loophole for those seeking to defend themselves in a counterfeit action. The reasonableness test will ensure that those acting illegally will have to satisfy this criteria rather than hide behind language barriers and pleadings of ignorance, as has been the case in the past. This, we believe, is a sensible and simple amendment that we hope may have Government support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next set of amendments relates to the National Measurement Act, and Senator Bishop has already elaborated quite lucidly on the wide-ranging effects of those amendments. The amendments are to the National Measurement Act 1960 and will broaden the power and scope of the National Standards Commission. The Commonwealth, of course, does have power to legislate in regard to weights and measures, and this is enshrined in the Constitution under section 51(xv). The proposed amendments to the National Measurement Act 1960, while on the surface appearing to be innocuous, will have some far-reaching effects on the weighing industry, both in the apparent excess of regulation and the likely increased cost to industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accurate measurement is very complex; far more complex than I would have ever thought possible. It is also vitally important, both to local consumers of weighed products, who require accurate measurement to ensure they are not being cheated by short weight, and to Australia's international trading partners, who need to be confident that measures made in Australia conform to international standards. In addition, measures are used for various legal purposes, such as breathalyser units and radar speed measurements, so it is important that the community can have confidence that measuring devices are accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, it is crucial to Australia's trade performance and international competitiveness that we be seen to recognise international agreements such as the Convention Establishing an International Organisation of Legal Metrology&mdash;legal metrology, of course, being the field of law dealing with weights and measures. The Government is attempting to clarify the implementation of this Convention in Australia through the proposed amendments to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While recognising the importance for Australia to be seen as firmly embracing international standards, some sections of the weighing industry in Australia have questioned the necessity for the excessive monitoring of the industry that these amendments may possibly bring about. Indeed, the National Standards Association has admitted that these Australian standards are breaking new ground. Whilst I admire the National Standards Association's aspiration to place Australia in the forefront of uncompromising international standards, I believe its timing is poor and its objectives very stringent. Australia is currently experiencing a severe recession and the weighing industry is very concerned that there will be a severe cost impact resulting from these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of this concern, I am afraid to say, has been largely due to the lack of consultation between members of the weighing industry and the National Standards Association. This has been acknowledged by both sides and it has been acknowledged by the Department of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). I believe that steps have now been taken to ensure that it does not happen again. I really do hope this is so because, as I have said, I think a lot of the problems with these amendments have stemmed from this lack of consultation. It will only be through consultation and perceived good will that changes will be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current regime operates on the basis of an approval and certification of a pattern for a measuring instrument used for trade purposes only. The Act does not provide that measuring instruments used for trade be of an approved pattern. This is an important distinction to be drawn between the various Federal and State responsibilities for these matters&mdash;a distinction that I believe is drawn in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that these amendments will allow the National Standards Commission to undertake measures to verify compliance with pattern approvals. The absence of this power previously has meant that the NSC has been unable to investigate offences and the amendments proposed will hopefully deal with these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there has been a great deal of conflicting information about what this Bill seeks to do&mdash;information that I have been weighing up very carefully over recent weeks. The Weighing Industry Association claims that the Bill will implement a pattern assurance program for load cells with a scale of fees. However, I understand this proposal and its fee schedule was shelved in March this year as a result of industry outcry. It is to be hoped that if the Government does plan to introduce this pattern assurance program for load cells, more consultation will occur with the industry than has been the case in the past. The industry was right to withdraw the very heavy schedule of fees and that proposal, if in fact that lack of consultation had not occurred. It should be recognised that the NSC does not have the power to set fees and there is nothing in this Bill which gives it the power to do so in relation to the verification of pattern approvals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that, with the legislation on the table ready to be amended, some sections of the Weighing Industry Association have still not had their arguments resolved. I must point out that there are other sections of the weighing industry which are quite content with these proposed amendments, with one exception, and I have received letters confirming their approval. A faxed message was sent to the Minister from Mr Bill Wedderburn, the Managing Director of Wedderburn Scales who, in fact, does support the amendments proposed here. I did speak with him about this and he was very adamant that the amendments were needed. I would certainly commend his advice to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been assured by the Minister and his Department that full consultation will take place when the associated regulations are being put in place. I will take close interest to see that this is indeed done. I have also been assured that for the Commission to establish a pattern assurance program, two requirements are necessary: the Commission would need to have the power to charge and to be able to obtain sample information. These powers have not been given to the Commission by these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have a major concern with this legislation. I will be moving an amendment to delete one very small clause relating to the search and seize powers that will be given to the NSC. An increasing feature of legislation, not only in this Parliament but also in parliaments in other States, is that far more legislation is being written by bureaucrats in the form of delegated legislation than perhaps was the case 15 or 20 years ago. In relation to the search and seize powers, we have tremendous concerns that the powers to provide for regulations given in this Bill are very broad. In fact, it has been suggested to me that the search and seize powers are so broad that they are almost gestapo-like in their application. I suggest to the Minister that, if he wants to give the NSC powers to search and seize, we should be assessing those by way of legislation coming before this Parliament rather than by way of seeking to disallow regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the issue of these search and seize powers was not picked up by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.  That is a pity as the powers conferred here by regulation are tremendously wide and are not supported by the Australian Democrats. However, we will discuss that further in committee. I am not opposed to enforcement procedures being given to the NSC or its delegates but I am opposed to very wide regulatory powers being given to bureaucrats to draft regulations that should more properly be presented to this Parliament as legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I simply say that I have given very long and serious consideration to all sides of the argument on this Bill. I have come to the conclusion that the Democrats should support the bulk of the proposed amendments to the National Measurement Act, with the exception I have raised. It is important that our trading partners and the community have confidence in our weights and measures. It is important that the authorities that are given power to approve patents and verify those patents have the legislative ability to do so. I think these amendments will certainly allow the NSC to carry out those functions that previously it was believed it had but on which legal advice was received to suggest that it did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is fault with the amendments before us in relation to the search and seize powers as they do not limit the length of time the Commission can hold weighing instruments for testing. There is nothing in the legislation about preventing the NSC from entering residential premises; there is nothing about a whole range of important civil liberties issues which I think need to be addressed by way of a further Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will present these amendments to the Senate in committee and hope that the Opposition will consider supporting a number of those in relation to both trade marks and the National Measurement Act. I commend the Bill and the amendments to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate. Many of the issues have been canvassed fairly well, and I will go through them briefly. One of the major amendments considered here is an amendment to the Automotive Industry Authority Act to continue the life of the Automotive Industry Authority. That was a recommendation made to the Government by the Industry Commission. It is a recommendation the Government is keen to support because, throughout these debates on various sectors of industry, the question of informed comment about a variety of issues, as we have seen in the last few weeks, has become immensely important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Automotive Industry Authority has been a source of important statistics on the industry. It has had a close working relationship with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on global trends in the automotive industry. It has compiled a very useful set of measures for assessing quality in automotive manufacture. With changes in productivity improvements in design and so on, these are all crucial issues for an industry of this kind. It is very important to have objective measures of what has been happening. For that purpose, the life of the Automotive Industry Authority, in the view of the Government, should be extended. That is proposed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the amendments to the National Measurement Act, this is a discussion which I concede has engendered a lot of heat&mdash;and some light. Essentially, these provisions are designed to ensure that measurements are made on a consistent basis throughout Australia and are compatible with measurements in other countries. They seek to enforce, if that is the right word, our treaty obligations, and with the introduction of uniform trade measurement legislation they seek to ensure verification of measuring instruments for use for trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two issues in this. There is the question, first of all, of pattern assurance. I think there is sometimes some confusion between the process of pattern assurance and pattern compliance. The issue of pattern compliance is the one which raises the most concerns. That particularly relates to the search and seize provisions which Senator Sowada has referred to, which we will deal with in the committee stage of the Bill. I just make the point that it is of the utmost importance that we have the highest possible standards in Australia in relation to these matters, that these standards are enforced and that they are not capable of being rorted&mdash;if that is the right expression. One way of seeing that they are enforced, that compliance is carried out, is to provide the Commission with the right to check on compliance. Currently, no mechanism exists for instruments to be checked for compliance and I think it is important that there are appropriate mechanisms for that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very minor amendment in the Bill relating to the Chief Executive of the CSIRO. There are also amendments which I will move on behalf of the Government to increase the penalties for counterfeiting and forgery of trademarks, and for falsely describing imported goods or goods intended for export, and to remedy an undesired effect of two recent Federal Court decisions in relation to the registrability of designs. These changes to the Trade Marks Act are based on the recommendations of the working party to review the trademark legislation, which recently reported to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free). The working party report recommended changes in the Australian trademarks legislation, and includes a number of recommendations to increase the present penalties for selling or importing counterfeit goods and for forging trademarks. So the penalties are made much stiffer, in line with the report recommendations. I announced, on behalf of the Government, an intention to carry out the recommendations as far as possible, and as soon as possible after the report was received. This legislation merely gives effect to that. I commend the second reading of the legislation to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say for the record that the reason why we oppose these clauses and why we wish them to be effectively deleted is that it is consistent with our policy on reducing tariffs to a maximum of 5 per cent by the year 2000, whereas the Government wishes to leave them at 15 per cent. We believe that to spend an additional $1.1m a year, plus property expenses, over that number of years is a waste of taxpayers' money and that ordinary Australians will have their opportunity enhanced to buy Australian-made cars more cheaply if the life of this Authority is not lengthened.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government certainly does not accept that these clauses should be deleted. The Opposition thrives on misinformation regarding the Australian car industry. The Automotive Industry Authority has been a source of objective information about a whole range of issues, and it has been partly its guidance that has brought the automotive industry in this country into very much better integration in the world automotive industry. That is something for which the Authority is to be very much congratulated. It performs a very useful function. It has nothing at all to do with the size of the tariffs we have as an end point. It has to do with whether we see this industry as operating as part of a global market, as it has to do, and whether we see it as being required to meet and be guided towards global standards in what it does. So we do not accept this opposition to the clauses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must answer the points made by Senator Button. If the aim of the Authority is to achieve world parity of standards, on that test alone its life ought not to be extended. It has clearly failed. During my speech at the second reading stage I gave some clear empirical evidence of how we rate on international standards in terms of errors per 100 cars. Where our error rate is 150 errors per 100 cars, in newly industrialising economies it is 100 per 100 cars, and in Japan it is 60 per 100 cars. We have a long way to go before we meet world's best standard, and I do not think the existence of the Authority is assisting in that endeavour.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>My amendment seeks to delete from the Bill the very broad search and seize powers that will be contained in the regulations. As I said in the second reading debate, what we have seen over the last decade or so is a proliferation of delegated legislation, which is essentially legislation written by bureaucrats and Ministers. The Parliament does have the authority to disallow delegated legislation, but I think everybody would agree that disallowance is a somewhat more difficult mechanism in the Parliament than simply scrutinising legislation and dealing with it as it is presented to us through the very extensive methods of debate here in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned at the very broad gestapo-like powers given to bureaucrats to make regulations to search and seize without actually having any details of what those regulations might contain. For example, as I said in the second reading debate, there is nothing here about how long the authorities may keep weighing instrument for testing. It may be that the regulations could provide for a maximum period of six months. In our view, it would be totally unacceptable for a company to be without its very important instruments for such a long time. There is nothing is this regulatory power that will actually limit the amount of time for which the National Standards Commission or its delegated authorities can keep instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing about restricting the right of the NSC to enter residential premises. I would draw the attention of the Senate to clauses in the Trade Measurements Act in South Australia which provide a very specific power of entry to residential premises. That is enshrined in legislation in South Australia. What we are doing here is basically giving the power to bureaucrats to make regulations that we may or may not disallow at some stage in the future. As a legislator, I would prefer to have those very important powers scrutinised by this Parliament in a further Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already indicated to the Government, in my speech at the second reading stage, that we would be more than happy to look at how these compliance measures may be enforced by further amendment to the National Measurement Act, but we are at this stage not prepared to accept the very broad and sweeping powers here given to bureaucrats to make regulations to search and seize premises, without knowing something of what those regulations might contain, without having some input and without having some assurance that the regulations will be drafted in consultation with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has expressed concern that the initial amendments to the National Measurement Act were not drafted in consultation. The Government has taken steps to rectify that and I have been assured that further amendments to the National Measurement Act will be drafted in consultation, as will the regulations. I have to say, however, that the experience on this matter so far has not been a good one. I am a little nervous to accept the assurances I have been given so far that consultation will take place when the Government has a very sorry record of consultation to this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that the Government needs to have powers of enforcement, but we are very reluctant to provide for these powers of enforcement by way of regulation. It is our hope that the Government will present to us at some later stage an amendment to the National Measurement Act that will provide for these enforcement powers, spelling them out in detail so that the Parliament and honourable senators can scrutinise those powers in detail, not simply leaving it up to bureaucrats and to a disallowance motion at some later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the proposal is totally unacceptable and simply represents the greater proliferation of delegated legislation, which takes legislating out of the hands of the Parliament and puts it into the hands of bureaucrats. That is something that should be opposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Sowada has said it all. There is no need for me to say much more, other than this: over many years, this issue has come up before this chamber, on many occasions and in respect of a variety of issues and a variety of questions. It is about time that the Senate took note of many of the statements and recommendations that have been made about this issue, which really concerns the defence of individuals' rights and, indeed, the defence of the rights of the Parliament over those of the executive government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think even the executive government should baulk at the proposition that we in this chamber should buy a pig in a poke, yet that is precisely what we have been asked to do in this legislation. We are being asked to approve of wide-ranging search and seizure powers in respect of regulations we have not even seen. I agree with what Senator Sowada said. Of course we all know that regulations are able to be disallowed, but one of the problems about that is that it does not enable this Parliament to engage in a meaningful way in discussing the merits of particular regulations, where some of them may be satisfactory and others not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have, as honourable senators know, promoted a Bill which would enable this Parliament to do more than it is capable of doing now in respect of regulations. I suppose it is about time that Bill received some discussion in this chamber. I am concerned that on this occasion, however, we are being asked to approve of wide-ranging powers of search and seizure in areas about which we have no accurate knowledge at this present point of time. Therefore, I support Senator Sowada's amendment. </PARA>

In having discussions with Senator Sowada, she and I are in agreement about the question of the search and seizure powers and the manner in which they are proposed to be imposed. I have already expressed my lack of confidence in at least parts of the National Standards Commission. I think the best way to deal with this matter is for me to have it on the record that we had chosen the method of opposing the motion that the clauses stand as printed as the method of deleting the clauses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I accept that the Government has already indicated that it will accept this amendment as well. It again relates to the regulatory power given to the bureaucrats by this proposed new subsection. In the light of the very broad and sweeping powers that were proposed to be given, it is my feeling that some signal needs to be sent to the Department that this Parliament will not tolerate regulations that will ride roughshod over the rights of individual citizens and of business. Whilst it may seem on the surface to be a fairly commonsense amendment and one that presumably the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee would take into account when examining legislation, it is our belief that the Department does need to be given a very clear signal that we will not tolerate the trampling of individual rights. I ask the Opposition to consider supporting this in the light of the arguments it has already suggested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak today on a matter which is of great significance to development and management in Australia. That is, of course, the decision for the operation of the Marandoo mine in Western Australia to go ahead. I want to put to rest a few of the furphies that have been put around about the situation there in regard to sacred sites and various species. I shall refer directly to what Hamersley has done to address these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Hamersley and, in particular, Tony Finucane on his patience and perseverance and the way he has operated throughout this whole unfortunate episode. The first thing that needs to be understood very clearly with regard to the operations of Hamersley at Tom Price and the various iron ore operations there is that, had Marandoo not gone ahead, Tom Price and that operation would have been finished by the year 2000, or within approximately nine years. The fact that Marandoo will now go ahead means that its life has been extended to around the year 2050 and a significant number of jobs will be created. That is the first of the furphies I want to put to rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I talk about the new jobs, I want to talk about the old jobs. Currently the Hamersley operation employs some 15,000 people&mdash;12,000 of them indirectly in jobs off site and 3,000 directly on site. Had Marandoo not gone ahead, all of those jobs would have been gone by the year 2000. But there would have been a phasing down period, one would have anticipated, of three or four years or maybe even less, because Tom Price was ceasing to be an open-cut mine that could provide the quality of iron ore required for export to Japan. So we would have seen a very rapid run-down in those jobs, which would have exacerbated the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin, the development of Marandoo will mean that in the first two years of the construction phase there will be some 4,000 jobs created&mdash;800 on site and at least 3,200 off site in fabrication and the other things that need to be done in establishing a mining operation. On top of that, there will be an additional 350 permanent jobs created, with the protection of those jobs I have spoken about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What needs to be understood about the Hamersley mining operation in the Pilbara is that, very simply, apart from the high grade ore that has come from Tom Price and the high grade ore that will come from Marandoo, the other larger iron ore deposits that have been discovered and are being mined are not of a suitable quality to meet the export standards required by the Japanese market, which is our principal market, and other markets around the world. It is needed for mixing with that iron ore so that the operation can continue. That is the second furphy I want to kill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We read reports in the press and hear comments by various individuals that there is plenty of iron ore to meet the export requirements, but it is not true. It is just not true of the discovered iron ore bodies that are required to bring that iron ore up to grade. As I have already said, Hamersley's mining operation there would have been finished in nine years. The implications of that go far beyond job creation and maintenance of those jobs. It would also impact dramatically on Australia's export earnings and, in particular, those of a remote part of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third furphy I want to deal with is the situation with regard to sacred sites. It has been reported consistently that there will be interference with sacred sites by the development of that mine. That is absolutely false. I believe there have been nine studies done into the area since 1975, there have been 12 reports commissioned from those studies since that time, and within the project area there are no sacred sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting, in terms of the operations there, that there are no sites of significance either&mdash;which sits alongside what I have already mentioned about sacred sites. But Hamersley has undertaken to make sure that buffers are kept around archaelogical sites that are outside the area and that they will be protected. It is going beyond the requirements to meet the concerns of the elders who have inhabited the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that Tony Finucane, on behalf of Hamersley, received yesterday a fax from the nine elders that company representatives have been dealing with in that respect, congratulating them for the way they have conducted themselves in at last achieving the development of Marandoo, which will give employment opportunities to the Aboriginals who live in the area. It has been a policy of Hamersley, over the years, to give Aboriginals opportunity for employment. Hamersley should be congratulated on that part of its policy also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look just a little bit further we find another thing that comes into the whole situation, the fourth of the furphies that have been thrown up: the situation of the pebble mound mouse. It is worth noting that just two years ago CALM, the Conservation and Land Management Department in Western Australia, sought funding from the Federal Government to do a study of the area, where there has been very little scientific study carried out to see what flora and fauna exist there. When that funding was not forthcoming, Hamersley itself funded the research. What it has discovered and put together is that there is an area at least the size of Victoria under which this pebble mound mouse exists. It is now believed, from recent trappings elsewhere, that the size of the area is actually double that of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come back to the total size of the area where the mine will be, in the initial stages while the rail corridor is being put through it will amount to an area of about 2 per cent of the total national park which exists there. Once the rail project is finished that will be reduced to one per cent. So claims that the pebble mound mouse is being put at risk are also false. That is not true. Nobody would have any idea of the extent of the habitat of the pebble mound mouse if it were not for Hamersley itself, which not only paid for the research that has been done but assisted in the carrying out of that research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point that I want to bring up here relates to tourism and the national park. It is interesting to note that, currently, some 40,000 tourists a year go through the Hamersley operation. The number of tourists to the national park is 20,000. So Hamersley's operation has twice as many tourists going through it as go through the national park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this development will do is actually build roads and allow more tourists to enjoy the pristine conditions of that national park. There is much to offer, as I am sure many people in this chamber would know, in terms of what exists in that part of Western Australia. Much of it is unique in the world. In actual fact, the opening up of Marandoo by Hamersley and the restrictions under which the company will be operating from an environmental point of view will give people access by properly constructed roads and the opportunity for a tourist bus, for example, to go into that national park for tourists to see what exists there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at that national park and the opportunity for tourism, if it had not been for the initial opening up of that particular area by pastoralists and, in particular, Hamersley mining company, that opportunity would not have occurred. We would have found that in fact the 20,000 who visited on an annual basis would not have had that opportunity because the country would not be accessible without properly constructed roads and infrastructure. Those roads and that infrastructure have been constructed by Hamersley mine, not by taxpayers through the Western Australian Government or the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the noises that we have read about in the press were ill informed and, I believe, deliberately misleading. I hope in addressing this particular issue today that, in particular, the position the Democrats have adopted on this, not only publicly but in this chamber, is put to rest because it is just not true; it is false. The important thing about this, not only from a national perspective but from a Western Australian perspective, is that we are going to see those people keep their jobs and we are going to see Hamersley continue to operate at least to the year 2050 in the Pilbara of Western Australia, rather than being forced to close down in approximately nine years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two Bills that we are debating, the Grain Legumes Levy Amendment Bill and the Oilseeds Levy Amendment Bill, change the basis of research levies on grain legumes and oilseed from a specific rate per tonne to a farm gate ad valorem rate. Initially that rate will be set at one per cent of the farm gate value, but there is potential within the legislation for that rate to be raised to 3 per cent. The Grains Council, on behalf of grain growers, has recommended that this is a more equitable form of contribution because it is proportional to the net return and takes into account, obviously, the varying prices or returns for different types of grain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us two separate Bills, but since 1990-91 there has actually been one corporation to cover the wholegrains, oilseeds and legumes area, the Grains Research and Development Corporation. Oilseeds include sunflower seed, safflower seed, soya beans, rape seed, cotton seed and linseed, which are mainly grown for their oil content. The main areas of oilseed cultivation are the New South Wales north coast, the central highlands of Queensland, western Victoria and the south-east of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990-91 production of oilseeds reached 1,072 kilotons, valued at $209m. The major grain legumes produced in Australia are field peas, lupins and peanuts. Field pea production in 1990-91 totalled 309 kilotons produced from an area of land of 309,000 hectares and valued at $35m. Lupin production in 1990-91 totalled 752 kilotons produced from an area of 789,000 hectares and valued at $140m. The major end use of lupins has been in the manufacture of pig and poultry feed, although quantities of lupins are now being used in the preparation of high protein food for human consumption in Asia and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peanut production in 1990-91 totalled 36 kilotonnes, produced from an area of 22,000 hectares and valued at $40m. In Australia, peanuts are grown mainly for human consumption, although small quantities of low quality peanuts are crushed for oil and vegetable meal. Peanuts are produced mainly in Queensland with only a small area grown in New South Wales, the Northern Territory and north-west Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of moving from a flat rate per tonne to a percentage levy is obviously designed to ensure that each industry plays a fairer share of the costs of rural research. No-one can argue with that in principle. The establishment of a single grain research and development corporation has meant that there has been a commingling of the funds raised from the various rural industries and States, with basically a common pool being distributed to research projects which are assessed to be a particular value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been general support within the industry for the changes proposed in this Bill. Everyone agrees that we need to spend more money on research. When times get tough in a rural industry and when the farmers can least afford to provide additional money, they become additionally conscious of the need to do better in the various practices associated with their industry. They want better varieties, they want to do things more efficiently and they want other aspects of their industry to be the best possible. They acknowledge the vital role of research in ensuring that we have the best possible practices. The Minister has argued that the proposed ad valorem rate will ensure that growers' contribution to research and development will be proportional to their net return for the particular crop growth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Honey Legislation (Repeal and Amendment) Bill 1992 terminates the Australian Honey Board from 1 January of next year and transfers certain functions to the Australian Horticultural Corporation. The Honey Board has operated for some 30 years, but the Government announced that it will terminate the Board and transfer some of its functions to the Australian Horticultural Corporation until 30 June 1995 when the Horticultural Corporation and that arrangement will be further reviewed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a certain extent, this was the result of the Davis review committee on Commonwealth primary industry statutory marketing authorities. It reported that the smaller marketing authorities, including the Honey Board, faced high costs relative to the income provided by levy on producers. The Honey Board had been operating on a budget of $500,000, about half of which went in administration costs. It is very important that the administration of these organisations, corporations or whatever, is kept under control so that the value of levies paid by producers is there for research, marketing, promotion or other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gross value of production of the honey industry is about $40m, with 40 per cent going for export. This is a good example of a small but very effective and efficient industry, contributing to Australia's international trade and balance of payments. The role of the Honey Board was the setting of a minimum price export for bulk honey, but that was not effective because Australia had only about one per cent of the world trade and the Board no longer appointed overseas selling agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry, represented by the Federal Council of Australian Apiarists Associations and the Honey Packers and Marketers Association of Australia, negotiated the changes with the Government. It is in agreement with the legislation and has requested that the Board be terminated at the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Honey Board Review Committee, established to consider future options, wanted the Board abolished but recommended the continuation of domestic promotion, consumer education, quality assurance and information dissemination through the Australian Horticultural Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research and development will continue through the Honeybee Research and Development Corporation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation we are considering, the Norfolk Island (Electoral and Judicial) Amendment Bill 1992, is for an Act to enable certain residents of Norfolk Island to vote in parliamentary elections, and for other purposes. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun: The Legal Regimes of Australia's External Territories and the Jervis Bay Territory</EMPHASIS>, March 1991, reported that Australian citizens resident in Norfolk Island remain the only resident Australians not entitled, as a right, to representation in the Commonwealth Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee received representations indicating that the Norfolk Islanders themselves had mixed views regarding representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. I can certainly vouch for that statement from the various visits that I have made to Norfolk Island and my discussions on this matter with the residents. However, the report concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the right to vote is an absolute right which should not be denied to those people of Norfolk Island who wish to exercise their right. However, the Committee recognises that the constitutional history of the Territory is complex and that Norfolk Island warrants special consideration in this regard. In addition, the Committee is cognisant of the strongly held views of the elements of the Norfolk Island population, most likely a majority, for whom Commonwealth parliamentary representation is an anathema.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is aware that provision exists within the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 for optional voting for the following categories: an Antarctic elector; an eligible overseas elector; or an itinerant elector. The Committee is mindful of the strongly held views and the historical reasons which make Norfolk Island a unique case. The Committee is therefore prepared to accept, contrary to the important principles which apply anywhere else in Australia, that the residents of Norfolk Island who are Australian citizens should have the right of optional enrolment. Once a citizen exercises this right, voting would be compulsory and normal provisions under the Commonwealth Electoral Act would apply.</PARA>
<PARA>The report recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth Parliament amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to give optional enrolment rights to the people of Norfolk Island; the electorate to which the voters would be attached to be determined on the advice of the Australian Electoral Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government response to the report tabled on 10 September 1991 agreed that optional enrolment recognises the unique circumstances of Norfolk Island and provides to those Australian citizens who wish it, the opportunity to exercise this basic democratic right to vote in elections for the Federal Parliament. As a result of the Norfolk Island plebiscite on the voting rights for Australian citizens, the then Minister for Territories, the Honourable David Simmons, suggested that for the purpose of Australian Federal elections, Norfolk Island voters would be aligned with a single electorate&mdash;that is, Canberra. The Norfolk Island Government has lobbied against the single electorate proposal and for compulsory voting for all Norfolk Island residents. The current Minister, the Honourable Wendy Fatin, has backed down and has now introduced legislation which enables Australian citizens to enrol in an electorate of their choosing. The purpose of this Bill is to extend to Australian citizens living on Norfolk Island the opportunity to vote in Federal elections and referendums. This is consistent with the coalition's repeated views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> an item regarding Senator Margaret Reynolds's comments to the constitutional conference specifically on the matter of the Norfolk Island Act and self-government for Aboriginal communities. I caution against the parallels drawn by Senator Margaret Reynolds in her speech between Norfolk Island and Aboriginal communities, because I feel&mdash;and certainly I know from my visits&mdash;that Norfolk Island is in a unique situation. The comments made by Senator Reynolds in Darwin at the conference, in which she was addressing issues relating to aspirations of some people with regard to Aboriginal self-government within Australia, need to be very carefully considered. I am very suspicious of some of the intent behind the speech of Senator Reynolds to the conference in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She claims that there is a precedent for self-government that applies under the Norfolk Island Act, which passed through this Parliament in 1979. But to suggest that that precedent is just as relevant today to now bring forward the aspirations of Aboriginal citizens of Australia, who live within Australia, who vote within Australia, its States and its Territories, would, I think, be treading on some very dangerous ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The residents of Norfolk Island are a unique blend: descendants of the original Pitcairners, Australians, New Zealanders and others, with 25 per cent of the population being temporary residents. The legislative framework of the island also has its own unique history: a constitutional battle for independence which in 1979 resulted in the creation of the Norfolk Island Act and a degree of self-government for the island. Norfolk Island has achieved a high degree of self-government and has proved since 1979 that it is able to act with goodwill in developing a range of laws designed to safeguard and meet the expressed desire of the Norfolk Island Territory residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to the Budget allocations to Norfolk Island. They are very meagre. About $1m a year goes towards the administration of that island, the Commonwealth services and the heritage provisions on the island. If Norfolk Island is compared with Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean, there is a very wide disparity on the issue of Federal funding. Some $20m is allocated to the Federal Government's responsibilities and provisions on Christmas and Cocos Islands, whereas on Norfolk Island the residents do not request it. In fact, they do not want it, because of the independent nature of their own establishment. The way in which they manage their economy and provide all of the services is very important and draws some very important parallels. I would certainly commend to Senator Reynolds, for her comments with regard to Aboriginal self-government aspirations, the parallels of finance that exist with Norfolk Island. She may find that her own arguments could well fall apart on many of those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that self-government on Norfolk Island should continue and proceed with the principles of social justice and fundamental human rights; the preservation of the Territory's environmental and cultural heritage for the benefit of present and future generations; and social equity and the efficient discharge of Commonwealth responsibilities, under Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill we have before us will amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to provide a form of optional enrolment for eligible Norfolk Island residents to enable them to enrol in a mainland electoral division with which they can establish a connection. Where such a connection cannot be established, the option of enrolling in a particular Territory division will be available. The Bill will also amend the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act of 1984 to allow those Norfolk Islanders enrolling in this way to participate in referendums as required by section 128 of the Constitution. The electoral provisions of the Bill will have negligible impact on Commonwealth revenues and expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be a minor amendment to section 56 of the Norfolk Island Act 1979 in relation to the travelling expenses of judges of the Norfolk Island Supreme Court so as to encompass `travelling allowances' and to place beyond doubt the legality of past payments of travelling expenses purportedly made under that section. The Norfolk Island Government meets the travel related costs of judges visiting the island from its own budget. The amendments to the Norfolk Island Act will therefore have no impact on Commonwealth revenues and expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition holds the view that participation in the Australian electoral system by Norfolk Island residents should not be forced. Rather, where permanent residents on Norfolk Island have made agreements between the individual and the community, then it is for the permanent community through the local parliament to decide whether permanent residents wish to participate in Australian Federal elections. We also believe that the right of those temporary Australian residents of the island who wish to have their voices heard in elections at home in their Australian electorates should have those rights preserved. Residents who do not hold permanent status but who hold Australian citizenship should be entitled to retain their enrolment in an Australian electorate. The coalition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation involves two matters, as we have heard. The first matter relates to a technical amendment which has been introduced to clarify any uncertainty concerning the validity of travelling allowances paid to Norfolk Island Supreme Court judges. The provision has been reworded to ensure that previously paid amounts have been validly paid. The second matter is far more important and far more interesting. Indeed, in some ways, it is an historic provision. This legislation extends to Australian citizens, living on Norfolk Island, the opportunity to vote in Federal elections and referenda for the first time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian citizens who are Norfolk Island residents have previously been denied the right to participate in electing the national government&mdash;a bizarre situation. It has come about because of the remoteness of Norfolk Island, of course, the small size of the community and the fierce independence and pride which many islanders feel. We are pleased to see that these special characteristics have been recognised by the Government in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without spending too much time, it is pertinent to point out that this legislation was not originally in this form. The original Bill allowed optional registration by voters but then proposed to incorporate Norfolk Island into the Federal seat of Canberra. This generated a huge amount of anti-Canberra sentiment on Norfolk Island and was rejected by a local referendum held on the issue. While the referendum question was a little emotional, and was voted on by many people who are not entitled to vote in Australian elections, the Government did listen to the will of the people of Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While maintaining the option for citizens to register to vote, this Bill also allows those voters who have some connection with the mainland electorate to be able to vote in that electorate, if they so wish. If there is no such connection to any particular electorate, their vote will be cast in the Canberra division. This is an outcome which has the support of the residents of Norfolk Island. The measure improves democracy in Australia by removing a barrier to participate in an election, which has always applied to residents of Norfolk Island. It is welcomed by the Australian Democrats and we support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For those of us who are historical buffs, Norfolk Island is indeed a fascinating place. It is a little piece of paradise. I think the temperature at Norfolk Island remains between 18 and 25 degrees centigrade at all times of the year. Its history is truly fascinating. Indeed, it is fiercely argued as to which place was settled first&mdash;Norfolk Island or Sydney. It would seem that on the balance of probabilities that Norfolk Island may have the edge in that argument. I mention in passing the spectacularly successful restoration of the historical buildings at Norfolk Island, particularly those along Quality Row, as it is called. I found the restoration fascinating. If visitors go to Norfolk Island today and look at the early settlement buildings that are still used as government offices and as the Administrator's residence, they will see that the restored buildings are indistinguishable from early etchings of that area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Amendment Bill 1992 which transfers responsibility for the management of marine mammals and reptiles from commercial fisheries legislation to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. The new Fisheries Management Act specifies that the term `fish' does not include reptiles and mammals, unlike the previous Act. This sensible realignment may marginally affect the empires of two Canberra mandarins and the extent of the powers of two Ministers. The fact that these two Ministers&mdash;the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and the Minister for the Environment (Mrs Kelly)&mdash;have agreed on this sensible realignment of responsibilities is a matter we strongly support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the national parks and wildlife regulations do provide protection to certain sea creatures, specifically sea snakes, seals and birds. After these changes there will be additions to the schedules of that Act which will cover turtles, crocodiles and dugongs. There may be some concerns about the extent of protection of crocodiles and that is a matter of some disagreement, but the Opposition is not taking a view on that matter at this stage. No doubt there will be opportunities for localised concerns to be expressed and dealt with over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these additions to the schedules in the Act do take place it will mean that all marine reptiles, birds and mammals will receive protection in Commonwealth waters under legislation administered by one body, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Whales and dolphins are already protected by the Whale Protection Act 1980 which is under the control of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service although much of the enforcement of the legislation is in fact delegated to State fisheries or to conservation agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Whale Protection Act is particularly relevant in this situation because the powers of enforcement that are proposed under this legislation have been drafted to be consistent with those applying under the Whale Protection Act and to be of the same level of stringency as applied under the old Fisheries Act which was used to protect these species. The Bill will extend the powers of wardens appointed to enforce the legislation to the waters of the continental shelf. I understand that the Australian Fishing Industry Council has no objections to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference to the Whale Protection Act reminds me of the fact that this Act was introduced into this Parliament 13 years ago by one of my former colleagues, the Honourable David Thomson, who was Minister for Science and Environment in the Fraser Government. I think it is worth remembering that it was the Fraser Government that introduced this protection of whales following the Government's commissioning of an independent inquiry headed by Sir Sydney Frost which was tabled in Parliament in February 1979. It was only a couple of months later in April that Mr Fraser, the Prime Minister, announced the Government had accepted all recommendations made in that report. The central conclusion accepted by the Government was that the Whaling Act 1960 be repealed and that we pursue a vigorous and active policy for the protection of whales. The Bill introduced such a policy for all cetaceans, that is, whales, porpoises and dolphins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation on which the present arrangements are based prohibits the killing, capturing, injuring or interference with cetaceans in the 200-mile Australian fishing zone, and by Australians domiciled in Australia and Australian vessels and aircraft and their crews beyond the 200-mile Australian fishing zone, with penalties up to $100,000. Support for a total worldwide ban on whaling was to have been sought immediately at that time through international forums, such as the International Whaling Commission. It is interesting to note that there have been some pressures for a resumption of whaling, which the Government is properly opposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protection of these other species of the sea fits into that category. The enforcement mechanisms that were put in place by Mr Thomson at that time, using the National Parks and Wildlife Service as the protective instrument, have been adopted for this measure. As a result, because it fits in totally with the coalition's policies on this matter, we have great pleasure in supporting the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, I am aware of the Sheraton Southgate workplace agreement; it was registered in the Industrial Relations Commission, I think, fairly recently. It is an agreement that has been negotiated between the Sheraton Hotel chain and the ACTU, and representing the Sheraton Hotel chain was a former Minister for Industrial Relations in the Fraser Government, Mr Ian Macphee. I must give due regard to Mr Macphee, on behalf of Sheraton, and the ACTU who have achieved a quite important industrial relations agreement&mdash;a workplace or, to use its fashionable term, enterprise agreement for the hospitality industry in Australia which recognises the 24-hour seven day a week needs of that type of operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distinguishing feature of this agreement is that it takes the penalty rates for shift loadings, totals them up, and wraps them into a bottom line rate, so that one gets all of the penalty rates in the bottom line outcome, which is then applied as the uniform rate. So no-one's wages are reduced by removing the penalty rate expressed as a separate component of the wage; it is all rolled up into a total bottom rate. As well, the Sheraton Hotel added a productivity bonus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a good example of management, unions and workers creating a constructive environment to deliver a quality service in the hospitality industry and it stands, as I said at the beginning of this answer, as something of a landmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been asked whether I am aware of criticism of it. I am aware of criticism of it. Yesterday at the National Press Club the shadow spokesman on industrial relations, Mr Howard, in answer to a question from Bruce Juddery from the floor, after Mr Howard completed what was a fairly old fashioned, conflict riddled style approach to industrial relations, criticised this agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see why he criticised this agreement. He criticised this agreement because the Sheraton Hotel did not eliminate the penalty rates completely; it wrapped them into a total rate. In Mr Howard's view, the wages of the employees of the Sheraton Hotel should have been reduced by denying them any penalty rate at all, and the total rate outcome should have been less than what the Sheraton Hotel agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This holds some very interesting lessons. It proves that the cat is now out of the bag once again. The Opposition's industrial relations policy is a low wage policy. It is a policy about reducing wages, imposing higher taxes, reducing skills in the community and introducing massive doses of confrontation&mdash;a low wage, high tax, low skill, high confrontation policy. Mr Howard criticised this agreement, I remind the chamber, because it did not reduce the wages. That simply goes to put the lie to the words that Mr Howard has been uttering just this day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just this day, Mr Howard suddenly discovers that he ought to describe his policy as a high wage one. What a load of rubbish! It is a low wage policy meant to remove the protections of the Industrial Relations Commission from the workplace, meant to undermine and remove the award structure in Australia that Australian workers depend on for fairness and introduce low wages into the Australian workplace.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear Dr Ed Shann's remarks&mdash;I missed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning, and I apologise to the ABC for that&mdash;but I have had the general thrust of what he said referred to me. The truth is that the unemployment statistics that have been published measure, as best we can measure it, the proper representation of unemployment. But there is a degree&mdash;and this is admitted and recognised&mdash;of hidden unemployment. What Dr Shann was doing was estimating, as I understand it, what he, as a consultant and someone who has worked in support of putting together the Fightback package of the Opposition, thinks is the degree of hidden unemployment. He may be right; I do not know. Those figures seem quite high to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, surely, the point here is that the comparison in terms of employment and the way in which we measure the movements of employment and unemployment is the Australian Bureau of Statistics series. If we compare, for example, the participation rate under this Government with the participation rate under the Fraser Government&mdash;if we compare the same participation rate, which was the point of a question to Senator Button earlier in Question Time&mdash;then by the measure of the participation rate of those opposite under the Fraser Government the unemployment rate would have been around 13.5 per cent, not 10.8 per cent, and doubtless the level of hidden unemployment, even estimated by a Fightback consultant like Dr Shann, would have been much greater.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the third go, despite attempts to muzzle me by the Opposition which says it believes in free speech, I believe that Greg Matthews is to be applauded for taking on the role of a role model for young Australians, who obviously always idolise their sporting heroes. He has taken the view that to smoke impairs sports performance and health. He is concerned to outline to young Australians how smoking can impair their health as it causes disease and, as we know, death.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect I believe that Greg Matthews is acting, as many other sporting heroes do, in a very salutary way in our community. Stephen Hawkins, the double sculls gold medal winner from Tasmania, is at this very moment going around 30 schools in Tasmania as a drug offensive ambassador spreading exactly the same message as Greg Matthews. I applaud both of them for taking on that role because, quite clearly, young people will listen to them in a way that they do not listen to others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Cricket Board should not take such punitive action, as reported by the AAP news this morning. Reports state that Matthews has been fined between 20 and 30 per cent of his contract fee. That is a very punitive amount of money if that report be true and, even if the amount be something lesser than that, it is quite clear that here one has a situation where a punitive financial burden has been imposed on Greg Matthews because he has decided to convey particularly to young people that smoking impairs health and diminishes sporting performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is doubly unfortunate in that the tobacco lobby is obviously exercising great power over the Australian Cricket Board. It is this very lobby which, in recent days, has said it is willing to go to the High Court to try to get an extension of the idea of the last judgment of which we have spoken in this chamber over the last 24 hours, whereby it is somehow going to try to equate a right to advertise tobacco products&mdash;which deal in death and disease&mdash;with the right to communicate political opinions in our democratic society. That is a totally bizarre notion. Here we have the tobacco lobby&mdash;always bleating about free speech&mdash;in this instance with the Australian Cricket Board, preventing Greg Matthews from exercising his freedom of speech to talk about the death and disease dealing aspects of tobacco consumption in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that to fine Greg Matthews is to portray him as being the guilty party. All honourable senators would realise that no magistrate or judge would fine someone 20 or 30 per cent of his income, which is what has apparently occurred in this case. It is quite clear that the guilty party in this instance is the tobacco lobby, which is impairing the freedom of speech of one of Australia's greatest sporting heroes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The people did not vote for it. The exit polls in Victoria show that, overwhelmingly, people voted against what they saw as poor financial management by the outgoing government. It was a classic case of voting out a government rather than electing a new one.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is indisputable and should be recognised is that the Kennett Government does have a big majority and it does have a mandate to enact the law. But I can understand that the Victorian unions are apprehensive, given the draconian nature of the law that is being proposed in Victoria and given the statements by Opposition spokespersons in Victoria at the time and Federal spokespersons, including in this case Dr Hewson&mdash;the increasingly inflexible Leader of the Opposition in Australia&mdash;who have proclaimed that their mission in life is to destroy the trade union movement. Given those declarations, I can understand some apprehension. But I do not support options which break the law. What I am interested in and will look at with an open mind is what I understand to be one of the other options, that is, that Victorian unions seek to transfer State awards in Victoria into the Federal jurisdiction as parts of Federal awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my period as Minister for Industrial Relations over the last 2 1/2 years, I have been trying to bring about, by negotiation with the States&mdash;and everyone, from a Federal point of view, knows how difficult it is to get six States and two Territories to agree with the Commonwealth on things of this nature&mdash;a more uniform single national system of industrial relations. I notice that Mr Gude, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and Minister for Industrial Relations in Victoria, supports a single industrial relations system. If the steps to transfer State awards to the Federal jurisdiction will help to bring that about, that will be a positive thing, and I will look to see what proposals are put to me by the ACTU and the Confederation of Australian Industry and discuss those proposals in order to make that reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, during our period of office in Australia we have achieved a record of industrial peace in which the graph for industrial disputes runs off the bottom of the table.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the evaluation of the national better health program was completed in June of this year. It was undertaken, as the honourable senator would know, by a team headed by Professor Laurence Malcolm from New Zealand. I think the report found generally that the program had many points to its credit, but that it had suffered from being regarded as the principal Australian response to the World Health Organisation health for all policy, and it endeavoured to cover too many areas and was too widespread in its endeavours. The findings of the evaluation were taken into account by the Government in drawing up arrangements for the new national better health program which was announced by the Minister in the 1992 Budget&mdash;and I am sure that the honourable senator saw that.

Is the Minister aware that there is a steadily growing number of married couples seeking to go on the IVF program? Is he also aware that these families are not able to adopt children, as there are no longer many babies available this way because of the increasing number of single supporting mothers and those having abortions? In view of the fact that the Government provides Medicare benefits for mothers seeking abortions, will the Government provide more funds to the IVF programs to enable more families to take part? Furthermore, will the Government consider providing Medicare benefits to cover the high medical costs for donors and recipients?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bjelke-Petersen has raised a very sensitive area, where medical technology and science have been put at the service of those couples who wish to conceive a child but where one or other or both are for some reason infertile.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the Medicare benefit is payable for six cycles of the treatment which stimulates the hormonal activity in relation to the female recipient of the procedure. So I believe that the Government has already shown a compassion for that situation. It does support in-vitro fertilisation procedures and treatment up to six cycles. I think Senator Herron would be able to confirm this, but I understand that it is up to about four cycles that one has a good prospect of conceiving and the embryo implanting in the womb in a way which leads to a successful birth.</PARA>

They are probably consistent with other figures which have been prepared for EPAC and so on, but I am not sure about that. I should have thought that Senator Harradine would have been pleased in a sense to see the participation rate fall.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At Question Time yesterday Senator Alston asked me a question concerning the new rules to apply to the treatment of shares under the income test for the pension. Honourable senators will remember that he sought to illustrate his point by reference to the Prime Minister's private business. I have an answer to that, and I seek leave to have it incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rules which will apply to the treatment of shares under the income test are considered necessary as the existing rules provide an inequitable treatment of shares when compared with the treatment of other types of investments and provide an opportunity for circumvention of the income test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present only the value of dividends paid from shares is regarded as income. Capital growth is ignored. Losses from one parcel of shares cannot be offset against gains on other shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From September 1993 there will be two changes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Income will be calculated by multiplying the current value of the shares by the rate of return over the previous 12 months based on the change in value of that type of shares and any dividends or bonuses during the period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Where this rate of return is negative, the `negative income' from shares will be able to be offset against other income from shares or managed investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston's example involved a pensioner with 1000 ordinary shares in BHP. Six months ago in March 1992, the value of these shares would have been $13,420. If the new rules were already in place, the rate of return based on the 12 months to the end of March 1992 would be 22.66%. The annual income assessed from these shares would be $3,040&mdash;$116.90 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the pensioner had no other income, the income from the shares would result in the fortnightly pension being reduced by $15.45. If the pensioner had other income which exceeded the pension income test free area the income from the shares would reduce the fortnightly pension by $30.90.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, under the proposed rules, it is also possible for the pensioner to ask for a reassessment at any time. In September 1992, as a result of a decrease in the market value of the shares, the 1000 shares would be worth $11,860. The rate of return to the end of September 1992 is&mdash;13.58%. This means that the rate of income is now negative:&mdash;$1,611 or $60 a fortnight. Under the new rules for shares, this amount could be offset against any other income from shares or managed investments owned by the pensioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current rules, a pensioner with BHP shares would not get any recognition in the pension income test for the decrease in the value of their share investment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It follows other extravagant claims by Senator Tierney who obviously does not support the expanded access to higher education that the open learning initiative will provide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 18 June 1992 the Minister wrote to all universities inviting them to express interest in participating as a broker or provider of programs for an Open Learning Initiative (OLI). Requests for formal expressions of interest against detailed requirements were sought on 1 July 1992. The closing date for those expressions was 7 August 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the closing date a request came from UP seeking to make a late submission. Agreement was given to that request. On 21 August 1992 the Selection Panel of officials met with a representative group of UP and on the same day met with representatives of other proponents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Panel had many problems with the UP proposal as then developed but encouraged them to talk with Monash University to see if they could resolve some of the differences between consortium partners in the interest of achieving the best possible national result. A meeting of Monash and UP representatives was attended by a member of the Panel. The Panel convened another round of meetings and had further discussions with UP and the other major proponents on 4 September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large number of the matters raised by UP as points of revision to the Monash proposal were in fact accommodated. However, in the view of the Panel the UP proposal in its revised form fell short of meeting the requirements set down in the request for expressions of interest. The Panel subsequently recommended that the Minister give in-principle approval to Monash to further develop its proposal in collaboration with other universities, including some members of the UP group. Negotiations are continuing with Monash to ensure that all government requirements for the open learning initiative are met prior to final approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the supplementary question of the Honourable Senator, the Minister is unaware of such allegations. The fact of the matter is that Monash University has encouraged the participation of others and modified its proposed arrangements.</PARA>

This horrific situation is continuing. Not one further job has been created.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked the Minister how the Prime Minister could answer to this appalling situation and how in such circumstances he could claim that the recession was long over, the only answer I could get was, `You should look at the model that exists in Britain; you should look at the model that is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>; and you should look at the model in New Zealand'. That model is now starting to show an improvement, and may well be one this Government should be looking at.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's economic model has failed in anyone's language. What is so frustrating the people of Australia at the moment is the fact that, although these unemployment figures are at record high levels and remain at record high levels, the Government will not face up to the responsibility of those figures and face up to the failure of its own economic program. All it can do, as is Mr Keating's usual behaviour, is attack the Opposition. That is not what the Australian people are expecting of a government in office. Certainly, the Government can question the Opposition's policies and so forth, but it is responsible for nearly one million people in this country being out of work. One would have thought that by now it would have revised the economic model that led to that appalling situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, you will remember the words of Mr Keating when he said, `There will be no recession'.

That represents 82,000 people who do not now show in the unemployment figures. In other words, well over one million people are really unemployed because 82,000 extra people have been discouraged from even participating in the work force over the last 12 months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most, if not the most, crucial issue in Australia today is the unemployment crisis. I am most disappointed in the response and attitude that Senator Button shows and provides in answers to questions on this most important matter. That was seen in his answer to Senator Hill, which we are taking note of. Unfortunately, that sort of attitude is typical of Senator Button's approach to this matter in the last few months. It could be said that that sort of attitude is a substitute for substantial policy. Over a number of months I have been on the receiving end of little snide remarks by Senator Button when I have raised serious issues about the participation rate. When I have raised issues about government policies which are forcing many families to have both parents in the paid work force just to make ends meet, he comes back and snidely suggests that I am virtually saying to the women that they ought to get back to the kitchen. Nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>

Its policies have been so constructed as to require both parents to be in the paid work force in thousands of cases. We all know of mothers in the paid work force who would much rather be at home caring full time for their children. The Government is persisting in those policies. Worse still, it is not analysing what is happening to the paid work force. In this particular instance I have simply asked why the Government is not doing a survey to ascertain how many of those 43,900 people who have lost their jobs in the last month are mothers, for example, who were forced into the paid work force or had to stay in the paid work force for longer than they wanted and are now being forced out of the paid work force. </PARA>

It is important that one of my colleagues drew attention to the rather trivial nature of the answer that the Opposition received from Senator Button. This is a serious matter. It is very clear that it is the major issue concerning most Australians. When Senator Button was asked the question, what the Opposition wanted to know was what he proposed to do about it and whether the recession was over. All the Opposition really got from Senator Button in response to this very important and reasonable question&mdash;and certainly a question that many people in the public are concerned about&mdash;was, once again, a trivial and misleading attack on Dr Hewson and the Fightback plan. That is the very problem that we have had in Question Time day after day.

Senator Button has been told by Mr Keating not to answer our questions but to try to turn the attack onto Dr Hewson and the Fightback plan. That was the very reason why, two weeks ago, this chamber moved to restrict the length of time that Ministers have to answer questions, feeling that, for most questions that are put, the two-minute time limit provides plenty of time for them to answer. But it did seriously inhibit Ministers from taking up that time, not by answering the question but instead by attacking the Opposition. We have had this ridiculous result that, after a four-day experiment on this important new initiative to see how the proposal shook down and how it worked its way through the procedures of this chamber, the Democrats crumpled under pressure from the Government and brought in the four-minute rule. We are now back to the bad old days where there are constant attacks on the Opposition and no answers to questions. </PARA>

<PARA>In his response today to the question from Senator Foreman about various aviation matters, Senator Collins quoted from a release called `Aviation Report' which reported on some aspects of a speech I gave and subsequent discussions I had with the Regional Airlines Association in Sydney a couple of weeks ago, on 24 September. Senator Collins claimed, and again he was quoting from the `Aviation Report' newsletter, that some of the key regional operators&mdash;and he mentioned in particular Mr Max Hazelton, the general manager of Hazelton Airlines&mdash;had said in the course of the discussions with me at that meeting following my speech that his company's best estimate of the savings as a result of the Fightback proposal was 4 or 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins went on from there to claim the great concern that the airlines may feel as a result of a 15 per cent GST on sales of their airlines tickets. As is common nowadays with virtually all Ministers, there were some very significant omissions from the answer that Senator Collins gave. In particular, he completely omitted to mention that 80 per cent of Hazelton Airlines ticket sales are business sales and only 20 per cent are sales to private and leisure commuters. Of course, the 15 per cent paid by business on an airline ticket will be fully rebatable as a business input. When we average that out, taking the 80 per cent of Hazelton's total fare structure, which in effect will not be subject to GST at all, it means that across the board Hazelton's air ticket prices as a result of the GST would rise by only 3 per cent. That is a smaller figure than the amount of cost savings that Hazelton Airlines has accepted&mdash;it is a conservative costing&mdash;of 5 per cent in terms of its cost reductions. So Hazelton, on its own figures, will be better off and the price to business commuters after GST will fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as private or leisure commuters are concerned, any increase in the price of airline tickets will be far outweighed by the major benefits they receive from other elements of the Fightback package.

In the comments that Senator Spindler just made, where he was trying to counter my view that he was a Marxist, he referred to me as a member of the far Right. That is a matter to which I take complete and absolute exception. The sorts of values that I seek to proclaim and advance inside this chamber and outside this chamber are the values of mainstream Australia. They are values which seek to create employment, to lower taxation, to protect private property, to advance the cause of the family and to cultivate a love and affection for our great country. To suggest that they are the values of people on the far Right is complete and blithering nonsense.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was asked by the Attorney-General on 1 September 1992 to inquire into the removal of the Gillespie children from Australia in the terms set out below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`It appears that on or about 14 July 1992 contrary to orders of the Family Court of Australia Raja Kamarul Bahrin, a Malaysian national and resident, removed from Australia his two children, Iddin and Shahirah (know as `the Gillespie children'). It further appears that that action was taken despite the existence of a Family Court warrant to all police officers in Australia (issued 12 July 1992) to take possession of the children and deliver them to their mother, Yasmin Gillespie, the person entitled to custody by court order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are requested to inquire into and report on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ta) the means by which the departure of Bahrin and the children from Australia was effected; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) whether the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service (having regard to both its passenger processing and coastwatch functions) took all action reasonably required and reasonably open in the circumstances in seeking to locate, arrest, take possession of or prevent the departure from Australia of Bahrin and the children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Government may wish to make public your findings and conclusions, and as criminal proceedings may arise out of the same matters, you should consult the Attorney-General's Department in preparing your final report to avoid so far as possible a situation where your report would not be able to be made public without prejudice to the fair trial of any person who may be the subject of such proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The inquiry required an examination of the events leading to the removal of the children, the procedures and practices followed by the Commonwealth agencies involved and the investigations they have undertaken subsequently. It also called for an assessment of the actions taken by those agencies responsible for preventing unlawful departures from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The Commonwealth agencies involved were the Australian Federal Police, Australian Customs Service, Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre), Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. While State Police played a part in the case, the primary responsibility rests with the Commonwealth agencies and it is on the latter that the inquiry concentrates. Any suggestion that State authorities should have a different role would clearly be something to be taken up with State Governments separately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The inquiry has been conducted by examining files and other documents held by the Commonwealth agencies, detailed statements provided by them of the events and the outcome of subsequent investigations and discussions with agency principals and their officers who had a direct involvement in what occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. A meeting was also held with Mr and Mrs Gillespie and their solicitors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. In view of the time allowed the inquiry has only sought verification of the material presented where this was clearly essential to meet the terms of reference. Some of the material may be tested before a court in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The report is divided into two parts. The first sets out in a chronological form the background to the case and the various events that occurred in July and earlier. The findings and conclusions of the inquiry are dealt with in the second part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. I have consulted with the Attorney-General's Department as directed and we have agreed certain matters which could prejudice the fair trial of a person the subject of criminal proceedings should be omitted from the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PART 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. The Gillespie children Iddin (9 years) and Shahirah (7 years) were removed from Australia in July contrary to an order of the Family Court of Australia. Their removal followed an access visit by their father, Raja Kamarul Bahrin Shah, a Malaysian prince of the royal court of Trengganu.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. On Thursday 9 July 1992 in Melbourne Raja Bahrin exercised access to the children, who are Australian citizens, in accordance with a consent order of 1991. The children were collected at their home at 5 pm and taken to the Victoria Hotel, Little Collins Street, Melbourne, where Raja Bahrin had reserved accommodation. They were to be returned at 12.30 pm on Sunday 12 July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. The children were seen at the Victoria Hotel on 9 July but not after that date. Raja Bahrin failed to return them to their mother on 12 July. On 26 July he held a press conference in Kuala Lumpur, shown later on Malaysian television, at which he claimed the children were also in Malaysia. This was subsequently confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Proceedings in the Family Court of Australia</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. Since 1985, when this matter first came before the Family Court of Australia, various proceedings have taken place and orders issued. In addition there were counter actions taken by Raja Bahrin in the Kadi Court (the Islamic Court) in Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. On 28 November 1985 the Honourable Justice Treyvaud made an interim order that Mrs Gillespie have sole guardianship and custody of the children of her marriage with Raja Bahrin. Among other things the Judge restrained Raja Bahrin from removing the children out of Victoria and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. This order was sent to the Australian Federal Police in Melbourne by Mrs Gillespie's solicitors on 3 December 1985 with a request that the children be noted "on your Federal Watch List". The Australian Federal Police entered the names of the children on the passenger alert system managed by the Australian Customs Service on 5 December 1985. There have been regular updates of that entry since then.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. Raja Bahrin then applied to the Family Court for a discharge of the November 1985 orders and sought orders for the guardianship of the children and custody of the older child. He submitted that the matter was a "kidnapping case" and that the wife and children should be returned to Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. In February 1986 Justice Treyvaud ordered that the children be returned to Malaysia in the wife's care on various conditions including upon an undertaking that steps would be taken to ensure that the matter would be litigated in the High Court of Malaysia and not the Kadi Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. An appeal by Mrs Gillespie was effectively upheld by the Full Court of the Family Court in a judgment delivered on 27 June 1986. It was decided that the children should not be returned to Malaysia and that the custody application should be heard in the Family Court of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. On 1 November 1991 a consent order was made by the Family Court providing for joint guardianship of the children but giving sole custody of them to Mrs Gillespie. It also dealt with access arrangements which would apply to Raja Bahrin. The conditions of access required that Raja Bahrin</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">give Mrs Gillespie one month's notice in writing of his intention to <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">exercise access and advise her of the hotel arrangements with respect <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to access;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">allow the children to telephone Mrs Gillespie daily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The restraint on Raja Bahrin removing the children out of Victoria and Australia was maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20. In chambers on Sunday 12 July 1992 the Honourable Justice Joske ordered the issue of a warrant to the Marshal, the Australian Federal Police and all State and Territory Police Forces to take possession of the children and deliver them to Mrs Gillespie. The Judge also gave authority for Mrs Gillespie and her solicitors, Price Brent, to publish details of the case as they thought fit in order to ascertain the whereabouts of the children. The warrant was issued and delivered to the Australian Federal Police in Melbourne that day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21. The following day the passenger alert system was up-dated to show the existence of this warrant. At the same time the Australian Federal Police enhanced the alerts on the children under various names&mdash;twenty for Iddin and eleven for Shahirah instead of two and three respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. On 15 July 1992 a warrant was issued for the arrest of Raja Bahrin and the passenger alert system activated in two names.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Raja Bahrin's Entry into Australia</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23. Raja Bahrin came to Australia in July to visit his children having earlier given notice to Mrs Gillespie in June, as required by the Family Court order of 1 November 1991. He advised her that he required access on three separate occasions between 6 and 15 July and would reside at the Victoria Hotel, Lit~e Collins Street, Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24. He arrived in Melbourne on Malaysian Airlines Flight MH 121 early on Saturday 4 July 1992. He travelled on a Malaysian passport with a multiple entry visitor visa issued by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur on 10 February 1992. The visa was valid for one year and allowed Raja Bahrin to stay in Australia for three months on each occasion he entered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25. The Incoming Passenger Card presented to the Australian Customs Service on arrival indicated that Raja Bahrin had boarded the aircraft in Malaysia, intended to stay in Australia for 10 days, that his main reason for coming to Australia was a holiday and that he intended to reside at the Victoria Hotel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26. At 6 pm on 4 July Raja Bahrin checked into the Victoria Hotel. The Hotel has advised that he was booked to stay from 4 July to 15 July although the Hotel Registration Card shows a departure date of 14 July. Two adjoining twin rooms Nos. 212 and 214 were allocated to him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Means of Departure from Australia</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27. Evidence obtained by the Australian Federal Police indicates that</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Raja Bahrin left Melbourne with the children and an accomplice on 10 July, the day after the second access visit commenced . Making essential stops only they travelled by car to Weipa in Queensland arriving on the evening of 12 July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Two vehicles were used for the journey. A station wagon rented by the accomplice in Melbourne was used for the first stage to Cairns. There they transferred to a utility with canopy owned by the accomplice to drive to Weipa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The accomplice had two weeks earlier taken his Starcraft cabin cruiser to Weipa where he had arranged for mechanical repairs to be made. The vessel is similar in appearance to a game fishing boat and had been fitted with long range fuel tanks that gave it capacity to cover approximately 700 nautical miles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Following some further mechanical trouble the vessel sailed from Weipa either on the night of 14 July or early in the morning of 15 July. While Raja Bahrin and the children were not seen in Weipa, all the available evidence points clearly to them being on board the vessel with the accomplice and to the vessel sailing north.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) The vessel had been refuelled to capacity giving it range to easily reach countries to the north of Australia and return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequently Raja Bahrin is reported as stating that he left Australia by vessel and travelled to Malaysia through Indonesia. The vessel has not been seen/identified by Australian authorities since leaving Weipa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Search for the Children</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28. The disappearance of the Gillespie children first came to the attention of Commonwealth agencies on Saturday 11 July 1992. Mrs Gillespie telephoned the Australian Federal Police in Melbourne on the afternoon of that day expressing concern about her children. They had failed to telephone her during the access visit and it appeared the children and their father had not been at the Victoria Hotel for two days. Her last contact with the children had been at 5 pm on 9 July when Raja Bahrin had collected them from their home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29. The Australian Federal Police made an immediate check of the outwards passenger movements at the Melbourne International Airport but no movement record for the children or their father was found. This was conveyed to Mrs Gillespie who was also advised about legal action that she might take through her solicitor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30. Mrs Gillespie telephone the Australian Federal Police again on the following day and was referred to Family Law Squad members then on duty. She later visited the Australian Federal Police Headquarters in Melbourne where she met the Squad members and provided photographs of both children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">31. The photographs were delivered to the Melbourne Airport that afternoon and arrangements were made for them to be distributed to all Australian Customs Service officers working in departure/outward areas and those coming on duty on later shifts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32. The warrant for the children to be taken into possession and returned to their mother was issued by the Family Court later on 12 July and was received by the Australian Federal Police at about midnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">33. On 13 July the Australian Federal Police updated the passenger alert system to show the existence of the warrant . Its Portswatch Branch at the Melbourne Airport was also informed of the upgrade. Following normal practice a series of checks were then undertaken involving all five members of the Family Law Squad in Melbourne including:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contacts suggested by Mr and Mrs Gillespie.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sightings of the children (of which there were 12 on the first day and 10 subsequently) reported by members of the public as a result of the media exposure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">34. The Police found that most of the Australian telephone calls had been made to hotels, guest houses and parks in the Healesville/Warburton area near Melbourne, and that Raja Bahrin had made bookings at several for 9 and 10 July but did not arrive at any of them. Subsequently all listed hotels and guest houses in the area were contacted with a negative result. Similarly all the other checks and investigations failed to produce any information on the possible location of the children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">35. The circumstances of the disappearance of the children and photographs of them were circulated to all Portswatch Branches in Australia (i.e. all international airports) late on 13 July requesting that the photographs be provided to all Australian Customs Service officers working in the departure/outward area at the airports. In one case, Sydney, hard copies of the photographs were sent by air when the facsimile copy proved unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">36. On 14 July the Family Court warrant, photographs of the children and descriptions of them and their father were sent to the Victorian and NSW Police requesting that they notify all country Police Stations. Family Law Squads in other Regions were also provided with the warrant, orders and photographs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">37. On the following days up until 24 July the Family Law Squad in Melbourne coordinated and conducted many investigations of the type listed above. Assistance was sought from and given by other Australian Federal Police Regions, all Portswatch Branches, Australian Customs Service, the Victorian, NSW and WA Police and many private organisations. Surveillance and searches of premises were carried out and special checks made of passengers on selected international flights. But no information or intelligence was produced that might have led to the children being found.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">38. During this period the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had contact with Mr and Mrs Gillespie about possible consular activity and legal processes in the event it turned out the children had been removed from Australia. The Department through the Australian High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur also notified the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of its interest in the case and requested assistance to ascertain whether the children were in Malaysia and, if so, their general well being. This action did not produce any information either.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">39. Late on 24 July the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Mr and Mrs Gillespie that they were reasonably certain the children were in Indonesia on their way to Malaysia. The Australian Federal Police received similar advice that night. Confirmation was given on 26 July by Raja Bahrin's appearance in Kuala Lumpur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">40. The Family Law Squad activities ceased the following week as the matter had become a criminal investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The "Pencheroboh" Incident</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">41. It has been suggested that a vessel called "Pencheroboh", (a name bearing no resemblance to that of the vessel referred to in para 27 above) may have been involved in the removal of the Gillespie children from Australia. In the days following Raja Bahrin's departure from Weipa there was a search and rescue incident involving a vessel identifying itself by that name. The vessel had broken down north of Australia and had requested assistance which was given by the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">42. On 15 July 1992, Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre received reports from all over Australia concerning possible distress calls from an unknown vessel, believed initially to be in South Australian waters. The messages were received on Citizens Band (CB) radio and were very garbled, with no accurate position given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">43. Further information received indicated that the vessel which was then thought to be an Indonesian fishing vessel could be 80 nautical miles north west of Weipa. One call in Indonesian also contained the message "Please help two small children on board Indonesian". At the request of the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, Coastwatch diverted an aircraft to that position but when contact with the vessel could not be made, the aircraft was released by the Centre to resume its scheduled surveillance task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">44. On 16 July, reports to the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre indicated that a vessel was broken down some 80 nautical miles south of Merauke, Indonesia and that it required a tow into Merauke. (Merauke is a small port on the southern coastline of Irian Jaya, Indonesia, some 160 miles north west of Thursday Island, Queensland. The position given was in international waters JUSt outside the Australian search and rescue area and in Indonesia's area of responsibility.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">45. A Coastwatch aircraft was tasked by the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre to undertake a search and rescue mission to locate the vessel. The aircraft sighted the vessel in international waters 80 nautical miles SSW of Merauke and communications were established. The vessel was described as an eleven metre game boat with white hull, beige deck, white cabin with a wooden door and guardrails on the forward deck. The drift of the vessel was carrying it towards the Indonesian coast.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">46. The person contacted on the vessel advised that his name was Abdul Rahman Said, that he was the only person, he was safe, had plenty of food and water and the vessel's name was "Pencheroboh". He also indicated that he had total engine failure and requested that a specific person in Merauke be informed that a mechanic was needed. This message was relayed by the Coastwatch aircraft to Merauke aviation authorities and by the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre to the Indonesian search and rescue authorities. In addition the Centre broadcast urgency messages to shipping in case any vessel in the area was able to assist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">47. On 17 July more distress calls were received from the "Pencheroboh" prompting offers of assistance from other vessels in the area. The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre also sought assistance from the Royal Australian Navy. Late that day RAN patrol vessel HMAS Dubbo advised that it was diverting to the distressed vessel and would assist with engine repairs or if this was not possible would transport the crew member to Thursday Island. Its expected time of arrival in the area was 12.30 pm the following day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">48. On 18 July certain CB operators around Australia established two-way communications with the `Pencheroboh". One operator reported that the `Pencheroboh' was 30 nautical miles off Merauke, had five persons on board with no food or water and had an urgent need for medical assistance. A message that HMAS Dubbo would be in the area to assist in approximately five hours was passed on to the `Pencheroboh".. Shortly afterwards the `Pencheroboh" indicated that it was underway, that it did not require assistance from HMAS Dubbo and expressed regret for the trouble caused. The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre then advised the RAN and Coastwatch that assistance was no longer required and cancelled its urgency message to other shipping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">49. Further distress calls were reported the following day including separate messages that there were women and children on board and that there were three children on board. There were other messages that the vessel had drifted ashore. The information was passed on to the Indonesian search and rescue authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">50. On 20 July the Indonesian search and rescue authority advised that a fishing boat from Merauke had been sent to tow in the "Pencheroboh" and followed up with a message on 23 July that five crew from the vessel had been rescued safely.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The Gillespie children, their father and an accomplice departed from Weipa, Queensland, on the Starcraft cabin cruiser on 14 or 15 July 1992. They travelled with their father and the accomplice to Weipa by car leaving Melbourne on 10 July and arriving at Weipa on 12 July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Only the accomplice, who had earlier purchased the vessel in Perth and taken it to Weipa, was seen in Weipa. Repairs to the vessel probably delayed the departure by two days and even then they left with mechanical problems including to the engine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Considerable funds were expended in the purchase of a vehicle and the vessel, repairs to both and in international and domestic travel. Almost all transactions were in cash.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">52. Raja Bahrin observed all the requirements of the Family Court order of 1 November 1991 by giving due notice of his desire for an access visit including the hotel where the children would reside during the visit and by surrendering his passport and tickets when he arrived</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">53. He entered Australia on a valid visitor visa in the proper manner with a return ticket to Malaysia for 15 July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">54. He had an access visit on 6 and 7 July in the normal way before returning the children to their mother. He collected the children from their home on 9 July for a second access visit as earlier arranged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">55. There was no suggestion in this behaviour of the events that followed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">56. Personal possessions and documents were left in the Victoria Hotel rooms that gave the impression Raja Bahrin would return with the children and was simply sightseeing in or near Melbourne. The accommodation bookings made at various hotels in the Healesville/Warburton area for 9 and 10 July added to this impression. They also set up a false trail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">57. The means by which the departure was effected had significant risks. To undertake such a risky venture suggests some desperation but more importantly that a judgment was made that departure by the normal means was not open to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Role and Operations of Commonwealth Agencies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">58. Primary responsibility for this family law matter rests with the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Customs Service has a principal involvement through its management of international passenger processing, Coastwatch and barrier control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">59. The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre has become implicated inadvertently because of the "Pencheroboh" incident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">60. The other two agencies, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, have interests related to entry visa control and consular activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">61. Australian Federal Police Regional Commands are responsible for handling individual cases in their Regions and deploying resources to meet priority demands. In this case the Southern Region has managed the Gillespie family law matter since it began in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">62. This is an appropriate devolution of authority by the Australian Federal Police&mdash;it is supported by policy guidelines and reporting arrangements which enable the Commissioner to maintain overall control of performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">63. There is, however, a standing arrangement for various operations declared to be national operations and for sensitive matters to be centrally monitored to ensure they are being effectively managed and resourced. While the Gillespie case remained for the entire period a Southern Region responsibility, it was monitored from 13 July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">64. The Southern Region does not have written procedures for executing Family Court orders but it does maintain a check list for inquiries in relation to custody warrants. The actions taken in this case followed the standard practice of checking with other police records, with State and Commonwealth agencies, with financial institutions, reported sightings etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">65. Information obtained from these sources is usually sufficient to enable children to be located. In the financial year 1991/92 75 Family Court custody warrants were executed in the Southern Region and 111 children returned to their legal guardian. In the last three financial years all the children the subject of a custody warrant were found and returned to the appropriate person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">66. There were different features in the Gillespie children case, however, to most of the custody warrant investigations referred to above:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">connections with family members or friends which are normally <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">available were not present;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Raja Bahrin being a short term foreign visitor did not appear in the <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">records of most other agencies and institutions;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the investigation commenced more than three days after the children <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">had been last seen;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the investigation required contact to be made with more people than <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">normal to follow up reported sightings and the inquiries in the <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Healesville/Warburton area;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reported sightings were totally unproductive (with the knowledge we <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">now have they could not have been the Gillespie children).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">67. Marginally more resources than normal were therefore allocated from within the Family Law Squad to the investigation. It is customary for a case to be allocated to an individual member, who takes all the action required, assisted by others on a needs basis only, for example when effecting an arrest. Two officers, including the Detective Sergeant in charge of the Squad, worked on a full time basis while the remaining three contributed at various times when needed. Assistance was provided as required by other parts of the Australian Federal Police and other agencies both Commonwealth and State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">68. Generally the investigation followed standard practices for executing Family Court custody warrants and was treated in a routine way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">69. The Australian Customs Service passenger alert system PASS, was operating effectively. The entries on the system for the Gillespie children were up-graded and enhanced in a timely manner by the Australian Federal Police. The addition of Raja Bahrin to the system was effected on the day the arrest warrant was issued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">70. On the other hand notification of an alert to Australian Customs Service Passenger Processing areas at airports other than Melbourne was not satisfactory. An all ports warning was not issued by the Australian Federal Police until late on 13 July 1992, the photographs of the children were not of high quality and the information was received over a period of several days, the last on 16 July. An ameliorating factor in this case, however, was the extensive media coverage which alerted staff at other airports&mdash;in addition at some ports newspaper photographs were found to be of more use than those distributed by the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">71. No Australian Customs Service Barrier Control outports were notified of the alert. Normal outward movement through those points, however, would have activated the PASS alert system. The Australian Customs Service's national computer network INTERCEPT links all Barrier Control points, including remote outports and gives access to the PASS alert system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">72. Similarly Coastwatch was not notified of the alert. (Mr and Mrs Gillespie assert that the Australian Federal Police informed them that this had occurred. For its part the Australian Federal Police is adamant that reference was made to its Portswatch Branch but not Coastwatch.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">73. Notification of the alert was confined to the Victorian and NSW Police primarily their country network&mdash;and the WA Police in Fremantle in response to reported sightings and externally provided leads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">74. The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre treated the "Pencheroboh" incident as a regular search and rescue situation following its standard practices which include diverting Coastwatch aircraft (as happened twice) and seeking the aid of other vessels nearby. The HMAS Dubbo (and other vessels) responded to the latter request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">75. Initially the very garbled messages received on Citizens Band (CB) Radio rather than Marine HF frequencies with no accurate position being given suggested to the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and Coastwatch that they could be hoax calls. With the assistance of radio operators around Australia&mdash;another common practice an accurate position and eventually two-way communications were established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">76. During the incident there was a discrepancy in the reports of the number of people on board the vessel, which varied from one to five. The very sudden release of the HMAS Dubbo by the "Pencheroboh" and later more may day calls also suggested something different about the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">77. Given the type of incidents that occur in these waters, the garbled nature of the reports and possible language difficulties these aspects were not regarded as significant or unusual. Indeed throughout the incident the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and Coastwatch believed the `Pencheroboh" to be an Indonesian fishing vessel out of the port of Merauke, which had broken down and was requesting a tow back to Merauke. No vessel with that name was known to have been in Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">78. The actions of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this matter were not directly related to the removal of the children. They accorded, however, with proper practice and procedures and were effectively carried out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">79. Australia has well developed computer technology, management techniques and systems, sophisticated equipment and well trained people to manage movement of vessels, aircraft, people and goods to and from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">80. The investment of resources has been considerable over many years and continues as innovative programs and processes are developed here and overseas. In a number of areas, Australia is in the forefront of these developments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">81. Resources are appropriately allocated to meet business demands and to target high risk areas. The Australian Customs Service, for example, has a network of more than 90 offices strategically located around Australia, mainly protecting our 37,000 kilometres of coastline. Resources are nevertheless, thinly spread, especially to manage movement of people in isolated areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">82. The procedures and processes in place adequately cope with lawful movement into and out of Australia. We have much more difficulty though than most responding to the unlawful, unusual and unexpected movement of people. The events of July amply demonstrate this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">83. It needs to be emphasised that the Gillespie children were taken out of Australia secretly just two to three days after it became apparent that they would not be returned to their mother. (Had there not been mechanical trouble with the vessel they may well have left earlier.) The chances of preventing their departure were therefore extremely remote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">84. The passenger processing arrangements in place would have prevented the children being removed from Australia had they attempted to depart by air or sea in a lawful way. The systems that support them are effectively maintained and managed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">85. Consequently an elaborate operation was mounted and with the assistance of an accomplice the children taken out of Australia unlawfully by a small vessel from the remote northern port of Weipa. Normal arrangements and procedures cannot stop this happening.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">86. In responding to the disappearance of the children in Melbourne the Australian Federal Police employed their standard search processes and techniques for such cases. They rely almost entirely on information provided by external sources. Their excellent recent record in recovering children has shown that the methods used are generally effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">87. The resources allocated (or available) by the Australian Federal Police to the search were adequate for the approach being taken. Assistance was also freely supplied by other authorities. The coordination of the activities by the Family Law Squad in Melbourne were satisfactory for the task as well. There was no need for a special task force to be established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">88. When this approach was not showing any signs of success, however, a reassessment of it should have occurred. That it did not occur calls into question the effectiveness of the Australian Federal Police monitoring process for such investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">89. Only occasionally would family law cases warrant any special treatment, given the other serious matters under investigation by the various authorities, but there should be a place for exceptions. The adherence to standard practices is not sufficient to meet all situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">90. A more coordinated effort&mdash;including greater sharing of information, intelligence and workload with other Commonwealth, and where appropriate State, agencies would be a desirable outcome from such a reassessment. In the Gillespie case a meeting of the principal agencies did not take place until after the children reached Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">91. The circumstances under which alerts are distributed to other agencies and the extent of their distribution requires further examination. While being conscious of the need not to overburden others or lessen the impact of material circulated in this way, wider distribution in selected cases would be justified. In the Gillespie case distribution to the Australian Custom Services' Barrier Control at outposts was warranted for example.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">92. Similarly Coastwatch and the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre could have been alerted. This is not really useful, however, unless other intelligence relating it to a vessel or incident is available and in the case of Coastwatch, they are tasked appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">93. The procedures for distributing material should be more clearly defined and understood by all agencies and the lines of communication (the cause of delay) more direct. A centrally managed system would have been more effective in the Gillespie case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">94. With the benefit of hindsight, the possibility of the Gillespie children being on board the "Pencheroboh" cannot be dismissed. Despite views to the contrary the events were not so unusual for search and rescue incidents north of Australia as to draw attention. There was no reason at the time for Coastwatch or the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre to suspect the vessel was other than what it claimed to be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">95. In summary, the inquiry found that the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service acted in an appropriate and generally timely manner using longstanding, proven practices for executing Family Court custody warrants. When the action being taken was not showing any signs of producing a result, a reassessment of it should have occurred involving all relevant Commonwealth and State agencies. On infrequent occasions a higher priority needs to be given to family law matters by the Australian Federal Police. Some of their procedures also need to be improved. In this case as the removal of the Gillespie children had been effected so early in the investigation, a change of direction following reassessment would not have produced a different outcome.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) for tabling this report, which is the document produced by Mr Glenn. I might remind the Senate that the Government undertook this inquiry largely as a result of my questions and concerns relating to this matter and the suggestion that I might press for a Senate inquiry into matters concerning the removal of these young Australian citizens from the protection of the Australian jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon reading the report, I am deeply disturbed. I am more convinced than ever that the search for the Gillespie children was inadequate. If there had been an adequate search, the children might well have been recovered before they were removed from this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement, the Minister said that a change of direction following reassessment would not have produced a different outcome. I dispute that. On the basis of the information put before us, I do not believe that one can reach that conclusion. I accept that Mr Glenn said that he thought that if a different procedure had been adopted even then the recovery of the children would have been unlikely. The trouble is that we do not know because other procedures in this investigation were not included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me briefly remind the chamber of what occurred as we know it. It seems that the father of these children, a Malaysian citizen, was taking proper access of his children under the Family Law Act in this country and that he abducted those children in breach of the order of the Australian Family Court and took them from this country back to his homeland in Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that he arrived in this country under a proper passport and that he complied with the proper entry requirements of Australia and deposited his ticket and his passport with the due authorities&mdash;in this case the solicitors for the Gillespies&mdash;in accordance with the order of the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then know that the children disappeared. The distraught Gillespies, Mrs Gillespie and her husband, contacted the AFP, the Australian Federal Police, seeking its help to discover the whereabouts and return of the children. The Australian Federal Police adopted procedures which seem to be consistent with those which it has adopted before in previous such cases with, it seems, quite good success. That is the key in this instance. The Australian Federal Police considered that the practices it had adopted&mdash;the methods of investigation that it had adopted&mdash;in the past would be adequate in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I ask you, Madam Deputy President, to address the likelihood of what the father of these children would have done to get them out of the country. He may have taken them out through airports, put them on an international flight, but one would have thought that that was probably unlikely because a Malaysian citizen with two very young Australian-Malay children would have stood out at the normal Customs checks and they would have been discovered. One would have thought that probably he would have sought to remove them either by air, through light aircraft, from northern Australia or by boat from northern Australia. The AFP took the procedure of monitoring airports through the Australian Customs Service. As a safeguard, it should have done that even though it was probably unlikely that the Malaysian Prince would have been so foolish as to attempt to use that avenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the AFP did not alert Coastwatch to watch for any unusual boat movements to the north of Australia and it did not alert police forces of Australia outside of New South Wales and Victoria, particularly police forces in northern Australia. One would have thought&mdash;and I am surprised that it did not strike Mr Glenn as obviously as it strikes me&mdash;that they would have been very basic decisions made in the investigation process early on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Glenn in his report&mdash;and I accept his bona fides in his efforts, of course, in this report&mdash;says that, when it was apparent that its earlier strategy was failing, perhaps the AFP should have looked at these additional options. But I suggest that it should have been obvious that these other options should have been taken into account and covered from the very start of this investigation, because Mrs Gillespie, the distraught mother, said to the AFP, `What we suspect is going to happen is that he is going to try to take them out of the country away from the protection of the Australian courts and return them to Malaysia, his home'. The failure to take this action by the AFP and of course of the administration of justice in this instance by the Australian Government is that Coastwatch was not alerted and the State police forces, particularly in Queensland and Western Australia, also were not alerted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that what happened was that the Prince and an accomplice took the children by car to northern Australia, to Weipa, where they picked up a smallish game-fishing boat that had earlier been purchased for the purpose of removal of the children. Then they took them offshore, it seems, through Indonesia back to Malaysia. What happened by a series of coincidences, we now believe, was that Coastwatch intercepted the boat on which we believe the children had been placed because there were calls being made for assistance from that boat, but Coastwatch did not link the possible presence of the children on the boat to the Gillespie case; it did not link the facts of the Gillespie case to the boat it was investigating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister shakes his head but, if he reads Mr Glenn's report, he will find that the calls for assistance that were given from this boat in one instance even referred to the presence of two young children on the boat. Then we get into a confusing pattern where not only the Coastwatch aircraft of Australia intercepted the vessel or took account of the mayday calls but also an Australian naval vessel went to give assistance. Surprisingly, when the Australian naval vessel went to give assistance, it got a response from the vessel that the engine trouble had been overcome, and so it turned away. Yet the following day, it seems that the calls continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was this mysterious set of circumstances of calls for assistance and then, when Australian naval vessels went to give assistance, they were told they were not required and the calls for assistance continued, with several of those calls making reference to the fact that there were children on the boat&mdash;in one instance, two small children, and another suggestion was that there were three small children. One would have thought that the Coastwatch officials, who were taking that course of action, would have been also looking for the possibility of these children being spirited off the north of Australia by boat. But they were not because they had not been tasked to do so. That is the major failing in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I put that to representatives of the AFP in the Estimates Committee, their answer to that was, `We did not do it because we could not apply a specific task to Coastwatch'. To me, that is an unsatisfactory explanation because all they should have simply instructed Coastwatch was that there was a possibility that these children could be taken offshore in an effort to return them to Malaysia by small vessel, and that Coastwatch should keep a look out for such a possibility. But it did not occur. If they had been keeping a look out for such a possibility, as circumstances developed when there was this series of mysterious calls from this vessel and the suggestion that there may have been two young children on the vessel, obviously their interception of that vessel, I respectfully suggest, would have been in a different light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other possibility and shortcoming I mentioned a moment ago was the fact that north Australian police had not be tasked also. As I said, the fishing boat took off from Weipa. The children and their father were in Weipa, it seems, for possibly two days before the vessel left Australian shores. But was there any check being made on small boats leaving Australia in mysterious circumstances during this period of time when the AFP believed that there were attempts being made to remove these two young children from Australia? No. I would have thought that that would have been an elementary procedure that would be taken in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the officers of the AFP sat down presumably after they were instructed by the Gillespie family that they believed their children had been abducted, one would have thought they would have addressed the possibilities that were open for the removal of these children from the jurisdiction, would have recognised the possibilities of removal of them from north Australia by boat or small aircraft, and would have at least made efforts to cover that possibility. That, in this instance, they did not. If they had done so then, as circumstances developed, I think there would have been a very real chance that these children would have been apprehended and protected by the Australian jurisdiction before they were lost from the protection of our courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what particularly disturbs me in this matter. I believe that the Government should face up to that failing. It should recognise that it was a failing that occurred in these circumstances; it should ensure that the AFP is properly instructed in future circumstances where attempts are being made to remove children from the protection of the Australian courts; and it should ensure that options such as removal by light aircraft and boat from the north of Australia are covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish on just a few other matters also remaining which cause me concern in this matter. I still do not know why officers of the Australian Federal Police on July 24&mdash;that is some nine or 10 days after the children had left Australia&mdash;were telling the Government they were confident that the children were still in this country. I thought we would get an answer to that in this document, and we have not. As I said, I still do not know why the search was concentrated in southern Australia. That also is not explained in this document when, as I said, it should have been so obvious that the north of Australia should have been covered and was just as important if not more important than searches within southern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why a meeting of the principal agencies involved in the search did not take place until the children had, in fact, reached Malaysia. One suspects, of course, that that coordinating meeting took place to look at ways to explain the deficiencies in the investigation. I hope that is not the case, but I certainly have not had an explanation as to why the key bodies, the key instrumentalities that should have been involved in this search did not meet early on and coordinate their actions properly. Of course I do not know why the vessel that was in Weipa for some considerable time before it took the children offshore was not discovered in the circumstances of this whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not only an extremely distressing matter for the Gillespies but it also demonstrates, in my view, a major shortcoming in the system of enforcement and protection of justice in this country. It is a demonstration of a state of affairs that is unsatisfactory. I regret, as I said, that the Australian Government has not been willing to face up to that shortcoming and at least put in place mechanisms that can give the Australian people greater confidence in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other matter that I want to mention is my continuing concern about what is now not being done in relation to the return of the children from Malaysia. I do not know whether or not, for example, a warrant has been issued for the arrest of the accomplice. That is not covered by this document. I do not know what action has been taken through the Australian courts against the father who abducted these children. Enforcement of the action is another question, but I do not know what action has actually been instituted against the father, who is clearly in breach of Australian laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following my efforts in the Estimates Committee it seems to me that there has been insufficient effort to get consular access to the children in Malaysia and to try to reunite the mother with the children in Malaysia. On humane grounds alone, one would have thought the mother ought to be entitled to meet with her children who have been taken from her in such traumatic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not, as the Australian foreign Minister says, purely a matter of Australian family law. This is a matter in which the laws of Australia have been offended against in a blatant and appalling way, and it is a matter on which the Australian Government should be strongly making representations to Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say in passing that I do not know what efforts were made when it seems the Australian Government may have believed that the children were in Indonesia to recover the children before they reached Malaysia. Were representations made to the Indonesian Government to try to seek the return of these children, or was it just all too difficult?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, this is a disturbing matter. It has certainly not been satisfactorily resolved by this report today. I will be continuing to press it and I trust the Australian Government, even at this late stage, might start to accept its responsibility and do a lot more than it has done to date to try to reunite these children with their mother in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are considering a report to the Attorney-General on the removal of the Gillespie children from Australia in July this year, the purpose of which is to determine the means by which the children and their natural father left Australia, and whether the Australian Federal Police and Customs Service took all reasonable action to prevent that departure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry concluded that Raja Bahrin and the Gillespie children travelled to Weipa from Melbourne in cars obtained by an accomplice. Two or three days after they were due to be returned to their mother, they left Weipa on a cabin cruiser bought by the accomplice in Perth. It is very obvious from that information that a lot of thought was put into this matter. It is easy for us to say in hindsight that we could have stopped it, although perhaps it is not quite as easy as we think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry found that both the Federal Police and the Customs Service acted in an appropriate and generally timely manner using longstanding, proven practices for executing Family Court custody warrants, but that a reassessment should have taken place when the action taken failed to produce any result. However, the speed with which Raja Bahrin acted precluded the outcome from being different, according to Mr Glenn. I must say at this point that I tend to agree with Senator Hill that we do not know that for a fact and we should be looking at it a little more closely to see what else we can do. We cannot say that they would not have been effected; we do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several recommendations in the conclusions which the Democrats would like to be taken up by the Attorney-General. I will be interested to hear whether he has any intention of doing that. In particular, paragraph 90 on page 17 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more coordinated effort, including greater sharing of information, intelligence and workload with other Commonwealth, and where appropriate State, agencies would be a desirable outcome from such a reassessment.</PARA>
<PARA>Also paragraph 93 on page 18 also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedures for distributing material should be more clearly defined and understood by all agencies and the lines of communication (the cause of delay) more direct. A centrally managed system would have been more effective in the Gillespie case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a good idea to examine several of the recommendations in the report. Many of them would not help in other cases, and perhaps the Gillespie children's case would have been the only one and therefore perhaps these things do not need to be done. But certainly the report's recommendations should be looked at. The Democrats think that Senator Hill is right when he says that not enough was done at the time and there was not enough coordination. We believe this is fairly indicative of what has happened in several cases. With hindsight, again it is easier for us to say that now than it would have been for the Federal Police and the Customs Service to have done it at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the crux of the report is in paragraph 82 which states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report says, we have great difficulty responding to unusual movements of people. It is not that long ago that a boatload of Chinese citizens reached the Western Australian coast without detection. If they could slip through the net with no evil intent, so too could terrorists, smugglers or even small, roving armed bands which our defence strategy has identified as the only realistic military threat which we actually face. It strikes us as a fundamental case of skewed priorities. This report adds still more weight to our view that coastal surveillance and protection are badly neglected and really need to be redressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Hill and Senator Bourne for their contributions to the debate on this most important report concerning the abduction of the Gillespie children from Australia out of the jurisdiction. As we now know, they are in Malaysia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to keep in mind the sequence of events in the early days following the abduction as we can now reconstruct them. The father&mdash;who had properly come into Australia and sought and obtained access to the children for visits while he stayed at the Victoria Hotel in Melbourne&mdash;contacted Mrs Gillespie and took the children quite properly and lawfully at about 5 p.m. on 9 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was on Saturday, 11 July that Mrs Gillespie first alerted the Australian Federal Police expressing her concern about the children. Of course, then the AFP immediately contacted the international airport and got matters under way. The AFP received a warrant for the children to be taken into possession at about midnight on Sunday, 12 July. As Mr Glenn has reconstructed events, it appears that Raja Bahrin and the children departed Weipa on the night of 14 July or early in the morning of 15 July. One can see that the notice to the AFP was only two days before the removal of the children from Australia by Raja Bahrin via Weipa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to take the sequence into account in trying to assess whether in fact even a different methodology, if it had been adopted by the Federal Police as the principal agency involved, might have resulted in the children being located before they left the jurisdiction. All I can say is that Mr Glenn concluded that a change of direction following any reassessment that should have occurred as to the progress of the investigation would not have produced a different outcome. In paragraph 83 he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It needs to be emphasised that the Gillespie children were taken out of Australia secretly just two to three days after it became apparent that they would not be returned to their mother. (Had there not been mechanical trouble with the vessel they may well have left earlier.) The chances of preventing their departure were therefore extremely remote.</PARA>
<PARA>In all fairness to the agencies involved, that point has to be emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true to say that the Australian Federal Police did allocate resources which I believe were adequate to the task as they saw it, particularly in those early days. After all, it is a fact that when one looks at the financial year 1991-92 which has just past, one sees that 75 Family Court custody warrants were executed in the southern region of the AFP and 111 children were returned to their legal guardians. In the last three financial years&mdash;and I know you will be interested in this, Madam Acting Deputy President&mdash;all the children the subject of a custody warrant were found and returned to the appropriate person. That is a pretty good starting point for thinking that the procedures which the Australian Federal Police got under way would hopefully be able to find the children and allow their return to Mrs Gillespie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not true to say that this matter was dealt with as absolutely ordinary or routine at all. The family law squad itself, and the detective sergeant in charge of the squad, worked very assiduously on this matter. Assistance was provided from other areas within the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from my own conversations with the Deputy Commissioner Operations of the Federal Police that there was a monitoring, as Mr Glenn acknowledges, from the centre of the investigation being undertaken. Whilst it is true that a different sort of investigation might have been mounted, I do not think real criticism can be levelled at the way in which the investigation seeking to find these children was undertaken, except in one matter which I will come to in a moment. I do want to emphasise that this was not an operation undertaken by just the family law squad of the AFP in Melbourne. Many other elements of the AFP and other agencies were involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to take up the Coastwatch matter raised by Senator Hill. I share some of Senator Hill's misgivings about whether Coastwatch might have been alerted in a general way as to the possibility of the people being in the area. Right from the start I have wondered why that might not be an appropriate course of action and why it was not undertaken. I accept fully what Mr Glenn says and what I have been briefed on; namely, that for Coastwatch realistically to undertake a sweep of the area it needs to be tasked to look for a particular vessel. In this case, the Starcraft cabin cruiser of course had not been identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also important to say in relation to some remarks Senator Hill made that Mr Glenn notes that Raja Bahrin and the children were not seen at Weipa so there was no sense in which Coastwatch could have been alerted to the fact that this particular Starcraft cabin cruiser was the one they should be searching for. I accept all of that, but I also share Senator Hill's general query and misgiving about why perhaps some general alert might not have been put out to Coastwatch. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are so many thousands of fishing boats and vessels that one would not know which one to circle and go down to have a look at. There are problems. I do have a misgiving about whether in fact it might not have been appropriate to alert Coastwatch in a general way. Whether doing so would have led to a different result&mdash;Senator Hill nods in agreement&mdash;must be thought to be very problematic. The chances are remote, but we do not know. I believe in these instances that some more general alert might have been appropriate, but I do accept that Coastwatch would not have known precisely which of the many hundreds of vessels present during those weeks in our northern waters, in the 700 kilometres between Broome and Cairns, it should have really taken a special interest in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that one caveat on my own part, I do think it is important nevertheless to say that the report put down by Mr Glenn does indicate that the sort of investigation undertaken by the Australian Federal Police, particularly given the excellent 100 per cent record I have adverted to over the last three years&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am agreeing with misgivings on that score, but exactly what they would have been looking for is a very different matter. It is recorded by Mr Glenn that even if the police in Weipa for example had been looking for a Malaysian with two children, they would not have seen a Malaysian with two children. That is the point I am making. I cannot go beyond Mr Glenn's report, obviously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe the attempt to locate the Gillespie children was undertaken in a wholehearted way. It was undertaken with very considerable resources being devoted by the Australian Federal Police, far beyond the norm. It is highly improbable that any further change to the direction of the investigation, which might have resulted from a reassessment whilst the matter was being monitored as it was by higher authorities within the AFP than just the family law squad in Melbourne or even the region, would have led to the recovery of the children. We will never know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great tragedy that the children were removed from Australia and I believe that, quite obviously, we need to ensure that steps are taken. I think Senator Hill has had conversations at the Estimates committee with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) about the extent to which Foreign Affairs has attempted to use its consular powers to help get access for Mrs Gillespie to the children. It must be most distressing to her that that has not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the way, it is not true to say that the Federal Government has not attempted to assist the Gillespies in this matter. As Senator Hill will know, the overseas custody child removal scheme provides for Commonwealth legal aid for legal proceedings overseas to recover children where the applicant is suffering financial hardship and where the case has reasonable prospects of success. Senator Hill will be well aware of that provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a meeting on 27 July between officers of my Department, the solicitors and a barrister for the Gillespies, the Gillespies were offered up to $2,500 for the costs of an opinion on their prospects of success in legal proceedings to be taken in Malaysia, plus the reasonable costs of preparing a brief for that opinion. The offer was subject to receiving a formal application for assistance and to being satisfied about hardship. These are normal criteria as Senator Hill will know. No formal application for assistance under the scheme has been received and it is now 8 October, so we have not been exactly heartless. We have tried to provide the Gillespies with a means of securing an opinion on how they should approach the Malaysian judicial authorities, but they have not taken up what assistance we have offered. They may say that it is partial, not enough or whatever, but there has been no formal application despite that offer having been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will realise that this is a particularly difficult matter. The judicial process to be undertaken is a difficult matter to speak about in the chamber. I can tell Senator Hill that warrants have been issued, not only in relation to the Prince but also in relation to one other person. Extradition, which I think Senator Hill raised, of course requires an approach from the appropriate authorities to the Attorney-General. That approach has not been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What extradition would succeed in doing if it were successful at all is securing the return of the Prince to this jurisdiction. It would not of itself secure the return of the children who, of course, would not be subject to extradition which has to do with alleged criminal activity. They are the victims in this scenario; they are certainly not the criminals. So they would not be returned to Australia simply because there had been a successful extradition of the Prince. So this is a very difficult matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to express very clearly my understanding right from the start. From the first few days of becoming aware of this matter I have been talking with the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner within the Australian Federal Police about the sense of urgency in this matter because of the distress no doubt being suffered by the Gillespies as parents with lawful custody of these children. That has motivated much of the very considerable effort which has been put into this particular search for the children. Unfortunately, it was not successful. With the one caveat I expressed, somewhat in harmony with Senator Hill's misgiving, and acknowledging that even a general alert to the Coastwatch may not have given it sufficiently precise tasking to enable it to locate the vessel, but having put that to one side, I believe a proper effort was made in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as Mr Glenn indicates that the monitoring by the Australian Federal Police should have led to a difference in direction of the search, I take that and give it full weight. I know from speaking with Deputy Commissioner Bates yesterday about this matter that he acknowledges that that ought to be done to ensure that in those few exceptional cases where, despite the tremendous record of the last three years, it appears that ordinary methods, even beefed up, may be falling short we will see the AFP responding in a slightly different way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, in so far as Mr Glenn has pointed to any deficiencies, they have been noted. There is a determination between myself as the Minister and Deputy Commissioner Bates to ensure that, as far as is humanly possible, this sort of abduction does not occur in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank those honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on this very important report. I hope that it leads to a revamping of the efforts by Australian agencies to ensure that their cooperation and coordination and investigation and search procedures allow us to ensure that the Family Court and its orders and, more particularly, the families concerned, who should be able to rely on those orders, are protected from the sort of criminal activity which has led to the very sad abduction of these children from Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government response to the report on government companies and their reporting requirements from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration tabled its report on Government Companies and their Reporting Requirements on 2 November 1989. The inquiry, which focused on the formation, operations and accountability of government companies, was undertaken pursuant to the Committee's standing reference on companies and incorporated associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. In 1987 the then Minister for Finance set out a framework for the reform of GBEs in the policy information paper entitled Policy Guidelines for Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises. These reforms were directed to improving the corporate financial structures of GBEs, replacing day-to-day controls with strategic controls and requiring enhanced accountability in terms of their performance. Achieving greater efficiency in the public sector via the GBE reforms is an important element in the Government's program of micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. Managers of GBEs have been given responsibility to manage, and the Commonwealth's attention is now directed at the enterprise's strategic plans and broad financial performance. This does not mean any lessening of the accountability of these enterprises&mdash;on the contrary, it has been made abundantly clear to GBEs that they are not only accountable in terms of discharging any legislative or Government policy obligations, but are accountable for their performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4. The Committee's report on government companies is thus a contribution directed to the development of improved accountability for these entities. The Government accepts the theme of the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">5. The Committee's key recommendations propose:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the maintenance of a central register of companies and incorporated associations in which the Commonwealth controls or in which it has a substantial interest;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">6. Detailed responses to each of the Committee's recommendations are set out in the attachment to this document. Below are the Government's comments on some of the more significant issues raised by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Central Register of Companies and Incorporated Associations</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">7. The Committee identified 208 government controlled companies, 55 associated companies and Commonwealth involvement in 58 companies limited by guarantee and 67 incorporated associations as at 1 July 1989. It indicated, however, that it could not be sure that it had identified all such bodies and recommended that a central register be maintained to record the Commonwealth's interest in companies and incorporated associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">8. The difficulty with a central register is that it would add to the level of bureaucracy and suffer from the inherent difficulties of ensuring that such a register is current. Instead of endorsing the Committee's recommendation, the Government has already moved to have departments of State report information on companies and incorporated associations, which the Commonwealth controls or in which it has a significant influence, in their annual reports which are tabled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">9. In addition, the Government proposes to include in the Aggregate Financial Statement prepared annually pursuant to Section 50AB of the Audit Act 1901 an additional Table listing Commonwealth Departments, Trusts, Other Agencies and Entities. This listing which includes government controlled companies, will also assist readers of that statement to place in perspective those Commonwealth controlled bodies which operate on the Commonwealth Public Account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislative Authority to Establish Companies</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">10. The Committee expressed concern that government involvement in companies may occur without any requirement for parliamentary approval or any need for Parliament to be informed, and recommended that no direct interest in a company be established without either general or specific legislative authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">11. The Government takes the view that, consistent with the Policy Guidelines for the Commonwealth Statutory Authorities issued by the Minister for Finance in 1987, the Minister for Finance and the Attorney-General should be consulted in advance for proposals to establish or vary a direct Commonwealth interest in a company. As it would not always be practicable to seek prior Parliamentary approval of Government involvement in companies, the Government's intention is that the legislation replacing the Audit Act 1901 will include a provision requiring that Parliament be informed of any new or varied direct government involvement in companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">12. Further, the Government endorses the principle that a Commonwealth body should not establish or acquire a controlling interest in a company which will engage in activities beyond the purposes for which the Commonwealth body was established, unless specifically authorised by Cabinet (and legislation, where the body was established by legislation).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Criteria for Establishing Government Companies</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">13. The current criteria for establishing government companies were articulated in the May 1988 Statement by the then Minister for Transport and Communications on Reshaping the Transport and Communications Government Business Enterprises. That Statement indicated that a government company structure is appropriate for those enterprises in direct competition with private sector competitors, or for enterprises which serve no explicit social objectives and have a well-developed commercial culture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">14. The Committee recommended that all these elements should be present before a government entity is incorporated and, in addition, recommended a further criterion that a company structure would result in clearly identified efficiencies and/or other benefits which cannot be obtained without recourse to that structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">15. Although it is difficult to lay down in precise terms the circumstances which would justify the use of a company structure by a government entity, the Government has noted the Committee's views and proposes that the criteria for incorporating a government entity as a company be revised so that all existing elements must be satisfied, but with a modification to the element concerning explicit social objectives. The Government believes that there may be circumstances where it would be appropriate for a government company to undertake explicit community service obligations (CSOs) provided that the discharge of any explicit CSO be made visible, with costing and funding arrangements transparent. Accordingly the criteria proposed allow for this possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">16. Other measures being proposed to improve accountability of government companies (such as tabling annual reports in Parliament) should overcome the risk of reduced accountability referred to by the Committee when recommending the criterion that a company structure must `. . . result in clearly identified efficiencies and/or other benefits which cannot be obtained without recourse to that structure.' Furthermore, while evidence before the Committee suggested that there appear to be benefits in adopting a company form, it would in the Government's view be difficult to establish objective tests to assess any proposed efficiency increases. Against this background the Government is not in favour of adopting the Committee's proposed criterion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reporting Requirements for Government Companies</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">17. Government companies report in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Law. However, some government companies have been incorporated as exempt proprietary companies and are not required by the Corporations Law to prepare a full directors' report and financial statements as is the case for public companies. Further, there is no formal requirement for the annual reports of government companies to be tabled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">18. The Government fully supports the Committee's recommendations that all government companies be public companies and that there be legislation requiring annual reports of directly controlled government companies to be tabled. Accepting these recommendations will have little impact on existing companies, as most currently table annual reports and the exempt proprietary companies do not take advantage of the range of privileges available under the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">19. The Government does not consider, however, that it is appropriate to require companies to abide by disclosure requirements which apply to statutory authorities. If a body is to be incorporated as a company, then the relevant disclosure requirements of the Corporations Law should apply; and equally, if the body is a statutory authority, the relevant guidelines for financial statements and annual reports should apply. In both cases the reporting requirements are specifically tailored to the reporting entity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">20. Nevertheless the Government recognises that there may be special circumstances where more frequent disclosure is warranted and proposes that the legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901 will provide that the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the relevant portfolio Minister, may require half yearly or quarterly financial statements to be submitted to the responsible Minister by Commonwealth entities. The responsible Minister will be required to table the statements in the Parliament. There will also be provision for the responsible Minister to obtain information confidentially.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Auditing Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">21. As previously announced, the Government has accepted the JCPA recommendation, which the Committee endorsed, that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor for all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities. However, the Government has also agreed that the Minister for Finance may provide exemptions in the case of Statutory Marketing Authorities and Government Business Enterprises where special circumstances dictate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Government Companies Act</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">22. The Government proposes that the legislation currently being prepared to replace the Audit Act 1901 should include provisions requiring Parliament to be informed of any new or varied direct government involvement in companies, requiring government controlled companies to table annual reports and specifying the applicable auditing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">23. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator John Coates, and the Committee members are to be commended for undertaking this inquiry. The Committee raised a number of important accountability issues and the Government will implement the measures outlined in its detailed responses to the Committee's Report as soon as practicable. Where legislative changes are required these will be taken up in the drafting of the legislation to replace the existing Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">24. The Government will continue to pursue a policy of reform aimed at providing incentive, enhancing efficiency and improving public accountability by moving from unnecessary detailed controls, which detract from enterprise performance, to a focus which places greater emphasis on bottom-line performance. It should be stressed that this Government regards enhanced accountability to the Executive and to Parliament as the essential concomitant of devolution of responsibility and the removal of detailed controls. The proposals outlined are a positive demonstration of this Government's commitment to that greater accountability.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Response</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than establish a central register and add to the level of bureaucracy, the Government has decided that details of all companies and incorporated associations which the Government controls or in which it has significant influence will be reported to Parliament in the annual reports of departments of State.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Government Companies and their Reporting Requirements</EMPHASIS>, to which the Government has just responded, was tabled in November 1989. I am the only current member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration who was involved in the inquiry which produced it. The Committee considered its report on government companies to be an important one. I have previously expressed my disappointment at the length of time between the report and the response. It is outrageous that it has taken 2 1/2 years longer than it should have. In the interim, the headlong rush to create government companies and convert other entities into the company format has increased, and that is a development that I deeply regret.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, my disappointment is mitigated somewhat by the generally positive and constructive nature of the response. I accept that the Government's consideration of the recommendations in the report was complicated by the need to reconcile those recommendations with the rewriting of the Audit Act that has been under way for the last couple of years. I also acknowledge that a vast number of portfolios were involved; it was not a response that could be done within one portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that the Government's response meets many of the Committee's concerns. Potentially significant loopholes will be plugged. The Government will no longer operate through exempt proprietary companies which have minimal reporting requirements. The annual reports of all government companies will now be required to be tabled in Parliament. Further, audit committees will become a requirement for all government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that, I regret that there has clearly not been a pulling back from a commitment to the company road. Whereas the Committee had recommended that Parliament be involved in approving the formation of government companies, the Government response merely provides that the Parliament be informed of the formation of government companies. As far as I am concerned, that is an insufficient response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am pleased to see that the Government has generally adopted the Committee's recommendation that the Auditor-General be the sole external auditor for all Commonwealth owned or controlled entities, the Government has nevertheless agreed that the Minister for Finance may provide exemptions to that mandate. The Committee's position and my position is that there ought not be the possibility of such exemptions and that the use of the Auditor-General should be mandatory, although that ought not prevent the Auditor-General from being able to subcontract to other auditing organisations if need be; but that ultimate responsibility really ought to remain with the Auditor-General. It is an improvement, but it is not as good a response on that point as I would have hoped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying theme of the Committee's report was that much was misguided in what seemed in the late 1980s to be a rush to incorporate government bodies under the companies law. It was notable that no concrete evidence was presented to the Committee of any operational advantages provided by the company form as opposed to the option of a statutory authority. Some of us felt that we were observing a management fad rather than a reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee noted the benefits on the efficiency of GBEs, some of which are companies and some statutory authorities, on a variety of government reforms. We reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It can be questioned . . . whether the legal form of the entity plays a decisive, or even a significant, part in the achievement of these desirable objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was able to provide examples of statutory authorities operating with all the examples said to be available from the company form, and of government companies complaining of the disadvantages that some had said were exclusive to the statutory authority form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw all this as a sad example of a then common practice in which senior people within the public sector itself tended to decry public sector efficiency and to unthinkingly adopt private sector forms. The myth of private sector superiority has now gone the way of the 1980s entrepreneur, and the strengths of the Commonwealth public sector are more clearly appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures proposed in this response will ensure that government companies are fully accountable to their owners&mdash;the people of Australia. The accountability mechanisms specified do not differ in any major way from the regime which applies to statutory authorities. This must bring into question the rationale for any widespread move to company reform in the public sector. I remain of the view, which was adopted in the Committee's report, that strong criteria should be met before the Government adopts the company structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding, I wish to raise a consistent concern of the Committee over many years&mdash;the need for a central register of government bodies. The Committee itself maintains such a register, but does so with some difficulty and with all the disadvantages of attempting such a task from outside the Public Service. In rejecting yet again the Committee's recommendation for an official register of government bodies, the Government has announced that a list of government companies might soon become available as a spin-off of the Australian Securities Commission's computer system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this transpires&mdash;it will be better than nothing&mdash;we will have the odd situation of there being a central register of government companies but no equivalent for the numerous statutory authorities and non-statutory bodies. I simply register again the belief that I and others hold that a requirement to list these bodies in appendices to the annual reports of departments is not an efficient or effective way of maintaining control of the non-departmental sphere of administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend the efforts of members of the Committee which produced this report to which the Government has now responded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, I have very mixed feelings about this response. I welcome the commitment to greater accountability.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">on matters connected with such activities, to which, in the Parliamentary Committee's opinion, the Parliament's attention should be directed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>During the first of a regular series of public hearings with the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Tony Hartnell, in August 1992 there was an extensive discussion on the place of criminal investigations in the priorities of the ASC and the relationship between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the ASC. It became evident during that briefing that the ASC had strongly held views that the principal role of the ASC was as a commercial regulator. It was also evident that there had developed a fundamental conflict between the ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions about the relative emphasis to be given to regulatory and criminal investigatory functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee subsequently invited the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Michael Rozenes, to canvass the issues further before the Committee. As a result of Mr Rozenes's evidence, the problems of the ASC-DPP relationship were widely debated in the media. The dispute centred on whether the ASC was primarily a criminal enforcement agency or a commercial regulatory agency. The Chairman of the ASC felt that its main role was a commercial regulatory agency while the DPP felt that insufficient priority was given to the ASC's role as an investigator of criminal matters. The method used to determine which cases should be pursued for criminal prosecution, as opposed to civil action, and the working relationship between the two organisations were also discussed before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the disagreements which came to light during the Committee's hearing and the subsequent public debate, the Attorney-General, the Hon. Michael Duffy, decided to intervene. Earlier this week honourable senators will be aware that he issued directions to both the ASC and the DPP clearly outlining their responsibilities and setting down procedures to improve the working relationship between the two organisations. In its report the Committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASC must have an obligation to investigate matters which may involve serious criminality at least to the stage where an informed decision on whether or not to prepare a brief for the DPP can be made. The Committee considers that the demonstrated willingness of the ASC and the DPP to prosecute and seek punishment of corporate offenders is a major deterrent to criminal behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the existing prosecution policy of the Commonwealth could, with modifications, form the basis for guidelines to the two organisations on which to base decisions to investigate breaches of the law with a view to criminal prosecution or civil remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the present financial arrangements with regard to funding prosecution exacerbates the tensions between the two organisations and is, at the same time inefficient. The DPP should be provided with the resources to fund prosecutions. It should not be dependent on the referring agency.</PARA>
<PARA>In this case, that is the ASC. The Committee will not seek further hearings into the issues raised at this stage. It believes that it is important to give both organisations an opportunity to give effect to the Attorney-General's guidelines and to develop an effective working relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted here that the fundamental conflict of views giving rise to the difficulties between the ASC and the DPP are not unique to Australia. The Serious Fraud Office in the UK has also experienced considerable difficulty in preparing and prosecuting complex corporate crime cases such as the Blue Arrow and Guinness prosecutions and this has led to debate on how such matters should be handled, including, ironically, reference to our own method of dealing with things and the possibility that it could move in that direction, despite the fact that we are being critical of it at this stage. In the United States the reliance on racketeering legislation, which would be unacceptable in Australia, is an indication of the difficulties being faced there. However, the Committee will continue to monitor the work of the ASC and its relationship with the DPP and it will review the progress that has been made in resolving these problems at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of some regret that this dispute became so public and required the Minister's intervention. Despite their differing priorities, many of the matters at issue could have been resolved much earlier by the two organisations. It has to be said that much productive work is done in many other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is a positive side to this. A potential problem of corporate law enforcement has been identified, discussed in public and remedial action has been taken. This is in contrast with the situation of the ASC's predecessor, the National Companies and Securities Commission, under the cooperative scheme, whose structure did not facilitate such rapid and decisive action and whose activities were not monitored by the Parliament in the direct way that the ASC is now monitored by my Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Attorney-General gave his directions to the ASC and the DPP, there have been comments reported in the media criticising them for placing excessive emphasis on the investigation and prosecution of criminal matters. I consider the statements overlook the clear wishes of investors in the general public that corporate criminals be vigorously pursued and are in any case premature. The Attorney-General's directions must be given time to be acted upon before any such judgments can be made. The Committee will in any case monitor developments, as I have said, and advise the Parliament if it considers that there is a need for further action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities tabled today. As Senator Beahan, the Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee has said, the Committee has had an emerging role since its formation&mdash;about 12 months ago now&mdash;in overseeing the activities of the Australian Securities Commission specifically. That role, in the last few weeks, has been elevated by what had become a very public dispute, with the Committee having a regular hearing with Mr Hartnell, the Chairman of the ASC, followed by the response from the head of the DPP, Michael Rozenes, only a few weeks later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Beahan has said, that debate in some ways was regrettable. Those two gentlemen were not able to sort those matters out between themselves in the normal course of their day-to-day dealings. However, the Committee was told at its hearing in Melbourne that 95 per cent of the work that those two organisations do together does actually proceed successfully and there is trouble in about only 5 per cent of cases. I reiterate the importance of the Committee's role in overseeing the Australian Securities Commission and bringing to public attention this debate which we would all hope has acted as a catalyst for change and will make things better in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few short points I want to make. The crucial element which this report brings to public attention, and which the whole public debate brings to attention, is the conflicting objectives which seem to have emerged from the Australian Securities Commission and, indeed, from Chairman Tony Hartnell during the months prior to the formal establishment of the Australian Securities Commission and since 1 January 1991 when the Commission was formally established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will all remember that Mr Hartnell initially came out with a hit list of, I think, 16 top corporate breaches or alleged breaches which he intended to ensure were brought to justice. It is fair to say that 12 months ago one had the impression of Mr Hartnell as someone who was more of a prosecutor than a regulator. It would seem that in the past 12 months Mr Hartnell has changed his public visage somewhat. He put on the record to our Committee at its hearing in Melbourne that he sees the role of the Australian Securities Commission more as a regulator, trying to create a healthy environment for business and commerce in Australia. Somewhere between those two objectives there is the balance that all of us seek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us have reservations about an Australian Securities Commission that has as its core objective&mdash;to use Senator Crichton-Browne's words from yesterday or the day before&mdash;to nail business scalps to the wall, to nail corporate scalps from the 1980s excesses to the wall, and to be able to then judge the success of the Australian Securities Commission by the number of scalps that are nailed to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that to have successful prosecutions is not in itself some measure of success. If criminal activity, white collar crime, is going on within Australian corporations, it is the role of both the ASC and the DPP to work together to ensure that criminal activity does not take place. Those activities of a small handful of Australian businesses bring the activities of the majority&mdash;probably 99 per cent of Australian businesses&mdash;into disrepute and hurts our international reputation and discourages average Australians from investing their hard earned savings in Australian corporations&mdash;the sort of investment we need to get this country moving again. They are the conflicts that arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Beahan said during his contribution to the debate, a number of commentators have come out in the last 24 hours criticising the political intervention by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to resolve this dispute. I have grave reservations about that. I think all of us wanted to ensure the ASC and the DPP were independent bodies and that direct intervention by the Attorney-General and by the Attorney-General's Department would not need to take place. Again, the lack of focus, the lack of objective and the fight to use the limited resources available within the ASC and the DPP to achieve their objectives as organisations is an ongoing problem for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Mr Hartnell has said&mdash;I think in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that they will abide by the Attorney-General's wishes. But we then have the very real problem of diverting resources currently provided for the regulatory capacity away from that objective towards prosecution. We all know, particularly those of us who are members of the Committee, that investigating complex white collar crime is a very expensive business, a very time consuming business, where one has to go through thousands and thousands of pages of documents; chase the paper trail. That takes the resources of well qualified lawyers and accountants and other people and it can take years and years and thousands of man hours to achieve what sometimes can be an elusive result. That is the very problem that Mr Hartnell and his investigators have been faced with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told by Mr Rozenes during his evidence to our Committee that there has been some concern about the quality of briefs provided to the DPP from the Australian Securities Commission, but I reiterate in defence of the Australian Securities Commission that it was made quite clear that that is only in a small number of cases. Only yesterday, Mr Hartnell said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the ASC has brought 162 cases for prosecution to the DPP, so it is very hard to criticise that work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I have always been somewhat amused or bemused by the high profiles and the big egos. There was Mr Henry Bosch, with his keen interest in almost doing corporate trial by media; then Mr Hartnell's extremely high public profile and the announcement of his hit list 18 months to two years ago; and now there is this seeming clash of corporate regulatory and prosecuting egos which has taken place as a consequence of our Committee's hearings in Melbourne and a month ago in Canberra. If the egos of the two gentlemen concerned and the high public profiles that both of those people have assumed were taken down a few notches, then both of them could concentrate on the very serious work at hand and we would not have needed this extremely regrettable intervention by the Attorney-General, which reminded me somewhat of the father pulling two feuding sons in and having a chat and banging their heads together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with Senator Beahan, the Chairman of our Committee, in saying that our Committee will, of course, monitor the progress made, after the tabling of the Attorney-General's advice, in achieving the objectives of corporate regulation in Australia. It is fair to allow some time to see whether this works. I am sure our Committee will do what it has done so successfully over the last 12 months, that is, monitor, on an almost daily basis, the activities of the Australian Securities Commission and the DPP and ensure that the sort of battle we have witnessed over the past couple of months is resolved and does not happen again. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to speak to the National Health and Medical Research Council report of the 113th session held in Hobart in June 1992. In particular, I want to raise a point that I think is of great importance. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in South Australia last week&mdash;I am not sure of which day&mdash;included in its coverage a piece attacking the NHMRC and this Government's `cuts' to medical research in this year's Budget. I think it is very important that any such public broadcast at least start with its basic facts right. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> clearly suggested that there had been cuts to the allocation of funds to the NHMRC in this year's Budget. Indeed there were not. The money allocated in the 1992-93 Budget for project grants was $108.7m&mdash;up from $103.3m in 1991-92. That is an increase of $5.4m actually and, if you allow for a 3.9 per cent indexation increase, it was a $1.5m increase in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for any journalist to say in a report that there were cuts in the Budget when there was an actual increase, I think is very sloppy journalism at best and, indeed, very insufficient journalism. I think it is a disgrace. As well as the $1.5m real increase&mdash;that is, a $5.4m increase on the previous year&mdash;there was also the allocation of $5m over six years for research into mental health. All of this is in association with the $50m worth of capital grants to our large research institutions for medical research; that money coming through in the 1991 Budget and still being spent over five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a journalist to run a report saying that there were cuts in allocations for medical research in the Budget is very insufficient. Indeed, I think it is disgraceful. The medical research in this country is brilliant and its allocation of funding has been very dramatically increased over the life of this Government. In 1982-83, the allocation for national health and medical research was $30m; that is now $108.7. In real terms, that is an increase of 100 per cent over the life of this Government. In fact, in this Budget there has been a further allocation and a real increase. It is very important that we recognise the quality medical research done in this country, and the range of medical research done with project grants in our specialist medical research centres, as well as in our large hospitals. And the majority of that medical research in hospitals is done in the public hospital sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would urge journalists, particularly the journalist who was responsible for this piece of reporting in South Australia last year, to make sure that in future they check their basic facts. Of course some researchers will want to say that they have cuts because they have not been allocated an increase in their funding. That is not the same as saying there have been cuts for medical research in the Budget. Indeed, as I have said, there were not. It is important that I have the opportunity to correct that very, very misleading and mischievous commentary on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining to me, I would like to briefly turn to page 14 of this report where there is a reference to the subcommittee on the ethics of the allocation of health resources. That subcommittee is being chaired by Robyn Layton and it is actually picking up on the references that came out of the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance, which I chaired. We recommended that, amongst other things, there will have to be an ongoing, rigorous and extensive public debate about how much health costs people in this community. That debate is beginning to be formed. We asked that the NHMRC ethics subcommittee do that. It is in the process of getting established so that the debate can be taken into the community. So I believe that this is a very useful report for two reasons: one, it allows me to correct the error from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> and, two, it allows me to acknowledge the continuing work done as a result of one of the recommendations of that Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report from the National Board of Employment, Education and Training is yet another example of this Government's policy failure with regard to education in Australia. In this case, the ideas presented to the Government for improving the quality of teaching in Australia are again a case of a centralist government creating extra paperwork and more bureaucracy rather than effecting change at the classroom level where it will actually make a difference. The specific issues raised in the NBEET report are the establishment of a national professional body for teachers, the development of a systematic appraisal system for teachers and the establishment of an education industry training fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of a national professional body for teachers is an interesting concept; but what is it meant to achieve? Surely what will actually develop is a national body for teachers that duplicates what the State organisations can effectively achieve anyway. It is unlikely that the quality of teaching will be the primary concern if this duplication occurs. This proposed national body would merely become involved in industrial matters, rather than focusing on the improved standards of teaching in Australia. It is proposed that this national body would develop standards of behaviour and standards of teaching, but on what basis will this be done? This is not detailed in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the body would be giving advice on initial and continuing teacher education, but the report neglects to tell us where the money for the implementation of such a program is coming from. The report then goes on to point out that it would be a good idea to develop a systematic appraisal system for teachers which embodied a range a principles. These principles embody quality assurance, professional development, an integrated career structure and the idea that it be based on the teacher's work. Again, these are generally accepted principles, but they come very close to stating the obvious. The report completely neglects, however, to explain the mechanism by which these principles would be put into place or have any effect on the quality of teaching in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to recommend the establishment of an education industry training fund, but it does not indicate the source of these funds. NBEET offers no suggestions as to the level at which the fund should be maintained or on what the contribution of the State governments, the Federal Government or any other body should be. The final line of the report by NBEET states that, overall, teachers should `increase investment of their own time in professional development'. This could well be regarded as the most realistic comment in the report. With the Government's neglecting this issue and NBEET's stating nice platitudes in reports such as this, it is obvious that nothing substantial is actually planned by this Government for improving the quality of teaching in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, on what basis can the Government assure quality? Under this scheme, it seems that this will be left to teachers and it will have very little support from government. This attitude by this Government stands in vivid contrast to the innovative policies outlined by the coalition in its Fightback reform program. Under the coalition, a special program will be funded to promote Australian best practice in professional development initiatives. These will be based on existing excellent professional development programs. Funds will also be provided under our quality of teaching program. Government and private agencies will be invited to tender for the development and production of professional development materials and for professional development programs. There is a particular call for such an initiative in areas where significant change has occurred, such as the teaching areas of technology, mathematics and science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles outlined in this report are fine, but it is its failure to produce anything practical or constructive that is its downfall.

<PARA>In speaking to Industry Commission report No. 24 on the Australian Horticultural Corporation, I wish to comment on some horticulture activities in Australia. In Australia, as in most other countries, the diversity of the horticulture industry distinguishes it from most other agriculture industries. Hundreds of products grown in Australia are generally classified as horticultural products. But there are no hard and fast rules as to what constitutes a horticultural product. Production occurs under a wide range of climates from tropical to cool-temperate. This seems to me to be a very comprehensive report on horticulture in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report states that major production differences exist between product groups. For instance, most fruit and nuts are perennial crops with long production lead times, while many vegetable crops have short production cycles and require regular rotation to maintain yields. For some products the geographic dispersion and seasonal variation of production mean that different regions have dissimilar marketing requirements. For example, citrus growers in Queensland operate in different markets and at different times of the year from citrus growers in other States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A table on page 6 of the report under the heading `Australian production of major fruits and vegetables, 1980 and 1990, kilotonnes' lists vegetables, bananas, potatoes, apricots, pineapples, citrus, pears, grapes, apples and peaches. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the volumes of some products such as apples, pears and grapes increased marginally during the 1980s, the production of several newer commercial crops such as macadamia nuts, avocados and mangoes increased significantly. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I was interested in that comment because at home on our property at Kingaroy we are growing avocados and mangoes. The mangoes from far north Queensland can be harvested a lot earlier than our mangoes. We grow the Bowen special type&mdash;I can recommend them, Madam Acting Deputy President, even though they do not come in at the same time as those from north Queensland. Because of this difference, people can buy mangoes over a wide time span. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in our local Kingaroy area, quite a number of farms out Kumbia way which used to grow just peanuts or corn during the off season are now are growing lovely fruits such as peaches.

We know what has happened to the sale of wheat at the present time. This is a real problem. A farmer near us at Kingaroy has the most beautiful crop of wheat. It really is lovely.

<PARA>Intrastate aviation services form an integral part of Australia's transport network. In many regions they supplement services provided by road, rail and, in some instances, coastal shipping. However, in some remote areas, intrastate air services provide the only practicable means of transporting inhabitants, tourists, food, medical supplies and other goods. Similarly, general aviation operators provide services, such as crop dusting and medical services, on which many rural communities are heavily reliant. As this report says on page one of the overview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given their important role in Australia's transport system, it is imperative that intrastate aviation services are provided efficiently. If they are not, segments of the community may be disadvantaged and the overall performance of the economy impaired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few comments in the few minutes I have today to speak on the disadvantages that are currently being faced by those in remote and rural areas because of the lack of services. In my own State of Queensland, where the majority of the population lives outside the capital city, it is essential to have an efficient and frequent air system to cover those vast tracts of land. Indeed, it is essential in order to provide a reasonable service to those living outside the major centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In two weeks time I intend to travel in far northern and western Queensland. It is a logistical nightmare to try to travel to and from each of the centres. The problem is that if an air service exists in some of these remote towns it operates only once a week. In essence, this means that if one were living there one would have to stay away for a week and pay the high costs of motel bills. Otherwise, the only alternative is to travel by road. Yet, these centres provide some of the highest earnings for Australia in export income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People living in these areas are being disadvantaged as airlines either close down or cancel flights on those routes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further penalties are placed on those in remote areas when if they do need to fly because of pressures of time, in many cases they have to charter a plane.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that in the current economic climate very few can afford to own and maintain light aircraft.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some consideration should also be given to the fact that people in the western and northern areas of Australia provide the income which supports many who live in the cities.

Sometimes the Government seems to forget that there are people who live and work in the far parts of our vast country. This report by the Industry Commission on intrastate aviation, dated 17 July of this year, on the first page of its overview states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Commission's view, the intrastate aviation sector is currently not performing to its full potential. Its present performance and future development is being hampered by a number of factors which are subject to the control of governments in Australia. The most significant of these is the economic regulation which continues to apply to intrastate airline operations in a number of states.</PARA>
<PARA>Hazelton Airlines was mentioned in the chamber today by Senator Collins when he tabled an aviation paper. Hazelton, I believe, is the most pure privately owned airline in Australia. Max Hazelton runs the company and does a fantastic job. The airline gives good service wherever it goes. In his submission to the inquiry he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dice are effectively loaded against regional airline operators in New South Wales, particularly those who remain independent.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that this was because of the high concentration of ownership that is already evident in the aviation industry, with the Ansett group and Australia Airlines dominating interstate markets and controlling over 80 per cent of the intrastate market. That is a problem Australia has. The big are getting bigger, and the small are unable to compete in a fair and equitable way. Senator Collins should take a little more notice of that instead of trying to make cheap political points as he did in Question Time. The report also mentions that Hazelton has stated that true and open competition cannot be attained because of the marketing and distribution power held by the two major airlines, Ansett and Australian. We should all remember that. Ansett and Australian hold an unfair advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that has concerned me for a long time involves submissions by Hazelton Airlines and other commuter airlines in my State about the peak and shoulder surcharges that apply at Kingsford Smith Airport. This report said that those charges should be reviewed by an independent body. The problem has been caused by the peak charging coming on and the shoulders becoming just as congested. Those factors are increasing the costs for the operators of the commuter airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that those commuter airlines face costs while in the circling pattern. I have had representations from commuter operators. One of them said that 18 per cent of all ticket costs at the moment are derived from government charges, including the CAA, the FAC, the ALOP and peak hour charges. That is another aspect that should be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hazelton Airlines told me that peak hour charges are costing them $600,000 per annum. If that is a fair charge to a commuter airline, I believe the Minister should look very closely at ensuring that the third runway is built pretty quickly in Sydney so we do not have all the problems with peak charging and so on. </PARA>

It must be remembered that 80 per cent of all tickets sold are business tickets, and business ticket holders will have the GST refunded. The other 20 per cent of ticket holders who do not have business tickets will definitely be better off anyway under our Fightback proposal, so they will be able to afford to fly anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is report No. 61 from the Law Reform Commission and it relates to administrative penalties in customs and excise. It is a particularly pertinent report in that it relates to matters that are being raised generally in the Estimates committees, but also in the Midford Paramount hearing dealing with the way Customs pursued matters where there are penalties and indeed settled them. It is also relevant to many of the complaints that are outlined by Mr John Richardson who has tabled a report, or had the President table a report in the Senate, and which could subsequently be the question of a privilege inquiry. Mr Richardson made some very substantial complaints about the way in which Customs prosecuted particular cases before the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters all related to the question of the strict liability system that was implemented for Customs whereby if any error was made in dealing with forms filled out by an agent, there was an automatic penalty. That penalty was set at a rate determined by the record of the agent completing the documentation dealing with the importation of goods. But Customs developed a practice of also taking into account penalties that existed against the importer himself or the firm of the agent concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a period of time Customs attempted to tell us that it had ceased that practice. But on further questioning it was discovered that cessation had only occurred where one of the parties&mdash;that is, either the agent or the importer or the agent's firm&mdash;was prepared to wear the responsibility for having made the error. If nobody was prepared to wear the error, then indeed the same old practice was pursued, and on many an occasion these matters would end up before the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to point out that the Australian Law Reform Commission analysed this strict liability situation. It has made many recommendations, but two of them are particularly important and ought to be noted. One is that the Commission recommends that a person who has paid an administrative penalty should not be able to be prosecuted for an offence based on the same facts. That is a very interesting recommendation. It goes on to say that if a person is prosecuted for an offence after he or she has made a submission to Customs in response to a pre-penalty notice, the submission should be privileged. Customs should not be able to use them as admissions in criminal proceedings against the importer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to some of the recommendations, I believe that the strict liability system is not in the interests of having a just system. The principle, however, about prosecution and an administrative penalty should apply not only in the area of Customs law but also in taxation law. On another occasion I will seek the opportunity to draw those parallels. We have seen instances where a penalty has been paid, the Taxation Commissioner has chosen to return the money paid and proceed with criminal proceedings, and indeed to query whether he has used admissions which ought to be privileged as part of his evidence. So the case that is made here in this report is applicable just as much in the taxation area and is an important parallel. </PARA>

<PARA>In the application for funds from the Advance to the Minister for Finance pending passage of Appropriation Bill No. 1, the claims on hand pursuant to the in-principle agreement for reform of the waterfront is $7,666,103. The explanation of the requirement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following its endorsement of the In-Principle Agreement (IPA) for Reform of the Waterfront, the Government agreed to provide $145 million under the waterfront reform program for retirement and redundancy payments to stevedoring employees. The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) is the vehicle through which these funds are distributed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced in December 1991 that an additional $20 million would be provided on a dollar-for-dollar basis with the stevedoring industry towards the cost of around 410 additional early retirement/redundancy packages under the terms of the IPA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the agreement. The thing that is interesting about this scheme, of course, is that the Government has gone about as far as it can go. The redundancy packages, which it has created, have not made our waterfront anywhere near world's best practice. They have not made our waterfront anywhere near as good as the reforms which have been implemented in New Zealand and have in fact made that country's waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, quite clearly, as the Government is the political wing of the trade union movement, it is not unreasonable for us to anticipate that the Government will never be able to fully solve the problems of the waterfront. Indeed, the Government is simply spending taxpayers' money to pay people off when it should be tackling the problem from a far different perspective: look at the New Zealand model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One interesting piece of anecdotal evidence that comes to pass, I might say too, is that we seem to have examples where a father may be paid off with a golden handshake only for the son or another relative to come and take the job.

<PARA>I wish to comment briefly on the AIDC report. There will be a greater opportunity for comment during debate on the Bill dealing with the question of lengthening the life of the guarantee for the AIDC. We had the AIDC appear before the Estimates Committee because, quite simply, the effect of the guarantee of the Corporation is to give an open-ended appropriation to the AIDC. It was interesting that a report was made to the stock exchange concerning the loss that AIDC Limited, the trading arm of AIDC, had made of some $99m. This was on top of the loss that it made last year, having been reported at $8.8m. However, the truth of the matter is that last year it made a trading loss of $32m but was allowed to treat its tax losses as an asset because, in the judgment of the Auditor-General, it was reasonable to expect that within three years a profit would be made and, therefore, one could treat the tax losses as an asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, specifically in this year's report, the Auditor-General has said that the AIDC may not treat the $99m loss as an asset because he does not foresee that those losses can be reasonably used up. He has, however, allowed it to carry forward a sum now of $47m which is transposed to a figure of $53m in the report, the explanation of which I understand is due to a tax ruling on swaps. But the anticipation that the AIDC can trade its way out of its difficulty remains in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is signed off by the Auditor-General on 4 September. My complaint about the report is that at the Estimates Committee hearing on 22 September, I believe it was, we were told that the accounts were not ready and, therefore, we could not have them for the purpose of that hearing. Quite clearly, it was within the competence of the AIDC to let us have this document so that we could have questioned Mr Gurry, the Chairman, at that time about that report. I find that behaviour totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I find utterly amazing is that in the Budget it was announced that the Government intended to sell another 30 per cent of the AIDC to take the Government holding down to 51 per cent, yet three weeks after the Budget Senator Button had to announce that that sale would not take place. The reason was very simple: in the interim the $99m loss was announced and, quite frankly, the shares were and are unsaleable. How is it that the Minister allowed a recommendation to go through for the Budget Papers that AIDC was saleable when somebody ought to have known&mdash;and the Minister ought to have known&mdash;that in fact it was making a $99m loss? To say that things were sloppy would be the understatement of the year. I think there are many more questions that need to be asked about the AIDC. </PARA>

<PARA>Some time ago I moved that the Senate be furnished with an Australian flag in a manner which is in keeping with the proportions and architecture of the chamber. That would give a permanent and outward sign of allegiance which we all owe to the nation of Australia, show our respect for the commitment Australian men and women have demonstrated to the Australian flag throughout the history of Australia both in times of peace and war, and be a unifying symbol for our sports people in the international area. That would demonstrate that the Senate is proud to display the Australian flag and I ask that the flag be installed within three weeks of the passing of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very proud to move this motion. I believe we are elected representatives of the community, the same as the members in the House of Representatives. Over in their chamber they have two Australian flags prominently displayed, but in the Senate we have never been able to proudly say that the Australian flag has flown in this chamber. The flag flies over the joint Houses of Parliament, and as it is seen in the House of Representatives, I believe it would complete the position if it were also displayed here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no better manifestation of the Australian people displaying their support for the flag than we saw at the opening of the Vietnam war memorial last weekend. We saw it on television and many people were fortunate enough to be present at the opening of the memorial when some 20,000 or 30,000 veterans visited Canberra to attend the opening. We saw a proud display of the Australian flag. In fact, Australian flags were flown representing the 504 veterans who made the supreme sacrifice and did not return to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be of very great benefit to have that flag in here to represent the strong feelings out in the community in support of the flag. I do not know which way the Labor Party will vote on this motion. I hope they will support it. I know that the Democrats have indicated that they will support it. It is part of the Labor Party's logo at election time. Members of the Labor Party stand behind it as they did in Victoria last Saturday, but not with particularly good results. They are very proud to stand behind it in times of election. It is now up to them to make up their minds because they have been equivocating as to whether they do or do not want the flag. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) certainly does not want the flag, but the hard men of the Labor Party, that is, Senator Loosley, Senator Ray and Senator Richardson, have advised the Prime Minister that he is on a losing tack by implying that he is not in support of the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flag has always had the support of the Australian people. Its birth is inseparable from the birth of our independent nation. The flag illustrates the symbol of our full nationhood. The design of the flag was not imposed from above. It arose from a public design competition in 1901 to coincide with Federation. Up until the last couple of months it has always had bipartisan acceptance by all political parties. In 1947 Prime Minister Chifley announced the Australian flag was to be flown freely and with appropriate respect. In 1953 there was bipartisan agreement between Prime Minister Menzies and the Opposition Leader, Mr Calwell, for the Flag Act whereby the Australian flag was definitely proclaimed as the national flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the Prime Minister criticise that flag over the past three or four months, although I must admit that in the last month or so there has been a deafening silence. The flag had never been officially criticised or derided until the Prime Minister made what I would term as his hysterical assault on the flag from April to June of this year. The Prime Minister chose very inappropriate times to criticise our national flag. On a visit to Indonesia on 22 April, in front of President Suharto&mdash;who I assume would have been embarrassed&mdash;and other Indonesian dignitaries, the Prime Minister made a speech that virtually said that Australia must change its flag. I believe that was an act of total disloyalty to Australia when he was visiting another nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 April on a visit to Papua New Guinea he commented to patriotic, loyal and courteous flag waving school children that we had to change our flag and he would get them a new one soon. I find it very embarrassing that a Prime Minister could make those statements to children who came out to welcome him waving the national flag. At the launch of the Sydney Olympic bid in front of Olympians he again chose to criticise the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last we heard from Mr Keating was in June when he said he was going to make a Cabinet submission on ways to change the flag. That is when the factional leaders stepped in and said that he was causing the Labor Party to lose votes. That is very true. It does not matter whether people are traditional Labor or Democrat voters&mdash;and certainly among traditional National Party voters there is overwhelming support for the Australian flag, which I think would carry through to the Liberal Party voters&mdash;support for the Australian flag extends right across the whole party system. Now it is time for the Labor Party to decide whether it wants the flag or does not want it. This motion that I have put before the Senate is symbolic, because it gives the opportunity for the Labor Party and the Government to make up their minds. They have to make a decision whether they will support the flag or vote against it. If they vote against it, that is a signal to the whole of Australia that they are against the Australian flag. I say to them that the time for decision is now. The Government has procrastinated and equivocated for six months. Some members of the Labor Party have pushed their republican cause, but today is the moment of truth and a decision has to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australians, we should be proud to stand by our flag as a symbol of our nation. That pride should be manifested in the displaying of the Australian flag in this chamber. This chamber must be one of the very few, if not the only chamber, of any parliament in the world that does not display its national symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been told that the Australian flag has not been in the Senate for 92 years. The Senate chamber of the old Parliament House had the State flags proudly displayed on the front wall&mdash;or the back wall depending on how one looks at it.

As senators who represent the States and as senators who represent the Australian people, it is time we made a decision as to whether we want and are proud enough to display the Australian flag in the chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only reflect on some of the debates which have gone on in this chamber in recent times in relation to the very large number of unemployed and the degree of inequity which is increasing in the Australian community as a direct consequence of abstract economic models being imposed on this country by the Government and the model which would be imposed by the Opposition. I would say that that is very much un-Australian. It certainly bears on several answers we had in Question Time today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamental to being an Australian is the fair go and a reasonable degree of equity in society. As we have seen from the report of the Catholic Bishops and from many other sources, since 1983 the degree of inequity, the degree of poverty and the degree of concentration of wealth in this country has increased very substantially. That is not being Australian and that, in our view, is far more important than whether a flag is displayed in this chamber or not. The substance is more important than the symbols. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concept of protecting in Australia what is uniquely Australian was also discussed in relation to the environment. Senator Campbell later on that day argued for mining in national parks and specifically for mining in the Marandoo National Park where there is a threatened species. It calls into question what it means to be Australian. To be Australian, surely, means protecting those things which are unique to this country. This includes the landscape and those species which have been absolutely decimated since European settlement. It raises also the issue that the Federal Government for years has promised legislation on threatened species. Even as we speak, the Government is attempting to water down that legislation so that we see either no legislation at all or, if we do see it, very weak legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original Australians in this land deserve a great deal more attention than they have been accorded. For years they were treated as a despised race. They were decimated, they were herded off their land, and they were treated with abysmal disregard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I imagined that somebody from the Opposition would have supported Senator Tierney's Bill. I rise to support the Australian National University Amendment (Autonomy) Bill. I see it as a very important piece of legislation not only from the point of view of what the Bill seeks to do, but also because of the symbolic significance of it. I suppose in that sense it is a little like the motion we have just been debating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will amend the Australian National University Act 1991 to ensure that the responsibility for the application of funds appropriated by the Parliament to the Australian National University rests with the University Council. In other words, it is aimed at preserving the autonomy of the university and, by extension, the autonomy of universities and tertiary educational institutions in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill seeks to amend section 42 of the principal Act, the section dealing with finances of the university, to regulate the Minister's powers in relation to money payable to the university. Currently, subsections 42(2) and 42(3) allow the Minister&mdash;this is an important point&mdash;to determine the amounts and the times at which money allocated by the Parliament to the university is to be paid to the university. In other words, the Minister has usurped that right and in so doing has undermined the autonomy of the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two new subsections (4) and (5) therefore prohibit the Minister from divesting control of the university funds to external bodies. In effect, the amendments reinforce the powers of council in section 9 which proclaims that the council has `entire control and management of the university'. That is a very important principle and one which in various ways and various guises has been consistently undermined by this Government over all the years that it has been in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a measure designed to safeguard the autonomy of the Australian National University and its prestigious John Curtin School of Medical Research in light of the decision by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, the Hon. Peter Baldwin, to transfer its funding from DEET to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. This decision sparked a national debate over institutional autonomy&mdash;and so it should&mdash;prompting a Senate standing committee inquiry into the Minister's role and the perceived threat to the ANU's autonomy. As I argued in an earlier debate in this place, and as I argued just a moment ago, it also threatened the autonomy of tertiary institutions generally around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April, the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training tabled its long awaited report on the JCSMR. My opinion and that of the Democrats in this matter is reflected in the minority report. I do not believe the Minister overstepped his brief, but I do not support the funding transfer on the grounds that there has been no demonstrable benefit to the school and, as the report states, it did constitute `a threat to the autonomy of the school'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry investigated the sensitive matter of ministerial interference in the administration of the university and the freedom of universities to exercise control over institutional funding allocations. We maintain that, in the case of the JCSMR, funding allocation should return to DEET and the directors of the research school. The Minister's Department still faces confusion as to how the new funding arrangements will operate. However, this debate is not simply about the funding transfer but goes to the very heart of government interference in education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National University Amendment (Autonomy) Bill 1992 seeks to avert any such threat in the future and to protect the freedom of higher education institutions to determine their own research and teaching priorities, and that is a very important principle which should be jealously guarded. It gives an assurance to the Australian National University and to other universities that their autonomy will be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support the training and funding arrangements. However, an acceptance of the need for centralised funding arrangements does not condone government interference or threats that are tantamount to blackmail and an attempt to redirect by government fiat research and teaching in our universities. Similarly, the Democrats support the process of institutional profiles to ensure that institutions meet access and equity criteria. So we have no problem with those general conditions being imposed on universities. The overwhelming majority of higher education institutions have demonstrated a willingness to participate in this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue of autonomy is indeed a very potent one. This year there has been an ongoing debate on this issue, especially surrounding the controversial relationship between vice-chancellors and the Government. This stems from what one vice-chancellor has described as `the seamless drift from accountability to control'. I might just add that it is my view that, with the amalgamation of universities which has been going on apace over many years now, the vice-chancellors were far too compliant in that process and should have raised their concerns much earlier and simply not laid back and allowed the Government to get as far as it did before it attempted to proceed with this particular quite iniquitous intrusion into the Australian National University.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a prevalent notion that, with the Dawkins led reforms of the higher education system&mdash;the abolition of the distinction between CAEs and universities&mdash;new measures of accountability have been introduced that encroach upon the universities' traditional freedom. That institutions should be pressured over funding levels as well as the manner of that funding is quite unacceptable. While I would strongly defend the freedom of the universities, as I have been doing, nonetheless that does impose a responsibility on the universities to reflect on the direction of society&mdash;to hold, as it were, a mirror up to society&mdash;to play a very critical role in relation to government and other activities in society in general; to help society make different decisions about different directions; and to open up different options for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one needs only look at recent criticisms of the economic rationalist model being pursued by Government and Opposition by people such as Professor Russell Mathews or various other authors to see that government would have found this criticism unpalatable. In that one can find reasons why governments would want to control the universities. The function of the universities in being critical of government and critical of other activities in the community is an absolutely essential activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner I was speaking on the Australian National University Amendment (Autonomy) Bill 1992 introduced by Senator Tierney. I made the point that this Bill addresses a very significant attack by the Government on our universities, not least through the attempt to control the funding for the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the ANU but also, in a more insidious way, in terms of the threat that it held for tertiary institutions more generally. I then made the point that universities, through their independence, had a very important role to play in our society by holding a mirror up to society. After all, they contain some of the more intelligent and better educated members of our community. They therefore have a very strong responsibility to be critical of governments and institutions and of the direction in which society is going, and also to hold out before society the alternatives that lie before it so that they can help to guide a more intelligent and more rational direction for society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not argue for a moment that the universities have always played that role. They certainly have not. However, to restrict their freedom to play that role and to try to tie them down to what the Government in its narrow vision conceives as a single vision future for the country is simply to deny them the ability to ever play that very productive and creative role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can already see the failure of the Government's proposal, not only in relation to the universities but also in relation to the CSIRO, in a number of very important respects. I remember asking Senator Button a question in relation to how much time CSIRO scientists spent making applications for funding, given the fact that the Government had imposed on it a requirement to get 30 per cent of its funding from private sources. Senator Button replied that they spent 20 to 25 per cent of their time applying for grants from private sources and then responding to the grant givers by way of reports. I remind the Senate that these people are highly competent scientists who should be spending that 20 to 25 per cent of their time on research work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a more sinister fashion, Senator Button in his reply went on to explain that he thought that this was a very good thing because&mdash;and I quote his very words&mdash;`this close association also helps to set the agenda for the research scientists'. That pressure for close liaison between research and immediate profit&mdash;something to which Senator Tierney drew our attention in his second reading speech&mdash;and away from the greater value of the long term research work which only these high powered research institutions can do, is extremely dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of CSIRO, one can point to many specific areas in which high quality research work has been impeded by the emphasis on that requirement. I cite, for instance, the attempt through genetic engineering to put the chitinase enzyme into sheep so that they would become totally resistant to blowfly strike. That work was being funded through government sources and it was totally halted for a period of four or five months once that requirement came in. That was because, quite clearly, private interests, particularly those that make chemicals for the treatment of blowfly strike in sheep, do not have an interest in that sort of work and it really undercuts their profitability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More directly in the area of universities, one could point to the work of Professor Derek Rowley from the University of Adelaide on a highly effective cholera vaccine which he could produce for as little as between 4c and 10c per shot. But no commercial interests are interested in cholera vaccine at 4c to 10c per shot for Third World countries. He was told by the commercial interests that, if he could make it available for people in First World countries who were going into cholera prone areas and sell it for $20 per shot, he might be in business. That very important research work, which went on over about 25 years, is now languishing despite many millions of dollars having been spent on this development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that close linking between research and private sources for funding is often inimical to the very research that we should be attempting to carry out. That is another reason why this particular proposal by the Government should be resisted and why we support Senator Tierney's Bill.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The insistence in the White Paper that university governing bodies be modelled on boards of large public companies has also resulted in considerable tension between the Government and university administrations. The concept of autonomy can, of course, be all things to all people. The freedom to determine research and teaching initiatives, however, is absolutely fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, freedom for research does not mean licence. With freedom comes rights and responsibilities, and I stress again that it is important that our universities demonstrate their commitment to the achievement of the highest academic standards, as well as equity of access, and also to intrude where they think it is appropriate into the workings of society to exercise their greater skills, knowledge and access to alternative views for the greater benefit of society at large. They should not simply wall themselves up in ivory towers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The freedom which universities experience, of course, does not extend to allowing institutions to charge fees or to discriminate against different groups in the community on unlawful grounds, a point which I mentioned briefly earlier. So clearly there is a general responsibility to observe those requirements, but they should not intrude into the general question of academic freedom.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in these respects the concepts of the traditional university autonomy and of university accountability are not incompatible. The internal funding allocations must remain free of external interference, and this includes not only pressures from government departments and their Ministers but also the pressures of industry and business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the coalition, however, we find that it too, in a rather different way, would intrude into the freedom of the universities through its insistence that the marketplace be the dominating force there. If that comes to dominate our academic institutions, again, we will miss out on the high quality academic and intellectual research work which universities should carry out. So I sound that note of warning. So, while we are supporting the Opposition in relation to this particular Bill, we do not want it to be interpreted as generally supporting the policies outlined in Fightback&mdash;far from it; we believe that there are very considerable dangers in going down that path as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we take the view that universities must be free and unfettered in terms of the research work they take on. They must be free to teach, to criticise and to fully exercise the intellectual and academic activities traditionally associated with a university, and that carries with it the responsibility to do that at the highest possible standard and, through that, among other things, to be critical of all aspects of the society in which they operate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think another Government senator has spoken in the debate so I will put the Government view on the record. So far in the debate we have heard quite a lot of carping about the John Curtin School of Medical Research. It has been said time and again in debates in the Senate that the ANU retains ultimate control of the administration of the John Curtin School. As the Senate knows, we have spent lengthy periods debating this in this chamber. Funds for the purpose of the John Curtin School have not been transferred to the National Health and Medical Research School, as originally was proposed by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) but rather to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to get our facts straight here. This was done after lengthy consultation with the ANU and with the agreement by both the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). The new arrangements for the John Curtin School of the Australian National University implemented by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services do not threaten the integrity nor the autonomy of the university. The ANU does retain ultimate control of the John Curtin School. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the risk of boring the Senate again, I will outline the facts which led to the Minister's decision. Minister Baldwin announced on 27 March 1991 new arrangements for the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU, including the Government's response to the report of the committee to review the Institute of Advanced Studies, the Stephen Committee. The Stephen Committee comprised members of outstanding scholarly reputation, including international representation, and was chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen. The review was requested by the ANU and the membership of the Committee was agreed to and by the university. I repeat: the university wanted the review and agreed to the composition and membership of the review committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Baldwin's March 1991 statement announced the Government's acceptance of the Stephen Committee's recommendation that responsibility for funding of the John Curtin School should be transferred to the NHMRC. The Stephen Committee report, while acknowledging that there were areas of considerable research strengths for the JCSMR, made some emphatic recommendations in relation to the John Curtin School which were not present in other schools or centres of the IAS. These problems were of long standing and were well documented in, for example, the reports of the reviews of the school in 1987-88 and 1988-89. They included problems of strategic planning, lack of evident leadership, poor public perception and low morale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Stephen Committee report found that whatever the causes of the problems, complex as they were, the status of the school was unacceptable. I will not read out the boring sections of the report because the people who have spoken in this debate would know them very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher Education Funding for the 1992-94 Triennium</EMPHASIS>, Minister Baldwin announced that $16.1m would be transferred from the Department of Employment, Education and Training to the Health, Housing and Community Services portfolio for the funding of John Curtin School. Administrative arrangements for funding of the ANU through the Department have been worked out between the ANU and the school. An agreement was signed between the ANU and Health, Housing and Community Services on 12 May 1992. This agreement includes the establishment of a liaison committee to oversee the implementation of the agreements between the university and the Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement also provides for quintennial reviews of the school, which will be coordinated with the reviews of other research schools. Such reviews will provide the John Curtin School with the opportunity to confirm its standing in the research community. The Government believes that there is merit in the argument that there is some advantage for the school being linked, through association with HHCS, to the mainstream Australian health and bio-medical research networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate for the Senate's benefit that the John Curtin School remains a part of the ANU. The new arrangements threaten neither the integrity nor the autonomy of the university. If the Government had not acted on the recommendations of the Stephen Committee, the Opposition would be criticising us here tonight for not taking seriously the very recommendations of the Stephen Committee. Any responsible government could not disregard those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney's proposal would have the ANU with absolute autonomy over the use of public funds. Would he have a university system with autonomy and no public accountability? What this Government has put in place is a well balanced system of accountability and autonomy which have been recognised by the system itself. Senator Tierney's proposal would render illegal the very profile system which this Government has established to balance autonomy with accountability&mdash;a system which the university system itself approves of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee&mdash;if you like, the universities' lobby group&mdash;has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AVCC believes that the profiles and present data collection arrangements provide an excellent accountability mechanism and enable the Government to be reassured about both educational quality and the efficient and effective operation of the institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>To separate the ANU in the manner proposed by Senator Tierney would really put the ANU at odds with the rest of the system. Governments do not control higher education institutions. They are autonomous, self-governing and self-regulating organisations. This Government has recognised and strengthened this position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services' statement on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher Education: Quality and Diversity in the 1990s</EMPHASIS> recognised this and has built in measures which give the system even further autonomy over its operations. This is evident in the Government's commitment to triennial funding, the recently announced roll in of capital funds into the operating grant and the proposed quality measures which will see the universities themselves ensuring the continued high quality of the higher education they provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's approach is sensible, balanced and pragmatic. It recognises all the different influences on the system&mdash;that is, academic freedom and institutional autonomy, student interest in quality, and national interest in increasing participation and relevance in teaching and research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policies endanger the autonomy of higher education institutions. The Opposition's proposed system of fees and vouchers will have the very effect that it accuses the Government of. Of course, the Opposition has still given us no details of how its fees and voucher system would work; what the value of the vouchers will be; how it will ensure that these vouchers are not used for the very attractive courses which lead to lucrative career paths; how the smaller institutions will remain viable; and how the Australian higher education system will function under its policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not moved by the reasons put forward by Senator Coulter and Senator Tierney.

I do not think we should go into that at this stage of the debate. In a number of other debates in this chamber I have made comments on how Fightback will affect education.

But I will leave that for another time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remark made by Senator Ray that I found most disturbing was that which indicated his attitude to private members' Bills. Senator Ray, just towards the end of his speech, said that this private member's Bill `will sit on the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for a long time'. I think it is a great pity that a Minister of the Government has that attitude to private members' Bills. I believe that in this place they are a real opportunity to bring matters of great concern to the community before the Government&mdash;and I assure the Minister that the community is extremely concerned about what this Government is trying to do to the Australian National University by removing control of the John Curtin School of Medical Research from the ANU and, flowing from that, the implications for the autonomy of other universities. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Coulter for his remarks in support of this Bill. I just want to outline to the Senate the nature and purpose of this Bill. The only effect of the Bill is to ensure that the Council of the Australian National University is solely responsible for the allocation of money appropriated by the Parliament for the purposes of administering the University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National University was established under its own Act of parliament. The Act specifically states that within the university there shall be a research school of medical science, and that school shall be known as the John Curtin School of Medical Research. It is therefore indisputable that the JCSMR is an integral part of the university. This was clearly the intention of the founders of the university and that is why such a specific provision is contained in the Act to establish the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, Mr Baldwin, has taken it upon himself to overrule these intentions and to circumvent the will of the Parliament by deciding to sever funding control from the ANU Council and, instead, to give it to a government department, namely, the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. This is clearly an invasion of the autonomy of the Australian National University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in Senator Ray's comments on autonomy. How he can actually reconcile the taking of a section of the university and putting it under the control of a government department that is not related to the Department of Employment, Education and Training and then claim that that is not breaching autonomy I think defies logic. The Minister's action in breaching the autonomy of the ANU has in fact created outrage on the campus of that university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANU Council has voiced its opposition to this issue. The Minister mentioned in his speech that the ANU had been consulted. What he did not tell the Parliament was that the ANU did not agree. As a matter of fact, the Council has passed resolutions opposing this move. In the end the Government, of course, had the whip hand with financial control and then had its way with the ANU. The staff of the ANU have also been very opposed to this proposal. They have held public meetings which have condemned the Minister's action, and they have called for the financial control of the ANU School of Medical Research to remain within the University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two prominent Australians who were among the founding fathers of the ANU, Sir Mark Oliphant and Dr H.C. Coombs, have expressed their disgust at the Minister's actions. These men know what they are talking about. They were prime movers in the establishment of the ANU and were justifiably horrified at the proposal to dismember this university by allowing ministerial intervention</PARA>
<PARA>which would have the effect of moving funding away from the ANU to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. Under this plan the Minister will be responsible for funding this integral part of the ANU under the health bureaucracy of the Federal Government. Thus the Department will be able to influence the research profile of the John Curtin School of Medical Research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research in Australia has suffered enough under the policies of the Australian Research Council and the educational profile process. Handing over the funding responsibilities of the JCSMR to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services is simply paving the way for even more centrally determined research priorities. One wonders whether this is not the hidden agenda that is behind the Government's actions. What it might do is actually stifle and hinder the outstanding and creative work undertaken by research scientists of the JCSMR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Centrally funded research results in blinkered research. There needs to be a plurality of funding so that research may expand into a variety of areas. In this way the research can produce a variety of benefits. Government interference with and intervention in higher education have been both disruptive and destructive. This disruption now threatens the future of the JCSMR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have repeated consistently, the John Curtin School of Medical Research is a world class bio-medical research institute and undertakes important work that is not always politically popular but is important long term research. It takes years of effort and ultimately yields results that are extremely beneficial. The research record of this school over the last 30 years stands in testimony to this. The actions of the Government to attempt to sever the JCSMR from the ANU could curtail this essential type of research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The John Curtin School is part of the Institute of Advanced Studies within the ANU. The institute is a magnificent institution made up of various research schools of which the JCSMR is one. Interdisciplinary areas of science are growing rapidly, and the results of such studies are becoming more and more important. The communication between the various research schools as part of the ANU is absolutely essential for this type of research. By giving funding to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services to support the JCSMR, the communication lines are broken&mdash;the funding lines are all so different. The John Curtin School loses that vital link with these other schools in the ANU as a result of this action by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia cannot afford to let that happen to one of our best research institutions. Also the Government must not be allowed to intervene at any time in the affairs of what should be an autonomous university as it sets a dangerous precedent. It was this consideration and, in particular, concern for the JCSMR that led the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training to investigate the Minister's decision. This is something that the Minister, in not telling us the full story, did not refer to. He told us the story of the committee entitled the Stephen Review of Higher Education in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if the Minister had taken the trouble to read the highly regarded report of the Senate Standing Committee of Employment, Education and Training inquiry into the John Curtin School, he would have found in it that the findings of the Stephen Committee were seriously deficient. I will illustrate in what ways they were deficient in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was asked to pay particular attention to the most desirable mechanism for control and administration of the school&mdash;and here we found great deficiencies in the Stephen Committee report. This was the report on which the Minister based his decision to transfer the control of the John Curtin School from the Institute of Advanced Studies in the university to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Committee found serious shortcomings with both the information gathering process of the Stephen Committee and the processes which it went through. To quote from the Senate Committee report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Committee is unanimous in its concerns over the shortcomings in the processes followed by the Stephen Committee during its review insofar as this related to the John Curtin School. The Senate Committee considers that such shortcomings diminish the value of the decision arrived at.</PARA>
<PARA>The eight members of the Senate Standing Committee&mdash;four Labor, one Democrat and three Liberal&mdash;endorsed that particular quote; we had serious concerns about what we found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that many of the findings of the Stephen Committee can be questioned. The process of collecting evidence, communicating with the school and consultation with the ANU were completely unsatisfactory. As a result of the Stephen Committee misinterpreting its terms of reference and its poor information gathering techniques, it appeared that it received a narrow range of opinions on the school and a disproportionately negative range at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Stephen Committee relied heavily on another review of the school in 1988, yet it failed to hold discussions with the persons who undertook that review. It spent very little time actually talking to the people at the John Curtin School, did not give any hint to the JCSMR staff of its concerns, thereby denying in its information collecting process a right of reply; yet it came up with recommendations in direct conflict with those of the 1988 review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Committee was not convinced that the Stephen Committee report demonstrated that the problems it identified would be resolved by the solutions that it proposed. The Senate Committee found that the shortcomings of the Stephen Committee review process detracted from the validity of its conclusions and bring in to question actions predicated upon its findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the report on which the Minister based his decision to transfer the funding of the ANU to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. Clearly, the Minister had been given poor advice by this Committee and the Senate inquiry has proved that. Now that the Minister's policy has been shown to have been poorly thought out and based on inadequate information and knowledge of the situation, he should not continue with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Minister is too stubborn and pig-headed to admit that he is wrong. The ANU is against him, the staff of the John Curtin School of Medical Research are against him, the founding fathers of the ANU are against him, the committee members of the 1988 review of the school are against him and the Senate Committee report is against him; yet he persists with this ridiculous idea that the John Curtin School would be better off amputated from the Australian National University and centrally funded through the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this Bill, if passed through the Parliament, would be to force the Minister to relent. The Bill seeks to overturn the Minister's decision and return to the previous funding arrangements. Presently, the John Curtin School of Medical Research is in a position where it is easier to accept funding from the Department of Employment, Education and Training through the ANU council than continue down the current road to centralise funding from the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the view of the ANU&mdash;and we have had this as recently as a week ago&mdash;it is easier to go back to the previous funding arrangement than to go forward with the Minister's poorly thought-out plan. Those senators on the Senate Standing Committee who felt that the funding should stay with the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services could not find one reason why that funding should not be returned to the ANU. It is even questionable whether the funding for the JCSMR, as given through Appropriation Bill No. 3 to the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, is by law required to go to the JCSMR. There is nothing stopping the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services from diverting the John Curtin School funds to other areas of medical research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Serious consideration should also be given to the fact that the funding of the John Curtin School has been coming through the National Health and Medical Research Council. This is despite the fact that when the Senate Committee looked at this issue it was told that the National Health and Medical Research Council wanted nothing to do with the John Curtin School. Clearly, the Minister's arrangements have not been well planned and are subject to change without notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I urge all honourable senators to support this Bill to ensure that the standards of higher education in this country are not eroded any further.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has prepared three other documents: one dealing with superannuation, the overseas experience; a second paper dealing with, regrettably, two cases of fraud, one known as the Burnwood case and the other ABC Engineering; and the third paper was a discussion paper on fees and charges. There will be a fourth report from the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which will deal primarily with some recommendations on the issue of fees and charges as they relate to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report tabled in the Senate this morning deals with various aspects of superannuation and the financial system. It deals with future developments of the financial system as they relate to superannuation. In part by necessity, as we are dealing with the future and at least in some areas with estimates of the likely effect, the consequences of superannuation are in some ways imprecise. The report examines trends that are now apparent and emerging and deals with recommendations largely concerned with monitoring the developments of superannuation and its effect on the financial system. The report makes six recommendations and I am pleased to say that those recommendations are unanimous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country at present contributions in the area of superannuation are rapidly expanding. Presently, there is some $150 billion in superannuation. It is estimated that by the year 2000 there will be some $600 billion in superannuation funds. Just to put these figures into perspective&mdash;they are rather hard to grasp when talking in hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;if the figure rises to $600 billion, it will be approximately twice the total value of the capitalisation of the stock market or, putting it another way, approximately five and a half to six times the total expenditure of the Federal Budget. So we are dealing with a massive amount of capital funds in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, this has been stimulated by the passing of the superannuation guarantee charge or levy, which has established a floor of 3 or 4 per cent superannuation contributions at the present time rising to some 9 per cent by the year 2000. It is estimated that this measure will lead to an increase in total superannuation moneys accumulated of some 39 per cent. It is against this background of the expansion of superannuation that there will be certain pressures placed on the financial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee report examines a number of issues: superannuation contributions, fund assets, the market for Australian shares, managed funds, the issue of national saving and the long term interests of contributors including the scope for criminal and fraudulent activity in the industry. Finally, we touch on the issue that we examined earlier in the superannuation guarantee charge report&mdash;the unfunded liabilities of Commonwealth and State public sector superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to deal with a number of the areas that the report deals with this evening in the time available to me. I note that my Senate and Committee colleague Senator Watson will also be speaking on the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the assets in superannuation, there is no doubt there will be an increased competition for savings, particularly vis-a-vis the banking system and the superannuation funds. The banks are clearly stepping up competition for the superannuation dollar because they believe, although the evidence to this point in time is to the contrary, that they will suffer a net drain of funds away from banking institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the superannuation assets invested in Australia, it is interesting to note that 11 per cent is invested in property, 36 per cent in equities, 23 per cent in long term securities, 6 per cent in loans and 10 per cent is invested short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some doubt as to the capacity of the share market to absorb the expansion of superannuation moneys. There will be pressure on high quality shares. That pressure will grow and indeed may outstrip supply. The third recommendation of the Committee is that the Government, through the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, monitor the trends and changes in the investment portfolios of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to fund management, superannuation funds are using professional fund managers to the same extent as the total investment market, but much of this management of funds is concentrated in the hands of a few who could exert undue influence on the market. Some observers, in their submissions to the Committee, believe that the fund growth will stimulate the entry of new fund managers and will even lead to an increase in competition. But the Committee has recommended that there be a monitoring to ensure the maintenance of competition in the superannuation sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of national saving, as superannuation grows it is likely that other forms of personal saving will probably fall. However, Treasury estimates are that there will be a net increase in savings owing to the compulsory vesting and preservation requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some long term issues that I would particularly like to touch on. Firstly, the Committee received some in camera and confidential advice from the National Crime Authority which touched on the potential for money laundering and the infiltration of organised crime into superannuation. I would like to emphasise that the National Crime Authority's submission to the Committee emphasised that there is minimal money laundering and minimal organised criminal involvement in the superannuation industry. However, there have been a number of cases of money laundering. To put the matter into perspective, amounts of money involved are minimal and are less than the amount taken through bank robberies during a single year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there is cause for concern because there are some obvious weak points in the administration and supervision of superannuation. We highlighted those weak points in our earlier report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding Superannuation</EMPHASIS>. I refer, for example, to the powers of the regulator, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, its staffing and its ability to carry out spot audits. In this regard I would say that there has been a welcome expansion of the staffing and the auditing staff of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission following the last Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is yet to hand down its paper on the safety aspects of superannuation, but I certainly do not have any doubt that this Government will give the recommendations we made earlier in the year the maximum consideration. I understand that paper is due to be released in the next few weeks. That will also deal with such issues as information to be provided to members, the way in which trustees are to be monitored, the way in which fund managers are to be monitored, disputes mechanisms and a variety of other reform measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area is the role of friendly societies. The Committee believes that friendly societies that are providing a superannuation product should be under the monitoring supervision of a national authority&mdash;in this case, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. We recommended that the Treasurer and the Attorney-General should examine the potential for fraud and money laundering within funds and develop effective countermeasures in addition to those recommended by this Committee on a previous occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super and the Financial System</EMPHASIS> is the third report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. In terms of performance, output and workload, this Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Nick Sherry, has a record far surpassing most of the standing committees of the Parliament. It has indeed been a good Committee because it has brought before the nation and this Government many of the vulnerable issues in relation to superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we progress down this road and have the advantage of some hindsight, some of the concerns that the Opposition drew attention to very early in the piece are being brought to light. I draw attention to the question of the validity of some Treasury assumptions, which the coalition had some concern about. This report even acknowledges that, in the light of the current very low interest and inflation rates, the validity of those Treasury assumptions about the earnings rate of superannuation funds and the rate of inflation may be questioned. The assumptions made about them have implications for the future in the effect of the superannuation guarantee charge on the financial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee came to the conclusion that it is important that future governments monitor medium and long term fund performance and, if required, be in a position to promote a more efficient and competitive capital market if returns fall below the required benchmark. Most senators would have had concerns from constituents in recent times about the very low returns that they are receiving from superannuation funds and ADFs in the current environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question of the rate of return and the impact on cash flows was also echoed in a submission from the Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Graeme Thompson. Whilst acknowledging that the growth of superannuation will provide competition to savings in other forms, he expressed an opinion that some views on the impact on cash flows have been somewhat overstated and have underestimated the capacity of financial markets to deal with these sorts of changes. Certainly the banking sector is quite concerned about the potential impact of the transfer of savings out of bank accounts into superannuation funds on the level of savings and their ability to productively move those savings back into the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge this recognition of concern in the community about the very low returns that are being given back to it at page 9:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Committee members have received a number of comments from retirees about disappointing returns on their rollover products. Some of these comments could have indicated that cross subsidisation between rollover funds and other savings vehicles in the one institution has been occurring.</PARA>
<PARA>If this is the case, it is somewhat serious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, on page 11 we issue a very strong warning to government in terms of legislation that has been introduced into the Parliament and which I understand has subsequently been withdrawn to be redrafted. That legislation relates to the taxation of interests in foreign superannuation investment funds as far as it affects superannuation. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee observes that the extent to which off-shore diversification is pursued by superannuation funds may in future be limited should the Government's proposal to tax unrealised gains by Australian interests overseas be implemented. Also included in the proposal are arrangements to change the tax treatment of insurance/superannuation policies which are brought into Australia by migrants. If the initiative is made to apply to superannuation funds, it could limit their ability to maintain an appropriately diversified portfolio and thereby produce satisfactory rates of return on funds under investment. The cost of compliance with the provisions of this policy may also detract from the performance of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically the big life offices and superannuation companies are not into the tax avoidance racket, so there is really good scope for insurance of this nature where the products are widely held to be outside the ambit of such a net. We have to be very careful that investments overseas are not taxation driven rather than risk and rate of return driven, which is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry raised the issue of the impact of the growth of superannuation funds on the funds management industry, which is very narrowly controlled. The report says that only a handful of very large funds control the bulk of superannuation assets. This could mean that the poor investment decisions of a few large funds managers could have a disproportionate consequence for the wider Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days, we have heard the term `computerised selling' used. If this computerised selling notion is adopted very widely, it will have an accelerating or snowballing effect if a particular share is seen to be out of favour. It can have some disastrous results, particular examples being the recent experiences with the Bank of New South Wales and Pioneer International. Perhaps the market has severely over-reacted in relation to those shares because, as we found with the City Bank case, banks have a great capacity to rebound in terms of profit performance. I am sure that this will happen with Westpac, although it might take a few more months for that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank also admitted that it did not know whether aggregate savings were affected by changes in members' contributions. We devoted quite a significant portion in the report to the point of view of the Reserve Bank on the impact of savings. It believes that, particularly for low income earners, it was very difficult to come to a conclusion, because during the 1980s there was a very low contribution rate, particularly from those low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerned me was some comments from representatives in Queensland about unfunded liabilities. I draw the Senate's attention to whether, in the light of hindsight, their statement is really accurate. It is accurate in a sense, but in respect of the ramifications, there is a big question mark as to whether there is a reserve in terms of those superannuation funds really being fully funded. Those who made that contribution did not examine that aspect perhaps as carefully as they should have. This may be the subject of some further investigation, certainly within the Queensland Parliament, if not within this Parliament. They presented a somewhat misleading position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some people in society at the moment who believe that superannuation is the panacea for many of our economic ills. In particular, there are those who would say that superannuation will solve our national savings crisis. I do not believe that that is a fair comment. Over the last nine years we have seen a decline in aggregate savings in this country when savings are measured as a percentage of disposable household income. In the first year of Labor savings as a percentage of disposable household income accounted for something like 9.54 per cent. However, in the 1991-92 financial year they slumped to a level of 6.57 per cent. In the previous financial year I understand that the figure was as low as 5.7 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incorrect to say that the growth of superannuation funds will and of themselves increase our national savings base. That must be a reason for concern because, as everybody in this chamber knows&mdash;in fact, as everybody in Parliament knows&mdash;we have a massive problem in terms of funding new investment. That has been the principal cause for the rise in our foreign debt. There has been a lack of money to fund borrowings and a lack of money to fund lending by banks and as a result the banks have had to go off-shore. The funding has come in from overseas and our foreign debt has blown out. Everybody knows that the rise in foreign debt under the Labor Government has been astronomical. It has risen from about $23 billion in net terms in 1983 to $150 billion currently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are some who would say that superannuation and superannuation schemes generally will be the basis for funding new investment via the Stock Exchange. Again, I think we must have grave doubts about this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may help and I wish to address that matter in particular. During the 1990-91 financial year total capital raisings on the Australian Stock Exchange amounted to just $6.596 billion. Of this new capital raising, something like 33 per cent was accounted for by dividend reinvestment. A further 36 per cent was accounted for by rights issues. Admittedly, some of the rights issues may have been funded by superannuation but only to the extent that the superannuation funds actually held shares in those companies to start off with and were willing to fund the rights issue. In fact, not all rights issues have been taken up. We have seen that in recent months. That means that just 31 per cent of the new capital raisings, or roughly $2.045 billion, actually constituted new capital raised from new sources. The really disturbing thing in terms of those of us who would like to see new companies expand and come onto the Stock Exchange is that of that $6.596 billion only $112m was raised to start up new companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation industry would say that it is making a major contribution to funding investment. At the same time as the new issues increased by roughly $6.5 billion, the amount of money invested in the superannuation market grew by $24 billion. So it is simply absurd to say that the superannuation funds could invest even a reasonable portion of their money into new shares on the Stock Exchange. The amount of money that was raised in new capital raisings was roughly one-quarter of the amount of money invested in the Stock Exchange. Roughly one-twelfth of the total increase in the superannuation pool would be accounted for by flotations on the Stock Exchange. There are very real reasons to have concern about exactly where the money is going. Of course it is a fact that up to 60 per cent of the money that flows into many funds is invested in shares already on issue. This money never flows through to the companies that issue the shares because the shares were issued years ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a major problem because we will be superheating the stock exchange. We will be bidding up the price of shares. They will not be based on the performance of the company because, as Senator Watson points out, the yield is sliding down. We are bidding up the price of the shares but it is not related to the company's performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the people who are investing in superannuation are my age so they will probably be retiring 35 to 40 years hence. Statistically, we should be able to expect two, maybe even as many as three, major falls in the stock market over that 40-year period. The problem is that people who are investing in the superannuation funds are being led to believe that that money will always be there and that growth will always be maintained at the time they take their money out. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We face the prospect that if this Government continues in the fashion in which it is going people will have no opportunity to lay off their investment into alternative forms of investment such as retirement savings accounts and there will be a major problem. Unless money goes back into the banking system we have the situation where we are bleeding regional Australia into superannuation funds where the moneys are punted on the Stock Exchange. A decline in deposits in banks in regional Australia ultimately means a decline in the available lending in regional Australia. So this Government's policy will make regional Australia poorer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to embracing the coalition's idea of retirement savings accounts, we also need to improve the liquidity for saving in the market by developing a real and effective secondary market for debt products in terms of personal debt products, mortgage backed securities and a secondary debt market for corporate debt. Although we have a bond market, the secondary debt market for single bank lines is very much constrained and is very much the victim of stamp duty on the loan transactions in most States in Australia.

<PARA>As I have said, it has been put to me that courts are extremely reluctant to provide for maximum fines. A number of cases have been brought to my attention where people have been prosecuted for selling counterfeit goods at markets and so forth. It is a concern that courts are in general unwilling to apply the full extent of the law. Of course, the size of the fine depends on the nature of the offence, but I think there is a very good case to be made for substantially increasing the fines provided for under the Trade Marks Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop has suggested that putting someone in gaol for the minor offence of selling and printing a couple of T-shirts with a fake trade mark is perhaps a bit excessive, but I think that one would be pretty hard-pressed to find someone who would be slapped into gaol for a fairly minor offence under this legislation. What we are talking about are fairly major offences of forgery of trade marks. For example, some of the cases that I have been provided with involve 15,000 T-shirts, 150 screens, bromides and sketches of one manufacturer alone. Fifteen thousand T-shirts is a lot of T-shirts and a fairly high volume counterfeiting operation. An offence of that magnitude, of course, would hopefully attract a fine of similar proportions. One would be pretty hard-pressed to find a court that would slap someone into gaol for printing two T-shirts and selling them at a market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of concern raised about the level of fines and I do accept and recognise that the Government has based these fines on the Copyright Act and I think that is a fair thing to do. However, if the Government is using the Copyright Act as a benchmark for fines, perhaps it is time that those fines should likewise be revised in the light of concern in the business community about theft of intellectual and trade property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of my amendment No. 6, again it has been put to me by the anti-counterfeit action group that a test of reasonableness should be included in clause 106 of the Government's amendments. That is not a tremendously significant amendment, but I think it is something that the Government could certainly see its way clear to accept. For example, there are a number of cases whereby people have hidden behind the definition of having known that the trade mark is a registered trade mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of senators present, I will refer to the details of one case whereby, in Canberra, a legal aid office defended a Vietnamese person who was charged under the Trade Marks Act. The case was dismissed because the defendant stated that he had no knowledge of copyright or trade mark because his wife did the shopping. The magistrate bought the story and dismissed the case. Since then, the legal aid office has made it clear that it will use the case as a precedent in other cases. End of story!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is simply one of the many examples that the anti-counterfeit action group provides of where people simply hide behind language, their newness to this country or a range of other things. If the test of reasonableness was applied that they should reasonably have known that the trade mark was a counterfeit or a forgery, that, I think, would enable businesses to more adequately protect their intellectual and trade property in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to prolong the debate on this matter any further. I think we will all be pretty glad to see the back end of this Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill is to extend the Commonwealth guarantee on the borrowings of the Australian Industry Development Corporation, or AIDC as it is commonly known, from its current expiry date of 30 June 1994 to 30 June 1998. The Bill also ensures that the guarantee does not continue on moneys reinvested after the statutory limit on the Commonwealth guarantee has expired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill reduces the size of the AIDC's board because, since AIDC Ltd was publicly floated, the Corporation has basically been a holding corporation and the requirement for a large board is no longer appropriate. The Bill also defines the powers of the AIDC to enter into swaps and other financial transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AIDC was established to provide what is termed `development funding' for Australian companies. The functions and objectives of the Corporation are set out in section 6 of the AIDC Act. In summary, they are: to facilitate the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries and the participation in those industries by Australian residents by providing finance to those engaged in the industries and by participating in enterprises or projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the latest annual report of the AIDC, the priority areas for the Corporation's focus in performing its functions are the manufacturing, processing or transportation of goods and natural resources, internationally competitive service industries, including tourism, and the development or use of new or improved technology. The annual report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an objective of the Corporation in the provision of development funding to Australian companies that the efficiency and competitiveness of those companies will be enhanced, that long-term viability of some industries will be achieved through reconstruction, and that new industries that have good growth prospects will be established.</PARA>
<PARA>The annual report also points out that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An overriding statutory requirement for the Corporation is to act in accordance with sound business principles in performing its functions.</PARA>
<PARA>An examination of the accounts of the AIDC reveal that the Corporation has, on a generous interpretation, not been, from all accounts, acting in accordance with sound business principles in performing its function. We find that the AIDC, like so many like corporations that have been run by Labor governments both federally and at State level around Australia, has been often used for making high risk investments, both on and off the stock market. The result of this high risk strategy, like so many others who played the game of high risk strategies in the 1980s, has been massive losses, write downs and write offs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Australian taxpayer is fortunate that the AIDC has not gone as far as the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, which is similarly constructed in terms of its objectives and which, of course, collapsed in a ball of flames in the late 1980s with a deficit of well over $100m. The disclosure of the collapse and the mismanagement within the VEDC was the start of the evidence that came forward in a rush from thereon to indicate just how incompetent the Victorian Cain and subsequently Kirner Labor governments were. This led to the overwhelming defeat of the Kirner Government last weekend. As I say, it was the collapse of the VEDC, which in many ways is a similar type of organisation to the AIDC, that began the downfall of the Cain and Kirner governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AIDC is now in a financial situation where it is left with a meagre equity of just $145m. Against that, it has debts of $2,900m and assets of just over $3,000m. In other words, it has gross assets of about $3 billion, debt of about $2.9 billion and a very meagre equity left of about $145m. That constitutes a debt to equity ratio of a whopping 19.7 : 1. That is an extraordinarily highly geared financial operation by anyone's standards, particularly in the more conservative financial environment that applies increasingly today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Corporation posted a loss of over $91m. When one has a total equity of only $145m, one obviously cannot afford losses of that magnitude too often. So it is no surprise that the AIDC requires the extension of the government guarantee and that is the main purpose of this Bill. If this extension is not granted, quite obviously the Corporation, in its present financial situation, would have a great deal of difficulty in borrowing further on the markets and in refinancing any of its maturing debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose this Bill. It does not do so simply for the reason that we can see no other reasonable course of action that would prevent the AIDC collapsing. We are reluctant to extend the guarantee in the way that the Bill proposes. But if that guarantee is not extended, the financial risk facing the Corporation and, through the existing guarantees, the taxpayer, would be considerable indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a policy of privatising the AIDC on coming to government. The present Government has already started down that road with some privatisation of the Corporation. We propose to take that all the way. Obviously, there is no need for a government, particularly in the 1990s&mdash;and in earlier decades as well&mdash;to support or own organisations such as the AIDC. Experience has shown all too well how much of a mess governments can make of owning corporations such as this and the problems that that causes for the taxpayer, financial markets generally, and companies and ventures in which such corporations invest. This all adds up to one unequivocal bottom line, and that is that governments should get out of the business of trying to run businesses and particularly financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be adopting that policy on coming to government. Obviously we want to have the Corporation in such a shape that it will be an acceptable proposition so far as a potential buyer in the private sector is concerned. In order to achieve that, we see no alternative but to extend the guarantee on the Corporation's borrowings, and for those reasons we will not be opposing the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporation does have a relatively new managing director, Mr Gerry Van Der Merwe, under whom there has been a considerable reshaping of the direction in which the Corporation is heading. He has made it clear through various statements that the shift in the AIDC's strategic focus will be more to concentrate on infrastructure and natural resource projects. Whether that is a good or bad thing is a matter for judgment. But I come back to the essential point that government ought not be a shareholder, particularly a majority shareholder or total owner, of corporations such as this which are required basically to be taking investment decisions relating to the normal processes of the private sector. I close my remarks on that basis. We will not be opposing this Bill. We reluctantly support it for the reasons I have outlined.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Likewise, the Australian Democrats will not be opposing this legislation, although we do share some of the concerns about the financial management of the AIDC that have already been outlined by Senator Short.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill gives an extension of the Commonwealth guarantee from 30 June 1994 to 30 June 1998; it also clarifies the AIDC's trading powers brought into contention by a UK court decision; and it also reduces the size of the AIDC board. While these seem to be fairly minor amendments, we believe they are in fact significant, especially the extension of the guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AIDC is the holding corporation for AIDC Limited, the operating company of the group&mdash;a company which lost $31.1m of taxpayers' money last year and has just posted a whopping operating loss before tax of $98.6m for this year. That is a $130m loss in two years which has resulted in the Corporation having a net consolidated operating loss of $84.4m after tax and excluding outside interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporation was expected to give an average return on capital and reserves of 13 per cent per annum. It is no wonder the Government is granting an extension of four years, for it is clear that without this extension the AIDC and AIDC Limited would be in serious trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the Democrats will be supporting this very necessary amendment to the AIDC Act. We hope that in future the reforms which have just been put into place and which were announced by the Minister on 4 September, relating to redefining the strategy and business focus of the AIDC and the other changes that have been brought to bear on the organisation, will produce some more solid financial result for taxpayers in the coming years. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Industry Development Corporation Amendment Bill that is now before us to extend the government guarantee comes to us in a climate where over the past two years the AIDC, shall we say, stands under a cloud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the last occasion we met together for Estimates in December of last year, I asked many questions about the AIDC's accounts. A statement had been made to the stock exchange that the AIDC or AIDC Limited had made a loss of $8.8m for the previous financial year. Yet in November of that same year Mr Hawke, the then Prime Minister, in his employment statement, which was repeated in this chamber by Senator Button, said that the AIDC had made a profit of $9.6m in that same financial year, whereas, as I have said, only the day before it was announced to the stock exchange that AIDC Limited had made a loss of $8.8m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hawke's statement said that AIDC was to be allowed to keep the $10m-odd, which was the alleged profit, because it could be added to the amount of money that it could make available to Australian industry. Indeed, the AIDC was seen to be a tool of government industry policy. We see the ridiculous situation whereby the AIDC, the Corporation itself, has a charter as set out in its establishing Act of 1970, but where AIDC Limited, which is in fact a merchant bank and is described as such its memo and articles, is exempt from that charter in terms of its memo and articles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fettered in some way to be connected to Australian industry, but what we have seen is a policy by the AIDC to invest in almost anything, except that which would assist Australian industries either with import replacement or exports or the sorts of things it is meant to focus upon. We can argue that it ought not to be forced to focus on those things, but that was the intent and purpose with which the AIDC was established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have seen AIDC Limited announce to the stock exchange a loss of near on $99m. When I went back 12 months and looked at why I was interested in the figures that were then released, I decided to go back further and take a good look at the company's consolidated accounts. Indeed, the AIDC in the previous financial year made a trading loss $32m. It was allowed to carry forward some tax losses from previous years and add to them a further $22m in tax losses which gave it a total of $47m in tax losses. That amount was shown as an asset, which is how that company read down the loss that it had made to $8.8m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that this year the Auditor-General said in the AIDC report, a report that came to this Parliament only in the last 48 hours, that he would not allow the tax losses or the losses that have been suffered to be stated for tax purposes as an asset because he did not believe it was foreseeable that in the next three years&mdash;which is the usual accounting period for this sort of forecasting&mdash;the AIDC would make sufficient profit to utilise those tax losses. Indeed, if the AIDC next year does not make a profit sufficient to use up the $47m carried forward, which earlier in the day I said has been adjusted to $53m because of a different tax ruling on swaps, then it will lose the right to express those as an asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the AIDC is in a very precarious state, and yet AIDC Limited carries a triple A rating. Why is that so? Answer: the government guarantee. Why is the Government guarantee being extended to 1988 past the usual forecasting period for accounting purposes and auditing purposes? We could well ask the question. If we took away the government guarantee, we would indeed find that the AIDC would probably fall over. It would be forced to make a decision as to whether it could survive by perhaps seeking a banking licence, or indeed fall over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take a look at AIDC's associated companies in the annual report, of the 14 companies that are listed, six of them are in receivership. If we look at the point I made last year, we will see that in the organisation's accounts last year there was a provision for contingency liabilities, but only provisioning for $129m relating to those matters on the balance sheet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I would like answered is whether or not part of that $99m loss is attributable to one of the contingencies in fact being fulfilled and their occasioning that loss. I asked Mr Gurry and Senator Button at Estimates the question as to why the Government was not informed or did not know that the loss was to be as great as it was, thereby allowing the Government to put a proposed sale of a further 30,000 shares in AIDC Limited on to the private market; in other words, to reduce the Government's holding in AIDC Limited from 81 per cent down to 51 per cent. That was announced on 18 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 August the Auditor-General signed off the accounts. On 4 August Senator Button had to recant and put out a statement that in fact those shares would not be sold because he would not sell them until they could at least reach asset backing. Asset backing is presently expressed to be $1.23 a share and that includes the asset of tax losses. The tangible assets are around $83 or $87 a share. I forget the precise figure. In other words, the shares were trading at around 46 cents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 August the Government said, `We are going to sell more shares onto the market'. On 4 September, barely a fortnight later, the Auditor-General signs the accounts and there is a $99m loss. On that same day Senator Button has to recant and say, `We will not be selling the shares at this stage because we cannot make asset backing as the price'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: why did not the AIDC know it was in a loss situation; why did it not tell the Minister; and why did the Minister not make it available to the Government in its pre-Budget negotiations so that it would not make an absolute fool of itself by saying, `Here is a product that is valid to be sold', and then having to turn around and say two weeks later, `No, it is not'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, there are questions to be answered. Again the AIDC came to the Estimates committee hearings. Senator Button argued that it ought not come to Estimates committee hearings because the AIDC did not get an appropriation. Wrong! The Government guarantee acts as a virtual open-ended appropriation to the AIDC and, quite properly, it should appear and answer questions. To allow that proper discussion to take place at Estimates committee hearings, it is necessary for the Committee to have at least a draft annual report, if not the annual report itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one takes a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of those Estimates committee hearings, one is led to believe that the annual accounts would not be available until the end of October, yet the Auditor-General signed them on 4 September. The annual report of AIDC Limited was tabled with the stock exchange only 48 hours ago. Quite clearly, those figures were available to be made available to the Estimates Committee. Indeed, the Senate was misled. I was interested to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 7 October an article on the AIDC which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the cultural changes that we are trying to bring to bear is to change to our approach to teamwork. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other cultural style we are trying to develop is greater accountability, increasing the focus on profitability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDC, which lost $98 million in the year to June, had got to a point where our whole direction and strategy had become fuzzy.</PARA>
<PARA>Fuzzy! We are talking about a $32m loss which was covered up last year and a $98m loss this year. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We reached the stage where the board certainly felt that the company had lost direction, it wasn't clear to the board precisely what it was we wanted to be. We have got a good relationship with both the government and the opposition, we try to keep them involved and informed as to what we do.</PARA>
<PARA>Informed? Nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to informing this Parliament and the Parliament through its proper committees, because the information imparted at those Estimates Committee hearings was simply not adequate. It would have been far better had we had the accounts to work with. Those were denied us and, as I said, from the dates that are shown, they were denied us for no good reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with this whole system of arrangements is that when we had the AIDC the Minister was responsible. AIDC Limited is now a corporate entity. It lives off in a sycophantic manner the AIDC corporate entity which does all the borrowing because it has the guarantee and then it on-lends. That is the way it works. We, the taxpayers, are the people who are propping it up. If that Government guarantee was taken away tomorrow, that AAA rating would disappear immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that people understand precisely what is involved. One of the other truly amazing statements made in the Estimates Committee hearing was when I asked the question, `What business did the AIDC have investing in Venture stores, which is in receivership?'. I was given the answer that, because there was a monopoly situation in the retail trading area, it was considered desirable for manufacturers in Australia of textile, clothing and footwear products to have an alternate market to which to sell their goods. In other words, it was being asserted that it was a proper investment for a government entity to make into that particular venture&mdash;pardon the pun&mdash;because it was almost an extension of textile, clothing and footwear protection policy. Yet the reality is that Venture was one of those stores that certainly acted on a strong import policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very large building in the Perth CBD and the first mortgage is held by the AIDC. If my memory serves me correctly, the original mortgage was for $75m. It had been written down last year to something like $43m and this year Mr Gurry would not tell me what the value of the mortgage was because that was commercial in confidence and would set the benchmark. God only knows what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the lending policy of the AIDC through this period right up until now has not been reflecting its charter. Yet, as I explained, AIDC Limited, the corporate entity, which actually spends or lends the money raised by AIDC courtesy of the Government guarantee, is not bound by that charter; it is bound by its own memorandum and articles. So we have this nonsensical position where the Minister can say, `It is a corporate entity. It is at arm's length. I cannot talk to you about it'. It is simply pushing government responsibility off budget and it has got to stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am speaking at length on this Bill is that there needs to be greater scrutiny. I apply this across the board to all corporatised entities or pseudo-GBEs. When we are dealing with taxpayers' money&mdash;and a government guarantee is taxpayers' money because if that entity falls over the taxpayer picks up the bill&mdash;there ought to be more information available through the Parliament to the public to know what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was something called short term or temporary borrowings permitted under the charter which are not included in the borrowing limits as set down in the legislation. One could ask oneself just what are temporary borrowings. Presumably, they include the general public's deposits which are advertised for. Presumably, they extend to overdraft. One can but guess at how the AIDC defines temporary borrowings and how in the future it will define temporary borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is another question: whether or not any new products which the AIDC Limited may develop in a desperate attempt to become profitable will in fact be a legitimate use of the Government guarantee. Presumably, that is a question that can be answered only by a correct audit by the Auditor-General. As we are here projecting this Government guarantee out till 1998&mdash;way past the normal three-year accounting forecasting period&mdash;I think it is very important that people be made aware of just what it is we are guaranteeing and whether it is a proper use of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Short has said, the Opposition will not be opposing the Bill. We will allow the Bill to pass and the Government guarantee to be extended to 1998. But the Government should be under no illusion&mdash;once we take office we will move to privatise or to change the circumstances of the AIDC so that it is no longer in its present form, privatisation being the preferred option, and the Government guarantee will be at an end. So although we are agreeing to this Bill tonight, it is not set in cement and when we come to office there will be a change in arrangements of the AIDC, hopefully a privatised arrangement, and the Government guarantee will come to an end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations Application Bill 1992 was directed at overcoming a potential legal problem relating to the incorrect passage of the legislation through the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Bill allows for the regulations made on 30 June 1992 under the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 to have the same effect as they would have had if the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act 1992 had received royal assent before those regulations were made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the coalition opposed the Bill when it was introduced, because this Bill contains no policy changes and is purely administrative the Opposition will not oppose it. This Bill is necessary because royal assent was not given due to some technical errors discovered after the original Bill passed through the Parliament. However, we do take this opportunity to debate the issues because of our reservations about the superannuation guarantee arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be said from the outset that the concept of the Government's policy was certainly mistaken and in all likelihood a provision for retirement, such as an employer funded compulsory superannuation guarantee charge, really will take decades to significantly increase national savings. Also, the coalition has doubts that it will contribute to individual retirement income in a way the Government is promising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Events in the last few months have given no cause for joy so far as the Government is concerned with the terms diminishing and some funds showing negative returns. We expressed concern about the Treasury's assumption of the 8 per cent nominal earnings rate of superannuation over 40 years. Certainly it has not got off to a good start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said before that that legislation would cost some people their livelihoods. I will give a very simple example. Recently a Launceston taxi driver explained to me that he was a victim of the guarantee charge because, as he said, his boss could not afford the extra cost so he substantially reduced the driver's casual time and the boss is now driving more hours himself. There are people in this situation all over the country and I ask: where is the human face of this Government which turns its face from the sufferings of Australian families?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further problem with the whole concept is revealed when, time and time again, people come into our office with superannuation when they have only casual earnings. In the latest case, a person had earned something like $1,000 and within 12 months, apart from $2, it was completely wiped off on account of government charges, taxes, administration fees and so on. Who are the real beneficiaries of this legislation, and how will it benefit particularly the lower paid and casual people? It is incomprehensible that the superannuation levy has been introduced during a severe and worsening recession. It will have a real impact on and be a further cost increase to Australian employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The employers of most of those 1.5 million workers to whom I have referred will be required to change from contributing nought to contributing 3 or 4 per cent, or 5 per cent for the bigger ones, in just one year as the legislation has been implemented. It will cost around about $2 billion a year. That is on top of the 4.5 per cent wage claim that has been pursued by the ACTU and other costs such as the training guarantee levy and payroll tax. These are the reasons it is not difficult to demonstrate that over recent times the cost of employing labour has increased by approximately 10 per cent. At a time of recession the timing could not have been worse and the principle, I think, has to be severely questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must point out that the Australian work force and Australian employers are being made to carry the cost of a pre-election accord between the then Hawke-Keating Government before the last election to cement the support of the ACTU. It has indeed been a high price for a lot of bosses. The ACTU, which sets itself up as the guardian of the future of the working class people of Australia, has done so little to encourage the Government to go to employers and say, `We want to reduce as much as we can of the oncosts of employing labour'. Of course, this is a fairly naive assumption on our part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to mention that there is a stark contrast between the Government approach, which is aimed at loading the oncosts of business, and the coalition's approach under Fightback, which is to reduce costs of business, reduce overheads. This amounts to a reduction of something like $20m in costs to business. Therefore, job opportunities increase and Australian products become more competitive when they are faced with imports. It is just another indication that this Government has the wrong approach to bringing about the sort of basic recovery that is needed in Australia. Seeing as there have been no policy changes&mdash;it is a technical correction&mdash;the Opposition supports these changes, although in principle it is very much against the concept of the superannuation guarantee charge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that we are here to re-canvass the whole SGC debate. We are here to talk about this relatively simple piece of legislation&mdash;the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations Application Bill 1992&mdash;which deals with a technical legislative problem that arose in respect of the package of Bills which included the superannuation guarantee charge. That package of Bills was passed by the Senate in June, and it anticipated a 1 July commencement date of universal superannuation arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that, unfortunately because of a clerical error, the table of amendments sent to the House of Representatives was not an accurate representation of what we had agreed to in this chamber. It was not picked up at the time, so the House of Representatives agreed to legislation which was different from that agreed to by the Senate. The error was detected while the legislation was awaiting royal assent. The Senate dealt with the error by way of resolution shortly after the commencement of the Budget sittings. The legislation then duly passed through the other place and received royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the legislation operates from 1 July, supporting regulations were made on that date. These regulations are crucial to the operation of the superannuation guarantee charge system in a number of ways. They allow superannuation funds to accept contributions made by employers under SGC arrangements, even if there are some conflicting provisions in existing arrangements. They also provide a degree of protection for employees, firstly, by stipulating that all contributions have to vest immediately in the employee and, secondly, by placing responsibility on trustees to obtain and provide employers and the ISC with specific actuarial information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support these regulations; we think they are very important. However, because of the administrative hitch in the SGC legislation, these regulations were made before the legislation was enacted. So the validity of these regulations is open to question, at least in the period between 1 July and the date of royal assent of the SGC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unclear what the precise legal position is, so it is clearly a sensible and responsible action to clarify the operation of the regulations from 1 July. We have recently had to deal with the awful mess of sales tax on in-ground swimming pools because of an adverse judgment dealing with the method of enactment. That case demonstrates the need to get it right in the first place and that sometimes remedial action might be prudent to avoid failure of law on a technicality. The Democrats support this legislation. </PARA>

I do not want to say much because we can adjourn as soon as I finish, which is always a good incentive to not speak for too long. Important as the issue is, the Bill is merely a validation of something which is now in some doubt. Ironically, it is not certain that the Bill is even necessary, but it gives a guarantee of validity that otherwise might not be there and would therefore mean that a very undesirable level of uncertainty might operate in an area where it is very important to give people confidence that the arrangements that they have entered into have all the necessary backing, legally and otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very rarely rise to speak on the adjournment debate, but I do so tonight&mdash;I know that I will be followed by my colleague Senator Tambling&mdash;to pay tribute to the former member for Arafura in the Northern Territory Parliament, Stan Tipiloura. He was the person who took that seat for the Labor Party after I vacated the Northern Territory Parliament to come to the Senate. He died just a short time ago at the tragically young age of 35.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first met Stan when he was a teenager and I was working for the CSIRO division of wildlife research in Darwin. We had an Aboriginal trainee program operating at CSIRO. Along with Nigel Gellar and David Yates, Stanley Tipiloura was one of three Aboriginal trainees who worked for CSIRO. Even then he was obviously a person who stood out from the crowd. He was a very big man physically&mdash;he was well over six foot&mdash;and an outstanding footballer, being highly intelligent and extremely strongly motivated. Despite his very large size, he was a very gentle and courteous man in every sense of the word, which is something everyone who knew Stan noted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That association with Stanley led to a close friendship between us which lasted fundamentally for 20 years of his 35-year life. After leaving CSIRO, Stan became the first police aid in the Northern Territory and subsequently&mdash;and this was unique&mdash;a commissioned constable in the police force who served on general duties in Darwin for some time, where he won the respect of all his fellow officers. This was demonstrated, in a way that was deeply appreciated by his family, by the very large presence of police officers, including the Commissioner of Police for the Northern Territory, at not just the requiem mass that was held at the cathedral in Darwin for Stan but also at the funeral service at Bathurst Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a remarkably young age Stanley took a very active interest in the affairs of his own community and subsequently became President of the Council at Bathurst Island. He was certainly one of the youngest Aboriginal people ever to go into that sort of position that I am aware of, which indicated the very great respect in which he was held by the Aboriginal community. Subsequently, he entered politics and, as was remarked in the Northern Territory Parliament at the time by Terry McCarthy, a member of the Country Liberal Party who also knew Stan well, it was something that did not come as a surprise to anyone. Because of his intelligence and the way he could articulate the concerns that he had on behalf of the Aboriginal people that he represented, it seemed like a natural transition for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I probably campaigned harder in that first election for Stan in Arafura than I campaigned for anybody, including myself. I worked as his electorate secretary&mdash;I do not think anyone had a more efficient electorate secretary than Stan Tipiloura had&mdash;on the princely sum of $19,000 a year at the time. The reason I mention that is that one of the personal traits that this person had, which was remarked upon by everybody who knew him, was his personal demeanour&mdash;that is, what an open, honest, friendly and gentle person he was. That was one of the happiest six months that I have spent in politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I worked for Stan, and in helping him to win the subsequent campaign as well, he was regrettably suffering the onset of the kidney disease that took his life. During the last campaign, an indication of the standing that he had established in the community was that, despite the fact that he was in hospital in Adelaide receiving a kidney transplant&mdash;this happened at a time not of his choosing&mdash;and was personally absent from the campaign, he achieved 65.5 per cent of the primary vote. That was an indication of the regard in which the electorate held him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stan's time in politics was not without controversy. I noted this publicly at the time in the Northern Territory. He was wholly Aboriginal and very proud of his race, his own people, the Tiwi people, his language and his culture. But at the same time he had a philosophical view which was not shared by other people who criticised him publicly for it. I could sum it up best by saying that his view was, `I'm black and you're white, but we're all Australians, so let's get on with it'. That fundamentally summed up the man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem of kidney failure that Stan tragically had is a problem endemic among the Tiwi people in the Northern Territory. It is not known why it occurs in that area. The Menzies School of Health Research in the Northern Territory is carrying out a research project on it. Dr David Pugsley, Stan's specialist physician from Adelaide&mdash;a wonderful bloke and a highly dedicated physician&mdash;said to me that it may be 10 years before the team of three medical researchers who are stationed permanently on Bathurst Island investigating this problem find an answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tragically, at the beginning of what everyone acknowledged from both sides of Parliament was an extremely promising political career, Stan was struck down with this Tiwi problem of kidney failure. He went on dialysis for some time and thought at that time that his political career was finished but, fortunately, by the very generous act of his uncle&mdash;at least the person that we would term his uncle, the person whom Stan related to as his father since the death of his natural father, Bernard Tipiloura&mdash;he got a kidney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty and the problem was that the condition that Stan suffered from&mdash;a syndrome which was a combination of medical symptoms&mdash;subsequently led to the failure of that transplant. What was particularly distressing for me personally was not only the fact that about a fortnight before his death he and I spoke about the prognosis that his doctors had given him, which was a fairly unhappy one, but also fundamentally that he would have had to go back on dialysis in December this year with no real prospect of ever getting another transplant. As his doctor said to me, and rightly, kidneys are a scarce resource. The medical people in Australia who are world leaders in this area have to provide this resource to people who can make the best use of it. Stan had the double blow of being told not only that his kidney had failed when he had a brief taste of a relatively normal life with the new kidney but also that he would have to go back on dialysis and for the rest of his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that he was down and depressed about was the fact that he would obviously have to retire from politics. He could not possibly effectively represent an electorate when he was tied up to a dialysis machine for eight hours a day Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays of a working week. Stan's preoccupation&mdash;and the reason I am accounting this, as it was very much a product of the sort of the bloke he was&mdash;was his unhappiness about the prospect of having to resign while Parliament was in session because he did not want to have to go through the speeches of people saying nice things about him and how sorry they were about him leaving. I said, `Look, the simplest way of handling that is that it is fundamentally the end of the parliamentary year already. The Northern Territory Parliament only sits once every blue moon anyway and you only have half a dozen sitting days left for the rest of the year. Why not quietly wait until the end of the year, resign over the Christmas break, and you will be relieved of all that tedium'. He was happy about that and that was the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To our total distress and shock only a fortnight after that, early on a Sunday morning, I received what to me was the appallingly tragic news that Stan had died in Melbourne. As I said before, Stan was a passionate and a very good footballer. He was a passionate advocate of Australian Rules, as all Tiwis are. He was in Melbourne supporting the Tiwi football team that played at the MCG and sharing a room in the motel with two other Tiwi footballers when he died. It was of great comfort to his family that he died at least under those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tragically, he was the first member of the Northern Territory Parliament to die in office at the very untimely age of 35. He was elected to Parliament in March 1987 and died on 20 September this year. Senator Tambling would testify, and no doubt will, that his funeral was testimony to the regard in which Stan was held. It bowled me over. A requiem mass was held for Stan in the cathedral in Darwin&mdash;not a small building&mdash;for the benefit of those many friends that Stan had from both sides of political life, from all sections of the Northern Territory community, and for those people who would not be able to get to the funeral service at Bathurst Island. The cathedral was packed out; there was standing room only. It was a tremendous comfort to Stan's family to see the level of support for the job that he had done in the tributes that were paid to him by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and by all members of the Northern Territory Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stan was a great ambassador for the Northern Territory, a very effective one. He travelled widely in the 5 1/2 years that he was a member and many members of the Northern Territory Government spoke about this. The feedback that everyone got from Stan's visit overseas, particularly on behalf of the Territory, was that he was an extremely effective ambassador for the Territory. Without question, the fact that he was black had a lot to do with it. There were only two full blood Aboriginal members of parliament in Australia: one of them was Stan and the other is Wesley Lanhupuy, who is also a member of the Territory Parliament, now in his third term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this articulate, young, black Australian politician was able to visit countries such as the United States of America, Canada and Germany as an ambassador for the Northern Territory was of enormous benefit to the Territory and to everyone who served in public life. We all shared a bit in the reputation that Stan Tipiloura had. We all dearly regret his passing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise tonight to pay tribute to the public service he gave as a politician, as a parliamentarian, as a passionate and articulate advocate for the Aboriginal people that he represented in parliament, and to pay tribute to the service that he gave them. I simply close by saying that it is a tragic fact that, as we speak, in 1992&mdash;today&mdash;the average life expectancy for an Aboriginal male in the Northern Territory is 40 years of age. Stan tragically never made even that relatively short life span. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish on a positive note. I am very pleased to say that, following Stan's death, I have been advised by the Tiwi Land Council, by the social club at Bathurst Island and by a number of other organisations, including the football club, that were associated with Stan, that there is now an intention to endow in his memory a trust fund that will be used to further the kidney research that is being carried out among the Tiwi people by the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, this evening I would certainly like to be associated with the tributes and condolences that Senator Collins has just expressed with regard to the very sad passing of our political colleague and good friend in the Northern Territory, Stan Tipiloura. People from the Tiwi Islands travelled to Darwin a week or so ago to `smoke' the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in honour of the late Stan Tipiloura.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stan, a Tiwi Islander and the honourable member for Arafura, died on 20 September at the tragically young age of 35 after a long battle with kidney disease. Some 60 of his fellow islanders performed the smoking ceremony in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and in Stan's old office to farewell his soul and to ensure that other members of the Legislative Assembly were protected and made proper decisions. That smoking ceremony, said to be the first in any Australian parliament, highlighted the strength of Stan's culture and the strength of respect for the `big man' across the Assembly and the Northern Territory community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Born in 1957, Stan Gabriel Tipiloura was, according to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, a man who represented Aboriginal Territorians with passion and conviction and a Territorian of whom all Territorians could be proud. His electorate covered the Tiwi Islands and the north and west parts of Arnhem Land. Chief Minister Perron told the Legislative Assembly last month:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The respect and support which he enjoyed in the community was demonstrated overwhelmingly when he first ran for Parliament in 1987 and won with three times as many votes as his nearest opponent. Even though he fought the last election from his hospital bed, he again won convincingly by capturing two-thirds of the vote. In this Assembly, he was always a gentleman and spoke from his heart, quite forcefully on occasions.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Opposition Leader, Mr Brian Ede, also reflected on the last election campaign when he said Stan became affectionately known as the `menace on the mobile'. Mr Ede said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stanley had a mobile phone and he would be forever ringing up various people asking what was happening and whether one thing or another had been organised. People would say that the "menace on the mobile" was at it again. He was as susceptible to election jitters as any of us.</PARA>
<PARA>Stan Tipiloura entered parliament just six months short of his thirtieth birthday and over the next five years served as shadow Minister for portfolios such as local government, administrative services, police, fire and emergency services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has already alluded to the fact that he served well in his parliamentary responsibilities. I pay tribute as a shadow Minister to the functions he carried out in the Northern Territory as a shadow Minister in the Northern Territory Parliament. A fellow Aboriginal member of the Legislative Assembly, Mr Wes Lanhupuy, said he often drew strength from Stan and considered him both a friend and a colleague. In fact, Mr Lanhupuy related an amusing story from Stan's trip to Germany in 1988 with the then NT Minister for Tourism, Mr Ray Hanrahan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, the two were preparing for an important interview when reporters and camera crews, confused as to who the Minister was, turned their attention to Stan. He did, after all, tower over Ray Hanrahan. According to Mr Lanhupuy, someone then asked Stanley who the little white guy was and Stanley referred to him as his baggage man. Let me support the words of Chief Minister Perron who described Stan in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person of unquestioned honesty and integrity, he was seen as having good judgment, confidence and a willingness to stand alone when the situation demanded it.</PARA>
<PARA>Stan Tipiloura, the man who in his maiden speech in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly pledged to work for the benefit of the people of his electorate and the people of the Northern Territory, will be well remembered. Unfortunately, I was overseas at the time of Mr Tipiloura's death and I was unable to attend the funeral in Darwin, which Senator Collins has already referred to, at which so many Territorians paid their last respects and tributes. I would have loved to have been there because of the personal affection that I felt for Stan. Certainly, we all share in conveying condolences to his mother, Scholastica; his wife, Patricia; and his four children&mdash;Gwain, Christophina, John Boy and Anna. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins referred to the fact that Stan probably intended to retire in the not too distant future because of the nature of his illness. I only wish that that had been his luxury, in particular, because he was a politician just like Senator Collins and I and he would have enjoyed the ensuing politics of the subsequent changes. The Labor Party in the Northern Territory has already endorsed another one of Senator Collins's proteges&mdash;a well known Aboriginal footballer, Mr Maurice Rioli. He has family links with the electorate and I am sure he will make a good candidate for this coming election. I am pleased that my own Party, the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party, has also entered into the political game that now has to be played in the filling of this particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pre-selection process for the seat of Tiwi in my party was concluded this evening. It was concluded, with a great deal of sophistication and a democratic process whereby it attracted a number of candidates for pre-selection. In fact, there were four candidates, all now quite publicly recognised and known. They were Mr Jimmy Tipungwuti, Mr Marius Purantatameri, Mr Teddy Portaminni, and the successful candidate for the Country-Liberal Party pre-selection, Mr Bernard Tipiloura who, coincidentally, is the uncle that Senator Collins referred to earlier of the late Stan Tipiloura. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, I wish Bernard Tipiloura well in the election. I am sure that the ensuing election campaign is one that Stan Tipiloura would have relished watching and participating in, as I am sure that both Senator Collins and I will both be active during this coming election campaign as with our colleagues from both sides of politics in the Northern Territory. Certainly I am pleased tonight to join the comments of Senator Collins. We have both lost a friend. Parliament, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and the Northern Territory have lost a very fine politician. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish tonight to refer briefly to the events which occurred in Canberra last weekend. I refer to the dedication of the Vietnam veterans' memorial, an event that I was very pleased and honoured to be able to attend. The Senate has passed a motion commenting upon the event and congratulating the organisers and I, too, share that sentiment. It was a most well organised event which could not have been easy with so many people coming from so many places&mdash;many of them arriving no doubt as events were about to take place. In some ways, it was almost an understated event, which added to the emotion of it, and there was a simplicity about it that everybody felt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just standing and watching the 504 flags carried past representing those who died in Vietnam was indeed a very moving experience for everybody. That was how I felt about it. One can only conjecture how those who were actually involved must have felt, but it was very obvious that it was a weekend of great emotion, tears, memories, reunions, pride, joy, sharing and the reliving of incidents that occurred. There was the sound of the Iroquois helicopters overhead that, I think, made an impression on all of us who heard them. King O'Malley, in 1911, said at the launching of the international design competition for this, the national capital of Australia, `This city must be the finest capital city in the world'.I think we can say to him that that has turned out to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are the memorials, the great monuments and the beauty of this city, and it is the symbol of our federation. But it is the people who give it its warmth and charm, as  was very apparent last weekend. I could not tell you them all tonight, but there are just so many stories of the role played by the police, the taxi service, the families who took veterans into their homes, looked after them and drove them around, stories of the people just out and about who saw them here and there and offered them lifts from one place to another. There were the members of Lions and Rotary who got up early and provided breakfasts at the dawn service for those who were there, and there were many other stories that could be told. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to express my appreciation for the preceding adjournment speeches which have just been presented by Senators Collins, Tambling and Reid. I think we have been deeply moved by what we have heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My speech tonight relates, perhaps in an ironic way, to the last speech. I rise tonight to express my concern, and I hope that many other honourable senators share this concern with me, at the rising tide of replica weapons which are being offered for sale in this country. Indeed, far from merely expressing concern, I want to draw attention to what I consider to be a distressing and also dangerous piece of marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A number of honourable senators have fought in various wars for this country and have demonstrated a degree of courage which, thankfully, is rarely required of a country's citizens. They are in no doubt about the killing capacities of weapons of war. Just this last weekend we have seen a reminder of the tragedies of war, and thankfully a healing time for those tragedies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it then that people seem ready to accept as legitimate marketing exercises and profit making ventures the selling of replica weapons? It may well be argued that a replica gun cannot kill, and that is correct. But, in my opinion, a replica gun is still related to the original by way of its symbolic value. I remember well the bewilderment of a prisoner, whose name was Francois, when he received a three-year sentence for armed robbery. He protested, `But it was only a water pistol'. Guns and their replicas demonstrate that the violent resolution of conflict, which has its ultimate expression in war, is legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, replica guns are not the only form in which this dubious trade demonstrates itself. A constituent, who is also an old friend, Mr Bill Bradbury, rang my office recently to complain about a brochure which was tucked into many weekend papers in Western Australia. The brochure offered for sale at extraordinary prices&mdash;some $195&mdash;replica knives. I am not sure that I know what a replica knife is. I do not think it is made of rubber. Surely, it is still a knife. The particular well known company which specialises in marketing collectibles is offering a set of knives comprising one each of the most famous commando and strike force knives of World War II. There is the famous Australian knuckleduster SAS knife, a German knife and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise three major objections about this piece of marketing. The first is that it is seeking to cash in on a certain ghoulish interest in war. For those who fought in World War II and in Vietnam, such a knife may have been a valued piece of survival equipment or a potentially lethal weapon in the hands of an enemy. I doubt that anyone here would want to own a replica of that. Perhaps those who fought may well value the genuine article as a souvenir, and it is not for me to gainsay their right to such a memento. However, I believe that such replica items can only foster a sick attitude to war, as something to be glorified and dwelt over, which I am sure no-one who has been to war would want to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second objection is that a replica knife, unlike a replica gun, can still kill. The knives in question are advertised as being the same as the originals in size as well as design&mdash;some 12 inches long. In this country we have a growing concern about crime&mdash;violent crime in particular&mdash;and about crime involving weapons. Does it make sense then for companies to be marketing extra weapons to be kept in the home?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a major problem with domestic violence. A significant number of people are murdered each year in acts of domestic violence&mdash;mainly wives. Do we, then, want to put extra weapons into the home&mdash;weapons which may appear to some as ornaments but which to others may fall easily to hand in a heated dispute? We are also at a stage where there is, regrettably, an increasing incidence of breaking and entering into houses. The possibility of assault and assault causing fatal damage is much greater if there are weapons easily at hand on display. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to raise the question of policing in relation to these replica knives. In Western Australia, anyone who carries a knife in public is liable to be charged by the police. That is as it should be. We do not want to live in a society where people routinely carry weapons. Nonetheless, society's double standards encourage weaponry and, as young boys seem more responsive to this than other groups, this makes them vulnerable not only to crime but also to police harassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, if one has paid $195 for a replica World War II knife and it is ready to hand on display in the lounge room at home, is it an ornament or a lethal weapon? The original was made to protect service people from death and to inflict death on an enemy. Is the replica somehow innocuous by virtue of its being a replica? I think not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My predecessor, Senator Vallentine, proposed in this chamber a Bill to stop the marketing of war toys. I would hope that we include these expensive war toys in the provisions of such a Bill when it is reintroduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the adjournment debate yesterday I brought to the Senate's attention the case of seven children from the Coffs Harbour region. I did so from information supplied to my office several weeks ago. More recently I received another package in the mail which tells a story about another region of Australia&mdash;the Mitchell Valley, Lindenow, near Bairnsdale in East Gippsland, Victoria. Contained in that package was a report entitled `Toxicology of Pesticides in use in the Mitchell Valley'. That was a study undertaken by the Mitchell River Valley Rural Safety Awareness Group in response to a significant local concern about aerial spraying in close proximity to the Lindenow Primary School, Pre-school and the Infant Welfare Centre. While the report goes into some detail about the toxicity of 66 insecticides, 95 herbicides and 37 fungicides, it conveniently ignores the question of aerial spraying in the district, despite the fact that 41 per cent of chemical application in the area is from the air.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Needless to say, the people who first raised the issue are totally dissatisfied and frustrated with the lack of response to the issue and have requested help from the Democrats to expose this practice and the detrimental effects that it is causing throughout Australia. The story covers a 12-month period between March 1990 and June 1991 during which there were four separate instances of aerial spraying near those schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 March 1990, lorsban, an organophosphate, and a poison of S6 rating, was aerially sprayed close to the pre-school. The Directress of the pre-school locked the children inside and sealed the doorways and vents with towels. Play equipment was then washed down to prevent any possible dermal absorption of the chemical. It took three months to find out from authorities what had been sprayed. When inquiries were made concerning the toxicity of that chemical from that same authority, a print-out of the chemical container label was the only information available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 June 1990, lime and potash was being applied to the paddock directly below the pre-school. The updraught was such that the pre-school was totally enveloped in a white cloud. The pre-school building was not visible 50 metres away. There was concern that this cloud would reach the school. At the pre-school the children were locked inside, but this did not stop the children from being affected. The children's and teachers' eyes were red and smarting and those asthmatic children present were particularly affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 November 1990, sumicidin was aerially sprayed near the pre-school. This is a synthetic pyrethroid, an S6 poison. Precautions were once again taken to try to eliminate possible contamination by that chemical. On 5 June 1991, ronilan and sumicidin were aerially sprayed near the pre-school and school. Spray was seen drifting towards the school while the children were in attendance. On that morning children were not in attendance at the pre-school, but the Infant Welfare Centre was open for young mothers and babies to attend. Play equipment at the pre-school was washed down for the afternoon session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local initiatives and actions were taken on all of the above occasions. However, because of the complacency of the authorities concerned, the threat of recurrence remains. In addition, concerns have been raised for children who have been travelling on school buses through the vegetable growing area in this vicinity. Aerial spraying occurs during the vegetable growing season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chemicals used in the Mitchell Valley are registered for use and are quite legal, but the toxicology data available suggests that health problems are associated with their use and that the chronic or long terms effects remain unknown. The acute effects or short term problems associated with chemical exposure often go undiagnosed and are not considered to be serious but still cause great discomfort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty known compounds and 76 different chemicals are in use in vegetable production in the Mitchell River Valley area. The synergistic or cocktail effect of these chemicals is of great concern, as research has not been done in this area. It is a fact that the effect of chemicals on developing children remains unknown as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those chemicals used in the Mitchell Valley have a high toxicity rating, as is borne out by the report of the Safety Awareness Group. Spraying often occurs on Saturday mornings near the pre-school and the school. As the many chemicals used there are of high toxicity and have a long half-life, contamination of the grounds of the pre-school and school is seen to be a problem if spray drift occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From information on the particular products that we have gained from the chemical companies, they have continually emphasised that their chemicals should not enter watercourses and domestic water supplies. However, this has not been adhered to&mdash;and I would suggest it is very difficult to ensure that it can be adhered to&mdash;because of the closeness of the Mitchell River to the vegetable farms. The Mitchell River is one of the main tributaries of the Gippsland Lakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Response from government departments in Victoria has been such that, because laws have not been broken, they have been unable or unwilling to act in any effective capacity. The Victorian health department has ignored the situation. The education department refuses to get involved. Yet the concerns of ordinary people are, of course, very real. A member of the National Health and Medical Research Council said he would not like to send his children to the school in Lindenow because of the chemicals used in the vicinity. A health surveyor in the area had his job threatened if he continued his involvement in endeavouring to expose the problem. Women in the area, including many vegetable growers' wives, have privately expressed their fears. But, because of the small, closed community, public support has not been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package that I received which contained this information also included a copy of a letter dated 14 February 1992 to the Hon. Ian Baker, MLA, the Minister for Food and Agriculture in the Kirner Labor Government. The final paragraph of the letter sums up the frustration being felt by an increasing number of people throughout rural Australia. I will conclude by quoting that final paragraph, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel you and your department have overlooked our main concern. That is the exposure on four occasions in the 12 month period&mdash;1990/91.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let it be stated that this is not the first time locals have complained&mdash;this is the first time we have taken issue on the matter! We find it to be completely unsatisfactory that each time they aerial spray, the children have to be taken indoors or some defensive action has to be taken. What is the department planning to do to address this ongoing problem?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the report was published we have had access to more comprehensive information and health data on many of the compounds used in the Mitchell Valley. It is extremely disturbing to note that many have been banned overseas and/or severely restricted for agricultural use. This gives cause for concern also in relation to the far reaching effects on ecosystems; in particular the Mitchell River and Gippsland Lakes environment. We have enclosed this information for your perusal and comment. We would like to know why it is that in Australia, and in particular in Victoria, these chemicals are used on a regular basis in food production and adjacent to urban areas?</PARA>
<PARA>This is yet another of the continuing saga of contributions that have been sent to me by Australian citizens who are concerned that their voice is not being heard in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my condolences to those of Senator Collins and Senator Tambling. Tonight I wish to raise the issue of a report in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> relating to a decision of the Australian Press Council. As some honourable senators would know, I am not in the habit of criticising the media for the job that it does. Nor am I someone who runs to the Press Council with complaints about misrepresentation. In fact, to my knowledge, I have never referred anything directly to the Press Council, though I must admit that I have suggested to some people who have been concerned about how they have been presented in the media that they always have available the avenue of referring their concern to the Press Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I must admit that I am absolutely amazed that the Press Council has decided that it upholds the right of newspapers and magazines to publish pictures which it says many readers will find `undoubtedly offensive'. It is reported that the Press Council's findings are likely to be used as a benchmark in future Council hearings when the question of taste is balanced against the freedom of the press. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I do not lightly speak about an issue relating to freedom of the press. But I speak about a particularly gross and offensive photograph on the cover of the March <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS> magazine which shows a naked woman in a particularly sexual position wearing a dog collar around her neck. Clearly, that photograph is more than offensive. It is an absolute insult to 51 per cent of the population of this country. I am pleased to say that the magazine has actually been withdrawn in Western Australia in accordance with a State Government regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I would, of course, uphold the principle of freedom of the press, I find it offensive&mdash;I am sure that the vast majority of women around the country will find it quite unacceptable&mdash;that the Council can rule in favour of the publication of photographs because they are in context with an accompanying story. The accompanying story was `Woof! More wild animals inside'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that Australia has a higher than average reputation in terms of violence against women, particularly sexual violence against women. Here we have the Australian Press Council upholding the right of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS> magazine not only to publish this photograph but to continue to publish such offensive photographs. The Press Council says that it is okay to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how the Press Council has come to its decision. I went to the trouble of finding some information about the Press Council. I have obtained a Press Council document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aims, Principles, Constitution and Complaints Procedure</EMPHASIS>. In a summary of how it hopes to operate, the Press Council states quite categorically that the industry wanted a Press Council because `it had come to accept that there was a need for a body to act as watchdog over the ethical standards of the press'. If the Australian Press Council thinks it is ethical for a magazine to have a naked woman with a dog collar on the front page, or anywhere else, in a magazine that is generally available and is displayed for all and sundry to see, I am not quite sure why it bothers to publish anything about ethics. I cannot see that there is anything ethical in presenting women in such a vulnerable and demeaning light.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Press Council goes on to say in point 7 of its statement of principles:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A newspaper has a wide discretion in matters of taste&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I would agree with that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but this does not justify lapses of taste so gross as to bring the freedom of the press into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA>Is the Press Council really suggesting that photographs such as the one that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS> magazine of March this year are so acceptable that they can proliferate in the Australian media? I certainly hope not. But the Press Council has lost the opportunity even to comment on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In point 8 the Press Council says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The publication of material disparaging or belittling individuals or groups by reference to their sex, race, nationality, religion, colour, country of origin or intellectual or physical disabilities is a breach of ethical standards.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot see that the front page of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS> magazine is anything else by a breach of ethical standards. Quite clearly this material is grossly disparaging and belittling to groups&mdash;as I said, 51 per cent of the population&mdash;by reference to their sex. I do not care whether there is a story inside <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS> magazine about animals or anything else. This was a photograph of a naked woman with a dog collar around her neck. Quite clearly, the Australian Press Council cannot be bothered to read even its own criteria and principles when making a judgment on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area in which the Press Council is in breach relates to the claim in point 10:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If material damaging to the reputation or interests of an individual, corporation, organisation or specific group of people is published, opportunity for prompt and appropriately prominent reply at reasonable length should be given by the newspaper concerned, wherever fairness so requires.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot think of anything much more damaging than this photograph. If the Press Council were to uphold its own principles&mdash;principles that it does not seem to be interested in&mdash;I believe that quite clearly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS> magazine should, at the very least, have been asked to give a reply. The material is clearly damaging to both the reputation and the interests of a specific group&mdash;that is, women&mdash;and therefore a prompt and appropriately prominent reply should have been given by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People</EMPHASIS> magazine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will be writing to the Press Council to ask at least for a copy of how it came to make the judgment that this particular photograph is acceptable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) ANSTO placed two separate newspaper advertisements during May on its work in nuclear medicine. The first advertisement was placed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 12 and 14 May, while the second (the subject of Senator Sowada's question) was placed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 19 and 21 May and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 26 May. That completed the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The decision to place these advertisements was taken in early May by ANSTO's Executive Director, as part of ANSTO's overall public relations program.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) ANSTO and its predecessor, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, have placed advertising material in print media from time to time for many years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Government is not privy to consultations between the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) and Australian companies. However, on 8 April 1992, Austrade received through its Washington office, a UN tender for the supply of demining kits to UNTAC. The tender was faxed to Australian firms with a known capacity or registered interest in this area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data are not available on the assets of non-pensioner aged persons and it is not possible, therefore, to provide an accurate and up to date estimate of the likely cost. Based on numbers affected when the assets test was introduced in 1985 and making several adjustments for changed circumstances since that time, a possible order of magnitude is in the vicinity of $55 million in a full year for the Department of Social Security (DSS) alone. This excludes the cost&mdash;about another $10 million&mdash;of applying only the income test to current part-rate assets-tested pensioners. These estimates are likely to be on the low side, because data from the Australian Taxation Office indicate that there are many more persons of age pension age who have taxable income below the pension income limits but have not claimed a pension. The above estimate does not take into account behavioural effects of persons rearranging assets to avoid the income test. The cost to the Department of Veterans' Affairs of removing the assets test for veterans aged 75 and over would be in addition to the figures quoted above, but cannot be calculated by DSS.</PARA>
