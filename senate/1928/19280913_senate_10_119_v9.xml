          <para>- I lay on the table the report of the Tariff Board  on  the subject of a request for increased duty on sewing threads and sewing cotton. The report is very extensive, but a large portion of it consists of a summary of the evidence. A number of copies of the report have been typed for the information of honorable senators, but the summary of evidence was so lengthy that time did not permit of its being also typed. The summary, moreover, is not essential to an understanding of the report. </para>

            <para>. - The principal feature of this measure is the repeal of the provision under which land tax has previously been collected on show grounds where machinery, stock and produce are displayed for the benefit of agriculture generally. This amendment of the principal act is, I think, long overdue. The other clauses simply tighten up the present machinery in relation to the appeal board, and determine the actual time in which the tax has to be paid when a decision by the board has been reached. As it is largely a machinery bill, I do not think there is any necessity for me to discuss it further. </para>

            <para>. - This measure is the result of one of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Moving Picture Industry. When the report of that commission was under consideration the Government indicated that in order to carry out certain recommendations of the commission it would be necessary to increase the duty on imported films. At that time it was thought that the increase would be a halfpenny a lineal foot. But this measure provides for an increase of only one farthing a lineal foot. When discussing the motion for the adoption of the royal commission&#39;s report I stated that unless the Government or the motion picture exhibitors guaranteed that the cost would not be handed on to picture patrons I would not support a higher duty. It is estimated that by imposing an additional one halfpenny a lineal foot  on imported films, the sum of &#163;44,000 annually will be collected, although according to page 14 of the report the commission suggested that only &#163;10,000 was required annually to provide a prize for the best Australian picture produced. One or two of the commission&#39;s recommendations will cost more than that; but my principal concern at the moment is to ascertain who is to bear the cost of this additional impost. At the time of which I am speaking, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Victor</inline> Wilson, who is  president  of the Motion Pictures Distributors&#39; Association, was reported in the press as having said that the extra cost would have to be passed on to picture patrons, and I do not think that statement has ever been contradicted. </para>

              <para>- I admit it would not be an easy matter; but there are sometimes ways of overcoming such difficulties. It may be that &#163;d., or even Id., will be added  to the charge for admission. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, did not say who would bear the cost. I regard the picture show as the poor man&#39;s theatre. It provides him with recreation at a comparatively low cost, and, where the censorship is strict, with much information of educational value. I do not want to see that class of entertainment made any dearer to the people of Australia, many of whom are unable to pay the high prices charged for admission to the ordinary theatres. </para>

            <para>. - It was my privilege to be a member of the Royal Commission on the Motion Picture Industry, on whose recommendation the Government has acted in proposing to levy an additional duty on imported films. In preparing its report, the commission desired, not so much to protect the Australian industry - because it was realized that an additional <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> a foot duty on films would not establish the film industry in Australia on a sound footing - but, rather, to find the best means of financing its recommendations relating to awards of merit, additional censorship provisions, and other matters. So far as was possible, the commission ascertained the cost of these things, and concluded that an additional duty of &#163;d. a foot would be adequate to meet the situation. The commission felt that it would be unfair to ask the general taxpayers of Australia to pay for the additional facilities recommended; it considered that these were matters for the film industry itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has referred to a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Victor</inline> Wilson, who, on behalf of the Motion Picture Distributors&#39; Association in Australia, is reported to have said that any additional duty would be passed on to the picture showmen. That matter was not overlooked by the commission. If the distributors took that stand the showmen, many of whom even now are struggling to make a bare existence, would probably have to bear the whole of the additional burden. The committee desired to avoid that. Later, as a result of inquiries made by the Government, it was seen that an extra duty of <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> a foot would yield more than was required, that an additional }d. a foot would be sufficient for all requirements. The Government was also influenced in its decision to increase the duty by only &#163;d. a foot by an assurance given by . the motion picture distributors that in that case no additional charge for films would be .imposed on the picture showmen. The distributors felt that the advantages which would accrue to them from the carrying out of the recommendation of the Commission - greater expedition in getting films through the censorship, and the establishment of an appeal board - were such that they would not need to pass on the extra duty of1/4d. a foot. In view of that assurance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> need have no fear that the patrons of picture theatres will be called upon to pay higher admission prices because of the imposition of this duty. The members of the Film Commission acquiesced in the proposal of the Government to make the duty13/4d. a foot. </para>

          <para>.- This bill is the result of a law case which, in a sense, prevented the intention of this Parliament from becoming operative insofar as the imposition of certain timber duties was concerned. A few months ago a considerable discussion took place in this chamber as to the necessity for giving added protection to the timber industry of Australia, and as a result of that discussion increased duties were passed. The matter was taken to the High Court and, consequent upon the decision of that court, the duties could not be imposed on certain timbers, and the industry did not receive the relief intended. As the bill endeavours to remove an anomaly I do not object to it. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KINGSMILL</inline>(Western Australia) &#91;3.38). - There is a point arising out of this matter that, perhaps, the Government and the Customs Department may consider unimportant, but to which, I think, attention should be called. The effect of the measure which we are considering is to narrow the field of operations of certain concessions in duty to a species of redwood, <inline font-style="italic">Sequoia sempervirens,</inline> which was not specifically described when the Tariff Bill was brought down. &#39; As there are a number of timbers known to the trade as redwood, amongst them one which comes from a British Dominion, we have the spectacle of this Government giving a preference to a foreign nation as against a BritishDominion - a peculiar position.. I do not know whether it occurred inadvertently or inadvertently. The first intimation I had of the anomaly came to me accidentally, when I had the pleasure a few weeks ago of meeting and welcoming the Empire Forestry Conference to Australia. Among other delegates I had the pleasure of meeting the Head Forester for British North Borneo. That gentleman asked me to put him in touch with the Australian Customs authorities in order that he might point out the injury that would be done to British North Borneo, a British Dominion, if the tariff then contemplated came into operation. Only yesterday I received a letter from him on this subject, and I take from it the following extract - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>With reference to your very kind promise of assistance relative to securing an adjustment or reduction of the Australian tariff on North Borneo timbers imported into Australia, I append herewith the reasons why North Borneo timber should receive preferential treatment. </para>
          <para>It will be noted that under sub-items (f), (g) and (h), American redwood has an advantage of 4s. per 100 cubic feet against North Borneo timber, while under sub-item (l) the disadvantage amounts to6s. Gd. </para>

        <para class="block">The writer of this letter is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> G. Keith, a forester of very high qualifications, and one who obviously has very much at heart the interests of the country which he represents. He goes on to speak of the trade relations between British North Borneo and Australia, and points out that British North Borneo is one of the very few countries with which, in our commercial relations, we have a favorable trade balance. It appears that we are now, by this legislation, doing our best to destroy it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keith</inline> spoke as the accredited delegate of British North Borneo to the Empire Forestry Conference - a gathering which I welcomed, not merely because of its scientific, but because of its economic significance.

          <para>The effect of the discrimination against North Borneo timber in the new Australian tariff is viewed with much concern by my Government. The result of the increased duties must mean that the development of business with Australia in North Borneo sawn timber will be restricted, if not destroyed. </para>

          <para>Further, the restriction of sawn timber shipments (the principal cargo offering) will seriously affect the prospects of the steamers at present on the Australian Sandakon run. and this again will affect the maintenance of trade relations with Australia and North Borneo. The timber of North Borneo is: a product of the British Empire, but pays the same duties as timber of foreign countries, whereas California redwood, an American timber, enjoys a preferential tariff. I understand that California redwood is used mostly for interior finish, and I would say that, for interior uses, it is no better suited than the so-called Borneo cedar (red and white  seraya). </para>
          <para>Borneo timbers have been imported into Australia for over twenty years, and never once have borers, their  larvae  or  pupae  in -any live form, been found in them. This fact will be vouched for by the Quarantine Departments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, or Queensland. I would say that every stick of timber leaving North Borneo for Australia is inspected by the North Borneo Forestry Department, and no timber is permitted to be exported unless it conforms to a standard that will be passed by Australian Government inspectors. I would also inform you that every shipment of timber is accompanied by a certificate stating that the timber is free of borers. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, I would say that as British North Borneo softwoods are meritorious, free from insect infection, supply a want of softwoods in Australia us well as being a product of the British Empire, they should have a preference over the timber of the American Philippines, and a preferential or at least equal treatment to California redwood in the matter of import duty. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keith</inline>advances another argument in support of his contention that Australia should give North Borneo reasonably decent treatment. He points out that under the North Borneo customs tariff, flour, the principal article which we export to the East, is allowed in free of duty. This I submit, is a friendly gesture made by the Government of North Borneo towards Australia. Contrast this with our gesture to Java in regard to the duties on coffee when the last tariff was under discussion. Fortunately, at my instigation, on that occasion we were able to prevent the Government&#39;s proposal from being given effect. We cannot afford to antagonize those countries to whom we must look for the sale of our surplus produce in the years to come. I suppose that it is of little use for me to oppose this bill, so I shall content myself with entering my protest against this policy of antagonizing countries, with whom we should do all that is possible to improve our trade relations. Borneo, Java and the great islands of South-Eastern Asia obviously offer the best market for Australian produce. We should not do anything to antagonize them as we have done by the duty on bananas, by an embargo on the importation of foreign sugar, by an attempt to impose a duty on coffee, and in many other ways. If we continue this policy, they will refuse to accept our produce, or at least they will impose heavy duties on it. </para>

          <para>. - I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> and protest against a preferential duty being given to California redwood, and also timber products of the American Philippines, where it is produced under black labour conditions. This bill will allow that timber to be imported in Australia at a lower rate of duty than is imposed on similar timber from British North Borneo, a portion of the British Empire. That country is a good customer for our flour, butter and dried fruits, and we should do all that is possible to extend our trade relations in that direction. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> has pointed out, this bill penalizes British North Borneo by giving preferential treatment to a foreign competitor. British North Borneo allows Australian flour to be imported duty free. </para>

            <para>-  Botanically  it is not a cedar; but it is known in the trade as cedar, so I am practically certain that it would not fall within the designation of redwood as established by the court in a recent case. This bill will leave the  position in regard to Borneo redwood exactly as it is at present. Although the court&#39;s decision may have been perfectly sound, its effect has been to admit certain classes of timber in at a rate of duty which this Parliament never intended should be applied to them. One hesitates to criticize the judgment of any court, but every one knows that there are such things as white Baltic and red Baltic. </para>

            <para>- The whole of the trouble has arisen in a very simple way. Although this particular timber came from America, it was the intention of Parliament, and clearly for good and sufficient reasons, to allow a lower rate of duty on it because we have in Australia no equivalent for it. I do not suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> suggests that Borneo so-called cedar is equivalent to, and could be used for, the same purposes as American redwood. </para>

But there are particular uses to which the latter is put for which, I venture to say, the cedar would be useless ; and it is chiefly for those particular purposes that the Californian redwood is used. I am practically certain that this bill will leave Borneo redwood exactly where it is at the present time. </para>

            <para>- The question of whether or not we should extend to Borneo redwood the special consideration extended to Californian redwood is outside the scope of this particular bill. It may be a matter for consideration at some future date, but it is unquestionably our duty to block up the hole in the tariff which the decision of the court has made. I am not prepared to say that the customs officers in their wisdom have taken the best course of doing it, but the best means of enabling this particular timber, which is undoubtedly the timber Parliament had in mind when the duties were altered, to come in at the lower rate of duty may be to give it its botanical name. </para>

          <para>. - I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> has said. Honorable senators will recollect that the timber duties were debated at great length in both chambers, and that it was decided to place a substantial duty on Baltic timber, some of which is red in colour, because it came into competition with Australian hardwoods. At the same time, it was decided not to increase the duty on Californian redwood. The court, however, subsequently decided that Baltic pine was a redwood, and consequently the increased duty could not apply to it. The bill we have before us is simply to give Baltic timber its botanical name so that a differentiation can be made between it and Californian redwood and so that it will not come into Australia at a rate of duty lower than that which this Parliament intended to place upon it. </para>

The fact that Baltic pine was being used where Australian hardwoods could be used, was really what led Parliament to increase the duty on this class of timber. It was evident to all honorable senators that unless the duties on Baltic pine were increased, the timber industry of Australia would practically cease. </para>

            <para>- In anticipation of an increase in duty, heavy importations of Baltic pine were made, with the consequence that large stocks have accumulated in Australia. This, combined with the slackness in the building trade, has not enabled the timber industry of Australia to derive the full benefit of the increased duties. Furthermore, Baltic pine is still coming in and is being used for the purposes for which we proposed to exclude it. The duty intended to be applied to it cannot be applied until this bill is passed and the matter is put beyond all doubt. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">That recalls to my mind the fact that in an article on penny-a-word cables and telegrams, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henniker</inline> Heaton, who was the member for Canterbury, one of the most Conservative constituencies in England, wrote : &#34; I am afraid we shall have to wait for a Labour Government to do this.&#34; I should prefer a National Government in Australia to take the initiative in introducing Id. a word wireless messages; and I sincerely hope that we shall not have to wait the advent of a Labour Government before such a reduction is made. </para>
          <para>I am anxious that a select committee shall be appointed so that both sides of the case may be presented. For some time I have endeavoured unsuccessfully to obtain certain information concerning the profit and loss account of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, but for this I do not altogether blame the Government. It is difficult, however, to understand why the financial position of this company, in which the Government has a controlling interest and on the board of which the Government is represented, is not disclosed. If it were a private concern we should have no right to ask for the production of its balance-sheet; but as it is a company in which public money is invested the people have a right to demand detailed information concerning its financial position. I admit that the company is also engaged in the manufacture of wireless equipment, and in that branch of its activities is in competition with other companies, but information concerning the profits of that branch is not sought. As cheap wireless communication is of vital interest to the Commonwealth and to the Empire, Parliament has a right to know what profits are being made by a concern in which we are financially interested. The estimates of proposed expenditure of the Postal Department are made available to honorable senators, and the Postmaster-General also tables annually an informative report concerning the activities of the department under his control. If there is an item in the report of the Postal Department that requires elucidation one has only to write for information and it is willingly supplied. We should be able to institute a comparison between the working of the Beam wireless service and the telegraphic service in order to ascertain how those services are functioning. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Mclachlan)</inline> said he was not prepared to get the information I desire from Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, but in another place the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> in answer to a member of the Opposition said that he would inquire into the matter, and that if no objections were raised he would table a statement in the House. That differs materially from the announcement of the Honorary Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government in this chamber, who said that he would not try to get the information from a private company which is in competition with other companies engaged in a similar class of business. </para>
          <para>It seems absurd to say that the cable companies can compete with the Beam wireless service which has a monopoly. We should be in a position to examine the financial position of the company in order to ascertain if it is functioning effectively. I suggest a penny a word, because at that rate sufficient business would be attracted to make the service pay. I am not advocating a &#34; wild cat &#34; scheme. The Postmaster-General&#39;s report shows that the revenue from the Beam wireless and the cables, made up principally of terminal charges, is about &#163;228,000 per annum. Each year about 15,000,000 words are despatched between Australia and England by the two systems. The terminal charges in respect of some messages are 3d. a word, and in other instances  &#189;d.  a word ; a fair average would be  1&#189;d.  a word. At l&#163;d. a word the terminal charges on 15,000,000 words would amount to approximately &#163;100,000 per annum. When I spoke on this subject recently, I suggested that at the rate of Id. a word the traffic would soon increase to 50,000,000 words per annum; but having since read <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Geoffrey</inline> Clarke&#39;s articles, I am led to believe that it would not be long before 75,000,000 words per annum were transmitted between Australia and England. That would give a revenue of about &#163;312,000 per annum, and provide us with a profit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> said the other day that messages sent via Beam cost 3d. each for delivery. At the time I thought that the rate was rather high, but seeing that the cost of delivering telegrams in Australia is, according to the Postmaster-General&#39;s report, about 3d. a message, I am prepared to accept his figure. Notwithstanding the cost of 3d. a message for delivery, telegrams are still transmitted throughout the Commonwealth at a maximum rate of Id. a word. In the case of wireless messages between Australia and England, there would be, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Geoffrey</inline> Clarke points out, no necessity to have them delivered by special messengers; they could be delivered by the postmen as lettergrams are now delivered. If, instead of sending a letter* which would take, say, five weeks to reach the addressee in England, a wireless message were sent, it would not matter in most instances if an additional 24 hours were added to the few minutes required for its transmission by wireless. Each year, about 10,000,000 words are transmitted by lettergram in Australia at <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> a word. Those lettergrams are delivered by the postmen. For some years the Telegraph Department has been losing money, because only <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> or fd. word is charged for many of the messages sent. If the rate for all telegrams were Id. a word, the Telegraph Department would pay handsomely. Another factor in the loss sustained by the Telegraph Department is the competition of the telephone and wireless broadcasting. That matter is referred to in the report I have mentioned. Those losses would be turned into a profit if the traffic between this country and Britain increased to 75,000,000 words each year. </para>
          <para>I desire to refer now to the stand taken by the Government in connexion with the wireless and cable services. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mclachlan</inline> said some time ago that the Government did not intend to interfere with the directors of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. In reply to my question whether the Government was consulted by the directors of the company as to the rates to be charged for messages sent by the Beam system between Australia and Canada, I was informed that they were fixed with the Government&#39;s approval. The Senate should know what that means. Are we to understand that the company was prepared to send messages at lower rates, but that the Government insisted on the rates being kept up practically to the level of those charged by the cable companies ; or does it mean that the company wanted to charge higher rates, which the Government refused to sanction? The Government says that it is necessary to retain the cables for defence purposes; but it allows messages to be sent by the Beam service at rates which are 10 per cent, less than those charged by the cable companies. The result is that the Beam service is attracting the business. The Government, although not prepared to kill the Pacific cable outright, is evidently willing to allow it to be bled slowly to death. A considerable traffic is conducted annually between Australia and Canada by means of the Pacific cable. Recently, however, a Beam wireless service between the two dominions was inaugurated. With lower charges for messages by that system, the traffic will be attracted from the cable. Telegraphic messages between Australia and New Zealand are now sent by means of the Pacific cable, but it is probable that a wireless system will soon be in operation between those two dominions as a result of the recent visit of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk,</inline> of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited to New Zealand in that connexion. So soon as that service is in operation, it will attract business from the cable. It seems ridiculous to reduce the charges for messages to a rate which means a loss of revenue without any increase of traffic. So long as the Beam service will transmit messages at lower rates than are charged by the cable companies, it will continue to attract traffic from the cable ; but it will not attract new traffic. A business man wishing to send a message to England naturally prefers to pay ls. 8d. rather than 2s. a word. He, therefore, sends it by the Beam system. But he does not send any more messages than he would send at the higher rate. Similarly, if for week-end traffic, 5d., instead of 7-&#163;d. a word, were charged, there would be no additional traffic, whereas if the rate for all messages were reduced to Id. a word, every one would be wanting to send messages to friends in the Old Country. </para>

          <para>I am glad that the Government has given its support to the League of Nations, and the efforts to secure international peace. In my opinion, there is no better means of attaining peace among the nations than by cheapening the cost of communications between them. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> have stated that, before long, it will be possible for Australians to communicate by telephone with persons in England. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that such a means of communication between Australians and the Mother Country would be invaluable in settling Imperial problems. But I should like to know how many of our citizens would use such a telephone. I noticed a statement in the press that telephonic communication had been established between Great Britain and the United States of America, and that the charge was &#163;15 for a three-minute conversation. That would certainly be a prohibitive charge to the average Australian. If we had wireless communication between Australia and the United Kingdom, at the rate of1d. a word, that method would become, so to speak, the telephone of the general public. I consider that cheap wireless communication between Australia and the Motherland would do more to assist migration than the very expensive Development and Migration Commission. Recently I received a letter from the Rev. Canon Garland, of Brisbane, Queensland, who is the director of immigration for the Church of England in Australia, and a most enthusiastic supporter of Empire migration.

        <para>I have read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> your speech on the subject of the cheaper wireless rate, and I venture to hope you will be, like Jennifer Heaton, a forerunner in bringing about such a good work. </para>
        <para>I am chiefly interested in your advocacy because of my concern with immigration. I note that one of the chief influences at work hindering our own kith and kin coming from the Motherland to Australia is the fact of the great distance. This applies particularly to young people, whose parents regard the thought of their children going to the Antipodes as going almost out of touch with them finally. This may be no more than sentiment, but it often affects the decision of an intending young immigrant, and I believe of others, to go to Canada, as not being so far away. To make wireless so cheap that any immigrant not out of work could send home a message three or four times a year that would arrive before it had got stale, would be a silken thread drawing the Empire closer together. To us who are concerned, the cost of cabling is often prohibitive. A person like myself gets no assistance from the Federal Government, and if cabling could be brought within my expenditure, it would facilitate immigration. For example, I frequently find I nominated a family or an individual with prospects of work, but many months lapsing before the immigrant arrives conditions have changed, and my difficulties are intensified. Were wireless cheapened many of these difficulties could be avoided, because the work could be done by wireless instead of correspondence taking many weeks. </para>

        <para>Such a person is in a position to speak authoritatively on the subject. In assisting migration, wireless would tend to consolidate the British Empire. If we had in Australia 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 people speaking our language, and all imbued with the traditions and aspirations of our Motherland, it would certainly assist to weld together our great Empire. I feel very strongly on this matter because I am confident that the inauguration of cheap international communication would promote world peace. The frequent exchange of messages between country and country, engendering the spirit of cordiality, would assist to eliminate war. I understand that the Ministry believed that a cable system is necessary in time of war, but I suggest that it is far better to have cheap wireless communication that would obviate war than to have expensive cables which are necessary only in the event of war. </para>

            <para>. - Two amendments are proposed in this bill, the first being the substitution of the Australian coat of arms for the existing coat of arms. No honorable senator can advance any sound objection to that innovation. The design of the Australian coat of arms, properly executed, is most artistic, &#34; a thing of beauty and a joy forever.&#34; </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second amendment is a proposal to raise the schedule of fees, and against that 1 register my strong objection. A comparison of the scale of fees contained in the principal act, with that in the amending measure, discloses that it is proposed to increase patent fees by practically 100 per cent. It does not stop at that, for whilst there are only five items enumerated in the principal act, quite an extensive list is set out in the amending bill. The Government proposes to charge renewal fees on a sliding scale, from&#163;l to &#163;6. No unnecessary difficulties should be placed in the way of inventive genius. Instead, we should encourage the inventive capacity of our citizens in every possible manner. We should not tax brains, but that is what the imposition of these fees amounts to. It is proposed to increase to &#163;2 the fee of &#163;1 at present charged for application for a provisional protection. It must be realized that probably only 50 per cent, of the applicants for provisional protection are successful in their efforts, and that only about one in five obtain any financial advantage from their expenditure of labour and money. The new fees will be a hardship, particularly on the working section of the community. Many of our artisans endeavour to evolve schemes which will facilitate and cheapen the methods employed in the industries in which they are engaged, and this measure will militate against their efforts. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator also said that the original scale of fees was fixed 20 years ago and that in the interim the purchasing power of money has been reduced, which justifies an increase in the fees. The workers of the community have made many applications for increases of wages, but they have not obtained anything like an advance of 100 per cent., as is the case with the fees proposed in this measure. My principal objection is to the increase of 100 per cent, in the application fee for provisional protection. </para>

              <para>- I am glad to have the Minister&#39;s assurance. We are always grateful for the smallest crumbs that may fall from the luxurious table of Ministers. The fees are considerably higher than in the British scale. I dc not like to put forward conservative Britain as an example for progressive and democratic Australia, but I remind honorable senators that in the Mother Country where there is a population of 40,000,000 people at least, the application fee for provisional protection is &#163;1 as against &#163;2 in Australia, with a population of a little more than 6,000,000, In New Zealand the position is much better. There the application fee is 10s, In view of the statement of the Minister I have nothing more to say, except to express the hope that when the bill is in committee the fee proposed for provisional applications will be considerably reduced. </para>

            <para>. - A few weeks ago I received a letter on this matter from a prominent patent attorney in Sydney. I thought then that the arguments which he advanced would give me an excellent opportunity to state the position in the Senate, but I find to my surprise that exactly the same statement was sent to other honorable senators, and the Leader of the Opposition has placed the views of patent attorneys before the Senate. It is a matter of indifference to me, but I should have thought that, since the representations were made by a New South Wales Attorney, they should have been presented in this chamber by an honorable senator from that State. All I wish to say now is that I cordially endorse all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has said, and I congratulate the Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> upon his promptness in announcing that, in committee, the fee proposed to be charged for provisional protection will be reduced. It appeared to me, when I received the letter to which I have referred, that the Government would find it extremely difficult to justify its proposal to impose heavier penalties upon those who wished to register provisional patents. The fees for renewal are quite a different matter. Those charges do not come into effect before the expiration of the fifth year after the registration of the patent, and by that time the holder of it is in a position to know whether it is going to return him sufficient to make it worth while to pay the renewal fees. If it is not likely to be a profitable business he can drop it altogether, as so many do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has said that  80  per cent, of applications for provisional protection are not renewed. I should say that the percentage is considerably higher than that. I am delighted to know that the Government intends to adopt what has been the long established practice in Great Britain and give every encouragement to inventors and patentees in the early years of provisional protection. If in the course of a year or two the returns from a patent invention increase, it is not unfair that the renewal fees also should be increased. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has said, applications for provisional patents are, as a rule, made by artisans and mechanics. In not a few instances these inventors have exhausted their slender financial resources in the development of their ideas and sometimes they are forced to apply for financial assistance to persons whose chief concern is to make money out of a patent, regardless of the position of the inventor himself. It follows therefore, that if we can make the lot of these people easier, it will be better not only for themselves, but also for the Commonwealth. We should do all in our power to encourage those of our people who have an inventive turn of mind to put their talents to the highest use. Only in this way can we expect to overcome the many difficulties that confront us in the development of this country. I take exception to the proposed fees, but as the Minister has intimated that when the bill is in committee he will move amendments to modify them, I shall support the measure. </para>

The effect of this and the next amendment I shall move is to reduce the fee on lodging an application accompanied by a provisional specification from &#163;2 to &#163;1, and to increase the fee on lodging a complete specification after a provisional specification from f 1 to &#163;2. The Government having given consideration to the matter of fees, came to the decision that on the whole those proposed were reasonable. During the year 1927-28, the loss on the Patent Office was in the region of &#163;10,000, and it was deemed necessary that the fees should be increased if the office was to be self-supporting. But on giving the matter further consideration, the Government which has received representations from two Institutes of Patents Attorneys, has come to the conclusion that the fees on lodging provisional and complete specifications should be altered. The schedule as it stands provides for the payment of &#163;2 on lodging the provisional specification and &#163;1 on lodging the complete specification. The examination into the question of novelty does not take place until the complete specification is lodged, and it is thought to he reasonable that the higher fee of &#163;2 should not become payable until this examination is required to be made. It is proposed, therefore, that a fee of only &#163;1 shall be paid on lodging the provisional specification and a fee of &#163;2 on lodging the complete specification. </para><para>Amendment agreed to. </para><para>Amendment (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford)</inline> proposed - </para><para>That the figure &#34;  1  &#34; after the word &#34;specification,&#34; fourth occurring, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the figure  &#34;2&#34;. </para><para>SenatorNEEDHAM (Western . Australia) &#91;5.11&#93;. - At the first blush one would think that the Government had conceded a great deal by the amendment just made. It is certainly a concession because the effect of it is to leave the application fee the same as it is in the principal act; but the effect of the amendment now before the committee will be to add the &#163;1 token off the fee required on lodging an application accompanied by a provisional specification to the fee required on lodging a complete specification after a provisional specification. The applicant will, therefore, derive no material benefit from the alteration made by the last amendment. As I pointed out on the second reading the majority of applicants for patents derive no benefit from the fees they pay, because the number of successful inventions is about one in five. I think the Government might well concede the point of allowing the fee on lodging the complete specification after a provisional specification to remain at &#163;1. If the Minister will not accept that suggestion, I must ask the committee to reject his amendment. </para>

            <para>. -  The reduced fee on lodging an application accompanied by a provisional specification must afford some advantage to the applicant. His provisional patent will cover him until he has an opportunity to consult engineers and test the practical value of his patent, and if he is successful in doing so he is then in a better position to pay the increased fee required on lodging the complete specification. It costs a great deal more to administer the Patent Office to-day than it did when the original act was passed. The Leader of the Opposition knows that to-day the purchasing power of &#163;1 is only half what it was when the original act was passed. The fees payable under the original act do not cover the cost of administering the office and many years must pass before there is a substantial increase in the revenue from renewal fees. </para>
