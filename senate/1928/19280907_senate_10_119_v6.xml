                    <para class="block">Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce).</inline> On behalf of my colleagues and myself I wish to express our heartfelt regret at the. untimely death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lambert,</inline> and to extend to his widow our sincere sympathy in her bereavement. It is approximately twelve months since the Parliament first assembled in this, the National Capital of Australia, and during that short period the dread visitor of death has made his calls with regrettable frequency. To begin with, two very able and competent officers of the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> McGregor passed away. Then came the death of the Minister for Trade and Customs the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Pratten, and a few weeks ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> B. C. Corser, the member for Wide Bay, died. The Senate has also lost through death, since first we met here, the valuable services of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh, Senator Grant</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> The death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lambert,</inline> another member of the Legislature, makes a total of eight in the short period I have mentioned. </para>
                    <para>The deceased gentleman lived an active and useful life. He took a keen and prominent part in the industrial affairs of this country, in the higher sphere of municipal government, and in the still more important sphere of our parliamentary life. He has now passed away to his reward at an age when in the ordinary course of events one would expect to he enjoying the prime of life. It is indeed sad to mourn the loss of another comrade, and I am sure all honorable senators join with me in expressing regret, and in extending sympathy to his widow. We can only hope that the Great Arbiter of all our destinies will sustain and comfort her in her hour of trial. </para>

I was his senior by many years, but our birthplaces were within a few miles of each other, and I was able in. our early political struggles to watch the growth of his intellect which, backed by resolution and determination, might have carried him almost anywhere. Now he is no more. I join with other honorable senators in expressing sympathy with his widow in her loss. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lambert</inline> was in the prime of life, and had he lived, might have been of great service to his country. </para>
