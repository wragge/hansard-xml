                    <para>. - I intend to submit a request in respect of this sub-item, the effect of which will be to remove the differentiation now proposed. In my second reading speech I referred to the advisability of giving careful consideration to the effects of these proposed duties on our commerce with those countries with which we may expect to develop important trade relations. One of the markets which Australia might legitimately hope to secure is materially affected by this item. For many years we have been doing our best to antagonize the people living in the Dutch East Indies - chiefly in Java - which, by the way, is a very inadequate description of the fertile islands to which I refer. These proposed duties will particularly affect the business of the State which I assist to represent in this chamber. There appears to be a good deal of misunderstanding on the part of honorable senators and the general public, or, at all events, those people who have never visited Java, concerning the immense possibilities of that market. I do not wish to pose in any way as an opponent of the White Australia policy. I strongly approve of it, and there is nothing I know of in the general principles underlying that policy to prevent our taking full advantage of a market which providence has placed at our&#39; doors, though in doing so we shall be trading with people whom we rightly refuse to admit to Australia. Java is peopled not, as many think, by a governing race of tyrants and a subject race of slaves. It is inhabited by millions of what I might term peasant proprietors holding the land under one title or another and cultivating it intelligently. In them the spirit of independence has been developed to an extraordinary and laudable extent. I can assure honorable senators that an immense amount of money is waiting to be spent in that country. Australia should seek to develop that market. The people there are ready to buy our flour, butter, bacon, cheese, condensed milk, biscuits, preserved meats and fruits, to mention only a few Australian products that should be readily saleable in the Dutch East Indies. The fruits of the temperate zone, I may add, are very much appreciated in tropical countries. There is also a good market in South Eastern Asia for second class leather, the disposal of which&#39; has always been the despair of Australian tanners. Unfortunately, as I have said, we have always done our best to antagonize the people of the Dutch East Indies. Many years ago we imposed an embargo on sugar. When in those parts in 1917 I made inquiries on behalf of the Government of Western Australia as to  the  trade possibilities between that State and the Malay Peninsula. Mill-white sugar was then obtainable in Java at &#163;11 a ton but owing to the embargo we could get none of it. </para>

                        <para>- During my visit to those islands I ascertained that the trade possibilities were practically illimitable; but as the State Government which asked me . to make the investigations went out of office at about that time, nothing was done to develop it. I think it should be possible to build up an important trade between the western portion of the Commonwealth and the Malay Peninsula. The people there are becoming more accustomed to our products, and are learning to consume flour instead of certain native commodities. Unfortunately, we have neglected our opportunity, but I hope that it has not been altogether lost. It may be news to some honorable senators that certain interests have for some years been importing the worst class of American flour, which is shipped in barrels and then put up into packets, which are a successful imitation of those of certain prominent Australian firms. This American flour, disguised in that way, is being sold as Australian flour, so that not only are we losing trade but we are also losing our reputation. There appears to be an impression in some quarters that almost anything is good enough for the Oriental races. As a matter of fact, they have discriminating tastes, and are rather particular as to the class of goods which they buy. Chinese merchants deeply resent and never forget or forgive a trader who imposes upon them in any way. They expect to be able to buy articles of good quality, and also to be sure of regularity in supplies. For these reasons, and in order, if possible, to put an end to what appears to be a systematic policy of antagonizing the people of the Dutch East Indies, I suggest that this differentiation in the duties be removed. We do not grow coffee in Australia, and I do not see the need for this preference, especially in view of the fact that  in an earlier item we imposed under the British preferential tariff a duty of 6d. a lb. on butter, which is not imported from Great Britain. Let us compensate these people by allowing them to sell to Australia a. commodity which we cannot readily obtain elsewhere, and which is greatly appreciated and extensively used by the Australian people. I was rather amused at the statement in the report which the Minister read, to the effect that after many years the decrease in trade with Java amounted to only a few thousand pounds. Let me remind the Minister that if circumstances had permitted it, and if antagonism had not been .shown by Australia, instead of there being a decrease, the trade would have quadrupled. </para>

                    <para>. -  I understand that it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill&#39;s</inline> desire to dispense with any discrimination between Empire and foreign grown coffee. If this proposal is agreed to certain consequential amendments will be necessary. I stated yesterday, that discrimination has been shown because the Government recognizes the growing importance of some of our British Crown Colonies in which coffee is produced, and towards which it is desirable that a gesture of this character should be made. This has been done in the hope that it may lead to closer commercial relations and assist in establishing reciprocal preferences which would be of advantage to the Commonwealth, and to those countries with which such preferential arrangements may be made. In deference to what appears to be a strong feeling in favour of  the  proposal submitted  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> I may  say  that  the  Government do  not  intend  to  divide the&#34; committee on the request. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that it would. The intermediate tariff can be used only in connexion with imports from countries with which we have entered into a treaty, and as we do not import coffee from Britain the effect of striking out the paragraph would be that all coffee would be dutiable under the general tariff, There would then be&#39; no discrimination against any country. The necessary adjustment of duties could be made in another place and the schedule then returned to this chamber for its approval. I therefore suggest for the Government&#39;s consideration, that the position would be met for the moment  by  striking out the paragraph at the end  of  sub-item b. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that there is room for a considerable expansion. I have been puzzled by the very serious decline in the value of our exports of preserved milk. In the year before last they were valued at &#163;451,000. There must be some reason for the falling off. If we were to discriminate against the Dutch East Indies as the schedule proposes, there would be a grave danger of our exports to that country declining, particularly in regard to flour, butter and preserved milk, which are very important items. </para>

                    <para>. - When the schedule was passed by another place it was viewed with alarm in Queensland. At a largely attended meeting of the Rockhampton Chamber of Commerce which was held on the 15th December last, a unanimous protest was made, and Queensland senators were asked to do what they could to have the former position restored. The proposed preferential treatment means a differentiation against the Dutch East Indies to the extent of 50 per cent. That is sufficient to cause the complete stoppage of our importations of coffee from that country. </para>

                        <para>- Indian coffee is dearer than that which is imported from the Dutch East Indies. Therefore the Australian consumer would have imposed upon him an additional tax. The reply of the Dutch East Indies would inevitably be the withdrawal of their open-door policy. I do not think we can afford to take the risk. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has referred to the value of the trade which we do with them. At one time Holland supplied 55 per cent. and Australia 44 per cent. of their requirements of butter. The figures for 1926 show that Holland in that year exported to its dominions only 61/2 per cent. of its requirements of that commodity, while Australia supplied 93 per cent. I understand that the quality of butter which we  send there cannot be exported to London. That is an advantage which cannot be lightly foregone. Our imports of coffee in 1925-26 totalled 3,750,000 lb., of which the Dutch East Indies supplied 2,062,220 lb., and India 809,160. Our exports to the Dutch East Indies in 1926 were as follow :  - </para>

                    <para>. - I thank the Minister for the information he has supplied ; but it is vital that honorable senators should thoroughly understand the. position if they are to cast an intelligent vote for or against the proposed duties. The information given by the Minister is somewhat scanty. He said that the value of low-priced grades of this material was 2s. per lb. The proposed . general tariff is 50 per cent, and the alternative duty a flat rate of 4s. per lb. Honorable senators will thus see that the 50 per cent, ad valorem tariff will be supplanted by a 200 per cent, tariff on that particular grade of material. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that, if the tariff amounted to 1,000 per cent., it would meet with the honorable senator&#39;s approval; but I am trying to conserve the interests of his own constituents. It appears that, with regard to several items, persons who are compelled to buy lower-priced articles will be penalised much more heavily than wealthy individuals who can afford to purchase higher grades of goods. I do not intend to oppose the item, because I realize that that would be futile. However, I think that the committee is entitled to further information to justify the proposal for a general tariff equivalent to 200 per cent. </para>

In 1925-1926 the imports from the United Kingdom were &#163;90,531, and from other countries, &#163;80,091, a total of &#163;170,622. In 1926- 1927 the imports from the United Kingdom totalled &#163;93,345, and from other countries &#163;157,554. The imports under the heading &#34;Other countries,&#34; were chiefly from Japan, and they increased in two years from &#163;23,555 to &#163;157,554.  That  is to say in 1926-1927 they were more than six times greater than in 1924-1925.

                        <para>- I admit that I cannot at the moment give definite information regarding the value of the goods that come from Great Britain; but they are certainly of a better class than the Japanese goods, which are chiefly cotton. From Great Britain we receive woollen goods, materials that are -a mixture of cotton and wool, and, iri some cases, silk and artificial silk. The ad valorem duty on these goods is considerable, and the only way to give adequate protection to the Australian manufacturer is to accept the proposals now submitted. </para>

                    <para>. - The duty on British goods has been 20 per cent. It is proposed to increase it to 30 per cent., or 2s. 6d. per lb., whichever is the higher rate. Say the invoiced price of a pound of cotton material from Japan is 2s, If I double that and say that the lowest-priced goods manufactured in Great Britain should be worth 4s. per lb., it seems to me that the present British duty of 20 per cent, would be increased to somewhere between 60 and 70 per cent, ad valorem. Whether or not that large increase is warranted, I cannot say. </para>

                <para class="block">In 1925 the Tariff Board held a comprehensive inquiry into an application for increased duties on woollen piece-goods with the result that in the 1926 tariff, piece goods, woollen, or containing wool (but not including flannel), ordinarily used in the manufacture of outer clothing for human wear and weighing more than 6-J oz. per square yard, the invoice selling price of which did not exceed the equivalent of 3s. 4d. per square yard, were made dutiable at composite rates of ls., ls. 6d., 2s. per square yard and ad val. 30 per cent., 40 per cent., 45 per cent. The weight limit was inserted in order that light-weight, women&#39;s woollen dress goods, which are not manufactured to any great extent in the Commonwealth, should not be liable to the composite rates. This weight limit was agreed to by prominent Australian weavers, it being considered at the time that <inline font-style="italic">6i</inline> oz. was a fair line of demarcation between the goods, manufactured in Australia, and those not commercially manufactured here to any considerable extent. It was also considered that woollen piece-goods over 6&#163; oz. per square yard in weight, sold at 3s. 4d. per square yard or under, were detrimentally affecting the Australian industry, but that Australian weavers were able to compete with the imported goods invoiced at prices exceeding 3s. 4d. per square yard with only a slight increase in tariff, the rates being made 35 per cent., 45 per cent., 50 per cent: Experience of the working of these duties shows that they have not been fully effective; Australian weavers are not receiving sufficient orders to keep their mills working full time and have been forced to put off a number of operatives. In some cases it has been found that the weight of cloth has been reduced just under 6&#163; oz. thereby taking the goods out of Item 105 (e) (1) and escaping the composite duties. </para>

                        <para>- Of course in their own interests overseas manufacturers are always endeavouring to get around the provisions of our Customs Tariff Act, and at times they are very successful- in doing so. One cannot blame them. It has also been found that worsted and other men&#39;s woollen goods are being sold in Australia to-day at prices with which the Australian manufacturer cannot compete. Moreover, leading Australian  manufacturers are .of the opinion that certain goods which are imported into this country are being sold at prices less than the cost of manufacture in Great Britain, and the evidence suggests that United Kingdom manufacturers are either selling below cost of production to meet continental competition or using continental yarns.  Inquiries are being conducted by the representative of the Customs Department in Great Britain to ascertain whether goods are being correctly described and valued on invoices; also whether such goods are eligible for admission under the British preferential tariff. The extent to which importations of men&#39;s woollens are increasing is shown by the following figures , of imports for the six months ended 31st December, 1926, and the six months ended 31st December, 1927 : - </para>

                        <para>- Owing to the huge imports df textiles from the continent, the textile industry of Great Britain is in a very serious position. I read a few days ago that more than half the cotton-spinning and weaving companies operating in Great Britain worked &#39; at a loss last # year. British manufacturers who are displaced in their own markets by importations from the continent, must naturally seek an outlet for their products elsewhere, and consequently quantities of their goods are sent to Australia at very low invoice prices, which are certainly less than the cost of production. I am not saying that the same goods may not be sold by them in Great Britain at something below the cost of production. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that all the wool used in Australian factories is the product of Australia. There is some doubt about the origin of the wool used in imported textiles. The Australian woollen industry is of such importance to Australia that no hesitation should be shown in dealing with the position. Undoubtedly it warrants drastic action. The Australian weaving industry consumes large quantities of the product of the wool-growing industry and adverse competition not only affects the Australian manufacturer, but also deprives local workers of the employment which the tariff was designed to provide. It is proposed to reduce the weight limit at present appearing in the item to 6 oz. and eliminate any reference to price. This will mean that all woollen piece-goods, except flannel, ordinarily used in the manufacture of outer clothing for human wear, and weighing more than 6 oz. per square yard will pay the composite rates of ls., ls. 6d., 2s. per square yard and ad valorem 30 per cent., 40 per cent., and 45 per cent. These increases may appear to be very drastic, but it must be remembered that at the present time under the composite rates piece-goods invoiced at 3s. 4d. per square yard, pay more duty than similar goods invoiced at 5s. per square yard at 35 per cent. The great bulk of woollen piece-goods imported into Australia comes from Great Britain and on a line invoiced at a price equalling 10s. per square yard the increased duties will only amount to 6d. per square yard. In the circumstances, I am asking that the &#39; House of Representatives be requested to amend . Item 105 to provide for increased duties on certain woollen piece goods. </para>

                        <para>. - It is proposed to increase the duty from 1st July next on leather cloth from 5 per cent. British, 10 per cent, intermediate, and 15 per cent, general, to 20 per cent. British, 25 per cent, intermediate, and 35 per cent, general. I want to know if the manufacture of leather cloth is an accomplished fact in Australia; if not, whether there is sufficient evidence to show that machinery is being installed to manufacture with success this substitute for leather, and why the preference hitherto accorded to Great Britain has, to a great extent, disappeared. </para>

In previous tariffs the duties have been levied for revenue purposes. As honorable senators know, I am not in favour of duties that fail to encourage the establishment of industries in this country, but governments are prone to take the line of least resistance and therefore impose duties on certain commodities chiefly for revenue purposes. It is obvious that the industry for the manufacture of leather cloth has not yet been established in Australia, otherwise, we should have heard from those interested in it concerning the low rates of duties imposed in previous tariffs. We are now informed by the Minister that there is every likelihood of a company being formed for the manufacture in Australia of this class of goods. Can the Minister say where it will be established? </para>

                <para class="block">Within the last year or two a considerable amount of money has been invested by a company in Tasmania, and a smaller amount by a company in New South Wales in providing the necessary machinery and plant for the treatment of Australian furs, chiefly rabbit skins, which are made into what are known as coney seal skins. This is a highly skilled manufacturing process. At present it is almost entirely in the hands of German, Belgian, and French manufacturers who have been doing a large business with Australia for many years. Several British firms are also engaged in the same business but on a smaller scale. The Tasmanian company at the outset was faced with unlooked-for difficulties in securing the essential dyes for the production of a first-class article. These troubles were overcome last year through the action of the Government in granting permits for the importation of certain continental dyes so that the company might be in a position to demonstrate . its ability to produce a high grade article. There has been an excellent demand for its product during the last six months, but the company finds that continental manufacturers can land their products in the Australian market at a price slightly below the cost of production locally. I have been supplied with a full range of coney seal skins manufactured by the Tasmanian company. As honorable senators will notice they compare very favorably with the imported article of the same grade. The import figures show that there is an enormous trade in this class of goods. On the continnent the dyes cost 6s. 3d. per kilo as against 15s. in Australia. Peroxide of hydrogen is obtainable at 81/4d. per pound in Europe, against1s. 6d. per pound in Australia, and acetic acid, 99 per cent. glacial, costs 3s. 3d. on the continent compared with 2ls. in this country. These extra charges, as well as the higher wages paid and improved labour conditions obtaining in Australia, make necessary a reasonable amount of protection for the Australian industry. There is no industry of any importance in Australia that is not receiving the benefit of higher protective duties than I am asking for in this instance. Although the duties which I suggest will enable the company to carry on operations, they will not give it an opportunity to make excessive profits. This is not an instance in which a company &#34;proposes&#34; to start operations; the industry has been established for two years, and has during the last six months produced goods valued at &#163;22,000. If we were to send to Adolf Petzold, of Leipzig, the largest and best coney manufacturer in Germany, who has a staff of nearly 3,000, a consignment of 1,000 raw skins, he would make them into coney for &#163;37 10s., which is at the rate of 9d. a skin, whereas it would cost this company &#163;93 13s. 4d., or1a.10d. a skin, owing to the additional costs in Australia. The difference between the existing duties and those I propose are only sufficient&#39; to enable the company to meet overseas competition. </para>

                        <para>- It has been established only about two years, and the duties which are 15 per cent. British preferential, 15 per cent. intermediate, and 20 per cent. general, were imposed, I think, only for revenue purposes. This is a bona fide concern, and has already spent &#163;47,000 in erecting building and plant and conducting its operations. If Parliament will agree to my reasonable proposal, I am confident that the industry, which at present has a fairly substantial turnover, will become a very important one. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. If the duties on furs are increased to the extent proposed, and those on furred garments, which are 40 per cent. British preference, 50 per cent, intermediate, and 55 per cent, general, are allowed to remain, the request, if adopted, may not accomplish what the honorable senator desires ; furred garments may then be imported in place of furs. As I wish to look further into this matter, I ask that the consideration of the item be postponed. . </para>

                    <para>.- If the committee agrees to the postponement of this item, I trust the honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford),</inline> who has expressed some sympathy towards the request, will not allow his interest to wane during the period of postponement. The case submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is worthy of favorable consideration, as I understand that if the industry, which has been in existence for about two years, is forced out of business, about 400 workers who are directly and indirectly employed by it, will be added to the already large army of unemployed, and a large amount of -capital will also be rendered idle. </para>

                    <para>. - There has been some discussion in committee concerning the effect of a flat rate of duty, and the conditions under which these duties are imposed. The Minister to-day carried a request that under item 105, piece-goods, certain material weighing more than 6 oz. per square yard be dutiable at an ad valorem rate or at per square yard ls. British, ls. 6d. intermediate, and 2s. general tariff, whichever rate returns the higher duty. I am sure honorable senators do not realize the exact effect of duties fixed on that basis. The same principle is applied to cotton socks and . stockings for which the ad valorem .duties imposed are 30 per cent. British, 40 per cent. inter mediate, and 45 per cent, general tariff, or per dozen 6s. British, 8s. intermediate, arid 10s. general tariff, whichever rate returns the higher duty. For woollen socks and stockings, or socks and stockings containing wool the rates are 45 per cent. British, 55 per cent, intermediate, and 60 per cent, general tariff; or, per dozen, 8s. British, 10s. intermediate, and 12s. general tariff, whichever rate returns the higher duty. For such articles of silk or containing silk but not containing wool and n.e.i., the rates are 35 per cent. British, 45 per cent, intermediate, and 50 per cent, general; or, per dozen, 7s. British, 9s. intermediate, and lis. general tariff, whichever rate returns the higher duty. These flat rate duties are fairly high, and I contend that very few honorable senators realize their, actual  effect.  I submit for the information of the committee an exhibit marked &#34; D &#34; of &#34;Mazol&#34; children&#39;s unshrinkable cotton and woollen socks made in England, the invoice price of which is 8s. a dozen, and the flat rate of duty 8s. per dozen. The landed cost was 12s. 10d. a dozen, but under the new duty it is 17s. 7d. a dozen. The flat rate of duty under these proposals is 8s. a dozen, which is equivalent to 100 per cent, on children&#39;s socks of British manufacture. I also submit a sample of children&#39;s socks of all wool made in England, the invoice price of which is 5s. 9d. per dozen and the flat rate of duty 8s. per dozen, which is considerably over 100 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">Sitting suspended from 12.1^ to 2.15 p.m.</inline></para>

                        <para>- By way of interjection, an honorable- senator asks why Australian socks are not bought. I point out that whereas the local manufacturer can obtain his supplies of wool on the spot, the English manufacturer is obliged to pay freight both ways, wharfage dues at each end, shipping and other charges, and the duty. Thus the Australian manufacturer is placed at a distinct advantage, and he should be able to manufacture hosiery in competition with the English manufacturer without the assistance of a 100 per cent, tariff. I have already given particulars of certain lines of socks; but I still have other lines. One is a man&#39;s sock of English manufacture, which is worn by working men and farmers in the country. The invoice price is 5s. 9d., and upon it there  is a flat rate duty of 8s. a dozen. This line is peculiarly suitable for use by men, whose work is such that they require a cheap sock. The landed price previously was 9s. 7d. a dozen, but under the new duty it is 14s. 9d. a dozen. I am not advocating the cause of the foreigner, but it is well that honorable senators should be made acquainted with the position. The invoice price of a foreign manufacture sock that I have in my hand is 2s. 8-Jd. a dozen. Under the old duty it was lauded in Australia for 4s. a dozen. The landed price under the new duty is no less than 12s. lid. a dozen, the duty amounting to over 300 per cent. </para>

In times gone by, my. children wore socks, the quality of which was no better than this. The invoice price is 5s. Id. a dozen.. The landed price until recently was 8s. 8d. a dozen, but under, the new duty it is 16s. 2d. The flat rate of duty is 10s. a dozen. Thus we are asked to pay a duty of 200 per cent, greater than the price at which the article is invoiced. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The Wholesale Softgoods&#39; Distributors of South Australia are opposed to a flat rate of duty because they believe it will unduly increase the price of certain lines of hosiery and, incidentally, the cost of living, will prevent the public getting certain lines of hosiery that they require, and severely penalize them. It is our opinion that the Australian manufacturers of hosiery are not at present in a position to supply the needs of the buying public of Australia, both as regards quantity and fashion, and the imposition of a flat rate will have the effect of absolutely prohibiting the importation of a quantity of hosiery goods that will be required. Our experience in the past is that when samples of hose or half-hose that are in demand are produced, the output of the Australian factories is, in many instances, taken up before we in Adelaide have samples submitted to us, and it is not until the wants of the eastern States are filled that we have the opportunity of buying Australian-made goods that happen to be greatly in demand. </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter of extreme difficulty. In many instances such action cannot be taken until a long and very careful investigation has been made in the country of production. By the time the necessary information is obtained very serious  damage has been done to the Australian industry. When the previous tariff was before this chamber, complaints similar to those which are now being made were voiced, particularly in regard to women&#39;s singlets, upon which the proposed duties were quite as high as those it is now proposed te place on socks and stockings. We were told that the inevitable effect would be to increase substantially the price of the. garments to which they were to be applied. But what has been the result? Instead of an increase there has been a reduction in the  price  of many lines. That is noticeable in regard to the output of a Swiss company which, since the imposition of the higher duties, has established itself at Bendigo, and is selling its products at a lower price than that which was charged before the increased duties were imposed. </para>

                    referred to the freight on wool from Australia to other countries and the return freight on manufactured articles. Any one who has given the matter consideration must admit that the freight on the quantity of wool used in a pair of socks or stockings, and on the manufactured article, is infinitesimal. . I doubt whether it could be expressed in terms of any Australian coin. I know that there are such charges, but they are made on quantities in bulk. It is doubtful if they would amount to a farthing per pair of stockings. In one factory I saw the whole process of the manufacture of these goods from pure silk, and they were retailed in Sydney and Melbourne at 7s. 6d. per pair, equal in quality to those that, before the imposition of the 1926 tariff, were retailed at 15s. In another factory, I saw pure silk hose, retailed at 10s. 6d., the price of which was 17s. 6d. twelve months before.

                        <para>- I have paid for a few pairs of Australian stockings, and I have never heard any complaints about them. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> has produced some samples of imported socks, but I should say that the pair I now hold in my hands contains very little pure wool. I should imagine that it is chiefly, if not wholly composed of what is known as junk. I admit, however, that the children&#39;s socks he has exhibited are of a better quality. For a considerable time I have worn Australian-made socks. They were sold to me retail in Melbourne at 2s. 6d. per pair. They are of good appearance and quite comfortable. I have never known socks to wear so well. So far as my experience goes, the whole of the woollen goods made in Australia have excellent wearing qualities. I have worn several suits of Australian tweed, and for years I have used underwear made in Australia. These goods have given me the greatest satisfaction. Our statistics show a reduction in the importation of woollen hosiery, but that is because- of a great change in fashion. The fact that ladies have favored silk in preference to woollen hosiery is a striking indication of the prosperity of the country. There is still a considerable demand for both woollen and cotton hosiery, and I am sure that nobody would complain if the price were slightly increased. </para>

                        <para>- We have every reason to believe that these increased duties will have a similar effect to those imposed on underwear. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman,</inline> I do not say designedly, but unfortunately, has not been supplied with the retail prices. Does anybody imagine that because an article can be imported at a low rate of duty, the consumer gets the benefit in every instance? We know that he does not. The effect of large importations has not necessarily been to reduce the price to the consumer, but to greatly reduce the price to the distributor, and hundreds, if not thousands, of good Australians have been thrown out of employment. A number of our knitting mills have been working either half-time, or have put off a great percentage of their employees. The proposed duties on cotton goods will be of great assistance to the cotton industry, because they will encourage local manufacture. We &#39; are now producing more cotton than the Australian market requires, and it is very doubtful if any of the cotton crop gathered this year will find a market in this country, because manufacturers have a large quantity of last year&#39;s cotton on hand. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has represented that our industries are suffering from the large importations of foreign cotton stocks; but I point out that that is not so. During the last few years, the importations have considerably decreased, although the population of Australia has increased appreciably. Turning to the Tariff Board&#39;s report we find, on page 4, that the total value of the importations of cotton hosiery during the five years ended 30th June, 1927, was as follow: - </para>

It will be seen that the importations of cotton socks and stockings have declined. This position, however, has not been brought about by an increased output on the part of local manufacturers, but is duc to a change in fashion under which cotton hosiery has to a large extent been displaced by silk and artificial silk. A decline in prices may also account to some extent for the lower total value for the later years.&#39; </para>

                    <para>It would appear that no children&#39;s hose entirely of cotton are being made in Australia. The prices tendered in evidence show that children&#39;s imported cotton socks are being sold retail in Australia as low as 6$d. per pair, the prices ranging up to 2s. 3d. per pair. A local manufacturer, who is making children&#39;s socks in silk and cotton mixture, gave 13s. Cd. per dozen as the lowest figure at which he could produce cotton socks to compete with the imported goods. So far as men&#39;s cotton hose is concerned retail prices on imported lines quoted in evidence ranged from 6d. per pair (Japan) to 2s. 3d. per pair (United States of America). The lowest price quoted in evidence of men&#39;s cotton socks of Australian manufacture was for those made by Eastaugh Limited, namely, 16s. per dozen pairs wholesale, the retail price being 2s. 6d. per pair, and in some cases as a &#34; cut &#34; line, ls. lid. per pair. The cheapest cotton hose made by Geo. A. Bond and Company Limited was sold by that company at 21s. per dozen pairs with a retail price of 2s. 6cl. per pair. Another line was sold at 24s. per dozen pairs with a retail price of 2s. lid. per pair. </para>

                <para class="block">It is all very well to talk about building up Australian industries, but are we to build them up by imposing a duty of over 100 per cent, on British socks and over 300 per cent, on foreign socks, raising their prices to a tremendous extent? It will penalize the farmers and the workers of Australia. I appeal to honorable senators of the Labour party, not on behalf of the farmers, but on behalf of working  men generally, not to support a duty of 100 per cent. on the socks worn by the children of the working men and by the working men themselves. These are&#39; articles that the workers ought to be able to get at a reasonable price. My complaint is against the flat rate which alters the incidence of the duties to such an extent that, instead of the rate being 45 per cent., in some instances it is increased to 300 per cent. I propose to move that the House of Representatives be requested to bring the flat rates more into conformity with the ad valorem rate on this item. </para>

                        <para>- We have heard the phrase &#34; rotten cotton socks,&#34; although I do not say that it can fairly be applied to the hosiery exhibited in the chamber to-day. Figures have been quoted to prove that there has been a decline in the importation of this particular kind of hosiery, but they merely prove that fashions have changed, and that the tastes of the working classes of Australia have changed. When silk stockings were first introduced it was thought that their price would be so prohibitive that they would be beyond the reach of those engaged in the ordinary work-a-day world. We know &#34;now that, for some days of the week at any rate, all our women folk wear silk stockings. In days gone by many working men wore cotton socks because they could not afford to buy anything better; but to-day working men are better circumstanced, and thousands of them are wearing a better class of socks. If a certain quality of socks is good for one section of the community it ought to be good for all sections, particularly the working classes, who produce all the good things of this life. Socks of the kind exhibited in the chamber to-day can be manufactured in other parts of the world, particularly in Japan, and even in England, much more cheaply than they can be turned out in Australia. It is impossible for the Australian manufacturers to compete with overseas manufacturers unless they are given adequate protection. Why should they not get it in this industry? We can turn out excellent stockings in Australia. One firm in Sydney, to its credit be it said, has well advertised its ability to manufacture stockings. </para>

                        <para>- Some people would say that socks are more or less a luxury; not long ago the newspapers informed us that womenfolk in Paris were endeavouring to set the fashion of not wearing stockings. I shall support the Government in imposing these higher duties. I want to see the hosiery industry in Australia grow until it is in a position to supply all of Australia&#39;s needs in stockings; and the only way to bring that about is to shut out as completely as possible the output of its competitors. Many people, while sympathetically inclined towards the Australian manufacturer, have also a keen regard for the importer, and many excellent citizens who are importers honestly believe in free trade or in a revenue tariff, I am equally honest in the opinion, that it is my first duty to give every consideration to Australian manufacturers, and to do everything I can to assist in building up Australian industries. </para>

                    <para>.- I have just as much admiration as the Minister has for the Australian manufacturer who is &#34; doing his bit,&#34; and I agree with the honorable senator when he says that the Australian hosiery manufacturer is turning out an excellent article - so far as I know no one has suggested that he is not doing so - but when I am told that hosiery manufacturers have been so blocked by importations that they have stores full of hosiery on their hands, all I can say is that I do not think the Minister has got his information from the most reliable source. </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">So keen to deal in imported goods that they would not give the Australian manufacturer a chance. To prove that that statement is also incorrect, I can quote the experience of one of the largest softgoods distributors in Australia. Of last year&#39;s transactions in the hosiery department of that firm, 73 per cent. represented dealings in goods manufactured in Australia. That is ample rebuttal of the charge that has been levied against the wholesale distributors of goods - that they are influenced against Australian manufacturers. Honorable senators opposite, and others, have frequently said that Flinders-lane - that is the term by which the softgoods distributors are generally designated - objects to high duties because their imposition prevents it from making large profits out of imported goods. </para>
                <para>I have no desire to say or do anything that may hamper the development of Australian industries. My objection in this instance is to the manner in which the schedule has been presented. I object to a flat rate in conjunction with the ad valorem duties. These will have the effect of placing the heaviest burden on the working classes and giving relief to those better able to meet any additional costs that may be entailed. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> that I am right. The largest wholesale distributor of hosiery in Australia has advised me that nothing of the kind has ever been offered to him. For some years the working men of Queensland have been wearing a light mixture of wool and cotton, suitable for tropical countries; for the working men of New South Wales there has been a slightly heavier line ; and for the working men of Victoria and Tasmania a somewhat stronger mixture. Up to the present, cotton socks have not been manufactured in Australia. I know what the Australian manufacturers are making, because I am a&#34; shareholder in one company. I am sorry to say I am financially interested in one that is in a most unsatisfactory position, notwithstanding the higher protection given in the last tariff. On more than one occasion I have expressed my gratification at the splendid progress made during the last few years by Australian manufacturers of hosiery. I am bound to say, however, that if we pass the item as it stands the working men of Australia will be compelled to wear cashmere hosiery, which is unsuitable. Cashmere gives satisfactory service when worn with light boots, but it will not stand hard wear in heavy boots. Socks made of that material will cost from 2s. to 2s. 6d. a pair ; and if the Australian manufacturer produces the kind of hosiery to which this item refers, instead of being able to obtain socks at from 6d. to ls. 3d. a pair, the workers will have to pay from ls. 9d. to 2s. 9d. a pair. </para>

                    <para>Witnesses supporting the request for increased duties strongly stressed the detriment resulting to the local industry from the importation of a class of hosiery manufactured from material described as &#34;shoddy,&#34; that is, yarn made from mill waste liberally treated with oil to permit of it being spun. This class of hosiery was represented by samples of men&#39;s worsted half hose tendered at the inquiry. It was claimed that, large quantities of the hosiery described are imported into Australia, being invoiced at prices as low as 5s. per dozen f.o.b., and retailed at ls. 4Jd. per pair. The lowest retail price of the competitive Australian line was given at 2s. per pair. </para>
                    <para>Evidence was tendered as to the effect of importations on local&#39; industries. It was stated that in Victoria there were 100 worsted and 100 cashmere knitting machines idle. In one factory making cashmere socks, worsted half hose and scout hose, 05 machines out of a total of 70 were idle. Another factory specializing in cashmere stockings had twelve machines idle out of 20. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, I can. The Tariff Board gave special consideration to the point that has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> It was particularly interested in proposals to manufacture cheap cotton shoddy socks from a low-grade material, which has to be liberally treated with oil before it can be spun. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> wishes to force upon the people of Australia. He suggests that we should permit such goods to come freely into Australia. We do not want that sort of thing, particularly when there are factories in Australia producing all that we require in this direction. We are not only able to manufacture these articles, but are producing the raw material, and if, in addition to encouraging production of the raw material we can provide a local market for the manufacturers, we will be assisting to solve the cotton problem in Australia. At present large quantities of locally produced cotton are sold overseas instead of being used in Australia, and until we have .an efficient protective policy it will be impossible for us to give any guarantee to the producers of locally grown cotton that their product will be consumed to any extent in Australia. This is a bigger problem than that of merely providing cotton socks at low prices for those who desire to wear them. The importations of certain of these articles are very heavy. According to the figures for the first seven months of the financial year 1927-28, the value of the importation of cotton sox and stockings was &#163;134,S74, silk &#163;343,140, artificial silk &#163;13S,656, and woollen &#163;304,892, or a total of &#163;921,562. </para>

I am surprised to find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> at this stage endeavouring to strike a blow at the local industry, and to prevent it from getting upon its feet, particularly when it is in competition with what the Tariff Board describes as &#34;low type shoddy foreign articles &#34;. I trust that the committee will endorse the proposal which the Government has submitted, and give the local manufacturers that protection which is so essential if they are to continue in business. </para>

                <para>I regret that I have to submit this motion. When the Senate met a fortnight ago the Government was prepared to introduce this bill, and at that time the term for which the Public Service Arbitrator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt, was appointed had not expired. Our friends in opposition in another place, however, submitted a motion of censure, which prevented the Government from introducing the bill for a fortnight. In the interim the Public Service Arbitrator&#39;s term of office expired. Under the present Arbitration (Public Service) Act a new appointment has to be made for seven years, but as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> will reach the retiring age of 65 in two years&#39; time, we are submitting an amendment of the Act under which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> will be re-appointed for two years. The bill does not provide for any other amendment of the law. The procedure I am now asking the Senate to adopt has been followed in another place, and in view of the unusual circumstances, I ask honorable senators to agree to the motion so that the bill may be passed through all its stages without delay. </para>

It knew that the Public Service Arbitrator was approaching the end of his term, and in these circumstances should have introduced the bill in sufficient time to enable it to be passed without the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders. I objected to the Government&#39;s proposal to place public servants under a special tribunal, as I thought that they should come under our general arbitration system. Parliament, however, decided otherwise, and from what I have seen and heard of the working of the court, I believe that it is operating to the satisfaction of those concerned. As I understand the only object of the hill is to make the term for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> is to he reappointed synchronize with the date of his retirement from the Service, I have no objection to offer to it. </para>
