            <para>. - What I have to say to-day will be in justification of a statement which I made when last speaking on this item to the effect that some honorable senators appeared to have been influenced by the large number of telegrams and letters they had received, and that I had good reason to believe that those telegrams and letters were not spontaneous, but had been sent at the request of some one, and were, therefore, inspired. If I received a large number of spontaneous letters and telegrams stating that certain proposals before this branch of the legislature were going to injure business, I should take a good deal of notice of them; otherwise I would not be influenced by them, and would throw them in the wastepaper basket. As I had good reason to believe that these letters and telegrams were inspired, I thought it my duty to give expression to that belief. I received a somewhat severe catigation for doing so, but I have since been able to obtain copies of circulars which should convince honorable senators that these communications were not spontaneous. For the information of the committee, I wish to quote the following from the circular issued by the Hardwood Millers' Association of Victoria, dated 27th February, 1928- </para>

For instance, SenatorReid, in his second-reading speech said, " I cannot conscientiously vote for higher duties on Oregon." But when the timber duties were under consideration, he quoted these telegrams and said that they had had a considerable influence upon him. I think another honorable senator also said the same. </para>

              <para>- Very well. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> was speaking in committee he condemned imported timber on account of the borer, which he said was a menace to Australia. Some six or seven years ago, when a shipment of timber infested with borer was imported to Australia, the Customs Department took certain action, and has since framed regulations which prevent timber so infested from being imported. </para>

            <para>. - When I was speaking during my second period of fifteen minutes, allowed me under the Standing Orders, I mentioned that I intended, first of all, to deal with the forestry aspect of the matter. This I did, and I think conclusively proved that responsible foresters in Australia view with alarm the increased cutting of hardwood timbers which will bo necessary if these duties are imposed. I said at the time that I would deal with an important portion of the Tariff Board's report, and I asked in what way circumstances had changed since that exhaustive inquiry was made to justify the failure of the Government to be guided by it. Another portion of that document is extremely interesting. In the first place, so as to indicate the attitude taken up by certain witnesses before the Tariff Board, I should like to quote the following evidence given by the representative not of the South Australian Timber Workers' Union but of the Australian Timber Workers' Union :  jo, </para>

          <para>I am instructed  to request  that the Tariff Board will take into consideration the reduction in duty  on 12 x  G Oregon from 4s. to 3s. We contend that as long as timber comes in bulk, we will have the work of cutting it up. </para>
          <para class="block">We do not want the duty on the smaller  sizes  reduced or increased. We also consider that should the duties be increased on bulk timber, and we were forced to supply our requirements from Australian timber, we know that it is a matter of impossibility for them to do so, because they have not enough to cope  with  the orders at present. Queensland cannot supply Australia with softwoods; so far as Tasmania is concerned, we use a quantity of their timber for fencing purposes, but it is not suitable in this climate for roofing construction (because it twists. We are of opinion that Australia would soon become depleted if only Australian timber were used. </para>

            <para>The principal witness for increased duties, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> who claimed to be representing Western, Australia before the Tariff Board, as well as most of the other States, failed, in the board's opinion, to place the whole of the facts regarding that State adequately, and, apparently, was unaware of that State's true position. This is not to be wondered at, since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> confines most of his activities to the timber industry in the State of Tasmania. The Tariff Board is in possession of the production figures of the State of Western Australia from 1914 to 1924, furnished by the Conservator of Forests of that State. On examination it will be found that these figures reveal, instead of a depression a condition of advancing prosperity. The actual position at the present moment is that the total timber production is greater than in any other year since 1914, which proved to be a phenomenally good year. The Tariff Board was not approached either by the Department of Forestry in Western Australia or any of the representatives of those actually engaged in the timber-getting industry in that State, with any complaints regarding the inadequacy of any of the duties affecting timber. </para>

              <para>- We had an example of that matter in the Senate the other day. The answer of the Postmaster-General as to the reason why Western Australian timber was used by his department in preference to timber from other States was quite unambiguous. Honorable senators cannot therefore be surprised if, with the knowledge which I have of the timber industry of ray State - and that knowledge I submit, is not inconsiderable - and knowing how these duties are likely to affect the industry, I om not disposed to support them. It is difficult to understand why they have been imposed. The forestry authorities in Australia did not ask for them and certainly it is not in the interests of the consumer that they should be agreed to. Whilst we are considering the interests of -those engaged in the industry it is desirable that we should also give some thought to the needs of the consumer - in this case the people who may wish to build houses. Cannot honorable senators see that these -duties will affect the cost of building? I do not suppose that I shall have occasion to speak again on this item. I hope not, at all events. I cannot possibly see my way to vote for any increase in the duties on Oregon. Obviously they will not be in the interests of labour. If large-sized Oregon is included in the schedule the saw-milling industry will be affected because Oregon, in large sizes, represent its raw material. Personally, I can see nothing but evil for the timber industry if these duties are passed, and furthermore I venture to say that  the  course which I have already suggested - the abolition of the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act - would achieve the object in view without increasing the cost of building. </para>

            <para>. - I rise to point to an aspect which appears to have been overlooked  in  this debate, and that is that those of us who are objecting to -the item are not advocating a reduction"1 in the duties in the old tariff, but what is actually an increase, since the increased duties set out in the schedule now before the committee cannot be assumed to be law until they have been agreed to by the Senate. The attitude which a number of honorable senators, myself included, take up, is that we are advocating an increase of practically 50 per cent, in duties which the Tariff Board considered adequate for the protection of the industry. In my remarks during the general discussion I made a slight mistake. I assumed that the old rate of duty was 3s. British, intermediate and general. I find that it was 3s. British and intermediate, and 4s. in the general tariff. Therefore, the amendment which I am about to submit will represent an increase of 50 per cent, under the general tariff. That should be sufficient to enable the saw-millers to carry on, without penalizing the consumers. I happened to be in telephonic communication with an architect friend of mine -in Sydney yesterday on the subject of these duties. He assured me that every architect in Sydney believed that they would very considerably increase the cost of every building erected in New South Wales, and that the position would be the . same in Queensland. That ought to correct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Hoare's  ideas regarding my consistency, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid's</inline> assumption' that my proposal is a shandy-gaff one.'1. 'T~ should like to follow up what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> has said respecting the influences that have been at work in this matter. In the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail</inline> of the 17th inst., a long telegram was published from Cairns indicating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> L. Moore had wired to the sawmillers in North Queensland informing them that Senators Reid, Foll, and Thompson were opposed to the proposed timber duties,  and asking them to use every effort to induce those honorable senators, to vote for them. There may be nothing' wrong with that, but it is an evidence of energy rather than of discretion. Honorable senators are nor likely to submit to that sort of thing. I have only a superficial knowledge of the subject, but I cannot see in what way North Queensland is likely to be injured. _ It is well known that that portion of Australia grows principally decorative timbers, that are unsurpassed by similar timbers grown in any other part of the world. A celebrated Swedish professor said recently that the decorative timbers of North Queensland had no superior within his knowledge. How, then, are they likely to be injured? It is only ridiculous propaganda to say that they are. </para>

The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> has referred to propaganda on the other side. Since the adjournment of the Senate on Friday last I have received a letter from Brown &amp; Broad, Newstead Homes Ltd., Brisbane, a firm which carries extensive stocks and whose operations in connexion with the building of homes for the workers are probably not equalled by any other firm in Australia.

            <para>Timber Duties. - I read with some amazement a statement in the press to the effect that hardwood millers had convinced senators that, if the proposed increased duties were not confirmed, the hardwood industry would be very seriously injured. Such a contention is utterly ridiculous, and an insult to the intelligence of senators - doubtless the statement was blatant propaganda. As an evidence of the difficulty in obtaining hardwood supplies, I may say that my company has a contract with the] Postmaster-General, for the supply of hardwood  crossarms.  The size of the timber is 3 inches by 3 inches and lengths vary from fi' ft. 6 in. long to 9 feet. This is one of the easiest specifications any  sawmiller  could ask for, yet what do we find? Out of five hardwood millers with whom orders were placed, only two can supply small quantities. I send you herewith copies of letters received from these millers, which speak volumes, more especially when one hears so much piffle about the great hardwood industry being ruined by importations of foreign timber. </para>

The Government appointed a tariff ' commission, who thoroughly and exhaustively investigated the timber tariff and brought down certain well-considered proposals. The Minister for Customs apparently did not see fit to accept those recommendations, and by a stroke of the pen just doubled the existing duties and ignored the report altogether. Surely the Minister's duty was to place the Tariff Commission's recommendations before the House, and let it decide; otherwise where is the justification for the appointment of a very expensive commission. You will have to deal with this important question in a few days, and I say deliberately that the trade as a whole had confidence in the Tariff Commission, and would have accepted their decision without demur; but, if the Minister's high-handed action is confirmed, then we lose our respect and confidence in those who support such a person. </para>

            <para>- In that case the statement of the Director-General of Forests is clearly incorrect. In view of the belief held by some honorable senators that there is a very meagre supply of matured milling timber in Australia I desire to read the following report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> Ingle, the Commissioner of Forests for Victoria. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Statements having been made publicly that this State has very meagre supplies left in the forests of matured milling timbers, and that, therefore, importations of softwoods should be encouraged in order to eke out as long as possible what are remaining, it has occurred to me that the present position should be reviewed in order to relieve any anxiety which may have arisen regarding this important matter. </para>
          <para>It is unfortunate that visiting foresters, in almost every instance, have based their calculations and conclusions on hearsay evidence, instead of gaining the knowledge required on the subject by actual personal inspections. . . </para>
          <para>When it is considered that most, if not all, of the forestry experts, who have visited this State from overseas, and who in books, pamphlets, reports to governments and newspapers, stated their erroneous conclusions, have only spent, at the most, a few weeks in the State and it is not possible for any one to obtain an authentic knowledge of the timber resources of this country in less than as many years as have been numbered in weeks by the visitors who have had the temerity to publicly sum up the forestry position here. </para>
          <para>In 1923-24 the total output of hardwood ('milled timber) was 108,000,000 super feet; but, owing to the low price of inferior softwoods, only 87,257,456 super feet were cut in 1920-27 and 82,000,000 in 1925-20. </para>
          <para>It is quite safe, however, to say that in this State there are supplies of mature hardwood which would produce the peak requirements of 1923-24, viz., .108,000,000 (annually) for at least 45 years. These supplies would comprise the best of furniture, flooring, weatherboards, scantlings, bridge, sleeper, pile and pole timber; at their worst, these trees would give better service than the imported softwoods. </para>
          <para>It may be pointed out, also, that in all parts of the State where milling operations have been carried on years ago, the regenerated forests, which have been highly improved, large areas of pines have been planted and within 45 years - the estimated life of the existing mature hardwood reserves - these plantations will be ready for use. </para>
          <para>The suggestion that the matured forests of Victoria are almost depleted is without foundation, and. utterly absurd, because in addition to the areas in the Yea, Alexandra, Warburton, Upper Yarra, Noojee, Tangil .and Baw Baw districts, which are now being exploited and will produce the hardwood requirements of tb is State, estimated at about 100,000,000 super feet per annum for a period of 20 years, there are the virgin matured forests in the watersheds of the Mitchell, Tambo, Timbarra and Buchan rivers containing 178,000 acres, which will supply our requirements for at least a further 20 to 25 years, and further east is the remainder of the county of Croajingolong, comprising approximately 1,000,000 acres and carrying matured eucalypts throughout, so it 'is plain that, for the period stated- 45 year/sl.at least - there will be no dearth of mature hardwood in Victoria, and the probabilities are that, as the old cutout forests are being regenerated, that period may be greatly extended. </para>
          <para>This statement is compiled from facts gained by 30 years of personal inspection, not from hearsay statements made by irresponsible persons. </para>

              <para>- Even though there may be a slight increase in the cost of houses because of the duties, a house erected of hardwood lasts longer than one constructed of Baltic pine, while the upkeep is infinitesimal compared with that of a softwood dwelling. Another objection raised to the higher duties is that no matter what duty is placed upon softwoods, they will still enter this country. I believe that no duties that we may impose will entirely prevent the importation of softwoods; but the imposition of high duties on softwoods will cause Australian hardwood to be used for many purposes for which imported timber is now employed. Throughout the world forestry experts are advocating a greater use of hardwood. The <inline font-style="italic">United Empire,</inline> the official journal of the Royal Colonial Institute, in its issue of 28th February last, publishes a paper on Imperial Forestry written by the right honorable Lord Clinton,  Chairman  of the Forestry Commission, in which it is urged that every endeavour should be made to keep out the existing supplies of timber by economizing in the consumption of softwoods and by persuading consumers to utilize hardwood instead of softwood wherever possible. The meeting was under the chairmanship of Lord Novar whose name is well ; known in forestry matters. </para>

          <para>I am satisfied that a majority of the members of this committee desire to do the fair thing by the Australian timber industry. I should not have risen had it not been that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> and others - perhaps not intentionally - would lead the public to believe that our timber requirements cannot be supplied by Australian sawmillers. The facts and figures regarding the industries which I have quoted absolutely disprove their statements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> complained that those interested in the timber industry in this country had communicated with honorable senators, urging them to support higher duties on timber. There is nothing unusual about that action ; similar action has been taken in connexion . with every other tariff schedule which has been introduced into this Parliament. It is their duty- to mind their own business.What is everybody's business is nobody's affair. The gentleman who is commissioned to look after the work on behalf of the timber producers has done his work well. Honorable senators prefer to meet representatives of various interests, producers or importers, in person, and secure information which assist us in the discussion of tariff matters. We receive a great deal of information from those who favour importations and we get it likewise from those who are deeply interested in Australian industries. But we are not influenced by that information in coming to our conclusions. </para>

            <para>. - When we are considering a proposal which means, roughly, doubling the rates of duty on timber and a substantial increase in the cost of a universally required article, we can well say, notwithstanding what the Minister has said, that an hour spent in discussing the matter is an hour usefully employed. ,.The Government's proposal means more than doubling the rate of duty on the great bulk of the timber imported into Australia. It means an increased levy of something like £835,000, or, deducting the duty on New Zealand timber, £770,000, on the users of timber in Australia. I feel it is like throwing chaff against the wind to. try to moderate these duties. I recognize that public opinion is still strongly in favour of the political superstition that all a country has to do to bring prosperity upon itself is to increase its customs duties and raise prices. Must not an end come to all this ? A few years ago the duty on imported timber was 2s. per 100 super, feet. The present proposal is to make it 8s., an increase of 400 per cent. Eight years ago the timber producers were clamouring for and were given rates of ls. 6d. and 2s., but the sole effect of giving those rates was to whet the desire of others to take advantage of the increase. The vicious circle came into play at once. Prices all round have been raised again and again, and the result has been that people making use of timber have had to pay more for it without any corresponding return for the extra price paid.. I suppose we shall continue this mad policy until we are brought to a dead stop. This country will have a rude awakening when it is found that the prices we get overseas for our surplus produce will no longer sustain our habits of high living and high prices. Already we as a people are living beyond our means and. the effect of this tariff will b.e to encourage us to indulge still further in that vicious practice. Let us call a halt before it is too late to avert the crisis that must come when the return we get overseas for our surplus produce will no longer sustain us in our course of high living-.^ Even now the price of wheat has fallen to little more than 50 per cent, above its pre war value. Yet we are being asked in this case to impose a duty which is 400 per cent, higher than that which operated eight years ago on this ""necessary commodity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has asked us to believe that 'Victoria is a timber State, but the Customs returns indicate that it is the second largest timber importer in the Commonwealth. During 1926-27 New South Wales imported 150,000,000, super, feet of undressed timber and 18,000,000 super feet of dressed timber. In the same period Victoria imported 92,000,000 super, feet of undressed timber 2and 54,000,000 of dressed timber. Of the total importations of dressed timber, New South Wales imported 23 per cent, and Victoria fi« per cent. </para>

              <para>- If Victoria is a State overflowing with timber which is ready to be put on the market, why is it that it is the second largest importer of timber? I could understand South Australia being a large importer of timber, but not Victoria. No reliance can be placed on the authority quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> The figures I have given blow the honorable senator's statement kite high. Victoria is not a timber State. It is not even in a position to supply its own timber requirements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> has quoted the statement made last year by the Forestry Commission of Queensland that within the next 25 years that State, which is admittedly one of the timber States of the Commonwealth, will not be able to pro-  duce supplies of softwoods to meet its own requirements''1 and must import £30,000,000 worth. The timber pro: duc.ers of Australia' who have been enjoying an average duty of 4s. per 100 super, feet, double the rate prevailing about eight years ago, are now anxious to double the rate again and make it 8s. per 100 super, feet. A complacent Government  is allowing them to do so. I call it a complacent Government because apparently it is ever willing to listen to the tales of those who want high duties and is never ready to | supply information to those who will Have to bear the burden of the higher duties imposed. When a Tariff Bill was under discussion in this Senate some years ago honorable senators were supplied by the then Government with the fullest details. That Government had some regard for Parliament and a proper idea of how a tariff should be discussed and settled. Against every item it showed the proposed duty, the British preferential rate, the former rate, the duty recommended by the Tariff Board, the amount of imports for the year, the revenue collected and the ad valorem duty paid. All this information could be seen at a glance. </para>

              <para>-When we were last dealing with the tariff, I protested against the frivolous way in which the Government was treating the Senate by  not supplying honorable senators with information. As a result of my protest we had placed in our hands not a Government publication but a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt, issued and published in the manufacturing interests of Australia. It is a partisan publication. It is a pity that the method which, as I have indicated, was adopted by a previous government, has not been copied by the present administration. This tariff has simply been heaved at us, and we have been asked to swallow it. There is an old saying that one man can take a horse to water but .ten men cannot make it drink. This country will not become prosperous by piling up rates of duty. The diminishing acreage under wheat tells its. own story. Paper is cheap, ink is cheap, cleri-  eai labour is cheap, and ministerial arguments are the cheapest of all. There is no reason why we should not get more information than that which has been heaved at us on this occasion. What has the Senate done  that it  has not been supplied with the  details t o  which it is entitled ? When we  are  asked to double the duties on timber, and" call upon the users of timber to pay an additional £750,000 for their requirements, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> of course, says " Hear, hear " ; but surely there is in the community an overwhelming number of silent patient citizens who will not applaud. Will the imposition of extra duties on timber have any different result from that which was achieved by doubling the duties some years ago. It is time we faced the matter squarely; it is time we made people live within their means and compete without the shelter afforded by a tariff 100 per cent, and not 400 per cent, higher than that which previously operated. I feel that my voice is like that of one crying in the wilderness, and that this insanity will continue until a rude awakening comes. Even now, however, we can see gleams of sunlight on the murky horizon. There are in this country some who are awakening to the fact that this drift must not continue. We know that the cost of building houses for the Victorian State Savings Bank is about double what it was in the early nineties just before the- financial crash came. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> rents have- not risen, or if they have the increase has been trifling. As a matter of fact rents in Australia have risen by 15 per cent, since 1921, while in the same period the average wage paid in Australia has only risen from 94s. lid. to 99s., an. increase of 4 per cent. We are asked to agree to an increase of duty amounting to 100 per cent. The Government should supply the committee with all information at its disposal instead of compelling honorable senators to fish around to obtain it. I have given the other side of the picture in connexion with this industry, and have shown that although wages have increased by only 4 per cent., the Government wishes us to support timber duties equivalent to, 100 per cent. Where is the warrant for this? When is consideration to be given to the man on the land who rises early in the morning and works until late at night and who does not receive any benefit from tariff duties ? How is he to get on ? In various ways he will have to pay these increased duties. It will not. be long before the burden becomes so heavy that these men will devote their energies to other activities where the conditions of life are much easier. If they do I shall not blame them; but when they do, production will diminish and the prosperity of the country will be seriously impaired. Why should they be compelled to work long hours whilst other sections of the community are sailing along smoothly and receiving protection and assistance which is denied to them? Notwithstanding the arduous nature of their work, Governments, of which this is a sample, have the audacity to impose high duties which these sturdy workers on the land will have to pay. The Government increased these duties without a scintilla of evidence in support of its action. Where are these ' industries which we are being asked to support ? The only trace we can find of many of them is in a back room in some city building. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has asked what justification there is for the duty under the general tariff being increased from 4s. to 8s. Those engaged in the industry were quite satisfied with a duty of 4s. when it was imposed; but conditions have altered considerably since then. I think it was in 1920 that  Oregon  was sold at 70s. per 100 super, feet; it was later reduced to 40s.; and to-day, owing to the cheap labour available in the country of production and to other factors, softwood timber is now being sold in Australia at 29s. per 100 feet super. </para>

The costs of the sawmiller have, in consequence of awards made by the Arbitration Court and the conditions imposed under the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act increased to a remarkable extent. On the one hand the costs of the sawmillers have increased and on the other, timber is being imported at a much cheaper rate. In these circumstances the Australian sawmillers have, to seek increased duties to enable the industry, which is not getting consideration commensurate with that received by other industries, to continue. </para>

              <para>- That may be so. The Navigation Act and the awards of the Arbitration Court are affecting industries t04 such an extent that we cannot continue the present system much longer. The duties which are now sought are only sufficient to enable the saw mills to keep in operation; but if many of the obstacles with which the sawmillers now have to contend were removed, they would not be necessary. It has been stated during the debate that certain forestry officers view with alarm the depletion of our Australian forests. I have before me extracts from statements made by certain forestry officers in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> referred to what has happened in Victoria, and I now wish to quote what was stated in evidence by the Conservator of Forests in Tasmania in relation to the Tasmanian forests being cut out. He said - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>There are at present under leases and permits some 300,000 acres of forest land, of which it is assumed some 100,000 acres are cut out. By assessing the balance of 200,000 acres to a yield of 20,000 feet to the acre, one thousand million super, feet in the round is reached. Suppose 50 per cent, of this is lost in conversion, a net balance of two thousand million super, feet of sawn timber would be produced. Of the balance of timber land in Tasmania 700,000 acres should be a conservative, estimate. As the bulk of- this is unexplored, let us consider 10,000 feet to the acre as the yield. This gives seven thousand million super, feet in the round which, with a 50 per cent, reduction, conversion works out at 3,500,000,000 feet of timber. Therefore on these figures the total yield of. sawn timber on leased and unleashed areas would be 5,500,000,000 super, feet. As Tasmania produces approximately 60,000,000 feet of sawn timber per annum, the forests would last at the present rate of cutting, about 90 years. ...... Sufficient data has been collected to show that the rate of growth is rapid and the annual increment in the Tasmanian eucalypt is very high. Be-growth 25 years old is at present being cut for board and case material, and in such localities 40 years should prove ample to produce sawmilling timber.  </para>

              <para>- Durable woods cannot of course be worked as readily as pine woods. Honorable' senators have noticed that some of the lamp posts in Canberra are of pine, and anyone who knows anything  about  timber will realize that pine is not likely to last long under the ground. Hardwood would be preferable, and I believe that peppermint would be four times and ordinary stringybark three times as durable for that purpose. Although I do not wish to criticize the action of the authorities here, 1 think it is surprising to see soft wood being used for lamp posts when plenty of our own serviceable hardwood timber is available. Tasmanian hardwoods can be used for all classes of work from rough fencing posts to the highest quality of furniture; these should be given preference over imported woods. The sawmillers have undertaken not to increase the price if these duties are imposed. They are. only anxious that Australians .shall use Australian woods to a much greater extent than they do, and this, I think, is only a fair request. </para>

              <para>- That shows how important they are. There is a great difference between legitimate representations, made to honorable senators, by reputable organizations, for or against certain duties in the usual way, and messages such as we have  received. Legitimate communications receive my careful attention. When, however, letters and telegrams began to pour in upon me directing attention to the deplorable conditions in the sawmilling industry, stating that men were unemployed and how essential it was that the mills should be re-opened, I began to feel that something was wrong. I thought it strange that I had not heard of these conditions from any other source. I now know why these  telegrams  and letters were sent. Who is responsible for them? I want to say now that I do not believe that the statements made in some of them are true. If they are then the whole of the arguments in favour of additional duties are valueless because these duties have been in operation for some months. We have been .told that two mills ..have been re-opened in Tasmania. </para>

              <para>- We have been informed by telegrams and letters from representatives of timber-getting firms that the industry is at its last gasp, and that unless the Senate ratifies the duties, it will go out of existence. Why has not disaster already overtaken the industry? The duties have been operating for several months and therefore their ratification apparently will not give the industry greater protection. Why has not more employment been given to Australian workers? </para>

              <para>- Unfortunately for Australia, they have not. Many timber-producing countries have magnificent waterways down which lumber companies float timber supplies to seaports for export to other countries. In that respect, Australia as a timber-producing country, is under a severe handicap, so severe indeed that largely increased duties would not assist the industry to any material extent. What is lacking in Australia is a more efficient and cheaper system of transportation. </para>

              <para>- Certain other industries are suffering in the same way. as regards the inter-state trade. In the Sydney press last week I noticed a statement to the effect that owing to the extremely high freights prevailing, it was impossible to market supplies  of timber in Sydney from north coast districts. Increased duties will mean increased prices. Can the people afford to pay these higher prices? I doubt if they can. It has already been shown that the higher duties will not benefit many sawmills in New South Wales, though they may assist a number of mills in Tasmania; but, as I have stated, the users of timber will be called upon to pay increased prices for it. This will mean dearer homes for the people. At the last election one of the cries was - "Put people in their own homes, and they will never become bolsheviks, because they will have a stake in the country." Those honorable senators who are supporting these higher duties appear to favour putting people in their own homes but only at an additional cost of from £30 to £40 each. </para>

              <para>- On that point I should like to state that in Sydney on Sunday last I met a friend of mine who, out of his hard-earned savings, had built a couple of cottages. Being a patriotic Australian, he used Australian hardwood for the roofing timbers, and is now faced with an unavoidable expenditure to re-roof both cottages. He told me that the rafters had warped so badly that the roof was leaking and the cottages were in a serious condition. I am informed that it is almost impossible to obtain Australian hardwood that is thoroughly seasoned and suitable for roofing timber. Builders and contractors cannot depend on it. For these reasons I am opposed to the increased duties. I do not believe that they will relieve the depression in the timber industry,. They have been operative for some time now, and apparently have not had the effect which certain people claim they will have if ratified by the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry if I have misrepresented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> in regard to the duty on imported socks; but, judging by his remarks just now, the honorable senator favours the use of inferior foreign timbers to the detriment of the timber industry in Australia. If, as he has stated, the election cry of Government supporters during the last campaign was to build homes for the workers so as to prevent them from becoming bolsheviks, why does not he now stand up for the Australian timber industry, so that Australians may have homes built of Australian timber ? Unfortunately, the volume of importations is undiminished, notwithstanding the higher duties that have been imposed. </para>

              <para>- I presume it is because production in other countries is cheaper than in Australia. Borneo timber is cut by coolies, who are paid only a few shillings a day, whereas timber workers in Australia receive what is regarded as a living wage, and they work under superior conditions. I totally disagree with those honorable senators who say that Australian hardwood is not suitable for building purposes. In Victoria it is largely used, and is entirely satisfactory. </para>

              <para>- Not at all. We have millions of feet of ...good timber available. If the imposition of a still higher duty on imported timber would lead to the cutting of a greater quantity of our own timber, and keep our mills working full time, I would agree to it. The imported softwoods are not all that they are claimed to be. It is argued that the price of building will be increased. The extra cost of a five-roomed house will amount to not more than £6 12s. 6d. The additional rental, therefore, will be not greater than approximately 3d. a week. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> claims to have been inundated with telegrams ostensibly from millers, and has used that as an argument to induce honorable senators who favour the higher duties to revise their views. I have not received a telegram from either a sawmiller or any other source. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> has argued that if we do not allow the importation' of softwood a substitute will be found. I point out that the substitute in the case of dado linings would be fibre plaster sheets, which are manufactured by Australian workmen under Australian conditions of labour; whereas -the imported softwoods are obtained in many cases from countries in which cheap colored labour is employed. </para>

              <para>- It would not do it any harm.  I wish to quote from the report of the Forestry Department of Western Australia for the year ended 30th June,' 1924. We. have been told * that borers are not brought to Australia in imported softwoods. That is incorrect. Three months ago an expert who travelled from the eastern States to Western Australia outlined to me the steps which have to be taken to cope with the borer, and said that not only the cargo  but also the ships which bring it to Australia are affected. Fumigation of the vessels does not succeed in driving out the pest. Once it gets a hold every subsequent cargo of timber becomes infected before its arrival in Australia. The report to which I have referred reads as follows : - </para>

            <para>The inspection of timber ' imported from Borneo and Java in conformance with the Commonwealth Quarantine Regulations has shown the necessity for close supervision. A number of living specimens of particularly destructive varieties of timber' borers have been discovered, and arrangements have been made for the infected timber to be destroyed. </para>

          <para class="block">The Government should take every step possible to prevent the borer from obtaining a hold in Australia. Some honorable senators- claim that it has been here for years. If that is so, it is only now manifesting its presence, I have seen in Melbourne imported furniture that has been in use for ten years, yet the borer is only now  working  its way out through the tops of the tables. We must take a firm stand to prevent its ravages. In Western Australia the life of Oregon used in flooring joists and floorings is only three years, on account of the destruction that is caused by white ants. Even when the piles are sheathed with tin the ants cannot be kept out of the building. The effects of the borer are not immediately apparent. It is time we prevented the importation of foreign timber and encouraged our people to use our own woods. If the softwood forests of the rest of the world should be burnt out a substitute could easily be found in Australia'. When hardwood from Victoria or jarrah from Western Australia has been placed in position it lasts for all time. I saw on exhibition in Perth a piece of jarrah that had been taken from one of the piles of a jetty at Fremantle. It had been under water for 35 years. It was sawn through the centre, and polished until it looked like a piece of glass. There was. not a blemish  on it. Sea water would cause a softwood to deteriorate within 24 hours. I shall support the proposed duties. </para>

The 44-hour week is now in operation, and it, together with other conditions that have been brought about by the Arbitration Court, Workmen's Compensation and Child Endowment have placed the industry in a parlous condition. If there should be a further rise in wages, or if the conditions should be made harder for the mill-owner, one of our big primary industries will go out of action. On different occasions I have heard honorable senators quote figures illustrating the drift of population to the cities, and deploring the growth of Melbourne, Sydney, and other capital cities at the expense of the country districts. Here is a primary industry, which, directly and indirectly, is responsible for the employment of thousands of country people ; yet we are asked not to consent to the proposed higher duties! If those duties are not passed the mills will cease to operate, and thousands of persons will lose their employment. Thus the curse of centralization will be accentuated.' Unemployment in our rural districts is sufficiently grave at the present time. Recently I travelled through a number of timber milling areas, and learned that since December last, when these duties become operative a number of mills had reopened, and tremendous sales of Australian hardwoods had been effected. Are we not, therefore, doing something to support a most important primary industry, and, by providing employment in the country for thousands of men, keeping in circulation a tremendous amount of money? It must be realized that wages account for from 75 per cent, to SO per cent, of the expenditure of the mill-owner. What is to be done if those mills close down? </para>

              <para>- I am in favour of the increases for which the schedule provides, so that this primary industry may be maintained. It has been argued that the increased duties will hit new settlers and wage earners. I point out that those settlers are generally supplied by a mill in their own locality. Therefore, that argument is futile. If the higher duties are likely to hit the wage earners, why are they being supported by our illustrious friends who sit on the Opposition benches ? </para>

              <para>- In many directions the dwellers in the country have been adversely affected by duties imposed to protect secondary industries. Surely when an opportunity presents itself we should give them the same measure of protection that we give to others. We must not lose sight of the fact that since the amended duties have been in operation mills which had closed down have re-opened. Should the higher duties be agreed to, a large co-operative timber company will immediately commence operations in New South Wales. There will also be a determined effort on the part of Australian saw-millers to overcome the objection that Australian hardwoods have not been sufficiently well seasoned. That effort, together with the standardization of timber measurements, should assist the industry greatly so that it should not be long before the number of its. employees is increased considerably. </para>

But during the past three months many of them have re-opened and are now the centres of thriving communities. It is not too much to ask the dwellers in the cities, for whom we have done so much, to pay a little more for their timber requirements if by so doing we can retain this important industry and keep people in the country instead of forcing them to drift to the cities, and swell the ranks of the unemployed. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>in accusing me of opposing duties which he said would assist other industries, described me as an anti-Australian. It is true that I have supported increased duties on some items; but in considering whether or not a duty should be given to any particular industry, I have always looked at the effect it was likely to have on other industries. For instance, in regard to the iron and steel duties, honorable senators may recollect that I said that I recognized they were likely to affect the initial and,  very often, the working costs of other industries, a matter which was well worthy of consideration, but that the iron and steel industry was necessary for defence, and whatever the price was, we had to pay it. Here, however, we have an imposition that will increase the costs of all other industries, and for no effective purpose. Many concerns are to-day carrying on at a very low profit. If in the inaugural stage of an industry the cost of a factory is likely to be increased considerably, or if the cost of extensions to an existing factory are to be added to enormously by the high cost of timber, the result will be that the industry affected will have to make a further application to the Tariff Board and to this Parliament for another increase in its protective duties. </para>

            <para>. - This item is plainly an attempt to increase the British preferential tariff by 5 per cent, in the case of assembled chassis, and although it does not seem hopeful to ask for a vote on the item, I propose to do so, my idea being to wipe out the duty on both classes of chassis, assembled and unassembled, and make them all free. There is no protective character about duties of 12£ and 17 per cent. ; they are purely revenue duties. Hot even the most rabid protectionist would claim that 5 per cent, duty against Great Britain on assembled chassis would support any local industry. It is time we gave a certain amount of preference to the Australian users of motor cars. We should allow people to carry on their work here without being saddled with an impost of, say, 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, which it is proposed to impose on assembled chassis. When the last tariff was going through this chamber quite an array of reasons was advanced by me in support of the principle of giving the people of Australia who want this imported type of conveyance a chance to get it at bedrock prices. </para>

              <para>- And go back to the wheelbarrow, perhaps. We cannot stop the march of progress. It is quite plain that these duties are not an attempt to found an- industry in Australia, and consequently their, only effect will be to saddle industries of Australia with an additional burden. Those who are engaged in the production of commodities which have to find a market overseas, are handicapped by their distance from markets, by the fact that they have to pay next to the highest customs tariff in the world, and because they have the highest standard of living in the world. I therefore intend to move that the House of Representatives be requested to remove the duties on chassis. I shall regard my request as a test for the purpose of giving the people of this country an opportunity to keep pace with the rate of progress of the rest of the world, without being penalized because they happen to use implements which are not made in Australia. </para>

              <para>- Not at all. The person who uses a motor car in preference to a buggy or any other such vehicle has not luxurious tastes. Such vehicles are used in order to expedite business. These duties are imposed for revenue purposes and will affect those who, though not on the bread line, are engaged in arduous pursuits in which the use of motor vehicles is essential. The users of a Rolls Royce or a Vauxhall car can, if necessary, be taxed in other ways, but cars of that type are not at present under consideration. Some time ago the Canadian tariff was framed to tax men and women who were living luxuriously, but in Australia we have been too tired, too ignorant, or too indifferent to realize the benefits that would accrue from a luxuries tax. I wish to free those using this particular means of transport from a tax that is bearing heavily upon them. They are already sufficiently handicapped. I am anxious to remove this handicap, particularly as the Treasury is not short of money. </para>

          <para>The Government is really at its wits end to know what to do with the revenue it is receiving. I am not anxious to provide it with a means of obtaining more so that it will have to tax its ingenuity in an endeavour to find a means of disposing of it. It is, of course, necessary to have improved roads, but in comparison with State Treasuries, the coffers of the Commonwealth are overflowing, largely as a result of the imposition of duties such as those which we are now considering. I am not opposed to preference to the Mother Country, but I believe that charity begins at home, and I have given ample evidence that those using motor vehicles should be given greater consideration. </para>

            <para>. - Under this item I notice that some of the fiat rates to which I have previously referred are to be increased. I mention more particularly the ordinary piano, which is used very extensively in the country and also by a large number of working and lower salaried people in the cities. The old rates for upright pianos were £7 British, £8 intermediate, and £9 10s. general, or ad valorem 30 per cent. British, 40 per cent, intermediate, and 45s. general tariff, whichever rate returns the higher duty. The rate how proposed is £7 British, £21 10s. intermediate, £25 general, with the previous ad valorem rates. As honorable senators will see, the late rates have been considerably increased on the type of piano with which the poorer people have to be satisfied. . It has been said that flat rates are imposed to keep out cheap foreign goods; but the Tariff Board which held an exhaustive inquiry into the importations of pianos, particularly from Germany, stated, that - </para>

            <para>Considerable evidence on the quality of the cheaper imported instrument was tendered by both sides. The witnesses appearing in support of the request for increased duties described these cheaper imported instruments variously by such terms as " rubbish," " inferior rubbish," " a menace to the purchasers." and " inferior low grade instruments." This general condemnation was, however, not supported by the presentation of any exhibits that would justify such a general condemnation. The only instrument which it could be said would in any way lend support to any of the general charges was exhibited some time after the inquiry had closed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that it will  be seen that these duties are not being imposed to protect purchasers from inferior pianos. They will be paid on serviceable instruments which the general community wish to use. The trade with America has increased tremendously, and the exports from that country to  Australia  supply food for thought. In 1921-22 our imports from the United States of America, were valued at £18,000,000, and they increased in 1925-26 to £37,000,000. The export from Australia to the United States of America, which in 1921-22  were  valued at £8,000,000, increased in 1925-26 to only £12,000,000 I admit these figures are alarming, but the importations of cheap pianos are not responsible for the large increase in our imports from the United States. Between the years' 1923 and 1926, the value of imports of player-pianos increased from £1,395,485 to £2,680,338, while imports of ordinary pianos declined in value from £1,036,419 to £338,477. </para>

              <para>- No doubt the honorable senator is right to a certain extent. As I have shown, the importations of player-pianos  from  America have doubled in three years. The figures relating to the imports of upright pianos for the three years ending 30th June, 1927, are as follows :- 1924-25, 10,225; 1925- 26, 6,254; 1926-27, 4,239. The poorer classes in the community are, in the main, the purchasers of these pianos, and the figures show that since imports of this class of instrument are declining, the Australian industry is not in any danger. There is only a limited number of manufacturers of pianos and player-pianos in Australia. If these duties are ratified, the people will have a more limited range of selection and of course they will have to pay a higher price for their instruments. Having had an opportunity  to  examine certain invoices, I find that a piano invoiced at £35 in Germany was, under the old rates, dutiable at £17 6s. lid., but under this item the duty is £25. </para>

              <para>- I think the effect will be to increase the price of the cheaper instruments to the people. One has only to go into our outback areas to realize what a difference a piano makes to the happiness of a home. Why, therefore, should we do anything to increase the price of this class of instrument to people who cannot afford to purchase player-pianos? Some time ago I asked a series of questions in the Senate with regard to the duty on pianos and was informed that for the year ending 30th June, 1925-26, the total amount of duty paid on pianos was £149,128, and on player-pianos £278,429, or a total of £427,557. The total of wages paid in the manufacturing industry in Australia during that year was only £335,502 in respect of the whole of the items included under the heading " Musical Instruments " - nearly £100,000 less than the revenue derived from importations. I protest strongly against the imposition . of the duties on these upright pianos, which will have the effect of increasing the cost to the people of this country. </para>

            <para>. - Honorable senators will observe that no increase is proposed in the duties on pianos imported from Great Britain. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> has pointed out, there has been a # considerable decrease in the number of ordinary pianos imported, and a corresponding increase in the importation of player-pianos. The old rates of duty - were applicable only when instruments were invoiced at less than £19 each. Australian manufacturers are suffering severe competition from the manufacturers of the cheaper American player-pianos. These imported instruments are being invoiced as low as £36 each, and during the last few years there must have been instances where they have been invoiced at even a much lower price, as duty has been paid on certain upright player-pianos at specific ra'tes of duty of £9 10s. each. The invoice value of these goods therefore could not have exceeded £1S or £19. Pianos invoiced at £36 are landed, duty paid, at from £66 to £68 and are being sold in retail shops at from £120 to £126 each. These profits are exorbitant. The cheapest player-piano made in Australia is somewhere in the region of £85. This instrument has to compete against the cheap American pianos. Certain departmental stores stock only those goods upon which they can make the greatest profit. In this way the sale of Australian-made goods is being seriously affected. In many cases the Australian instrument is not stocked because the retailer can make larger profits on the sale of imported pianos. I hope that the committee will pass the item in the interests of not only the Australian manufacturer, but also the British" manufacturer and "the dear old mother country " to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> referred so feelingly in the general debate on the tariff. </para>

The figures show that in 1922-23 the number of upright player-pianos imported from Great Britain was 148; in 1925-26, it was 214; and in 1926-27, it was 291. From Germany we imported 58 of these instruments in 1922-23, and no less than 1,993 during 1926-27. "What has become of the cry which we heard 'a few years ago, that never again should we trade with Germany? Our imports from that country show a substantial increase. America is, of course, our greatest competitor. In 1922-23 we imported from the linked States of America 2,746 player-pianos, and last year, 11,329. </para>

          <para class="block">Already there are many factories engaged in the manufacture of pianos and player-pianos in Australia, and they are turning out splendid instruments. The bulk of the material used is obtained in Australia. The Beale factory uses all Australian metal for its frames. It obtains iron from Hoskins Brothers and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's Steel "Works at Newcastle; the copper wire comes from Metal Manufacturers Limited, Port Kembla; bronze pressure bars from the Austral Bronze Company, Alexandria; glue from the Davis Gelatine Company, Botany; lacquer from the "Woolwich Chemical Company, Sydney; and timber from various Australian timber merchants. "We are encouraging not only the manufacture of pianos, but also the production of practically all the raw material that is used in their construction. The efficiency of Beale's factory cannot be questioned. The capital investments of that company total £650,000, and the wages distribution amounts annually to £160,000.

            <para>. - My interest in this debate is practically confined to the deplorably decadent influence of the player-piano upon the art of piano playing. Concurrently with the ever-increasing importations of player-pianos there is a rapid decrease in the number of pianos, and a thinning of the ranks- of pianists. Had the Minister for Trade and Customs been imbued with the true musical instinct he would have brought down an almost prohibitive tariff on player-pianos and pianos, and one that would have placed within the reach of every person the ordinary piano. In my young days every cottage had its piano, with the result that Australia produced many very fine artists. The number of boys and girls of the present generation who can play the piano artistically is considerably fewer than was the case at the period to which I refer. If in the future we have at the head of the department a Minister who is thoroughly imbued with the musical instinct relief in. the direction I have indicated may be given. </para>

In the vegetable kingdom we have a fruit which has the stone on the outside instead of the inside. In the animal kingdom there are such strange phenomena as beasts that jump when they run, and stand when they sit. So it is with the arguments of high protectionists. What are we- to believe, the old argument or the new - the old, that we were crushed out of the market by the low price of the foreigner; or the new, that we must give protection because the price of the foreigner is so high? </para>

              <para>- What else can be said of them ? The only vehicle for conveying the thoughts of man is speech; but it has been well said that speech is given to us to conceal our thoughts. If we recall the past utterances, &gt;both public and private, of those honorable senators whom I have indicated, we must come to the conclusion that they are against a tariff of this character, and that speech is so employed by them. I can only conclude that it is because we are mentally and physically at the antipodes where reversals occur in the vegetable and animal kingdoms. We cannot now frighten the people with the old argument about our inability to compete with an article that is produced at a low price by sweated  labour. The . protectionists of earlier times showed at least a semblance of consistency. I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> as a Himalayan protectionist, anxious to protect everything Australian, including the Australian workmen, against the inroads of the sweating foreigner. Now he stands four-square behind the Minister and says, " Give us protection, because the price of the imported article is so high." Where are our common sense and our logic? I am inclined to uphold the view put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman,</inline> little as he deserves my support. On this question of the tariff we are getting into a vicious circle. Honorable senators from Tasmania support what is agreeable to that State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> was not afraid to say so. The only redeeming feature of his pronouncement  was its extraordinarily refreshing frankness. He said, " If protection is to be the policy of this country " - meaning inferentially that it is a bad policy " let Tasmania participate in any benefits that accrue from it." In other words, if the country is going on a spree, let Tasmania be in the spree. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> made a similar statement in relation to another item in the schedule in modified form. </para>

              <para>- Of course I did; and I am proud of it, for the simple reason that the manufacture of local whiskey had not previously been given adequate protection. Whiskey can now be manufactured in Australia at a low price for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden.</inline> That is an illustration of my consistency. I am in favour of protection . up to a point, but no further. The result of having moved in a circle is this shocking anachronism in the shape of a tariff that has increased from 20 per cent., 25 per cent., and 30 per cent, to 45 per cent., 55 per cent., and 60 per cent. It has neither rhyme nor reason to sustain it. Admittedly, there is a break in the clouds. Honorable senators who come from any one State do not now always vote alike, for the simple reason that they realize that this kind of ' thing cannot continue. I rose particularly to point out the foolishness of the Minister's argument that we need protection in this case because the price of the foreign-made article is so high. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> gave us the usual rigmarole about imports. It would seem almost that our criminal law should be remodelled' so as to make it an offence for any person to be seen near an importer's place of business. By some persons imports are regarded in almost the same light as are stolen goods. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> seems to forget that the wool and wheat which we export are imports in the countries which purchase them. What would happen if other countries refused to accept our goods because to them they were imports? If they were to pay us back in our own coin honorable senators who now complain about the volume of our imports would realize the unsoundness of their argument. In this instance I support </para>

          <para class="block">The existing tariff does not' -protect any industry established to prepare rabbit skins, for manufacture into articles of apparel or attire. During the past two years the fur industry has been established in Tasmania and New South Wales. At first the companies experienced difficulties in obtaining the proper dyes, but last year permission was given by the Commonwealth Government for their importation, with the result that within a few months coney sealskin furs to the value of £22,000 were manufactured and sold. I have here some samples of furs treated in Hobart. The demand for furs is so great that the granting of a moderate measure of protection will provide employment for a large number of people in a very short time. Hitherto large quantities of furs and other skins have been imported from France and Germany. </para>

              <para>-  On a point of order I want to know where we stand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator '</inline> Payne is asking for a duty on the raw material required for making the apparel or attire referred to in sub-item a. It would be manifestly unfair if we agreed to duties of 40 per cent., 50 per cent, and 55 per cent, on apparel or attire including furs or other skins sewn together, and then subsequently agreed to a request for duties which would manifestly have the effect of increasing the price of the raw material of that attire. If that were done it would be necessary to impose higher duties than 40 per cent., 50 per cent, and 55 per cent, on apparel including furs. If we agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> request we shall not be able to go back to sub-item a and alter the. duties it imposes on apparel. I am prepared to vote for the item as it stands, but the adoption of this request might make a considerable difference to the effect of sub-item a. </para>

A very valuable fur industry, which was commenced under great difficulties, and in which I am not interested in any way, has been established in Tasmania. The company spent £40,000 in plant and operating costs; but found it difficult to successfully treat and finish ordinary rabbit skins owing principally to its inability to obtain the necessary dyes. The company stated that the industry could be successfully carried on if it were given reasonable facilities for importing the necessary dyes from Europe, and these having been provided, it has operated so successfully during the last six months that its sales have amounted to £22,000. I submit samples of the finished skins in the most' popular shades of coney. I have submitted a request for the very moderate duties of 25 per cent. </para>

A large number of fur coats, consisting of different . varieties of fur, - are made in Australia, but I am asking that this protection . shall apply only to rabbit skins. In view of the results which have followed the use of proper dyes, it must be apparent to every one that this industry, which is now in its infancy, when firmly established, will be of great importance to Australia. </para>

              <para>- No; I know the quantity of rabbit skins annually exported and the quantity used by our local factories. Even if the number treated locally increased ten-fold, it would not affect our export trade. Here we have an opportunity to deal with a raw product, and we should endeavour to foster this industry. It is better for us to manufacture articles of clothing from materials produced in this country than to export skins and purchase the finished articles from Germany, Belgium, and France. I have always favoured giving every consideration to British manufacturers and also of doing all we can to foster Australian trade. </para>

              <para>- I do not know the present value of rabbit skins, but I can give the value of the finished article, samples of which I have submitted. The cost of treating the skins abroad is 9d. each, but owing to the enormous difference in the cost of the material required in their treatment in Australia, the cost here is about Is.10d. a skin. This is due mainly to the high duties imposed on the ingredients used in the tanning and finishing process. At present, these. skins are sold to the wholesale trade at from 25s. to 50s. a dozen, according to size and quality, whilst imported skins of similar grade are landed at from 19s. to 40s. The duty of 40 per cent, that I am asking for will make up the difference between these prices. I am not asking for prohibitive duties, but for a tariff that is lower than that imposed for the protection of any other Australian industry. </para>

              <para>- Yes; to any industry manufacturing solely from raw materials produced in Australia. The preliminary difficulties have been overcome, and in order that the industry may be carried on successfully, more capital has to be raised, but this will depend entirely upon the protection to be afforded. I know of some who are . willing to subscribe additional capital if the industry can be placed on a commercial basis. Even if this protection is afforded, the company will not be able to make large profits, but it hopes to be able to pay its way. It should not be necessary to labour this question, as the advantage of having such an industry firmly established in Australiamustbe apparent to every one, particularly when fur garments are now so extensively worn. </para>

              <para>- The moderate amount of protection which I am asking is necessary. Employees engaged in this industry in France, Belgium and Germany  work  from 55 hours to 60 hours a week, as against 44 hours in Australia. In those countries the wages for men range from 25s. to 60s. a week, compared with from £4 4s. to £6 a week in Australia. For boys the wages on the continent are 16s. or 17s. a week, and in Australia from 20s. to 45s. Women on the continent receive from 15s. to 35s. a week, and in Australia from 40s. to 70s.; while girls get from 5s. to 12s. a week, compared with from 15s. to 35s. a week in Australia.. There is the same difference in the cost of dyes and other materials. For instance, dyes cost 6s. 3d. per kilo. on the continent, as against 15s. in Australia; peroxide of hydrogen 8£d., as against ls. 6£d. in Australia, and acetic "acid 3s. 3d., compared with 21s. in Australia. In the circumstances it would not be too much to ask for an ad valorem tariff of 50 per cent, instead of 40 per cent.; but I realize that it is not wise to ask for a high duty at the outset. The protection I am advocating will, I believe, be sufficient to place the industry on a satisfactory footing. </para>

            <para>. - One would imagine while listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> that this was an entirely new industry to Australia. At present there are within the precincts of this building at least three representatives of firms that have been engaged in the business for some years, without asking the Government or the Tariff Board for any assistance by way of protection. Let us examine the position and see where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> proposal would lead us. The honorable senator is asking for an ad valorem duty of 40 per cent, on some classes of imported skins. Since the bulk of "our imports are from foreign countries, the effective duty under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> proposal would be 40 per cent. It must be manifest to all honorable senators that owing to the high cost of production, there will be no' market in other countries for fur goods manufactured in Australia. I presume, therefore, that what the honorable senator has in mind is that we should build up the industry for the Australian' market. There is, approximately, £500,000 invested in the fur garment industry in Australia, which gives employment to between 4,000 and 5,000 people. For the higher class of goods, these Australian manufacturers are obliged to import skins from Belgium and France, the Australianskins not being large or heavy enough; but they use a certain percentage of Australian furs. If we impose this ad valorem duty of 40 per cent., the margin of protection for the Australian manufacturer of apparel coming under sub-item a will be only 15 per cent. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> seriously contend that that is sufficient to safeguard an Australian industry in which so much capital is invested, and which, as I have stated, gives employment to such a large number of men and women? I have been informed that if this ad valorem duty is imposed without a corresponding increase in the existing tariff on the manufactured garments, the Australian concerns already engaged in the business will cease manufacturing and become importers. As a result an Australian industry of some magnitude will be destroyed. This is a position which we cannot regard with equanimity. I may add that I have visited the Hobart factory, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has referred, and that it is my desire to do all in my power to assist the enterprise in that State. I think, however, that it would be much better if the position of the industry were submitted to the Tariff. Board for investigation and report as to the proper ratio of duty to be imposed on the manufactured goods, and on imported furs which are the raw materials for the local manufacturers. The proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has never been before the Tariff Board, and as it involves the fate of an Australian industry, it should be considered in all its aspects. . It is a serious matter. </para>

              <para>- Ninety per cent, of those which are sent to Australia are not made from Australian rabbit skins; they are altogether different from our skins. It is upon that section, that this duty of 40 per cent, will fall. I point out that if there is not a corresponding increase in the duty imposed on manufactured apparel, that industry will be ruined. Assistance may be given to one or two factories which are treating the type of skin exhibited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> but the number of persons which they employ is comparatively few. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Duncan</inline>has argued that I have proposed a duty of 40 per cent, on skins imported from the , ' continent ; that the duty on fur clothing is only 55 per cent. ; that therefore the Australian manufacturer will benefit to the extent of only 15 per cent.; and that that will mean the ruination of the fur clothing industry in Australia. Last year we imposed  a  duty of 45 per cent, on tweeds and one of 12s. 6d. on the finished garment that had been made from imported tweed. How does that work out ? The flat rate of 12s. 6d. on an overcoat invoiced in England at 30s., is equal to 40 per cent., which is 5 per cent, less than the duty on the tweed itself. On an overcoat invoiced in England at 25s. the duty of 12s. 6d. is equal to 50 per cent. Thousands of operatives depend upon that industry for their livelihood, and the clothing manufacturing trade in Australia has been put in a more flourishing condition. That is my reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline></para>

              <para>- No way is the right way if it does not meet with the approval of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.-</inline> On the tariff he is the " lone fisherman." I defy any member of the committee to forecast the way in which he will vote or act. He is a creature of impulse. He blows hot and cold. He makes it known to those who, like myself, are strong protectionists, that they can rely upon his vote. Accepting his word, they go away in the fond belief that they will have his support. But to their amazement they find subsequently that, like the weather, he has changed. He is never reliable. He ad vances foolish arguments - if by any stretch of imagination they can be called arguments - to bolster up his case.  His  final statement in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> request was that those who are engaged in making up fur skins will be forced out of business if the proposed duties are imposed. If that should be the case they might become what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> probably desires that they should become - wholesale importers of goods that have been produced cheaply and under conditions which differ from those that obtain in the industrial world of Australia. </para>

              <para>- I desire that the hat industry shall flourish in Australia. The duty on fur felt hats, the majority of which are made from the fur of the Australian rabbit, is 24s. per dozen, or 35 per cent. British ; 30s. per dozen, or 40 per cent, intermediate; and 36s. per dozen, or 45 per cent, general. Because of the duties imposed the hat industry is well established, and employment is provided for many Australians. It is argued that we should not -send our wool out of Australia. We have magnificent sheep, and our wool is probably the finest that is grown in the world; yet we send it overseas. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> favours the policy of ' encouraging the establishment of woollen mills in Australia, thus providing employment for an increasing number of our own people. The duty on worsteds is 1s. a square yard, and 30 per cent., and 2s. a square yard and 45 per cent. If it is a good thing to protect that industry, what is wrong with protecting . the industry to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has drawn attention? We have been informed that only one or two firms are engaged in it at the present time. I cannot say whether that statement is correct or not. It is sufficient for me to know that it has been struggling and striving to establish, itself during the last two years ; that it has been faced with serious competition; and that oversea prices are lower than those which permit its business to be profitable. Those who are engaged in the industry are probably in a better position to-day thar. that which they occupied a little while ago, when they were handicapped because they were unable to secure the necessary dyes. They have now passed the experimental stage, and have demonstrated the high quality anil the excellent finish of their goods. The industry is susceptible of improvement, and is capable of becoming firmly established. After all, who is a judge of fur; who can define exactly its quality and its value? It has been stated that fortunes are being made in The fur trade, and that furs made from the Australian rabbit skin have been sold at fancy prices as the finest that are grown in other parts of the world. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> request is agreed to, the people of Australia will have the guarantee that these furs will be sold under their proper name. </para>

              <para>- The skins of English rabbits are more suitable for the making of fur than are the skins of Tasmanian rabbits. From Canada we imported skins and furs valued at £2,226 in 1924-25, and £2,112 in 1925-26. From other countries our importations in those years were, respectively: Belgium, £10,238, £8,442; China, £6,727, £14,613;- France, £84,735, £76,334; Germany, £11,171, £10,406; Russia, £8,508, £7.488; and the United States of America, £88,420 and £41,865. Honorable senators will see that the United Kingdom heads that list. Of the skins imported, rabbit skins represent a large proportion. I am astonished. at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> moving a request which would injure the Old Country, concerning which he had so much to say on another item. </para>

It has been said that certain industries will be ruined if the duties proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> are imposed. Let me draw an analogy. If a duty is imposed on any article imported, the importer who has probably put a considerable amount of capital into his business for the disposal of such an article will be seriously affected.

              <para>- That is the position. Firms are importing skins and manufacturing them into coats, just as other firms, are importing timber and manufacturing it into doors'. If the committee says it will not protect the local rabbit skin industry, but believes in protecting every other industry, its logic is seriously at fault. I have listened to arguments about "the necessity for assisting the timber industry, and find many of them applicable to the subject under discussion. We have now an opportunity to turn into a blessing something, which has been a curse to Australia, and at the same time to assist an industry that may largely expand. I am informed that we are exporting each year nearly £3,000,000 worth of rabbit skins. Ever since I can remember I have heard it said in season and out of season that Australia should not export its wool, hut should manufacture it here into textiles. Surely we can draw another analogy here. Why should we export rabbit skins? Why should we not manufacture them into furs and other articles of apparel in Australia. We have heard it said that the </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Australian rabbit skin is not as good as the imported skin. I undertake to say that it is almost impossible to get the same quality o£ rabbit skins from every district in Australia. For instance, rabbits in mountainous country have dense fur, while those that are found in dry or swampy country have correspondingly thin fur. Surely we can turn the one into hats and the other into articles such as have been displayed here to-night. If the policy of Australia is to protect its industries, it would be a tragedy for the Senate, having an opportunity to assist one industry that may grow to large dimensions, to refuse it the measure of protection it needs. The rate of duty for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has asked is not prohibitive; nor is it excessive. It is only reasonable, and I claim that it is the bounden duty of this committee to agree to it. </para>

They make their own coney seal as far as- possible out of Australian skins, but they point out that the demand for garments made out of Australian skins is fairly limited, and that the demand which really pays them is for garments made from imported skins with which, I am sorry to say, the Australian skins cannot compare. </para>

              <para>- Yes; they are mainly importers of skins from which they manufacture apparel, and that is a section of their trade with which they do not want any interference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has claimed that the skins he has shown in the Chamber are the equal of the imported skins. If honorable sena-' tors will glance at the skins I am displaying they will note their size and quality and will readily understand  why  their price is so much higher than  that  of local skins. As a matter of fact  the  two classes of skins do not come into competition with one another in the articles into which they are made. If the duty proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is imposed these Sydney firms will have to pay so much more for their skins that their business will be seriously affected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in his attempt to reply to my arguments tried to look intelligent and asked himself foolish questions  to  which he gave foolish answers.  He  turned himself into an animated interrogation mark. He charged me with being anti-Australian. Yet in this case I stand for 'the welfare of an Australian industry with a capital of  £500,000,  employing between  4,000  and  5,000  workers. To my mind, a large industry like this should have prior consideration to' a small industry with comparatively few workers, and with not nearly the same amount of capital invested in it. It would be wrong  to sacrifice a big industry to help a little one, but if we can assist both we ought to do so. I want .to give the highest protection possible to the industry which is making coney seal out of Australian rabbit skins; and if, as a. result of inquiry by the Tariff Board or any other authority it is found that a 40 per cent, duty is necessary, I shall give it my wholehearted support. The industry referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is well worthy of support. When' I was in .Hobart I inspected the factory and I promised the proprietor to afford him all the support I could give, but I cannot give him that support on the proposal made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> unless something is done for the other and bigger industry already in existence which might suffer even to the extent of having to go out of business. Let us do -something for both industries in a just and equitable way. It is grossly unfair to accuse me of trying to do something to injure the smaller industry, but so far we have not had from those who are supporting this request any suggestion that they will support a corresponding increase of duties on manufactured apparel coming under this item. On the contrary any one who puts in a word for the manufacturer of apparel is attacked. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has attacked me, saying that I am an opponent of Australian industry. One could not imagine a more foolish statement. All I hope is that -the interests of the larger industry I have mentioned will not be lost sight of in seeking to give help to the smaller industry. I believe that we should give help to both, but it would be wrong to give help to the one at the expense of the other. </para>

            <para>-AS. - I have no hesitation in telling the honorable senator what I propose to do. I do not see why this industry should not be protected as other industries have been protected, but, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> first of all I want to know what effect the proposed duty will have on the larger and bigger industry of making apparel. When I entered Parliament many years ago we used to. hear from the protectionists of those days that all we had to do was to put a duty, on an article and that article" became cheaper. I had heard that said so often that I almost began to believe it, but people are now beginning to realize that when a duty is placed on an article it becomes dearer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays put up a rattling good case the other day for duties on timber when he pointed out that owing to the imposition of duties everything used in the saw-mills had become more costly to purchase. He quite upset the theory that duties make articles cheaper. I agree that if we impose duties on rabbit' skins we shall certainly make the raw material for the manufacture of certain apparel much more costly. </para>

              <para>- That is granted, and, of course, the difficulty can be overcome by increasing the duty on the manufactured article. If the cost of the raw material is increased the manufactured article will become so expensive that imported goods will be purchased. We can get over some of our difficulties by imposing higher duties, but the locally manufactured article will become more expensive. Fur coats cannot be purchased by every one, and if they become more costly the demand will decrease. If we wish to ensure that rabbit skins only shall be used we should impose an embargo on imported skins, just as we have imposed an embargo on- the importation of sugar, and thus ensure the whole of the local market to Australian manufacturers. That would enable the industry to be successfully carried on ; but I do not suggest it is the right way. I am not in favour of higher duties, because I know that the cost of the locally produced article will be higher. I think additional information is needed, and that, therefore, the Government should refer the matter to the Tariff Board, the appointment - of which, by the way, I opposed. If that body, after hearing both sides of the case, advocates the imposition of  higher duties I shall support them. In the present circumstances I feel compelled to vote against the request. </para>

            <para>. - Had I thought for a moment that a knowledge of the Government's attitude towards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> proposal would have any effect upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> I should have spoken earlier in the discussion on this item. This freetrade Ephraim, however, ".is joined to idols," and so I propose to "let him alone." The Government is supporting the request moved by . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> because . it considers this new industry deserves a larger measure of protection than it has hitherto received. It is true that the request if agreed to, will have the effect of reducing the margin of protection at present enjoyed by manufacturers of garments consisting of the particular kinds of fur which it covers. But it is quite . erroneous to argue that the only protection the manufacturers will have will be the 15 per cent, difference between the proposed duty upon rabbit skins and the present duty on the made-up garments. They will have the full 5.5 per cent, duty on the cost of manufacture abroad. They will have the 55 per cent, duty imposed upon the foreign manufacturers' product, and also a margin of 15 per cent, on the fur, to all of which amounts must be added the 10 per cent, added to cost before the duty is assessed. There will therefore still be a considerable margin of protection. It must be admitted that . 55 per cent, is a very substantial protection. Those who have spoken in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> request, have made out a very good case. It commends itself to the Government, and without desiring to injure any industry I shall have no hesitation in supporting it. </para>

          <para> Board is a useful institution, and, in accordance with its report, we have, at the instance of the furriers of Australia, substantially increased the duties on fur trimmings under item 112. It is wrong, however, to suggest that the Tariff Board is superior to Parliament, and trial when a proposition commends itself to a majority of members, Parliament should not. declare its inability to reach a proper decision. </para>

Only to-day I received a letter from a firm established in New South Wales, engaged, not only in the manufacture of coney from rabbit skins, but in the manufacture of fur garments. That is the kind of firm which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has in mind. The communication is from Furs Limited, Sydney, whose showrooms are in Pomeroy House, York-street. This is what the manager writes - </para>

            <para>We note the contents of the letter received from you to-day, in which you state that you have indicated your intention to move for an item providing for duties of 25 per cent., 35 per cent., and 40 per cent, respectively, on rabbit skins finished for articles of attire. In our opinion these will be likely to meet the requirements of the case, and, as far as we are concerned, we think will be sufficient to put us on a competitive basis. We are in an entirely different position to Tasmanian Fur Traders Limited, and other manufacturers, inasmuch as we make up in our factories all the coney seals we are producing. </para>

              <para>- In the first place I had a letter from Tasmanian Fur Traders Limited asking me to move to get moderate protection for the industry up to 50 per cent, under the general tariff. I wrote to the firm in Sydney, sending them a copy of the request I intended to submit. That, I think, was a reasonable course to adopt. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> now asks me to produce the letter I wrote to the firm. I communicated with the company, which is a reputable one, stating my intentions. My letter to the firm in question simply stated that I proposed to move a certain amendment to the item when the Senate resumed consideration of the tariff this week. </para>

              <para>- In this Senate 1 am a representative of the whole of the people of Australia, and in particular I am a representative of Tasmania if an attempt is made to interfere with its privileges. I trust that honorable senators will not be afraid of the bogy that has been raised to-night. There is nothing in it. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> has explained that the ad valorem duties which I am asking shall be imposed will not have the effect on the industry which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> fears they will. I remind honorable senators also that we dealt with much the same problem last year, when we were asked to impose a heavy rate of duty on imported tweeds at the request of clothing manufacturers. On that occasion we imposed a flat rate of 12s. 6d. on every imported overcoat. The ad valorem duty on overcoats is now equal only to the fixed duty on the tweed, the raw material. That industry does not enjoy a margin of 15 per cent, protection, which will be given to our fur manufacturers, even if the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> are sound ; nevertheless, the clothing manufacturers of Australia are able to carry on successfully. It has been urged, also, that the proposal now before the committee has not been fully considered. I raised no objection to a postponement last week, when the Minister suggested that the Government would like time to consider it. Now the Minister tells us that, after having given the proposal careful consideration, the Government intends to support it. It has been said, also, that the Tasmanian company has attempted to avoid an inquiry by the Tariff Board.' As a matter of fact, it was not competent for the company to approach the Tariff Board with a request for tariff protection until it had received permission to import certain dyes so as to establish its claim to be a manufacturing concern. Therefore, there was no possibility of getting this proposal before the Tariff Board in time for consideration by Parliament this session. In the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to ask Parliament to deal with this item as an emergency case since those who are interested in the industry have furnished the information asked for by the Tariff Board, and have complied with the  Usual  procedure. Only the other day we dealt with another item which might be regarded as analogous to this. When it was pointed out that, owing to the effect of competition from overseas, the Australian'1 woollen tweed industry was in a. parlous position, an item to give protection to it was agreed to unanimously. </para>

              <para>- I am sure that my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll,</inline> does not. wish to misrepresent me, and therefore, I must assume that his memory is at fault. All I said was that the industry in question had been the subject of a careful inquiry by the Tariff Board last year, and that as the Tariff Board had fixed the weight of tweed per square yard at 6£ oz., it seemed strange that another application should be made to depart from the recommendation of the board, after both sides had been heard. I urged that in the circumstances some explanation was necessary, and having obtained it from the Minister I had nothing further to say in opposition to the item. In all probability it was absolutely essential that the woollen industry in the southern portion of the continent should have that protection. The fur industry is now in the same position. It requires our help. I hope, therefore," that the Senate will agree to my requested amendment. </para>

I understand thatSenator Duncan's exhibit was manufactured from the skins of domesticated rabbits. In the circumstances I am prepared to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> requested amendment if he will add a proviso excepting furs manufactured from the domesticated rabbit, because manifestly it would be unfair to impose a high duty on expensive skins, manufactured from the domesticated rabbit, for the purpose of encouraging the manufacture of furs from inferior skins. </para>

            <para>. -  It is to be regretted that we have not more knowledge of an industry which, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has informed us, has been in existence in Australia for some years. I wish to assist that industry and. also the one referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> Unfortunately, until to-night we knew nothing of the fur manufacturers in New South Wales,, and do not know whether they are struggling for existence or are on - a satisfactory footing. I feel sure that if honorable senators had the whole of the facts before them they would be just as anxious to safeguard the New South Wales industry as they are to encourage the industry in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is interested. I doubt, however, if the duties asked for are high enough.  I  believe the overseas firms will make  a  determined attempt to crush the industry by cutting the price of the imported furs. In all probability we shall discover later that the duty which is now proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is not sufficiently high. It is well known that Australian industries can manufacture only enough to provide for local consumption. Those who are engaged in this industry will doubtless make every endeavour to capture the Australian market. I wish them every success, and hope that their industry will grow. It is astonishing that they have not asked sooner for a duty. </para>

              <para>- If our economic conditions are to be maintained at their present level, the taxpayer must pay the cost. Another aspect of the matter is that if this becomes a big industry the rabbit may be protected in certain areas in Australia suitable for the purpose where it will not be a menace to landowners, and instead of being a pest it will be a valuable asset. If anything is done on these lines it must be carried out under proper supervision. We send overseas for high-class stud sheep and cattle to improve our flocks and herds. If this industry proves of value to Australia a. similar method can be employed to improve the quality of the rabbit. </para>

              <para>- Only in proportion to the rest of Australia. For that reason I do not intend to vote for the honorable senator's request. During the past week I have been shocked by the number and variety of the wares that have been brought into this chamber. Such a thing would not be allowed in any other Parliament in . the Commonwealth. The plea that protection is necessary for the working man is bunkum. The salvation of the workers of the Commonwealth does not lie in the direction of a protective tariff. The problems that confront Australia are infinitely greater than those which face this fur industry. One can always tell when an industry is in a serious position by the number of occasions upon which its representatives are present at the sittings of this chamber. Like those who go to prayer meetings, they are regular attendants. I do not blame them for looking after their interests. They are. justified, so long  as  we allow that practice to continue. But we must speak and act independently of any  outside influence. No man is greater than his environment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> environment to-night will not prove of any assistance to him. </para>

            <para>.- This afternoon I asked the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, " What is the loss or profit on the working of the Beam section of the Amalgamated Wireless Company?" and I was informed that the information is not available in the Postmaster-General's Department. Half the shares in that company are held by the Government on behalf of - the people of Australia, and I desire to know whether honorable senators are entitled to get information about the company; if so, to what Minister should my question he addressed. I did not expect that the information would be in the files of the Postmaster-General's Department; hut I assumed that it would be obtained, and, if we are entitled to it, I hope that the Minister representing the Postmaster-General will get it for me. </para>

          <para>According to a statement published in the press tenders have been received in London for the purchase of the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers. The Prime Minister has stated that the details of the tenders are being sent to Australia by mail, because it would cost a small fortune to transmit the information by wireless or cablegram. I understand that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has not sufficient overseas traffic to keep it operating half-time; if that is so, would it not be an act of statesmanship to utilize this modern service in order to get the information promptly? Must governments still adhere to old-fashioned methods of communication? </para>

Amalgamated Wireless. (Australasia) Limited is in competition with two cable companies.

              <para>- Yes ;but only in the -same  way as Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and the Commonwealth Oil Refineries are bound to publish their reports and balance- sheets. These are public companies, and the reports and balance-sheets will he made available in due course. But to disclose business details at any period of the year in regard to concerns in which the taxpayers' money  is  invested would be extremely unwise. The information is not at the disposal of the Postmaster-General. The Government must rely on its representatives on the board of directors of Amalgamated Wireles (Australasia) Limited to safeguard the interests of the taxpayers of Australia. </para>

            <para>[10.35]. - Reports  which  are laid on the table of the Senate become the property of the chamber and it is for the Printing Committee . to decide what is to be done with them. That committee is expected to . go through all reports laid on the table and decide which shall be printed, because obviously, it is not necessary to print them all. If a document is laid on the table and not printed the fault lies, not with the Government, hut with the Printing Committee of the Senate. It is rather interesting to learn that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Andrew,</inline> who has just interjected that the Printing Committee meets about once in every five years, is a member of that committee. If  it  does not meet the fault  is Mb.  The Senate does not tell the committee when it ought to meet; the members of the committee themselves decide when they shall meet. I have learnt, however, that the report of the Postmaster-General was laid on the table of the House of Representatives to-day and ordered to be . printed.
