          <para>I had hoped to be able to give the Senate a statement of the budget this afternoon, us the Treasurer proposed to deliver his budget speech in another place soon after it met. I understand, however, that the adjournment of that House has been moved in order to permit of the discussion of another matter. This will prevent the budget from being presented till a later hour in the day. In these circumstances it seems hardly necessary to ask honorable senators to come back to-night, to hear a statement on the budget from me ; especially, as with the business on the notice-paper we should be able to take the statement to-morrow. </para>

            <para>. - I object strongly to the motion for the adjournment of the Senate at this stage. On Thursdays private members&#39; business takes precedence after eight o&#39;clock. That is our only opportunity to discuss private business. The Senate reassembled yesterday after about three months&#39; holiday; but unhappily owing to the death, during the recess, of an honorable senator and a member of another place, we adjourned without having transacted any business. There is a certain amount of private members&#39; business to be dealt with; but it is anticipated that Parliamentwill prorogue in about four weeks&#39; time, and we shall shortly be informed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate that owing to the volume of Government business it will be impracticable to discuss private members&#39; business. As honorable senators are, I believe, prepared to proceed with the discussion of such motions, we should not, at this stage, be asked to agree to an adjournment, particularly as some of those now on the notice-paper could be dealt with between now and the dinner adjournment. </para>
