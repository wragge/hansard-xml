The schedules containing the board&#39;s specific recommendations are complete, with the exception of a few which have not yet been considered by the Government. When these have been dealt with they will be laid on the table. Many of the board&#39;s reports referred . to in the papers accompanying the annual report have been laid already on the table of the Senate and printed, and formed the basis of action taken in the tariff schedule lately before the Senate. In respect of the board&#39;s recommendations in connexion with the by-law items of the tariff, and other matters apart from tariff revision, the action taken is set out on the schedule to the report in respect of each recommendation, and all such by-laws made have been duly published in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette.</inline> Under these circumstances it is not proposed to print the papers annexed to the report. </para>

          <para>The Minister for Home and Territories has supplied the following answer: - 1 and 2. The whole question of the extension of the Queanbeyan-Canberra railway to the north is being considered in conjunction with the lake scheme, but it is anticipated that it will be at least twelve months before the present investigations are completed. It may bc mentioned that there has never been a public line for railway traffic to Ainslie. The line which was previously laid was a constructional tramway only and was put out of commission as a result of heavy floods in July, 1 922, when the trestle bridge over the Molonglo River collapsed and the approaches were washed away. </para>

              <para>- I do not think so. Should the Government persist in its attitude and force the unfortunate leaseholders who are being attacked in this way by the Federal Capital Commission to take the case to the High Court, it will find itself in &#34; queer street.&#34; I want to obviate any such happening, largely because of the expense which necessarily attaches to an action before the High Court. Before  that court could be approached the matter would first have to come before a local magistrate; then on appeal, the case would go to a district court, while a further appeal would be necessary to bring it before the High Court. </para>

          <para class="block">I direct special attention to the words &#34; a later date.&#34; The ordinance provides that it shall be deemed to have commenced on the 5th day of November, 1925, notwithstanding that the ordinance itself is dated the 27th July, 1928. The ordinance is therefore retrospective. I submit that, except in special circumstances, we should be chary about countenancing retrospective ordinances, regulations or legislation. There may be times when retrospective legislation is necessary, but those occasions ought to be very few, and even then they should be confined to great issues upon which there is little difference of opinion. The issue before us is not of that- nature, for with the exception of the unfortunate residents whom it affects, the ordinance is not regarded as an issue by the people of Australia. This Parliament is being asked to countenance what is really an act of repudiation by the Commission. Indeed, should Parliament agree to the ordinance, it also will be guilty of repudiation. In order that honorable senators will be in a position to register an intelligent vote I propose to trace the history of this case. The ordinance applies to lands sold on the leasehold principle either by the Federal Capital Commission . or by the Government prior to the appointment of the Commission. The original sale was conducted by auctioneers acting on behalf of the Government. The only responsible officer of the Government present at that sale was the then Surveyor-General,  Colonel Goodwin,  who has admitted in a statutory declaration that at that sale he stated that kerbing and guttering were not charges which would be levied on the purchasers of the land. That statement, which was made with the object of increasing the competition for the blocks, had the desired effect. It was generally understood by the purchasers of land that they would not be responsible for the cost of kerbing and guttering. Acting on the assurance they had received, people bid for the blocks, and later took possession. </para>

              <para>-  Colonel Goodwin  was the senior responsible officer representing the Government at the sale, and he is not the type of man to make wild or stupid statements. He believed that what he said was absolutely correct. If that, was his firm opinion, how much more forcibly must the idea have been impressed on the minds of the majority of prospective buyers present at the sale? Statutory declarations have been made by other persons present, alleging that  Colonel Goodwin  did make the statement to which I have referred, and that they acted subsequently in the belief that kerbing and guttering charges would not be levied upon them. Still others have made statutory declarations to the effect that they cannot remember such a statement being made. The auctioneer himself declares that he has no recollection of the occurrence, but he will not go so far as to say that it did not happen. When the Commission proposed to levy kerbing and guttering charges, the matter was raised in another place, and the Minister for Home and Territories made a statement in that House. The honorable gentleman had already been waited upon by purchasers of Canberra land, and made aware that a legal opinion had been obtained that the proposed charges were <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> In all sincerity those people laid their cards on the table and placed all the facts of the case before the honorable gentleman. The Minister admitted by his subsequent action that they were right in claiming that the original ordinance was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> as he issued the amending ordinance which I now have in my possession. I submit that the amending ordinance is also <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> and as hideously unfair as the earlier action of the Government and its agent, the Commission. The Government, having fired one barrel which proved to be a squib, should have admitted its mistake and abided by the terms of the original agreement. </para>

Undoubtedly the Government had no legal right to impose kerbing and guttering charges in the first place, and it should have adhered to the terms that were announced on the day of the sale. The original agreement specified the costs that had to be met, and did not in any way mention kerbing and guttering.

              <para>- There are any amount of leaseholds from the Crown in all parts of Australia, and everywhere in this country the owner of a freehold, whether he be a private individual or the Crown, is responsible for curbing and guttering charges. Leaseholders pay such costs only when that is expressly stated in their leases, which was not done in this instance. In the circumstances, I contend that the action of the Government and of the Commission is unfair.I know that different legal opinions have been expressed on this matter, but it is customary for lawyers to differ. I do not deal with the matter only from the legal point of view. There is an important moral aspect involved, which I hope will have the consideration of this Senate. We are under a moral obligation to them and we have to stand up to any obligation, actual or implied. The Minister denies that this is an actual obligation, but I have said sufficient I think to establish it as at least a moral obligation. </para>

I submit that it is the duty of the Government to meet the lessees in the most impartial way. . It is not for the Government to make up its mind and not budge a point, simply saying &#34; That is the position, and you must accept it whether you like it or not.&#34; Honorable senators are not in the position of attackers or defenders of the Commission. They are here to see that justice is done and should approach questions of this kind in the most impartial way possible. The Government is in the same position. It must be impartial but it is not if it does not ask the lessees to come to it and state their case fully, and if having done so it is not prepared to say to them &#34; If it is proved that you are right, we shall drop this ordinance.&#34; </para>

          <para>The lessees having been once bitten, are not prepared to be bitten twice. They have no guarantee that even if they prove that the new ordinance is wrong the Government will not come down with an amending ordinance to get over all legal difficulties and all the unsurmountable hurdles that the lessees have been able to put up. It is quite possible that the Government may so amend the law that it may be dated retrospectively over a sufficient period to enable it to do what it wants to do. But that is not the proper way to treat the lessees of the Federal Capital Territory. When the Commission proposed to take a certain course which it was afterwards proved to the satisfaction of the Government could not be taken, an amending ordinance was gazetted, and I think that the facts I have given indicate that even that amending ordinance is as <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> as was the original one. If the Government forces these unfortunate people to fight their case through several courts it will not be just to them ; that is certainly not the proper way for a great Federal Government to deal with its tenants. After all, the people concerned are our tenants. The lessees of the Federal Capital Territory should not be put to the enormous expense which will be involved in testing in the courts the legality of this . ordinance. I hope that the Government will view the matter in a reasonable way so that all the difficulties likely to arise through the course of action now proposed by the Federal Capital Commission, may be avoided. Every one recognizes that there is not in the Territory at the present time the spirit of good will and fellowship between the Commission and the lessees and other residents of the Territory that there ought to be. We have now an opportunity to help to build up a new sentiment of goodwill and co-operation that will make all in the Territory work together for its general benefit and for the advancement of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Senate will see that this ordinance is not allowed to stand. We are, under the statute, given power to disallow any. ordinance that we think is not a fit and proper ordinance. We rarely exercise that power because it seldom becomes necessary to do so. But when it does become necessary we should not hesitate to disallow an ordinance. The Administration may be prepared to come to the assistance of any commission or any body that is acting manifestly in an unfair and improper way, but in this matter I do not cast any reflection on the Government. In all probability it has not been consulted to any great extent about this ordinance to which I object. If the ordinance itself is right it ought to stand, but if it is wrong, and I claim it is, the Senate should not hesitate to disallow it. </para>

              <para>- That may be so, but the honorable senator is appearing for those who are antagonistic to the Commission, and therefore I, say at once that the Government takes full responsibility for this ordinance. Its very terms indicate that it was passed with the approval of the Government. The honorable senator therefore must direct his attack at the Government and leave the Commission out of the question. The Government does not desire to shelter behind the Commission. I cannot understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> should have appealed to honorable senators to be jealous of the rights and privileges of Parliament. There has been no invasion of the rights and privileges of Parliament. This Parliament, because it did not want to become a mere parliament for Canberra, endowed the Government openly, and with full knowledge, with the right to make ordinances with respect to the Federal Capital Territory. It recognized that the people of the Territory were entitled to have a code of laws but it did not want a Parliament, elected by the millions in Australia, to be occupied in passing laws for Canberra. It therefore delegated to the Government the power to make ordinances for the Territory, and in that respect I regret that too much of the time of this Parliament has already been taken up by Canberra affairs. In fact, there is a danger that the National Parliament may degenerate into a parliament for Canberra. A great many of the matters relating to the Territory that have been brought up here, ought to have been left to the people of Canberra themselves. In that connexion the Government hopes to give the residents of the Territory the opportunity they should have of expressing their own views on municipal matters where they ought to be expressed, and that is on the Commission controlling the Territory. When that is done I hope that less of the time of this Parliament will be taken up in discussing what are purely municipal affairs that ought never to be discussed in a national parliament. My remarks on this point are prompted by the honorable senator&#39;s statement that in some way or other the privileges of Parliament have been undermined or given away </para>

          </interjection>
          <para>Looking at the matter, apart altogether from the points raised by the honorable senator, is it not a fact that if a person has property in any other part of Australia and the municipal authorities lay down a footpath alongside that property the owner has to pay a share of the cost of making it? The property owner pays his share of the cost of making not only the guttering and kerbing, but also the footpath. It is, as a matter of fact, common knowledge in Australia that that is one of the liabilities of the owner of a property. If a person buys land anywhere in Australia, he does so on the assumption that if the municipality in which the land is situated provides a footpath, he will be called upon to pay his share of the cost of making it. Likewise, the persons who came to Canberra in the days of the first auction sale, came here with the knowledge and on the assumption that if they bought leaseholds here they would have to pay their share of the cost of making footpaths. I venture to assert that all. the buyers who attended the first sale had that assumption in their minds - that the common practice all over Australia would be applied here. I have a very distinct recollection of that first sale, because I&#39; was the Minister who approved of the conditions of sale. I went over them dozens of times with various officers of whom  Colonel Goodwin  was one. He afterwards ceased to be an officer of the department, but at that time was the officer who advised us on land matters. I went over the conditions of sale with the auctioneer. Certain conditions were printed on the forms which advertised the sale. If we were about to effect a revolutionary change, if we were about to do something in respect of properties in Canberra that had not obtained anywhere else in Australia, and would have added considerably to the attractiveness of purchasing land in Canberra, should we not have included it in the conditions of sale? Should we not have starred it on the plans we issued? Should we not have said on those plans, &#34; Here you will have a privilege that you have not enjoyed anywhere else in Australia&#34;? Of course we would have done so, but it was not done, and those who are raising the issue now do not claim that it was done. In fact they cannot point to anything in the conditions of sale to support their present contention. It is true that years after the sale  Colonel Goodwin  made a discovery and told some one certain things, but it is news to me to learn that  Colonel Goodwin  was authorized to tell any one anything at the sale in regard to the conditions. My recollection is that the announcement of the conditions of sale was to be made by the auctioneer. At any rate he was the only person authorized to announce the conditions of sale. I certainly have no recollection of authorizing  Colonel Goodwin  to say anything to any one. </para>

I have told honorable senators the state of mind in which people attended the first sale. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> says that an attempt has been made to get round an act of Parliament. Why does he use language which amounts to an accusation against the Minister for Home and Territories? As a matter of fact, no attempt has been made to get round any act of Parliament. No act of Parliament can lay down all the conditions governing the Territory. The Seat of Government Administration Act is simply an enabling act, and in that respect it is just like the Constitution Act. The Federal Convention did not attempt to lay down in the Constitution Act all the legislation that would express what it meant. Year after year since the establishment of federation, there has been passed legislation in which this Parliament has endeavoured to interpret what the framers of the Constitution put into it. Similarly, the Seat of Government Administration Act does not purport to contain all the provisions and regulations under which the people who live in the Territory are to be governed. Parliament directed that that should be done by ordinances. </para>

I am saying that there has been no attempt to get around an act of Parliament. But there has been an attempt to do what the Government does every time an act is passed by Parliament - there has been an attempt to express the will of Parliament. The ordinances relating to the Federal Territory are an attempt to express the will of Parliament in respect of the powers conferred upon the Government by the Seat of Government Administration Act. </para>

          <para class="block">It did not specify what the services were. It did not specifically mention sanitary, lighting or other services but gave the Minister a general power to make charges for services. The Minister therefore had power to make charges for guttering, kerbing and footpaths. As there might have been some doubt whether they were included in &#34; services &#34;, we expressly provided for them in the later ordinance. In other words, that ordinance was a declaratory one. It was intentionally brought into operation in the form of an amendment of the Building and Service Ordinance of 1.924. The authorization of 1924 to make charges was intended to cover services such as the provision of guttering and kerbing, but a question having then been raised as to whether guttering or kerbing was a &#34; service &#34;, the amending ordinance was brought down to remove all doubt on the point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> urged that in 1925 we did not intend to charge for guttering and kerbing, but that in 1928 we made up our minds to do so and accordingly made the provision retrospective to 1925. That is not so. I repeat that it was intended to charge lessees for guttering  and kerbing in 1024 when the first ordinance was passed ; that we intended the word &#34; service &#34; to cover such charges; and that doubts having arisen on the point, the later ordinance was framed to make it clear that lessees here are so liable, just as they are everywhere else in Australia. The honorable senator has suggested that proceedings will be instituted before the High Court. The Commonwealth will welcome such proceedings. </para>

          <para>On the particular question of the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to enact retrospective legislation Griffith, <inline font-style="italic">C.J.,</inline> disagreed with the majority of the court, but the decision of the other five judges must, of course, be accepted as authority on the question. The Building and Services Ordinance 192S was passed in pursuance of the powers conferred by the Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909 and the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910. Section 12 of the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 provides that &#34;until the Parliament makes other provision for the government of the Territory, the Governor-General may make ordinances having the force of law in the Territory.&#34; The section also provides for the notification and disallowance of ordinances. There can be no question as to the plenary nature of the power conferred by this section and consequently the decision of the High Court in <inline font-style="italic">The King</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Kidman</inline> must apply to Ordinances for the Seat of Government. It seems clear, therefore, that the Governor-General has power to provide for the retrospective operation of Ordinances for the Seat of Government. So much for the legal side. Let us now come to the facts. On 20th October, 192? the Federal Capital Commission, purporting to act under the powers conferred upon it by the Building and Services Ordinance 1924-1925, made certain regulations known as the Roads and Footpath Regulations. These regulations, which were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> on 10th November, 192T, provided, inter alia, for the charging of lessees with a proportion of the cost of the construction of kerbing and guttering adjoining their properties. These charges were resisted by a number of lessees on the ground that it had been officially announced . at the first auction sale of leases at Canberra on the 12th December, 1924, that the cost of these works were included in the reserve prices fixed for the blocks offered. It was alleged that Colonel J. T. H. Goodwin had made the announcement, but he stated that the announcement was made by the auctioneer acting under his instructions. Colonel Goodwin would in the first place have no authority to give such an instruction to the auctioneer. </para>

Statutory declarations furnished by several officers of the Federal Capital Commission, who were also present at the sale, support this view. The auctioneer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Crammond,  said that the question of kerbing and guttering was never mentioned and that this is confirmed by a search made by him of all the records, including a transcript of his remarks in the newspaper. Barely three months after the sale, when referring to a memorandum to him from the secretary of the Federal Capital Commission, Colonel Goodwin stated that &#34; in making valuations it was considered that the formation of roads would not be a charge against the lessees, otherwise the valuations would have been lower, but that the matter of forming a footpath and kerbing and guttering is quite another matter &#34;. That statement by Colonel Goodwin ip on record on the official file. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE.Yes, years afterwards.  Colonel Goodwin&#39;s  statement on this occasion is inconsistent with his averment that the auctioneer, acting under his instructions, announced at the sale that the cost of kerbing and guttering . had been included in the reserve price of the blocks. </para>
          <para>Further, an examination of the figures relating to the reserve prices placed on the blocks shows that it is almost incredible, from a practical point of view, that kerbing and guttering had been taken into account. This contention having been disposed of, certain lessees took up the attitude that the owner of the land - the Federal Capital Commission - and not the lessees should be charged with the cost of kerbing and guttering. In this connexion, it is pointed out that the freehold of land in the Territory cannot be sold, <inline font-style="italic">vide</inline> the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1924-1926, but a 99 years&#39; lease in the Territory is regarded as equivalent to freehold elsewhere. </para>
          <para>In such a case, the lessee is regarded as owner and liable for a proportion of the cost of construction of kerbs and gutters. It has been ascertained that, so far as the city of Sydney is concerned, kerbs and gutters were constructed by the council before leases were sold. The prices of the leases would, naturally, bo adjusted accordingly. Further inquries made elicited the information that, id respect of two large leasehold estates, namely, the Holt-Sutherland estate and the Cooper estate, which were subdivided by the lessors and sold on long term leases, kerbs and gutters were constructed by the local councils in each case, and that in both cases, the lessees, not the lessors, had met the payments involved. Some doubt was cast upon the legality of the action of the Commission in imposing charges for kerbs and gutters and it was alleged that the roads and footpaths regulations made under the ordinance were <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> There was, at least, some doubt whether the definition of the word &#34; services &#34; covered the regulations made by the Commission, but it is quite clear that it was intended that the term should bear a wider meaning than that placed upon it by objectors to the imposition of the charges complained of. It is not considered that any technicality should outweigh the moral considerations which spring from the intention underlying the principal ordinances, the understanding which evidently prevailed prior to the raising of the technical point now taken, and the inherent reasonableness of the claims made against the lessees. To put the matter beyond doubt, the ordinance objected to, No. 17 of 1928, was ac-&#39; cordingly promulgated, to take effect as from the 5th November, 1925, the date of ordinance No. 9 of 1925, which gave the Commisison power to make regulations dealing with the supply of services. Among the points raised this afternoon was one that there is no provision in the leases for these charges. If that contention is to hold, we might as well say that the residents of Canberra shall not be called upon to pay rates, because at the time of the sale there was no provision for the levying of rates. In fact, if that argument is to hold, the lessees of land in Canberra should not be charged for anything which is not specifically set out in their leases. There are charges for other services than kerbing and guttering. </para>
          <para>It has also been objected that the definition of kerbing and guttering as services would involve lessees in payment for maintenance of kerbing and guttering as well as the contribution of half the original cost. This is erroneous, as under the definition of &#34; services &#34; in the amending ordinance now under consideration the reference is to the construction of footpaths, kerbs and gutters. There is no reference to maintenance. The maintenance of kerbing and guttering will be met from the general rates which are levied annually under the Rates Ordinance. </para>
          <para>I ask honorable senators to remember that there are two parties to this case - the residents of this Territory and the general taxpayers of Australia. </para>

              <para>- Is not the tenure in Canberra equal to freehold ? I have already quoted instances of leaseholders in other parts of Australia being called upon to pay for kerbing and guttering. Are we to make the residents of Canberra a privileged class at the expense of the rest of Australia? I know that there has been a good deal of canvassing of honorable senators in this matter, but I ask them, in dealing with it, to remember that they are responsible to the taxpayers of Australia as a whole. This ordinance does no injustice to the people of Canberra. It merely places them on the same footing as that of other citizens in different parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- Throughout Australia private subdivisions are now constantly being made on the distinct understanding that roads and footpaths will be constructed by the vendors. The Commission does not deny that the auctioneer stated that purchasers would not have to meet the cost of making roads. Technically, roads do not include footpaths; but to an ordinary layman a statement that the vendor will construct roads is taken to mean that he will also provide footpaths. I had an instance &#171; few months ago at St. Kilda, of an owner, on whose behalf the auctioneer had stated that roads would be made by the vendor, refusing to take advantage of the technicality and insisting that he was in honour bound by the promise to make the footpaths as well. </para>

              <para>- I said nothing of the kind. I mentioned a case in which the owner of freehold land which was being subdivided insisted on providing footpaths, because he knew that the purchasers understood the auctioneer to include footpaths when he stated that the vendor would construct the roads. The land at. St. Kilda referred to did not bring anything like the price extorted from purchasers of land at Canberra. </para>

              <para>- That is not so. With only twenty blocks available, and 60 or 70 people requiring laud, the price realized is not a true indication of the value of the land. That is shown by the action of many lessees in forfeiting their leases. The Minister said that he hoped the lessees would take the case to the High Court. Apparently the Federal Capital Commission is not so confident. Some time ago the Commission was asked if it would state a case for the opinion of the High Court in order to avoid the delay and expense which otherwise would be incurred by having the case dealt with in the lower courts.

          <para>Undoubtedly if the Crown or any statutory body such as the Federal Capital Commission operated in New South Wales and offered land for auction under the conditions that prevailed at the original sale in Canberra, the owner of a freehold but not of a leasehold would- have to pay kerbing and guttering charges. Presumably it was the intention of the Government at the time to pass a Local Government Act, but no definite provision then existed, and purchasers naturally concluded that the provisions of the New South Wales Act would apply. That act makes it perfectly clear that if a man buys a leasehold from the Crown, the Crown has to pay kerbing and guttering expenses. That contention is borne out by the opinion which has been received from one of the commissioners of the city of Sydney, who stated that in circumstances such as prevailed in Canberra at the date of the original sale, purchasers in New South Wales would not be called upon to meet these charges. </para>

              <para>- I fail to appreciate the difference. I do . not know whether the Minister is familiar with the terms of Canberra leases, but I find that these charges are not to be limited to those holding 99 year leases. There is now an endeavour to make lessees with shorter terms pay, so that the simile drawn by the right honorable gentleman between freehold and leasehold fails. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Here is another serious aspect. The Minister has talked about footpaths, but I am afraid that he does not understand the position. Those familiar with the Civic Centre know that it embraces a very extensive and elaborate arcade which has a footpath running under it. That footpath has been constructed and paid for by the tenants, and under the terms of their lease they must maintain it in perpetuity. Now, they are asked to bear the cost of additional footpaths which run at right angles to the shops, and naturally they have rebelled. These are really ornamental&#39; paths and clearly should be a charge only upon the Commission. It was certainly not the fault of the tenants that elaborate geometrical paths were put down. There again the parallel attempted to be made by the Minister fails. Again, under this ordinance the Commission may charge for kerb crossings. In the case of a lease with which I am familiar, which originally consisted of four blocks, but is now consolidated into one, and has only one entrance, the lessees have been charged &#163;20 for four kerb crossings. Yet an inspection discloses that not even one crossing is provided. After making a number of threats about prosecution the Commission, at the last moment, experienced a spasm of pity and wrote the following letter on the 1st August :  - </para>

      <para>Kerbing, guttering, and footpaths adjoining shopping blocks - contribution by lessees. </para>
      <para>A lessee has advised the Commission that he considers it unfair that, in addition to bearing the whole cost of the footpath within the arcade surrounding the shopping blocks at Sydney and Melbourne Buildings, City, holders of leases of shopping blocks should also be charged half the cost of the alighting footpath adjoining the kerb and of the concrete footpaths leading from it to the main footpath. </para>
      <para>This matter has been reviewed by the Commission, which has now directed that no charge shall be made to lessees for these auxiliary footpaths, and for the concrete edging to the plantations. </para>
      <para>In view of this decision the Commission is issuing notices to lessees of shopping blocks indicating the amounts- now payable in respect of half -cost of kerbing, guttering, and footpaths in front of shopping blocks, and you might therefore take no action with respect to any notice received prior to this date, but make payment in accordance with the notice now being sent to you., </para>
      <para>If you have already made payment as a result of the first notice of demand the Commission will make an adjustment and refund the amount equivalent to half-cost of the alighting and leading up footpaths. </para>

        <para class="block">But the Commission absolutely refuses to give an assurance that lessees will not be subjected to further imposts, which neutralizes the Minister&#39;s assurance that they will not be charged additional maintenance costs. </para>
        <para>I appeal to honorable senators to look at the facts squarely. I ask them to realize that lessees have paid as much as &#163;135 a foot, and that they have already  met the cost of expensive concrete footpaths. It is held in Victoria that if the holder of a lease constructs a gravel footpath, he cannot be called upon to bear any additional cost for that item should the local authorities decide that a more expensive footpath is desirable. Here tenants are compelled to maintain as well as to build footpaths, and in addition are called upon to bear the cost of ornamental paths. Can it be wondered that the worm turns? </para>

            <para>. -  I certainly have an open mind on this subject, upon which I have not arrived at a considered opinion inasmuch as I have not had an opportunity to give it lengthy consideration. There appears to be a difference of opinion as to what Colonel Goodwin said, but that does not seem to me to come up for consideration, because if he declared that tenants would not have to meet kerbing and guttering charges, he apparently did so without the authority of his Minister. I am concerned about the power conferred by the Seat of Government Act to make ordinances; whether the ordinance should be allowed or disallowed on account of its retrospective character. The Seat of Government Act says distinctly that ordinances made under it shall take effect from the date of notification or at a later date.  1928  is admittedly a later date than  1925. </para>

              <para>-  Since I resumed my seat I have obtained the opinion of the Attorney-General on this matter. It is that section  12  does not prevent the making of an ordinance having retrospective operation. It merely provides that such an ordinance shall not take effect until notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> After it has been so notified, it may apply retrospectively if it contains an express provision to that effect. </para>

That is a matter to be fought out between the parties themselves. I am concerned, however, about the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes - the wisdom of passing a retrospective ordinance, and whether the ordinance itself is constitutional. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is correct in saying that the Commission had power under an ordinance of  1925  to impose the kerbing and guttering charges, to my mind it would be much better for the Government to withdraw its later ordinance and&#39; rely entirely on the original one. </para>

              <para>- I am inclined to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan&#39;s</inline> contention is unanswerable and that the Government is trying to do by ordinance what the statute prevents it from doing. I am not at all anxious to embarrass the Government although I suppose I am on safe ground when I see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> rising and speaking in opposition to something the Government has done; but I am on safer ground when I am in opposition to a body that is not responsible to the people. I refer to the Federal Capital Commision which is not responsible to the residents of the Territory. On this, the first occasion that the Senate has been asked to defend the interests of the community of Canberra from some action taken by the Commission, I think it would be well advised to take steps to prevent the Commission from seeking legal authority to make charges retrospective as far back as 1925, possibly on the ground that it has found that those charges cannot legally be imposed under the old ordinance. I realize the responsibilities of the Commission, but I have my own responsibilities and one of those is to defend a body of people who are not represented on the body that governs them. The people of Canberra having no representation on their governing body must look to this Parliament for protection from possible danger, and one danger that threatens them is that the Commission is desirous of charging lessees for the construction of kerbing and guttering. I know the practice of municipalities in New South Wales. If a municipality provides the kerbing and guttering in front of my property it promptly bills me with half the cost, but I am in the happy position that the kerbing and guttering adds to the value of my property and I reap the benefit of that increased value. The value that the Federal Capital Commission adds to the land by the provision of kerbing and guttering does not go to the occupier or lessee, because as soon as a new valuation is made the occupier, who has borne the cost of the work is compelled to pay an increased rental. By this ordinance the Commission is thus seeking to compel the residents of Canberra to expend money that will ultimately compel them to pay more rent. To my mind tha.t is not fair, and in the interests of the residents of Canberra I think the Senate could well force the Government to hold this ordinance in abeyance until the legal points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> have been cleared up. Otherwise the courts may declare that what we have done is illegal and the whole of the cost of any law proceedings that are taken may fall on the Government. We should give the matter serious consideration before we permit a doubtful ordinance like this to be gazetted and become law. I candidly confess that I have not given the subject the time or attention I should have given to it. Had I paid more attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan&#39;s</inline> remarks I possibly could have spoken more clearly on the subject. But I ask honorable senators either to hold their hand and allow the matter to be adjourned until the opinion of the Crown Law Office is obtained or to order the ordinance to be withdrawn with a view to its re-gazettal in an amended form. </para>

            <para>. - Speaking to this motion it is my intention not only to criticize the budget, but also to review the work of the Government during the last three years. In doing so it is possible that I may be going over some ground that has already been traversed; but the record of the Government is so bad that many of its defalcations cannot be over-stressed. Many of its acts of mal-administration, and much of it extravagance, ought to be brought once more to the attention of the people. When the Treasurer was introducing the budget in another place he did not give any evidence of modesty. He applied the brush of self -flattery very thickly. He praised himself for many things he had done. I gather from a perusal of his speech that he does not place much reliance on the old saying that &#34; self-praise is no recommendation.&#34; He spoke about the excellent record of the Government, and about &#34; his statesmanlike financial schemes.&#34; If the financial administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page is statesmanlike, I have yet to learn what the administration of a statesman would be. The only chance of learning what statesmanship would be like is to relieve <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page of his present position. The Commonwealth might then secure a Treasurer who would act in a statesmanlike way. The right honorable the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> is also not averse to self-flattery. A little while ago he and his lieutenant, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, issued a statement, in which they laid the flattering unction to their souls that they had done a lot of good to Australia during the time they had been the responsible heads of the Bruce-Page Ministry. Referring to that statement, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said - </para>

          <para class="block">As the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth has stated that the method of presenting the accounts is such as to obscure the true position, it is necessary for honorable senators to analyse very carefully the Treasurer&#39;s financial statement. The financial year which closed on the 30th June last shows a deficit of &#163;2,628,743, so that during a period of twelve months we have drifted to the extent of &#163;5,263,743. At the end of the financial year of 1927 we had a surplus of &#163;2,635,000, but at the end of the last financial year we were faced with a deficit of &#163;2,628,743. Although confronted with this large deficit, with the prospect of an early general election the Government is endeavouring to find a way out of the difficulty without offending any section of the community. It is afraid to increase taxation, and it declines to reduce expenditure. </para>

              <para>- When I occupy the position of Treasurer I will tell the honorable senator which course I shall pursue. What does the Treasurer suggest? He intends to suspend the deficit and to mortgage future surpluses. If that is the kind of business acumen that the Treasurer would display in a private concern he would soon find himself in financial difficulties. I repeat that neither the Treasurer nor the Government has the courage on the eve of a general election to attempt to balance the ledger by increasing taxation or by reducing expenditure. Ever since the inception of federation no Treasurer has handled such substantial amounts of revenue as has the present occupant of that office. In a school-boy fashion he is running away from the financial problem he is supposed to overcome. Since the war Australia has, with two or three exceptions, enjoyed prosperous seasons, and our revenue has been buoyant, as the following figures show - </para>

          <para>No Government, Federal or State, has been guilty of shirking its responsibilities as this Government has. It has appointed commissions, boards, and committees galore. The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> a staunch supporter of the Government, has already condemned the Federal Treasurer for his extravagance, but notwithstanding his condemnation, he still continues to support the Administration of which the Treasurer is a member. A study of the expenditure since 1923, when the Treasurer first took office, will give honorable senators an idea of how the money has been squandered. The figures are - </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">From these figures it will be seen that during the period the present Government has been in office expenditure has increased to the extent of approximately &#163;16,500,000. As our expenditure has increased so has our debt per head of population. The figures are: - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="119332192809056_19_3.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">We have thus had an increase of &#163;78,000,000 in our public debt since the Bruce-Page Government took office, and an increase of &#163;4 10s. 7d. a head. </para>
          <para>Let us now deal with the net debt which shows our financial position more accurately than does the public debt. Our net debt in 1921-22 was &#163;339,002,000. In 1927-28 it had grown to &#163;347,168,000, an increase of nearly &#163;8,166,000. The Treasurer stated that the increase in the net debt since 1926-1927 was &#163;6,189,025. He pointed out that, of that amount, &#163;3,477,176 represented the difference between the amount of purchase money outstanding in connexion with the sale of the  Comomnwealth  ships, and the face value of the debentures of the Commonwealth Shipping Board held by the Treasury. Let us examine that statement in its relation to our present financial position. Allowing for this adjustment it will be seen that our national debt has increased by &#163;4,688,000 since 1921- 22, despite the fact that the Treasurer has received &#163;33,000,000 more revenue than he would have received had the revenue remained on the 1922-23 level. In addition he utilized the &#163;7,428,574 surplus that existed in 1922-23. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline>Page has again emphasized the reduction in our war debt which, on the 30th June, 1922, amounted to &#163;333,093,834. On the 30th June last it was &#163;293,420,106, a decrease of &#163;39,673,728. It is true that the war debt has been decreased to the extent mentioned, but in emphasizing that decrease, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Page</inline> conveniently omitted to mention &#34; other debts &#34; which, excluding debts incurred by the States, amounted to &#163;31,745,756 on the 30th June, 1922. Up to the 30th June last &#34; other debts &#34; amounted to &#163;79,363,982, an increase since 1921-1922 of &#163;47,618,226. Thus, it will be seen that &#34;other debts&#34; exceed by approximately &#163;8,000,000 the reduction in the war debt during the same period. </para>
          <para>During his term of office, the Treasurer has enjoyed a total revenue of about &#163;33,000,000 more than he would have received had the revenue remained on the 1922-23 basis. In addition, he has dissipated an accumulated surplus of &#163;7,428,574, which existed when he assumed office as Treasurer. That is the record of this high priest of economy - this man who, as a private member, was a thorn in the side of governments. Since he became Treasurer and assumed control of the public purse, he appears to have run wild. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer continually boasts of the reduction in taxation brought about by the Bruce-Page Government. Let us examine the figures to see whether that boast has any substantial foundation. It is true that taxation on personal incomes has been reduced, but it is equally true that during his term of office as Treasurer taxation as a whole has increased. </para>

          <para class="block">In 1921-22 the amount received from income tax amounted to &#163;16,790,000, while last year the Treasurer collected &#163;10,165,000 from the same source, a reduction of over &#163;6,000,000. Again, I contend that the people in receipt of smaller incomes received no advantage from that reduction ; it benefited the wealthy classes exclusively. It would have been far better to continue the taxes and apply the amount collected to a reduction of the war debt. </para>

          <para class="block">Those figures disclose that we have experienced an adverse trade balance aggregating &#163;32,500,000 since the present Treasurer has been in office. </para>
          <para>Another feature of the budget that is worthy of attention is our loan expenditure. One of the complaints of financial critics is that the Commonwealth Government is spending too much loan money on unreproductive works. That state of affairs should not be allowed to continue. The Treasurer himself, as a private member, condemned the idea of spending loan money on unreproductive work, yet I find that in 1921-22 our expenditure from loan money on works, &#38;c, was &#163;5,246,000, whereas last year it was &#163;6,888,000, an increase of &#163;1,642,000. Each year the expenditure from loan funds on works has increased while expenditure out of revenue on works has decreased, as the following figures will show :  - </para>

          <para>Of course it is obvious that the less the Government spends out of revenue on new works the more money it will have to spend on other things and the better surplus it will show. While this Government has been in office, nearly every year it has spent approximately &#163;2,000,000 less out of revenue than was spent in 1921-22. Reduced to simple language it means that the Government has borrowed to show its surplus. </para>

          <para>I have completed my review of the budget, but there are one or two other matters I wish to mention. The Government has definitely decided to go to the country, and on the 17th November next will appeal to the people for a renewal of power. There is every indication that it will resort to somewhat similar tactics to those it employed three years ago, when by false pretences and misleading statements it secured the suffrages of the people. On that occasion the Prime Minister, assisted by his lieutenant, the right honorable the Leader of the Senate, put forward the red bogey. He saw red, talked red and dreamt red. So to speak he played a game of political billiards and &#34;got in off the red.&#34; He is now starting another game of political billiards, and will again endeavour to &#34;get in off the red.&#34; At the last election he said that the paramount issue before the people was the maintenance of law and order and the supremacy of constitutional government. Having gained a majority in both Houses, having appealed successfully to the people for power to crush the extremists, the communists, the revolutionists, who he declared were a danger to the country, he passed a Crimes Bill, but that measure has not been of any avail. He said that the people stood on the edge of a volcano which at any &#39;moment might belch over them its lava of red revolution, that there were in our midst men who were a source of danger to Australia, and that these men would have to be deported and their illegal organizations dealt with. Yet not one man has been deported; not one illegal association has been dealt with. Unless the Government has been false to the pledges it made to the electors, it is clear that no one has been a danger to Australia and that there have been no illegal organizations in existence in Australia. Yet Ministers, I presume, will go to the country again on a similar election cry. When introducing the Crimes Bill in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce said - </para>

            <para>He would . be a bold man who would say that there is no necessity to take legislative action with regard to unlawful associations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>He went on to say that there were associations that declared themselves to be against law and order and against constituted society and proclaimed their intention to wreck and change existing society. In his concluding remarks the right honorable gentleman said that the Government did not intend to place the Crimes Bill on the statute-book, and allow it to remain there unused. The Ministry had told the electors that the communist party was one of the associations to which they referred, and that the methods of communism were revolutionary. Addressing a meeting at Loch in Victoria, the Prime Minister said - </para>

      <para>It is interesting to note how this Government has worked and how it has kept Parliament going since it has been in office. During the last three year3 it has been in office Parliament has sat for 190 days. If the Government could show that during that short period it had done something to assist the development the progress and the prosperity of Australia, and that it had made some legitimate attempt to carry out its promises to the electors something might be said in its favour; but to my mind it is a national disgrace for a government that has done so little not to ask this Parliament to sit more than on an average nine weeks a year. During the previous three years, from 1922 to 1925, this Parliament sat 171 days or an average of about eight weeks a year, and the whole of the six years this Government has been in power Parliament has sat 361 days, an average of about81/2 weeks a year.

Since the inception of federation no government has shirked its responsibilities and delegated its authority in the way this Government has done. Whenever it is confronted with a problem it appoints a board or commission to do the work that it should do. The function of government is to govern. The Government is an executive body consisting of persons chosen by the people to administer the affairs of State. This Government has failed in that respect. It has neglected its duty by delegating its authority to more or less irresponsible boards and commissions. Why does it not tackle the problems with which it is supposed to deal? The Leader of the Government in the Senate, in endeavouring to defend the Government&#39;s action, said some time ago that some of the problems facing the Government were so intricate that it had to obtain the services of men possessing expert knowledge on various subjects to advise it as to the best course to adopt. But when these experts have made reports their recommendations have been rejected. For instance, the Western Australian Disabilities Commission was appointed to inquire into the financial position of Western Australia, and after an investigation which lasted approximately twelve months, it recommended that &#163;450,000 should be paid by the Commonwealth to that State for a period of 25 years. The Government did not accept the commission&#39;s recommendations; but agreed  to  pay that amount for only one year. </para>
      <para>Wherein lies the intricacy associated with the subject of child endowment, or a system of national insurance against unemployment? There is ample evidence available in the parliamentary library to place the Government in possession of all the information it desires to enable it to formulate a policy to give effect to a system of child endowment and insurance against unemployment. Instead of using the information at its disposal, the Government appointed a royal commission to inquire into the matter of national insurance. The Leader of the Government in the Senate claims that the Government of which he is a member has fulfilled every promise made prior to the last general election. I submit that it has not. The electors were promised a system of national insurance against unemployment, and child endowment. </para>

The introduction of a measure to give effect to its promise in the dying hours of a parliament is not a fulfilment of its pledge.

            <para>- When appealing to the people in 1925 the Prime Minister emphasized the importance of a child endowment scheme, and stated that this question was one of vital importance. He said that a man with a family was the greatest asset to the community, and that it was essential and desirable that the greatest encouragement and assistance should be given to such men. With that statement we all agree. Our children should be so reared and trained as to be well fitted to carry on the burdens of life, and so be able to assume the responsibilities of citizenship. The Prime Minister, as I have said, stated in his policy speech that the question of child endowment was of vital importance. </para>

        <para>It is true that the subject was discussed at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, but at that gathering the Prime Minister said it was a matter for the States and not the Commonwealth.

        <para>In a full page advertisement in a Syd-new newspaper these words appeared: &#34; You and yours are safe under a National Government which &#39; provides for motherhood endowment.&#34; Was not that a definite promise?

        </quote>
        <para class="block">Notwithstanding that definite promise nothing has been done. In the opening remarks of his policy speech of 1925 the Prime Minister said that he would not make elaborate promises in order to get different sections of the community to support him. Indeed, he strongly deprecated the practice of political parties endeavouring to outbid each other for the people&#39;s favour, stating that such promises appealed to the cupidity and the lowest instincts of the community. Let me quote his exact words - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>That course I refuse to follow. The times are too critical. For any national leader to-day to deceive the people by promises which, either for financial or constitutional reasons, he could never redeem, would constitute a betrayal of the obligations and duties resting upon him which would never be forgiven. </para>

        <para class="block">I say definitely that the people of Australia were led by the Prime Minister&#39;s statement to believe that, if returned to power, he would introduce a scheme of child endowment. The Prime Minister has betrayed his trust as a national leader. When he made that statement no mention was made of constitutional or financial limitations. It was only when he met the State Premiers in conference that he turned a political somersault. After the election the Prime Minister stated that any scheme of child endowment would have to be introduced by the States, because the Commonwealth could not finance the scheme. If, with its annual surpluses, the Commonwealth could not finance such a scheme, how could the States be expected to do so when, even now, they are at their wits&#39; ends to balance their ledgers? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> also said that industry could not afford to pay for an endowment scheme, and suggested an adjustment of wages to provide the necessary funds.  His  proposal was that the men on the basic wage should bear the cost of the scheme. In this connexion I wish to emphasize that any system of child endowment must be kept entirely separate from the basic wage; there must be no confounding- of the two things. Industry must pay its proportion of the cost, and the general community the rest. More than rights and privileges, for the preservation of which it is said that the recent war was fought, are involved; there are also the maintenance of proper living conditions, and our duty to our children. All political parties in Australia agree that a scheme of child endowment is essential. Indeed, they all advocated it during the last election campaign. Had the Labour party been returned to power, a scheme of child endowment would now be in operation; but the present Government has made no genuine effort in that direction. </para>

I express the hope that what was accomplished recently in Paris is but the forerunner of greater achievements towards universal peace. Between the signing of the armistice in November, 1918, and June, 1919, Australia spent about &#163;3,000,000 on defence. Since June, 1919, a further sum of approximately &#163;55,000,000 has been expended for defence purposes, making a total of about &#163;58,000,000 since the cessation of hostilities. One might reasonably expect that Australia would have something to show for that huge expenditure, but that is not the case, for the defences of Australia to-day are in a worse condition than ever before.

            <para>- This Government stands condemned for its incapable handling of the finances of Australia, for its reckless borrowing and its extravagant spending policy. Last year it proposed to raise  &#163;62,725,000,  and this year it budgets to raise  &#163;63,310,000.  Actually it collected last year  &#163;1,441,000  more than was estimated. It was estimated that the Post Office would show a surplus, which hope has not been realized. It was also estimated that the Commonwealth railways would show a shortage of  &#163;227,000,  whereas the actual deficit was  &#163;438,000.  The sooner that the finances of Australia are stabilized the better. The sooner that we have as Treasurer a man with a better idea of controlling the public purse than the present occupant of the office, the sooner will Australia journey along the road of progress. The time is not far distant when the Government, its supporters, and those in opposition will have to render an account of their stewardship; and I am confident that the people will then decide in favour of a party that can establish more effective control over the finances and destiny of this country than is evidenced by the present Government. </para>

          <para>. -  I take it that although many of us hold certain differences of opinion we believe unanimously that a swift, accurate and cheap means of communication throughout the British Empire will tend to assist Empire trade and migration, and consolidate our great empire. Until quite recently the only way in which we could have swift and accurate communication between countries separated by oceans was by cable. For many years the cable systems of the world were in the hands of private companies which held an absolute monopoly, because in every case where these lines traversed the same route they entered into an agreement amongst themselves that they would not compete unnecessarily one with the other. They used that monopoly ruthlessly. They had but one object : to wring as much as possible out of their customers in order to make their dividends as large as possible. It is known to all of us that that monopoly was used so ruthlessly that at last the business people protested. Those who protested were not bolsheviks, or even associated with the Labour movement, but hard-hearted business men. They made repeated requests that the governments of their countries should break up the cable monopoly, but it was a long time before the British Government acquiesced in the proposal, apparently because it had more thought for the dividends of capitalism than for the welfare of the Empire. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, when a private member of the House of Representatives, said - </para>

          <para>I have repeatedly pointed out that we should never have had the Pacific Cable but for the way we were treated by the Eastern Extension Company. They would make no concessions to us, but the moment arrangements were completed for the construction of the Pacific Cable, the Eastern Cable Company rushed in, and by a bribe - for that is what it amounted to - in the shape nf reduced rates, they obtained concessions that have enabled them to relegate the Pacific cable to the background. It was no part of our duty to put this weapon into the hands of our opponents to enable them to flog us as they are now doing. I believe that all the great cables, such as the Pacific cable, should be owned by the governments interested. However patriotic and lenient a company may be, we should not allow it to hold us at its mercy. </para>

        <para class="block">As the outcome of a good deal of agitation, the Pacific Cable Board came into existence, and rates were slightly reduced. Owing to the fact that it was necessary for a message from Australia via the Pacific to travel over a privately-owned telegraph line in Canada, and a privately-owned Atlantic cable, the Pacific Cable Board was very seriously handicapped. Now these handicaps have been removed to some extent, and the Pacific Cable has been more able to stand - alongside the other cable companies. %&#62; </para>

        <para class="block">The cable companies, realizing the strength of the competition of the wireless companies, moved hell and earth in order to endeavour to come to an agreement with the wireless company. To be in a better position to do so the companies bought up a large number of shares in the Marconi and wireless companies in order to secure some say in their control. I do not wish this evening to object to the amalgamation of private companies in the ordinary way, as that is their own concern. But in this case a conference was held between the wireless and cable companies, at which the British and Australian Governments were represented, and the cable companies expressed a desire to lease from the British Government its rights in respect of beam, wireless in Great Britain. That completely altered the position. We in Australia are not justified in dictating a policy to Great Britain, and if that Government is prepared to hand over to the merger the beam service, we cannot question its action. But as a citizen of the British Empire, I should regret the action. It may lead to a proposal that Australia should hand over its control of the beam service to the merger. Due to the genius and foresight, of the Eight Honorable W. M. Hughes, the Australian Government has 501,000 shares in the beam service - a controlling interest - and Parliament should certainly have a voice if the handing over of that interest to the merger is contemplated. I shall read an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Sun</inline> which covers the ground far more ably than I can do. It says - </para>

          <para>When the public reads a cabled despatch to the effect that a conference&#39; has been arranged between the Eastern Cable Company and Marconi for the purpose of making a report for submission to the two boards &#39; regarding a possible arrangement for the protection of their mutual interests,&#34; the full significance of the proposal may not at first strike home. Even when it is observed that Marconi shares have risen on the Stock Exchange, the public may be but mildly interested. Yet these things affect the Australian people directly and adversely in a substantial measure. Even&#39; the Postmaster-General, &#34;although impressed by the rise in Marconi shares,&#34; is inclined to scepticism regarding the rumoured merger between the two companies, which practically control communication with the world from and to Australia. He has not been advised. Beyond a passing suggestion that in a matter of such immense importance, affecting so closely his department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gibson</inline> should become advised as soon as possible, it is not necessary to dwell on that part of it. Millions of pounds have been spent by the Eastern Telegraph Company and allied corporations in laying cables, and upon that capital excellent dividends have been made. When the possibility of world-wireless was considered only a few years ago, the company was not perturbed. Wireless, with its lack of secrecy, and its uncertainty, would not interfere with the cable traffic - that was the comfortable opinion. Now that wireless has arrived, and it is possible to build a transmitting and receiving station which will cover much of the globe for as many hundreds of thousands of pounds as it takes millions to lay a cable across one ocean, the danger to the company which has sunk so much capital, literally in the sea, is that a cheaper means of communication may render that capital in part useless. While it is possible to sympathize with the point of view of the shareholders and directors of the cable company, there is another and larger point pf view - that of the people of Australia. It may be to their misfortune that, a number of investors shall lose part or all of their capital because science has moved on, but such accidents happen every day. The cable company seeks, therefore, to do what many  other companies have done, to buy in its competitor and acquire a monopoly which enables it, in the gentle language of commerce, to arrange &#34; for the protection of mutual interests.&#34; It is an old trade device for keeping up prices. It will be astounding if the British and Australian Governments, both interested as they are in wireless communication, stand quietly by while an amalgamation so adverse to their interests is proposed and completed. A scientific discovery instead of being used for the benefit of mankind, may be used to bolster up old interests and capital. If the history of the mismanagement of wireless by the &#39;Marconi Company be now completed by a characteristic action, which will hamper communication all over the world - and particularly in Australia - the people will call governments to account. It is certainly time that the governments of the dominions and of Britain took steps to decide whether the people&#39;s interests or the interests of a few shareholders in two companies, shall be the determining factor in the future of wireless. </para>

        <para class="block">I think that article puts the case very clearly. The question is whether we ought to consider chiefly the interests of the cable companies or those of the community in general. If we brought the price of wireless messages down to one penny a word, as no. doubt we could do, and thus place this means of communication within the reach of the ordinary householder we are told that it would mean the scrapping of the cables. I believe that I am correct in saying that the cable companies have threatened to go out of business - I do not think they would do so - if wireless competes with them, as they describe it, unfairly, by &#34;accepting messages at Id. a word, a rato which would pay. </para>
        <para>During the recess I read a very interesting article by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Godfrey</inline> Clark who was for many years in charge of Posts and Telegraphs in India. The article was reprinted in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> from the <inline font-style="italic">London Times.</inline> It must have been written twelve months before the Beam service was able to do what it is doing at the present moment. The writer pointed out that there were, people who argued that if wireless were to be allowed to have full fling the cables would have to go, but he said that in certain circumstances the cables could still compete with wireless in some parts of the world. The writer of the article contended that both cables and wireless should work side by side, but that the cables must not be allowed to prevent wireless from doing its full work, because if wireless were allowed to do its best it could send 100 words for 10s. or about 11/4d. a word. He claimed that if the cost of messages could be reduced to a price approximating11/4d. a word there would be such a tremendous traffic throughout the Empire that there would not be enough cables and wireless services to carry it. Thus it does not necessarily follow that cables will have to go even if wireless is allowed to do its very best. </para>
        <para>The cable companies tell us that they will have to go and that if the cables are scrapped it will be a very serious thing for the Empire in time of war. I think the real fear is that the dividends of the shareholders in cable companies will have to go. Obviously it would not be a good election cry for a conservative government in Great Britain or a Nationalist Government in Australia to raise, that the cables must be kept going because of the dividends of the share-holders of the cable companies. It is, therefore, necessary to get another cry, and that cry is that the Empire will be in danger in time of war if the cables are scrapped because wireless is not secret. Marconi says that wireless is secret but the cable companies say that it is not. In order, therefore, that secrecy may be observed in time of war we are told that the cables must be retained ! It is amusing to read the objections that are always raised when a reform is advocated. For a number of years it was thought necessary that commissions in the British army must be obtained by purchase, and when some people advocated that it would be better to allow people to earn their commissions by their merits so much opposition was raised that even the House of Lords threw out <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone&#39;s</inline> bill to abolish the practice of buying commissions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> had subsequently to bring about the reform on the warrant of Queen Victoria. On that occasion so eminent a man as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Scott asserted that it would be a terrible tiling to do away with the buying of commissions; that the British constitution would not stand the strain and that the very safety of the Empire depended on the purchase of commissions. When opals began to compete with diamonds the people interested in the latter started the cry that it was unlucky to wear opals. There are people to-day who still think that it is unlucky to wear opals. I suppose that there are quite a number of people who&#39; on being asked who introduced penny postage into England would reply : &#34; Rowland Hill.&#34; As a matter of fact in the reign . of Charles II., practically 200 years before the time of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rowland</inline> Hill, private enterprise was carrying letters in London at1d. each. It was a successful venture but vested interests was up in arms against it and one of the arguments used in opposition to it was that if letters could be carried at1d. each the Jesuits would more easily be able to issue propaganda for their religion. </para>
        <para class="block">The business men of London disregarded that cry, and had the advantage of penny postage until vested interests successfully interfered. The Duke of York, who was a brother of - Charles II., received a pension from the Postal Department, and as the reduced rate affected his pension, it was discontinued, and the British people had to wait 200 years before they were again able to derive the benefit of penny postage. I am always sceptical when I hear cries of the Empire being at stake owing to any interference with the cable or any other system of communication. </para>

            <para>- It all depends upon the aspect from which it is viewed. E am of course strongly in favour of the interests of the Empire being safeguarded in every way; but I object to the statements that have been made that the retention of the cable system is essential in the Empire&#39;s interests when those who make such statements are more concerned with the dividends of the cable companies. I agree with the utterances of a great ambassador who once said that if rapid and cheap communication is provided we shall have greater cordiality between nations. If there is every facility for cheap communication, it will naturally lead to more cordial relations, which must, of course, reduce to a minimum the possibility of international disputes. The inference to be drawn from the utterances of some interested persons is that while high cable rates are maintained, the security of the Empire is assured; but that with their disappearance the British Empire, like many great empires of the past, will totter and fall, and be but as the memory of a mighty pageant. When reading the other day of the death at Dubbo of a young immigrant, who had no relations in Australia, but a widowed mother and sister in England, I could not help feeling what a blessing it would have been if that mother had been able to communicate by wireless with those who had been in close touch with her deceased son, at the low rate I have suggested. But the introduction of Id. a word messages would endanger the Empire, whereas a charge of ls. lOd. a word&#39; ensures its safety! </para>

            <para>- And they won. Have honorable senators considered the arguments used by those who were on the winning side? One of their slogans was &#34; Liberty is at stake &#34;. Over twenty years ago the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henniker</inline> Heaton advocated cheap communication throughout the Empire, and when being banquetted  prior to leaving for a visit to South America, suggested in the course of a speech, a rate of Id. a word for cable and telegraphic messages. A very distinguished person who was present at that gathering said to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henniker</inline> Heaton &#34;Your case is unanswerable; but there is one difficulty which is insurmountable and that is vested interests.&#34; I sometimes wonder whether that was the reason why the Postmaster-General of Australia, when asked to institute Id. a word wireless system, said that&#39; it was impracticable. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>As I have said, the introduction of cheap wireless communication would tend to consolidate the Empire, and be largely instrumental in the prevention of war. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline> Samuel, a very distinguished and able Postmaster-General in Great Britain, when speaking at a dinner of the Pilgrims&#39; Society - a society consisting of </para>
        <para class="block">Americans and Englishmen who hold an annual dinner alternately in London and New York - said that his idea was to bring the nations closer together. He stated that the American people and the British people were united by a common language, common laws and by religion. He also said that the postal service was a means of bringing the two nations closer together. This remark caused some laughter; but he supported it by saying that if there was an absence of cable communication and of interchange . of letters, lettercards, postcards and magazines, cordial relations would not last very long between the nations. With that I agree. A deputation comprising a number of Great Britain&#39;s leading journalists waited upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> when he was Prime Minister of Great Britain after the Boer War and before the Great War, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Moberley  Bell, the manager of the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> speaking on behalf of that journal, said, in pleading for cheaper communication, that before the Boer War he sent a cable in code to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cecil</inline> Rhodes, but unfortunately it was not decoded satisfactorily. Later he sent a letter confirming the cable. Some time after the Boer War he met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cecil</inline> Rhodes, who told him that if the cable could have been properly decoded, in all probability the position in regard to the Boer War, which cost Great Britain many millions of pounds, as well as a large number of valuable lives, might have been different. He did not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cecil</inline> Rhodes told him that the war would actually have been avoided; but that the position would have been very different. He would have sent the cable in plain language if the rate of Id. a word had been in operation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henniker</inline> Heaton on one occasion said that be wished the telegraph system to be used a great deal more than it was, and that he had been told that in time of war the telegraph lines might be cut. There are, of course, he said, long periods in which such a service could be effectively utilized. He also said &#34; Wireless is coming, and will be able to do the work.&#34; </para>
        <para>Whenever we speak of the cable companies being concerned in the interests of the Empire, we naturally wish to consider the patriotism which they have displayed in times of peace. Prior to the Great War - I do not know what the conditions are now- if one wanted to send a message from London to India, it cost 2s. a word for traversing a distance of 6,000 miles .by cable. Cable messages could, however, be . sent to the Continent and then, by using a land line of 3,700 miles, to India. The cost in Australia to-day of constructing a land line is about &#163;70 a mile, but in those days I suppose a similar line could be erected on the Continent for from &#163;20 to &#163;30 a mile. The cost of sending .a message from London to India over this line of only 3,700 miles was, however, 2s. a word, the same as the charge for sending a message over 6,000 miles of cable costing &#163;200 a mile, the reason being that the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company also had a controlling interest in the land line. They maintained a charge of 2s. a word in order that there should be no competition with the cables. A Britisher in London wishing to do business with a fellow Britisher in India had to pay 2s. a word whereas he could send a message from London to Vladivostock, in Siberia, a distance of 7,000 miles, for 6&#163;d. a word. That is an example of the patriotism of the cable companies. Were it not so tragic, the Government&#39;s treatment of the wireless and cable companies would be amusing. </para>
        <para>So far I have been unable to get the information I desire regarding the profits made by the wireless company. The Minister said that, having handed over the control of wireless communication to a private company, the Government would not interfere with the directors, and that we shall have to look to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to safeguard our interests. I should like to know whether the Government interfered in connexion with the charge for messages to Canada. It was consulted, we are told, and it would be interesting to know whether there was . any stipulation that the rate should not be brought below a certain amount per word or whether it should be raised. </para>
        <para>If the policy of the Government is to retain both the wireless and the cable, it seems foolish, from that  point of view, to allow the wireless company to charge even. 10 per cent, less than the cable companies, because the lower rate will attract the business. Even now the Beam wireless is competing more than satisfactorily with the cables. The Beam system has not yet been in operation eighteen months, yet of 14,000,000 words sent between England and Australia it has transmitted 8,000,000 words. By permitting the wireless company to charge 10 per cent, less than the cable rates, the Government is condemning the cable companies to a lingering death. So long as the charges remain what they are now, neither the wireless nor the cable will attract business from ordinary citizens, but if the price per word of wireless messages is reduced there will be a greater volume of business, of which the Government will reap&#39; the advantage. We should know whether the wireless company has a free hand in the matter of price. If the position were reversed, the Eastern Extension Cable Company would not consider the interests of its competitor. </para>
        <para>I enter my emphatic protest against any attempt to hand over the Beam system to the merger. In a long discussion in the House of Commons in relation to this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker,</inline> the member for East Bristol, in an impassioned speech, objected to handing over our means of communication to a private company. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hamar</inline> Greenwood, who in the Coalition Government was Secretary for Ireland, said during the debate - </para>

What an idea! <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> the great object of companies is to earn large profits, and to pay their shareholders huge dividends; but the policy of maintaining a profitable monopoly is not always compatible with great public needs. In the present case, the progress of the Empire and the requirements of the British people have far outstripped the narrow policy which best suits private companies. </para>

He has given us some food for thought. That wireless messages should be sent for a Id. a word may at this stage of wireless development appear rather fantastic, but in the years that have gone other proposals, no less idealistic, have been realized in time.

The speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> was characteristic of the honorable senator. He condemned the budget, the Treasurer, as well as the Government, its friends and supporters. He could see nothing but ruin before this country unless there was a change of government, and he and his associates were placed in control of the destiny of this fair land. The consideration of the nation&#39;s balance-sheet should be above party considerations. </para>

        <para>When considering this budget we should bear in mind the extraordinary circumstances in which the Treasurer finds himself. The honorable gentleman, before he can give his attention to finding money for the pressing problems of our national life, such as defence and development, must first make provision for certain statutory and other obligations. These  absorb such, a considerable portion of our total revenues that the Treasurer has left at his disposal but a comparatively insignificant amount. It is&#39; easy to criticize and attack a Treasurer. Apparently every honorable senator imagines that he is a potential Treasurer, equipped with the necessary wisdom to control the financial destinies of the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has intimated that he could do the job better than the present Treasurer, but he did not explain how he would do . it. I thought that, speaking as he did on behalf of the Labour party of Australia, the honorable senator would indicate how Labour would initiate reforms in the existing system. </para>

            <para>- That is so. The Treasurer is not to blame for that, as it is the result of the considered judgment of this party. Evidently it also has the approval of the Labour party, because that party does not favour the collection of heavy revenue through the customs. Honorable senators opposite even consider that too much revenue is now being collected through the customs. Apparently it is impossible to please the party opposite. Had there been a big increase in customs revenue we should have been told that the duties were too low, and that it was most improper to allow overseas goods to come in so freely. They cannot have it both ways. Either our policy of protection, with its consequent falling off of customs revenue, is a good thing or it is not. If it is a bad thing, as one is led to believe by the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> why does not the honorable senator&#39;s party pluck up sufficient courage to declare that they do not favour it, and fight the forthcoming elections on that issue. </para>

            <para>- A great deal, in-, deed. Had the party that the honorable senator represents had its way we should not be so nearly advanced as we are today. We certainly have the nucleus of an effective fleet, which would not have been the case had our ships been built at Cockatoo Island. We know that the Labour party has discarded its old defence plank, but it is not prepared to tell the people of Australia exactly where it stands in that regard. Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> reduce the amount expended to assist industry generally? Does the honorable senator contend that that money has not been wisely spent? Would he reduce the amount that the Commonwealth is finding to assist the States? I do not believe that he would. The honorable senator claimed that Western Australia is not receiving enough assistance. No doubt if he had his way - that is before the elections take place - he would not limit the amount given to the States, but that would be only a temporary expedient. Would the honorable senator reduce expenditure on the constructional work that this Government is undertaking throughout Australia? Would he dare to tell the trade unions that, if his party came into office, he would reduce the vote for postal and other construction works, and throw hundreds, and, perhaps, thousands of men out of employment? He would not have the courage to do so. Therefore, it is idle for him to attack the Treasurer and the Government, and say that they are doing wrong in spending far greater sums of money than the condition of affairs in Australia warrants. For the purpo.se of saving money would the honorable senator advocate reductions in the Civil Service, reductions in pensions, or reduced assistance to the primary producers? 1 do not believe that he would be in favour of a reduction in any of these directions. But, when we consider these matters in relation to the speech which has just been  delivered by the honorable gentleman, we see just how little there is behind the high-sounding words he uttered, and how empty were the criticisms he directed at the Treasurer and the party behind the Government. </para>

        <para>I have referred to the headings under which the Commonwealth Government has been committed to expenditure in the budget now before us. There is very little room for the suggestion that expenditures have been too heavy under those headings. A great expenditure is involved in paying interest on borrowed money and in other directions that could be mentioned; but the fact remains that, despite all he said, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> made not one suggestion as to where he or his party would be able to reduce expenditure. In spite of his very violent criticism of the Treasurer as to the amount of money spent last year, the honorable senator said that he was opposed to the reductions that had been made in the income tax. He said that we lost revenue by those reductions, and that the financial position of the Commonwealth would have been different if these reductions had not been made. Will the honorable senator be honest enough to tell us that, during the coming campaign, his party will advocate an increased income tax for the Commonwealth, and that, if his party is returned to power, there will be an immediate heavy increase in the rate of the tax? Such honesty would be magnificent, hut the honorable senator is not foolish enough to tell us that he would advocate an increase in the income tax. While telling us that the income tax should not have been reduced, he would rather go before the electors and say, &#34;Look what this wretched Government is doing. It is imposing all this taxation.&#34; While complaining that the present Government is getting in taxation more than any other government, he says that taxation should not have been reduced to the extent to which it has been reduced. Let me remind the honorable senator that the income tax has been reduced, not by the Government on its own authority, but by the authority of both Houses of Parliament. A great majority in both chambers agreed that the time had come when not merely because the revenue was not required - we can always find something to do with the revenue we receive - but for other reasons of policy, it was well that the income tax should be reduced. It was felt that the imposition of a heavy income tax meant that we were taking out of industry money that should remain in it, and that it was far. better to leave in the pockets of the men who were engaged in industry as much money as possible, so that they &#39; might extend their enterprises and thus enhance the wealth of the community and make Australia a better place to live in. That course, which was followed by -Parliament as a matter of definite policy, was endorsed by a great majority of the people of Australia, and certainly by almost the whole of the press of Australia. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> tells us that we should not have reduced the income tax. I do not remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> making any particularly strong protest against the action of the Government when the bill to reduce the tax was before this chamber. I cannot remember any herculean fight put up by him. At any rate, the fight, if any, he did put up was not worth remembering. I believe that I should have remembered it if he had fought against the proposal with half the zeal and earnestness that he has shown in opposing other proposals. </para>
        <para>The honorable senator ought to answer the question - Will Labour, if it comes into office increase again the income tax which this Government has decreased ? But before he answers that question I want him to ask himself who pays taxation. The man who pays income tax is not the man who runs a big business. The capitalist, as the honorable senator&#39;s friends describe him, is merely an agent for the collection and payment of the tax. The man who pays is the consumer, and as the workers of any country constitute the great majority of the consumers, it is the workers who pay practically the greater part of the taxation levied by the Government of any country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> thus claims that the burden upon the shoulders of the workers should be increased, and that the Government was wrong when it decreased the income tax. </para>

            <para>- Even to take the honorable senator&#39;s amended statement that the major portion of our borrowing from overseas comes into Australia in the shape of manufactured goods from other countries, how does the honorable senator account for the recent decrease in the customs revenue? The one thing kills the other. This fact should convince the honorable senator that he is wrong in his contention. Actually our borrowings do not come here in the shape of pounds, shillings and pence, but represent a credit created for us in Great Britain or America, or wherever the money may be borrowed, which may be operated on by bills of exchange and so forth. We may receive a portion of the money in the shape of manufactured and other goods, but, as I have already pointed out, a considerable portion of it is required to pay  interest in London and to provide for renewals, redemptions and other obligations. </para>

        <para>The honorable senator has already attacked the Government . for referring to what he has called the red issue at the elections. He has accused the Government - I think he used the words - of telling untruths to the electors and of deliberately misleading them. He urged that what we said about the red issue was entirely unjustified, and that there was no reason for it - in fact that there was no such thing as a red menace in Australia to- day. It is strange, but nevertheless true, t hat in this connexion the honorable senator finds himself out of step with a very considerable section of his own party.  There is to-day from one end of this country to the other a growing realization on the part of all men who really understand the position that this menace is a thing which does exist and must be met. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> tell his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> general  president  of the Australian Workers Union, that there is no red menace in Australia to-day? Will he say that the Australian Workers Union is not fighting for its continued existence against that very menace ? When the executive of the Australian Workers Union - the greatest labour organization in the Commonwealth - is compelled to take the drastic steps it has to effectively fight this insidious influence which is working into their organization and tending to destroy it, the Leader of the Opposition should realize the seriousness of the situation. Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> say to the Premier of Queensland, another Labour colleague of his, that there is no red menace in that State? Would he deny that there is in South Australia and in other States certain individuals who hold such extreme views that they are a danger not only to Labour organizations, but also to Australia? Does he say that there is nothing in this menace? Of course there is. The statements made by the members of this party during the last election campaign and which are being made to-day are fully borne out by facts. There are good Labour men, it is true, who see the position just as clearly as we do, and, to their credit, have pointed out to the people the danger confronting them. </para>
        <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition made a similar statement a few months ago when I submitted a motion to the Senate in relation to the Pan-Pacific Trade Union Congress. The honorable senator even went further and credited the Labour party with having originated the idea of a Pan-Pacific Congress. He also said that I was wrong in bringing the matter before the Senate, and that I did so in order to make an unjustifiable attack upon the Labour party. Since that time the people of this country have learned a great deal about the congress, who is organizing it, and what is its objective. We have gained more information, and possibly the Leader of the Opposition now knows a good deal more about the matter than he did when he last spoke on that subject in the Senate. Does he still say that the Labour party should take the credit for the Pan-Pacific Congress and what it stands for? Will he now repudiate the hideous policy that that organization advocates? Upon reflection and the exercise of more mature judgment, I do not think he will repeat the statement he made on that occasion. He is adopting the same attitude in regard to the red menace. It is time that the Leader of the Opposition and those associated with him realized that the red menace does exist instead of closing their eyes to facts. The honorable senator is quite out of step with a considerable section of the organization which he represents, and is, I am afraid, proving to the people that his judgment upon this matter, as it is on finance, and a few other subjects, is not as reliable as it might be. </para>
        <para>I wish now to refer to the subject of child endowment. The Leader of the Opposition charged the Prime Minister, the Government and its supporters, with not having kept their promise to the electors on this important matter. It is true that we made certain promises - not quite as the Leader of the Opposition said - during the election campaign in regard to child endowment. The Government, with a view to arriving at some <inline font-style="italic">modus operandi,</inline> referred it to a conference of Commonwealth and State. Ministers because it found that some of the </para>
        <para class="block">States had committed themselves to certain schemes and had very definite plans as to the way in which the system should be conducted. During the discussion at that conference the Prime Minister endeavoured to discover a means whereby the Commonwealth Government in co-operation with the States could introduce a scheme acceptable to all parties. What happened? The action taken was not at the instigation of a Nationalist Premier. The representative of the Queensland Labour Government at that conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith, said that the problem of child endowment was very intricate, and as the introduction of the system would cost a lot of money, the Governments would have to be very careful. He therefore moved that the subject be referred to a royal commission. That action was not proposed by the Prime Minister or the leader of any Nationalist administration, but by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith, a member of the Queensland Labour Government. The Prime Minister acquiesced, and the question was referred to a royal commission. It is hoped that when a report is received, and is considered by the Government in conjunction with the representatives of the States, it will be possible to devise a scheme whereby child endowment may be brought into operation. The Government has done everything possible, in the circumstances. There has been no breach of any pledge, and I feel sure that when the &#39;supporters of the Government place the position before the electors their action will receive the endorsement of the people of Australia. </para>
        <para>I have endeavoured to answer briefly some of the attacks made upon the Government by the Leader of the Opposition, particularly in connexion with the budget, which, in the circumstances, I regard as very satisfactory. It is certainly not as attractive as some of us would like, but there are exceptional circumstances which have to be considered, and over which neither the Treasurer nor the Government has control. The budget has been well received throughout the country, and the criticism levelled against it has not been serious, due largely to the fact that it covers an extremely difficult period. I regard it as a good budget, and I feel that the Treasurer and the Government should be congratulated upon it. I am confident that when the people of Australia have an opportunity to consider its contents, the Government need have no fear that it will not secure the support of a great majority of the people of Australia. </para>

          <para>. -  I endorse all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has said, but more particularly the concluding portion of his speech, in which he congratulated the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> upon the clarity of the budget which has just been presented to Parliament. It is a matter for regret that the financial year closed with .a deficit, but, owing to the unsatisfactory season and to the difficulty in estimating the revenue, that was not surprising. It is, however, pleasing to note that the Treasurer has been able to budget for a small surplus this year. He will perhaps be criticised for not budgeting in such a way as to wipe out last year&#39;s deficit; but the only -way in which that could be done would be by raising more revenue or by reducing expenditure. The raising of additional revenue would necessitate higher taxation, which is undesirable, and the difficulty in reducing expenditure is apparent. Fully 60 per cent, of bur Commonwealth expenditure is represented by statutory commitments in the form of interest, repatriation, pensions, and other charges. Expenditure in that direction cannot be reduced, and some of it may possibly have to be increased. It is necessary, however, to study our loan expenditure very closely. At the present time a reduction of loan expenditure also presents some difficulties, since a large proportion of the workers in Australia are obtaining their wages on works provided by loan moneys. Unfortunately, at present, there are a large number of men out of work, and although some of us may feel disposed to vote against some of the items on the loan estimates, it is extremely difficult to reduce such expenditure unless we wish to create further unemployment. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Our present position is due largely to the fact that we have been legislating on wrong lines. I have spoken on this subject before, and I wish to repeat that our  high customs duties are seriously interfering with primary production. High customs duties increase the cost of living, which results in an appeal to the Arbitration Court for higher wages, which are invariably granted, and these in turn lead to still higher duties, and so it goes on. I do not wish it to be thought for a moment that I am an advocate of low wages. I am not. I should like the workers to receive real wages, and not sham wages. The system we have been pursuing in the past has resulted in men receiving, say, an additional 2s. a day, and the cost of living at once being increased by 2s. 6d. a day. This is simply throwing dust in the people&#39;s eyes. </para>
        <para>I do not believe in the day-labour system. I hold the view that men should be paid for the work they do, not for the time they take to do it. The day-labour system means that the cost of a job is determined not by the amount of work to be performed, but by the time it takes. We have reached such a position that a full and careful consideration of the effect of our tariffs and arbitration laws is imperative. We shall not progress towards real prosperity until there is a lowering of the cost of production. There is scarcely a thing which can be exported from Australia without assistance of some kind. Even wool, which is our best exportable commodity, is getting perilously near the stage when it will not show a profit. Some time ago an inquiry was made into the pastoral industry. I commend to honorable senators the very fine report issued as the result of those investigations. In 1911, the average price received for wool grown on certain stations was 8.71d. per pound. That left a profit of 3.32d. per pound. In 1925, although the average price of wool grown on the same station was 15.26d. per pound, the profit was only 2.8d. per pound. The tendency throughout the world is for prices to revert to pre-war levels. While at the present time the price of wool has not reached a dangerous level, I desire to point out that with the tendency towards lower prices any product which brings twice as much as it did before the war is in danger of seeing a reduced .price. </para>
        <para>Australia enjoys natural conditions favorable to the growing of wheat. </para>
        <para class="block">Our wheat, therefore, should be able to compete in the world&#39;s market. In addition, we have probably the best machinery in the world for the cultivation of wheat. The price of wheat in the world&#39;s market is declining. Wheat in England is about 5s. 5d. a bushel, which would give us 4s. or 4s. Id. a bushel at the sea-board. After allowing for railway freights there is no margin of profit. Although it is rather early to forecast, the indications point to a bumper wheat harvest this year, but, unfortunately, the price of wheat is not encouraging. Canada expects to produce 600,000,000 bushels of wheat this year. Should Russia and Siberia re-establish themselves in the world&#39;s wheat market Australia&#39;s wheat farmers will be working at a loss. Our costs of production must be reduced. The first thing to be done is to amend our tariff. I do not suggest any drastic legislative amendments, such as freetrade, for that would cause chaos. But we must start to round off the edges. </para>
        <para>Although Australia exports large quantities of butter, that would not be possible were it not for the Paterson stabilization scheme. I believe in that scheme, although I would rather see a reduction in the cost of production. Were it not for the 4d. a lb. assistance to butter under the Paterson scheme, and the fact that dairy farmers work for much less than the rates awarded to ordinary labourers by the courts, we should export no butter. </para>
        <para>This year Australia exported about 3,000,000 bushels of fruit. From the time the fruit was picked until it was sold, handling costs represented about 9s. a case. Yet a large proportion of that fruit realized much less than 9s. a case; some of it brought only 7s. 6d. a case. In pre-war days 9s. or 10s. a case represented a fair margin of profit, but to-day that is not so. Tasmanian members of this Parliament have asked for a bounty on dried fruit, but so far without success. I do not like bounties; but the fruit industry is in need of some assistance, and is as much entitled to a bounty as are other industries which have been helped by that means. In Tasmania we have some of the most up-to-date fruit evaporating factories in the world. The cost of production, however, is so great that it does not pay to evaporate fruit for export, and as soon as the Australian market is supplied they shut down and the rest of the fruit rots. </para>
        <para>The potato industry in Tasmania is also in a bad way. Thousands of tons of potatoes will not be dug this year in Tasmania because of the high cost of handling them. Labour and machinery are expensive, while the high freights due to the Navigation Act make it unprofitable to ship potatoes to Sydney. Digging, bagging, cartage and rail charges and steamer freights represent from &#163;4 5s. to &#163;4 10s. a ton, whereas the price of potatoes in Sydney is from &#163;4 to &#163;5 a ton. That leaves absolutely nothing for the grower for all his work. There are thousands of people in Australia to whom those potatoes would be invaluable; but production costs force growers in Tasmania to let them lie in the ground or to be used as food for stock. </para>

            <para>- Probably the &#34; freight on coal from England to Adelaide is less than from Newcastle to Adelaide, owing to the Navigation Act. It is possible to convey Scandinavian timber to Adelaide for about one-half the cost of shipping it from Hobart. The same thing probably applies to coal. High costs are killing everything. The  chairman  of directors of one of the best mines at Broken Hill, which has shut down, said recently that he could find employment for 1,000 men if they would accept wages which would enable the company to compete in the world&#39;s market. Metals had come back to pre-war prices, and as labour costs had kept up the mine was shut down, and the men were thrown out of work. </para>

        <para>Until we face the position squarely, we shall not achieve real prosperity. The greatest barriers to progress are the tariff, the Arbitration Court, and the Navigation Act. Of these the greatest obstacle is the Navigation Act. It has created two big monopolies - the steamship owners and the seamen. They are both relentless. Southern Tasmania is worse off than it was 60 years ago in the matter of steamship services. A majority of the members of both the Navigation Royal Commission and the Public Accounts Committee reported_ in favour of the repeal of the coastal sections of the Navigation Act. I hope that the Government will give effect to their recommendation. I do not want to use extravagant language, but I say unhesitatingly that no better scheme to cripple Tasmania could have been devised than the passing of that legislation. In speaking of these matters, I speak of that which I know. I have been forced to travel from Hobart overland by night to another port in order to catch a small boat to take me to the mainland when, were it not for the Navigation Act, I could have boarded a well-appointed passenger steamer at the first port. People from other parts of the world doubt our sanity when they see the effect of the Navigation Act, and wonder why we submit to it. Tasmania, being an island State, should have the best means of sea transport possible. The coastal sections of the Navigation Act should be repealed immediately, so that Tasmania may have free intercourse with the rest of Australia and other parts of the world. I am prepared to take any steps and go to any length to have them repealed. Tasmania is dependent upon shipping, yet it has always been badly off in this respect. It is faced continually with the handicap of Bass Strait, and it is the duty of this Parliament to minimize that handicap as much as possible. Some little time ago, as a member of the Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts, I was associated with an investigation into the Tasmanian shipping problem. That committee recommended that three services should be established. Some people believe that one service is sufficient, but Tasmania now has several ports in order to  give access to its producers, and it needs an adequate shipping service. It is not right that Tasmania should be worse off under federation than it was previously. Had there been a desert instead of a strip of water between Australia and that State the Commonwealth Government would certainly have constructed a railway to afford the necessary communication, and it is but fair that it should give effect to the various recommendations that have been made for the provision of proper shipping facilities. One of the recommendations made by the Public Accounts Committee was that an old vessel, which has been 40 years in service on the northwest coast of Tasmania should be replaced. I should like honorable senators to travel in that vessel as the representatives of Tasmania have to do - sometimes twice a week - in order to appreciate her extraordinary condition. It was also suggested that when the boats at present on the Launceston service are due for replacement, steps should be taken to provide better vessels. In regard to Hobart, it was recommended that a subsidy should be granted during the summer months in order to effect a better service. At the time when that committee inquired into the matter at Hobart a very good service was running. Had it discontinued then as it did a few weeks afterwards, I have not the slightest doubt that the committee would have recommended an all-the-year-round subsidy. I understand that the Government has received a tender for these services, and that the amount quoted is large. Whether it is too large is a matter for experts; but we want better services. Ordinarily my advice is to &#34;sell, rather than purchase vessels, but being .so keenly aware of the suffering to which the people of Tasmania are subjected owing to the lack of communication I advise the Government to take any steps, even to the extent of purchasing boats, in order to afford relief. I urge the Government to give every consideration to the reports that have been submitted, feeling confident that if that is done there will be a repeal of the coastal sections of the Navigation Act, and the subsequent establishment of satisfactory communication between Tasmania and the mainland. </para>
        <para>After a long series of conferences and examinations the Government sent <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Nicholas Lockyer to Tasmania to inquire into the disabilities which it suffered under federation, and as a result of that inquiry the Commonwealth made an annual grant of &#163;378,000 to Tasmania for two years. It was urged at the time that the grant should be extended to five years, but the Government proposed to review the situation at the end of two years. I understand that that has now been done, and that the grant has been cut down to &#163;220,000 per annum. I admit that the Tasmanian Government showed a surplus this year. But there is very little incentive to show a surplus if, as a result, the Commonwealth grant to that State is to be cut down. A great many people in Tasmania will be very disappointed that the grant has been reduced. This Government also sent the Development and Migration Commission to Tasmania to make inquiries and devise a scheme to increase the prosperity of the State. That commission did excellent work. Finally, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Findley</inline> was instructed to inaugurate an agricultural bureau scheme, in order to strengthen the Agricultural Department. I take the keenest active interest in the work of that bureau. Everybody in Tasmania was under the impression that its upkeep, amounting to something like &#163;30,000 a year, was. to be paid for by the Federal Government. Now we have received the bombshell that the Tasmanian Government has to meet that amount, which actually cuts down its grant of &#163;220,000 to &#163;190,000. There is not the slightest doubt that the Tasmanian Treasurer will now have to budget for a deficit instead of a surplus. I have no idea how the amount of &#163;220,000 was arrived at. Although Tasmanian representatives in the Federal Parliament were at all times anxious to assist in the matter, the basis of the calculation was determined in private conference between the Treasurers of the Commonwealth and Tasmania. </para>
        <para>I ask the Government, in justice to the island State, to be a little more liberal in supporting the grant to Tasmania, and I urge that, as the Development and Migration Commission has been instrumental in instigating the existing agricultural drive in Tasmania, the Federal Government might see its way to pay for it. </para>
