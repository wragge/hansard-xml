        </quote>
        <para class="block">It is well that at the outset I should indicate that this measure deals exclusively with Commonwealth employees and has no application whatever to employees, of private individuals carrying on business within the Territories of the Commonwealth. Their relationships as employers and employees will have to be provided for by ordinances passed from time to time, as occasion requires, in the various Territories. </para>
        <para>In connexion with the consideration of . this bill it may be useful to refer briefly to the history of the law under which a master has been liable for injury or death of his servants in the course of their employment. From early times the common law imposed a duty on the master to take proper care to see that employees engaged by him in carrying on his work or industry did not suffer injury by reason of <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> personal negligence or through his failure properly to superintend and control the undertaking in which he and his employees were engaged. For his own personal negligence the employer was always liable and still is liable at common law. The obligations of the master in this connexion extended to: - (1) The provision of a proper and suitable plant; (2) the selection of fit and competent fellow servants; (3) a proper system and, control, of the work; (4) the observance of regulations imposed by statute. The extent of the employer&#39;s duty varied according to the degree of danger involved in the work, and also, according to the skill and experience possessed by the servants. Contributory negligence on the past of a servant would absolve the master from liability in re,spect of injury arising from such  negligence.  Where the risk and danger of the work were known and appreciated by the workman, and when he undertook to per-, form the work, the master was not, following the maxim <inline font-style="italic">volenti non fit in,juria,</inline> liable for any injury resulting from the risk or danger thus undertaken by the workman. The master further was freed from liability where the doctrine of common employment could be invoked, that is to say, where the person suffering, and the person causing, the injury were fellow servants engaged in the common employment for and under the same master.* This doctrine has, to a certain extent, been modified by legislation, to which I shall refer later. </para>
        <para>The common law on this subject was first invaded by statute law when the Employers&#39; Liability Act was passed in England in 1880 as a tentative measure to remain&#39; in force for seven years. It has, however, been kept in force from time to time by the annual statutes, the Expiring Laws Continuance Acts. The act did not abolish, though it largely modified, the doctrine of common employment. The general effect of the law was that whereas previously the workman could recover only if he could show that his employer had neglected a statutory duty or was personally responsible for negligence that led to the injury, he could now recover where the employer had delegated his duties or powers of superintendence to others who had been negligent in the performance of those duties or powers. Th? effect of the act may be stated generally as placing the obligation on the employer to pay compensation for personal injury caused to a workman by any defect in the condition of the ways, works, machinery or plant; the negligence of his superintendents; the negligence of persons to whom he had delegated the power to give orders to his workmen; defective by-laws and defective trade instructions; and in relation to railway servants, the negligent management of signals, point3 and trains. </para>
        <para>The next step in the development of this subject was the passage of the &#34;Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act in England in 1906. Here the liability to pay compensation attaches to the relation of employer and employee, and is quite irrespective of negligence. With a few exceptions the obligation is placed upon every employer of labour to make pecuniary compensation to a limited extent whenever death or disablement happens to a workman in the course of his employment. Every employment is within the act, where a contract of service or apprenticeship exists, whether the work involved is manual labour, clerical work, or otherwise subject to such express exceptions as are made in the act. The persons to whom the act does not apply include - (1) Those whose remuneration exceeds a specified sum and who are employed otherwise than by manual labour - in respect of these honorable senators will note a distinction in the measure which we shall deal with presently more in detail - (2) casual employees; (3) outworkers; (4) members of the employer&#39;s family dwelling in his house ; and (5) persons in the naval or military service. The injury in respect of which compensation is payable under the act must be the result of accident arising out of and in the course of the employment of the employee. This provision, as is generally known, has been a frequent cause of litigation. </para>
        <para>The first legislation by the Commonwealth on this subject was the Commonwealth Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act 1912, which was to a considerable extent, based upon the British of 1906. Such provisions of the British act as were found to be applicable to Commonwealth conditions were applied. Since that date legislation has been passed in the States, and the basis upon which compensation is calculated has been considerably altered. It is thought that the time is now opportune to bring Commonwealth legislation on this subject up to date, and with this object the measure now under consideration has been introduced. </para>
        <para>The bill provides for comprehensive and up-to-date legislation in connexion with compensation for injuries to Commonwealth employees who are not entitled to participate in the rights of </para>
        <para class="block">State laws. Commonwealth legislation is therefore necessary. In many respects the present act, which was passed in 1912, is out of date. The bill therefore provides for the repeal of that measure and the introduction of new provisions. It contains many important variations from the present law, the chief of these being: - (1) Administration to be in the hands of a commissioner; (2) the act to apply to all employees irrespective of salary but to exclude naval, military and air forces; (3) payment of increased compensation ; (4) payment of medical benefits; and (5) specified payments for certain injuries. </para>
        <para>Under the present act questions of compensation are decided by agreement, arbitration or by the court. In the case of death it is the practice to refer questions of dependency to the court, thus causing delay and expense. Provision has accordingly been made in the bill that the act be administered by a commissioner. The powers and functions of the commissioner are set out in clause 6. They provide that he shall determine all matters subject to the provisions of the bill. There is, however, a right of appeal from his decision to a county court. The act applies to all civil employees of the Commonwealth, except employees receiving more than &#163;500 per annum. In the bill the limit of &#163;500 has been abolished, and the act therefore will thus apply to all civil employees. At present the law applies to naval and military forces except when on active service, but the defence regulations contain comprehensive provision for compensation in respect of injuries to members of the forces. It is proposed, therefore, that the bill shall not apply to the members of the forces, but provision is made for the extension of the act to employees of such authorities established under the Commonwealth as are prescribed by regulation. The bill can thus be made applicable to such an authority as the Commonwealth Bank and the authority will, unless otherwise prescribed,, be responsible for the payment of compensation in accordance with the provisions of- the act. Under the present act the compensation to dependants, wholly dependent, is a sum equal to three years&#39; earnings, subject to a minimum of &#163;200 and a maximum of &#163;500. Under similar conditions the bill provides for payment of a sum equal to one hundred and fifty-six times the weekly pay at the time of injury, subject to a minimum of &#163;400 and a maximum of &#163;700. The present act provides for a weekly payment not exceeding 50 per cent, of average weekly earnings and subject to a maximum of &#163;2. The bill provides for payment not exceeding two-thirds of weekly pay at time of injury, and the maximum is increased to &#163;3. In addition, allowance for child endowment, if any, is to be continued in full during total incapacity. Provision has also been made for increased payments to minors. </para>
        <para>The present act does not prescribe payments for specific injuries. The absence of this provision, makes it necessary to arrive at an agreement in each instance or go to the court. Modern compensation laws, including State acts, contain a schedule of fixed payments for specific injuries. The bill accordingly contains a schedule in keeping with modern requirements. In this schedule the payments vary from &#163;600 downwards according to the nature of the injury. The present act contains no provision for payment of medical benefits to injured employees. The trend of modern legislation is to provide for such benefits. Provision has accordingly been made in the bill for payment of medical, surgical, and hospital treatment up to &#163;100. This payment is in addition to compensation otherwise provided in the bill. </para>
        <para>The bill provides that the liability of the Commonwealth shall be limited to &#163;700 plus medical expenses, except in the case of permanent total incapacity. It is felt that this limit should not apply in the case of an employee who has received injuries which render him totally incapable of doing any further work. It is considered that the best way to assist such an employee is by a permanent weekly payment instead of lump sum compensation. The bill accordingly provides for a weekly payment of two-thirds of his pay subject to a maximum of &#163;3, without any limitation as to period and total liability. </para>
        <para>When the Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act was passed in 1912 there was no Superannuation Act in existence. The principle was laid down, however, that an employee should not be entitled to receive compensation or payment from the Commonwealth in respect of an accident both independently of and also under the Compensation Act. The Superannuation Act was passed in 1922, and provision was made for pensions to be paid from joint contributions by the employees and the Commonwealth. Where an employee receives an injury resulting in permanent and total disablement, that employee, if a contributor to the superannuation fund, is entitled to a pension. If death results, his widow will receive a pension of half the amount that would have been payable to the employee. In both cases a pension will also be paid in respect of children under sixteen years of age. As the Commonwealth provides half of these pensions - for the majority of the present employees the Commonwealth contribution exceeds half - the Government has carefully considered the question as to what additional payments shall be made in such cases as compensation under this bill. As a result, the provisions which the Government deem equitable have been set out in clause 17 of the bill. Briefly stated, the effects of that clause is this - </para>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label="i.">
            <para>The widow, in addition to the pension under the Superannuation Act, will receive a lump sum compensation, less the capitalized value of half the pension. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="ii.">
            <para>There is a saving clause that a minimum payment equal to half the compensation will be paid to the widow. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="iii.">
            <para>Where the employee leaves a widow and other dependants, such as a mother, the mother will be entitled to her full share of compensation, and the widow&#39;s share will be reduced as already indicated, subject, however, to a minimum payment of half that share being made. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>In the case of permanent and total incapacity, the maximum amount which the employee could get under the Compensation Act is to be reduced by the amount of any pension payable to him under the Superannuation Act. Honorable senators will see that there is a limit to the amount to be paid to an employee in the event of permanent and total incapacity. </para>
        <para>This bill includes very comprehensive provision for compensation in respect of injuries sustained by all civil employees of the Commonwealth. These provisions are in keeping with the trend of modern legislation, and are very much more liberal than those of the existing act, and the Government considers that these provisions should apply uniformly to all civil employees. It is therefore proposed that the power to make provision for compensation for injuries to civil employees under any other laws of the Commonwealth shall be abolished. The bill accordingly provides that such a power shall be taken away from the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator, and that the existing awards shall be non-effective. That provision makes it possible to maintain an orderly system, which was difficult when the Public Service Arbitrator had to fix compensation for injuries. This provision is incorporated in the bill as it is desirable that compensation shall be controlled by one Government ordinance. The bill also provides for compensation to be paid to employees who are not covered by the Public Service Regulations also for employees who come under the Defence Act. Previously, when applications were made to the courts, there was no definite principle by which the Government could be guided and there was always the possibility that the Minister controlling the department might be inconsistent when awarding compensation, and that he might even dispense varying degrees of justice to persons suffering from the same injuries. I have enumerated the salient features of the measure and I commend it to honorable senators as a genuine attempt to regularize the laws regarding compensation. </para>

            <para>. - It is not my intention to occupy the time of the Senate at any length since the subject was thoroughly ventilated when the original measure, which this bill amends, was before us. During the last election campaign the right honorable the Prime Minister, in announcing the policy of the Government stated among other things that it was intended to introduce an extensive and liberal housing scheme. In fulfilment of that promise a bill was brought down and enacted, incorporating most liberal terms for the acquirement of homes by the thrifty. I consider that more liberal have never been granted. In order to encourage people to build and own their own homes 90 per cent, of the cost of a home is advanced to the applicant. The bill affords industrialists an opportunity to acquire their own homes, to be free of landlords, and to have a sense of security and independence. It is particularly desirable that people as they reach the winter of their lives, should have the comforting knowledge that they own the roof which is over their heads. The different States of Australia have housing schemes in operation, but it is my opinion that eventually all of them will be merged in one huge scheme controlled by the Commonwealth Government. The State schemes are not nearly so generous as that which is now before us. Under some of them only 66 to 75 per cent, of the cost of the home is advanced. Most of those schemes are very conservative, and a person needs to be comparatively well off to avail himself of their provisions. In the circumstances this Commonwealth legislation fills a long felt want. The amending bill liberalizes the principal act. It was .found, through consultation between the Commonwealth and State Savings Bank officials, that anomalies existed. Those anomalies will be rectified by this measure and the machinery of the principal act will be made easily workable. The bill also extends the benefits of the act. Originally a person could not obtain any additional advance should he by reason of an in&#39;crease in family or any other s&#62;uch contingency, desire to make additions to his home. That is a very wise and necessary provision. Furthermore, it provides that should a person sell his home, remove to another locality and again desire to build or purchase, he may do so. That also is a necessary provision. The bill provides, too, that repaid money, instead of lying idle as previously, shall earn interest, which is desirable. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Many countries have recognized the necessity for housing schemes. Since the war  Great Britain has constructed  1,000,060 homes under housing schemes, and France, Belgium, and Germany are also active in the same direction. Generally such schemes are operative through municipalities and other local organizations, local control being considered most desirable. The Commonwealth law wisely provides that loans shall be made through State authorities, and no. doubt in future municipalities, particularly in the capital cities, will freely avail themselves of its provisions. In industrial centres where suburbs are extending this . will be a magnificent scheme to enable the workers to obtain homes of their own. I think that the amendment is necessary and wise. It liberalizes the act, and will confer great benefits upon those who avail themselves of the scheme. </para>

            <para>. - It is perfectly true that the Government did, at the last election, proclaim that it would, if the people of Australia gave it a further lease of life, proceed with a &#163;20,000,000 housing scheme - one that was to be bigger and better than any housing scheme undertaken by any State Authority. Two and a half years passed, and not a brick was laid, and it follows that if you do not lay foundations, you do not build houses. It was a jerry-built scheme of the worst kind. Then the Housing Bill was brought down, accompanied by another bill to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act, by separating the general banking business of the Commonwealth Bank from the Savings Bank branch. It provided for the appointment of three commissioners to undertake the administration of the housing scheme. &#34;We were told many times during the debate on that measure that the Treasurer of the present administration had had frequent consultations with the directors of the Commonwealth Bank and with the State authorities in respect of the housing scheme. The Labour party pointed out the absurity of appointing three commissioners simply to advance money to authorities which would afterwards be created. Largely because of our opposition to the appointment of the commissioners, as expressed both in this Chamber and in another place, S.O.S. messages were sent to some of the directors of the Commonwealth) Bank, and they immediately hastened to Canberra. The Treasurer realized, after consulting with them, that the opposition of the Labour party was justified, and that it was quite unnecessary to appoint special commissioners. </para>

          <para>We were told that the scheme had been worked out in consultation with the State authorities. Now we are informed that, as a result of later consultations with the States, it has been, found necessary to introduce this amending bill. If ever there was a band of muddlers and unbusinesslike men carrying on the business of government in any country, it is those who compose the Bruce-Page administration. Most of the time of this Parliament is occupied in amending bills which have been introduced, and put through Parliament by this Government. This &#34;business-like&#34; Government introduced a housing scheme before it had made any serious attempt to ascertain the views of the State authorities. It introduced an amending banking bill before it had ascertained the views of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank. The result has been that we have had three or four attempts to get the act into operation. </para>
          <para>SenatorReid.  -  Do not exaggerate. This is only the second attempt. </para>
          <para>SenatorFINDLEY. - It is the fourth attempt, and I ask myself is this the final . one. This Government went to the people at the last election with the cry of &#34; Houses for those who are houseless, and homes for those who are homeless. &#34; Many votes were captured by that cry, but it was a cruel deception. Many people who were without homes voted for the Government in the hope that they would get what the Government promised them. When I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Andrew</inline> say that this was the most liberal housing scheme ever introduced, I wondered if he was familiar with  conditions in his own State. Does he really know anything at all about the housing scheme undertaken by the State Government of Victoria? If he does, he must know that this Commonwealth Housing Scheme is a most illiberal one as compared with the Victorian scheme. I shall endeavour to show the honorable senator how ignorant he is of the Victorian housing system. There the State Savings Bank has been created a State authority for the building of houses, and it operates one of the most liberal housing schemes in the world. </para>

Therefore, a man with a family of five can, under the State Savings Bank housing scheme, build a wooden house costing &#163;1,000, or a brick house costing &#163;1,300, for a deposit of &#163;25. and his whole liability would be discharged in 26^ years. Under the Commonwealth scheme, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Andrew</inline> has called one of the most liberal ever introduced in any country, an applicant is required to pay a deposit of 10 per cent., which would be &#163;100 on a &#163;1,000 house, and &#163;200 on a &#163;2,000 house. </para>

          <para class="block">The Commonwealth Government introduced its housing scheme when there was not an acute shortage of houses. If building operations in Victoria have been more or less stationary it is due largely to the fact that there are many men out of employment, who, whatever schemes were provided, would be unable to undertake the financial responsibilities associated with house-building. </para>
          <para>There are a number of houses for sale and to let in Melbourne suburbs; yet in some suburbs two or more families are living under the one roof, and there are also numerous married couples living in apartments. Many -of these persons desire houses of their own, but are unable to undertake the financial responsibility involved in home building. I criticized the Government when the first measure was submitted, and I have not hesitated to offer my strong opposition to the amending bills. If there ever was a time when the Government deserved criticism for incompetence and incapacity it is now. The time of Parliament should not be occupied in discussing amending legislation necessitated by the incapacity and incompetence of Ministers. </para>

Will the honorable Minister say that it is proposed to liberalize this measure in such a way that it will be acceptable to those who desire to build homes as is the Victorian State Savings Bank scheme? If it is to be as liberal, there is no justification for a Commonwealth scheme. </para>

              <para>- I accept the honorable member&#39;s word that the limit is now &#163;1,300; the Victorian act must have recently been amended  by the present State Government, but the Commonwealth scheme permits of advances up to &#163;1,800 being made to persons whose salaries are higher than those provided for in the various State acts. There are many people with salaries in excess of &#163;600 a year who, in the matter of securing homes, wish to be put on the same footing as people with lower salaries. They have been unable to get advances under any State scheme, either because their salaries have exceeded the limit fixed in the State acts or because the amount of the advance available under State legislation is too low. </para>

          <para>Because of the change that has come about in industrial conditions, and because of awards made by Arbitration Courts, the wages of many mechanics&#39; have reached what was previously regarded as the general professional or clerical standard, but no State housing legislation makes provision for persons who earn more than &#163;600 a year. In Victoria the salary limit is a little over &#163;400, and when the Commonwealth Housing Bill was introduced that State would not advance more than &#163;800 on a wooden house or &#163;950 on a brick house. Contrary to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has Stated, the Commonwealth Government has not set out to deceive any one. Its purpose in passing this housing legislation was not to provide homes foi&#34; the homeless. State legislation already catered for the homeless, and the appeal made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> for the homeless was consequently a little overdrawn. Under the Commonwealth scheme a person who is paying 8, 9 or 10 per cent, on mortgage to some home building organization -will be enabled to obtain an advance from a State authority. </para>

          <para>Another feature, of the Commonwealth scheme is that it will be administered by the State authorities. Of course, if the State of Victoria is as well off as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has said it is, it will not need to take advantage of the Commonwealth scheme, but several of the other States are in a very bad financial position. For instance, Queensland, owing to the way in which money has been wasted on wild socialistic schemes of the class favoured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> finds now that it has no money to advance for the erection of workmen&#39;s dwellings. The people of that State are just as anxious to own their own homes as are the people in other States, and they will be accommodated by the Commonwealth scheme. Victoria, about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> makes a great deal of fuss, is only a small portion of Australia. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>was not quite correct in his description of the position in Victoria. That State will have a deficit this year and will consequently find it difficult to provide money for the erection of workmen&#39;s dwellings. The honorable senator&#39;s constituents will probably find it convenient to make use of the money made available by the Commonwealth Government for the purpose. As a matter of fact, Victoria has already entered into an agreement to carry out the Commonwealth housing scheme, and in this instance also, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> talk was all so much gallery play. As the boisterous weather of a few clays ago has passed away and has been succeeded by calm beautiful days, so it will be with the Commonwealth housing scheme; when the State authorities get into swing and advances are being made to those who require homes, everything will settle down and no doubt the constituents of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> will derive much benefit. </para>
          <para>In a complicated measure providing for the erection of houses through the activities of local authorities and for making advances through the Commonwealth Savings Bank to State authorities, it was to be expected that amendments would be found necessary. Full effect cannot be given to the intentions of Parliament until its legislation is put into operation. The Housing Bill which this Parliament passed has been put into operation and in administering it difficulties have been discovered, which the Government has been wise enough to have rectified at once. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> took good care not to refer to the amendments contained in the bill before us.  His  speech was simply a tirade against the provisions of the original measure. He could not raise objection to a proposal to make the Housing Act more workable and better for the people whom it was intended to benefit. To my mind it is one of the best steps the Commonwealth Government has ever taken to find homes for the middle class in the community who are to-day suffering from the effects of economic pressure. Men in professional and clerical circles have to maintain a certain standard of living, on proportionately lower incomes than they enjoyed in the past, but in the matter of securing homes for themselves they have not been given help by the State Governments. The Commonwealth Government has taken steps to help them. I have always been enthusiastic about aiding people to get their own homes. It is one of the best antidotes the nation can have against the actions of extremists. In Australia to-day, we have the spectacle of extremists who are not only seeking to injure Australia, but also are ruining the party to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> belongs. They stir up feelings of discontent among people who are suffering from grievances of, perhaps, only a minor character. But when a man owns his own home he has a stake in the country, he has something to lose, and something to stand by. If the people of the middle class who are now squeezed economically, can by acquiring homes of their own, be made more contented than they are to-day, they will become again the stable factor they have always been in Australia, holding as they do the balance as between the extremists on either side. Extreme conservatives are just as dangerous to the community as the bolsheviks, who have been causing such an upset in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> party during the last three days that caucus has been scratching its head, not knowing where it stands. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is not a Bolshevik, but unfortunately he is sometimes driven by the extreme section of his party to do things which he would not otherwise do. The Ministerial party, which is not conservative, is sometimes hindered by the activities of extreme conservatives, who object to housing schemes or any thing that will afford help to the people. </para>

            <para>. - The bill before us is designed amongst other things to enable advances to be made for the extension of houses. I differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Andrew,</inline> who described extensions as improvements. If I own a home and set to work to paint it and make it ornate I am improving it, but not extending it. Extensions are simply additions. I differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who claims that the alteration in the administrative provisions of the original bill which was effected by the Government last year and consented to by Parliament, was made at the instigation of the Labour party. I remind the honorable senator that when the Housing Bill was before the Senate I drew attention to the desirability of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank administering the housing scheme and urged that there was no  need for appointing special savings hank commissioners. I went so far as to move an amendment to carry out my idea, but, as my proposal was not then acceptable to the Government, I let the matter go on the voices. Fortunately, later on, the Government saw its way to agree to my suggestion. I do not think, therefore, that the alteration can be said to have been made at the behest of the Labour party. &#34;While I agree that extensions of houses should be encouraged, I think that the Housing Act should have been functioning and that a bill for permitting advances for extensions could have been brought down later on. In Queensland quite a number of people of the middle class referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> are waiting for the act to come into operation,- so that they may make application for advances and proceed with the building of homes. In this way the public have suffered a great deal more inconvenience than would have been caused if the act had been allowed to function. The amendments could have been made later. 1 welcome the measure, but regret that the act which was passed last year was not brought into operation at once. </para>

          <para class="block">The point which the honorable senator endeavoured to make was that the Commonwealth Government was about to become actively engaged in house building. Actually, we are not doing that at all. Our purpose is to furnish the necessary money to the various State .instrumentalities, so that they may expand their house building schemes. This amending measure is the result of representations made to the Government by officials connected with the several State house building authorities in order that it may not be necessary to alter materially State legislation. </para>
          <para>The position is not quite as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> has put it.

              <para>- No application will be made to the Commonwealth Government, in the way suggested by the honorable senator. After the various State authorities have brought their schemes into line with- this measure they will get in touch with the Commonwealth Savings Bank authorities to obtain money for can extension of their present activities. The fact that they have asked for certain slight alterations to the Commonwealth Act is evidence that the measure is attracting attention and is desired by the States. I ask honorable senators to endeavour to appreciate all the difficulties in the launching of such a scheme as this. It cannot be done iri five minutes. An officer of the Commonwealth Savings Bank visited all the States to inquire into the State schemes, and ascertain how they could be brought into harmony with the proposals of the Commonwealth. It has been suggested that in submitting the original measure last year, the Government was lacking in foresight or business acumen, because it did not foresee all the obstacles in the way; but, as I have said, these could only be ascertained after an officer of the Commonwealth Savings Bank had visited the . different States and had had consultations with responsible State officersThe Commonwealth housing scheme in its original form would have limited the operations of many State authorities. I think I am safe in saying that the whole of the amendments included in this bill have been made at the instigation of the State authorities. </para>

I see no reason why an applicant, who may have moved to another part of the Commonwealth, should be denied a privilege enjoyed by other citizens, because it is specifically provided that an advance may only be made to an applicant who has paid off his previous loan, presumably by the sale of his house, and desires to build or acquire another home. To my mind this provision should be an incentive to thrift. </para>

On that point I venture the opinion that the Government proposal to provide finance for the State authorities is a much more satisfactory arrangement. These amendments will make it possible for the Government  to assist the State authorities to liberalize and enlarge their building operations. The Leader of theOpposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> suggested that the Government, under the Housing Act, was in the position of a money lender. That is exactly the function which the Government will discharge. Through the Commonwealth Savings Bank it will provide &#163;20,000,000 for the use of the several State authorities, and will thus provide for the enlargement of their schemes. </para>

            <para>- My friend opposite is either purposely or unconsciously obtuse. I prefer to think that he is not purposely so. The indictment levelled against us was that we had fallen down on our job over the war service homes, and that we were not fulfilling our promises. In answer to that I have pointed out that we have already constructed 1,455 war service&#34; homes, and that another 704 will be completed this year. Surely that is a satisfactory contribution to the housing requirements of the people by the War Service Homes Department. The average annual amount spent during the last five years by that department has been from &#163;1,700,000 to &#163;1,800,000. This year it is proposed to spend &#163;1,748,000.&#39; While there may have been, some small delays, they have not been due to any slackening or slowing down on the part of the War Service Homes Department. There have been many reasons for the delay, including the fact that some of the work has been held in abeyance by the applicants themselves, and in other cases the plans were not approved of. I maintain that the position in regard to war service homes is entirely satisfactory. </para>

            <para>. -While this clause is under consideration I wish to draw attention to a matter about which I spoke during another stage of the proceedings. I think that we ought to be better informed as to what advances are to be made to those who come under this scheme. During the course of my second-reading speech I said that only 90 per cent, of cost of a home would be advanced under the Commonwealth scheme. That statement was challenged by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline> and he asked me to point to any act that had, so far been passed wherein such a provision existed. I said that it was in the original act, find he again denied it. I now wish to draw his attention to the fact that, in section 9 of the original act the powers of existing authorities are extended- - </para>

Under this scheme provision is made for advancing up to 90 per cent, of the value of a house costing up to &#163;1,800, so that a person desiring to erect such a house under the scheme will have to find 10 per cent, of its value as a deposit.

              <para>- I admit that it is difficult to interpret correctly the definition of a newspaper, but I am endeavouring to show that if this bill is passed an injustice will be done to certain people: I am hopeful that when I have compared a number of publications, weekly and monthly, the Minister in charge of the bill will see the advisability of consulting his expert advisors in regard to the need for amending the bill. The <inline font-style="italic">Catholic Press</inline> is a weekly publication, the <inline font-style="italic">Harbinger of Light,</inline> a monthly. They are both religious publications, and convey news to the respective religious bodies for which they cater. The <inline font-style="italic">Advocate, Table Talk,</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">World&#39;s News</inline> are weekly publications; <inline font-style="italic">Life, Stead&#39;s,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Adam and Eve,</inline> monthly. Will any honorable senator say that <inline font-style="italic">Stead&#39;s</inline> does not convey to the reader news of a very important nature? I venture to say that this publication plays a very important part in the life of the people of Australia. I do not think that any Minister or officer of the Minister should be allowed arbitrarily to declare that it is not a conveyor and distributor of news. The <inline font-style="italic">Woman&#39;s Budget</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Woman&#39;s Mirror</inline> are issued weekly; the <inline font-style="italic">Woman&#39;s World, the Australian Home Journal</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Everylady&#39;s Journal</inline> are issued monthly. They are all similar in character, distributing to the womenfolk of Australia news regarding dresses, fashions, housekeeping hints, and so forth. The <inline font-style="italic">Listener In, Popular Radio Weekly, Mining Standard, Construction,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Manufacturer, Pigeon Keeper, Poultry, Photoplayer</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Hawklet,</inline> are weekly papers. <inline font-style="italic">Radio, Queensland Mining Journal, Building,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Sugar Journal, Young Australia, Power Farming, Musical News,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">A.N.A.</inline> are monthly publications. </para>

Weekly publications have the benefit of a bulk postage rate of l1/2d. for 20 oz., as compared with a rate of 21/2for 20 oz. for monthly publications. For single copies of weekly publications the postage is1d. for 10 oz., against a rate of1d. for 8 oz. for monthly publications. </para>

              <para>- It affects them very seriously because it is a tax which cannot be passed on. The other day we were discussing a proposed increased duty on films, and were well aware of the fact that the people engaged in the industry bad indicated that they would pass the tax on to the patrons of picture theatres. The publishers of monthly publications will not be able to go back to their subscribers and ask them for increased subscriptions to cover the four months of the year already gone ; consequently they will be obliged to bear the increased rate and charges. It is neither just nor equitable to distinguish between weekly and monthly journals which are obviously similar, &#39; except in the matter of frequency of publication. There is very little difference in their contents, and the Postal Department is fastening on to frequency of publication as the sole means of distinguishing between them. Nearly all these publications, weekly and monthly, cater for the same class of readers. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> publishes <inline font-style="italic">Table Talk</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Weekly Times,</inline> and I venture to say that the weeklies contain items that have already appeared in the daily. The <inline font-style="italic">Woman&#39;s Budget</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Home Journal,</inline> the former a weekly and the latter a monthly publication, contain the same class of information ; they both cater for the same section of the community, the same readers, and the only justification the Government has for charging an extra1d. on the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Home Journal</inline> is that there are 30 days instead of seven days between each issue. </para>

              <para>- The Minister&#39;s assurance on this point removes any objection I may have had to the clause in its present form. I again direct attention to the provisions of clause 28, and I suggest that the proposed added impost on magazines as against weekly publications be reconsidered. </para>

          <para>. - I realize that this measure is a necessary corollary of the Post and Telegraph Bill which has just been under discussion. It will be necessary to pass this measure in order to protect the public revenue. As it contains no debatable matter, I have no Opposition to offer to it. </para>
