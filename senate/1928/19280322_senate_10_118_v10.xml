            <para>At present all Public Service uniforms are manufactured in the Defence Clothing Factory in Melbourne and the arrangement is found to be quite satisfactory. All other general Government stores are purchased under tenders freely invited in all States. Contracts are then placed in accordance with the lowest satisfactory tenders after allowance for freight, cartage,  ,&amp;c.,  to the place where the stores are required. These arrangements appear to be the best possible in the public interest and a variation of them does not seem to be desirable. </para>

It makes practicable a permanent solution of the longstanding difficulty that has vexed the Commonwealth and the States in their financial relations with each other. The agreement is subject to the ratification of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and the States, and its permanency is dependent upon an amendment of the Constitution being agreed to by the people, and a validating act being passed by the next Commonwealth Parliament. </para>
          <para>Many attempts were made by previous Commonwealth Governments to bring about a permanent settlement of this question; but they were unable to arrive at an agreement with the States. The execution of this agreement with the States which now makes the way clear for a lasting settlement of' this difficult problem is no mean achievement. I remind honorable senators that this is the first occasion on which the Commonwealth and the States have been in agreement. </para>

              <para>-I shall show shortly that that is not the case. The subject of Commonwealth and State finances has been considered and dealt with' at length by honorable senators on previous occasions, and I do not propose therefore to do more than refer to one or two incidents in connexion with the history of this agreement. In 1919 the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> then Acting Prime Minister, submitted the first proposal for an alteration of the capitation payment.  His  scheme provided for a gradual reduction of the payment of 25s. per head to 10s. per head, but it was not accepted. In 1923 and again in 1926 further proposals which provided for the Commonwealth giving up to the States some portion of the income tax field as compensation for the abolition of the capitation payments were placed before the States, but were not acceptable to them. After the 1926 conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers the Government came to the conclusion that the capitation system, which could be suspended by the will of Parliament at anytime, should be superseded by some scheme that would provide for a permanent settlement of this vexed problem. As a preliminary it brought forward a measure to discontinue the payments under the Surplus Revenue Act as from 30th June, 1927. That measure also provided for special grants on the capitation basis, for the year 1927-28, subject to any agreement that might be entered into between the Commonwealth and the States. When that measure was brought down the </para>

Parliament approved of the bill in March, 1927, and thus made the way clear for an open conference. Shortly afterwards a conference was held at which the Commonwealth placed before .the States further proposals which aimed at a settlement through the transfer of State debts.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE.No; a section authorizing such 7an agreement will be embodied in the Constitution if the people so approve. ' The agreement contains certain provisions which will apply during the temporary period of two years from 1st July, 1927 to 30th June, 1929. These provisions which are set out in Part II., briefly stated, provide that the Commonwealth shall pay to the States, towards interest on debts, £7,584,912 and 5 per cent, interest on the value of the transferred properties instead of 3^ per cent. They also provide for sinking fund contributions to be payable as from 1st July, 1927, except in the case qf New South Wales which State will commence its contributions on 1st July, 1928. </para>
          <para>The agreement will involve a substantially increased burden on the Commonwealth revenue as compared with the payments provided for under the States Grants Act, 1927. This additional charge mainly arises from the sinking fund contributions which the Commonwealth will make for the redemption of existing States debts. As the people of Australia generally will reap the advantages of co-ordinated borrowing and the establishment of sinking funds, it is felt that, the Commonwealth is justified in making an immediate and substantial contribution from its revenues to secure those advantages. In the year 1927-28 the financial position will be as follows : - </para>

          <para>The following table sets out in detail the amounts that will be received by each State'. </para>
          <para class="block">It will be noted that under the agreement every State will gain a substantial benefit. </para>
          <para>I invite honorable senators to turn to the agreement while I explain briefly some of its chief features. It is divided into four parts, namely : - Part I., general provisions; Part II., temporary provisions; Part III., permanent provisions; and Part IV., miscellaneous provisions. The most important provision of Part I. relates to the constitution and powers of the Loan Council. A voluntary Loan Council has been in operation since 1924. Up till then there was cut-throat competition between the States, and during the financial stringency in 1923 interest rates reached 6 per cent, in respect of loans free of Commonwealth and State income tax. The Loan Council has since secured co-ordination in both the Australian market and the overseas market. Each State was free to withdraw from the Council at any time, and unfortunately New South Wales did so. That action to some extent minimized the benefits of the Council; nevertheless the results exceeded anticipation and made the States realize that they had nothing to fear from a permanently constituted Loan Council. The agreement provides that there shall be on the Loan Council one representative of the Commonwealth and one representative of each State. Where a vote is necessary each State representative will have one vote and the Commonwealth representative two votes and a. casting vote. One of the most important questions to be decided by the </para>
          <para class="block">Loan Council will be the amount of money that can be borrowed at reasonable rates and under reasonable conditions. The decision of this question will really not be difficult, since it will be governed by the state of the money market. In times of stringency, if it is found that the total programmes of the Commonwealth and the States exceed the amount which, in the opinion of the Loan Council, is available in the market at reasonable rates and conditions, the agreement prescribes the method of apportionment of the reduced amount amongst the various governments. If the decision of the Loan Council is unanimous, the allocation of the money available will be in accord with that decision. If, on the other hand, the Loan Council fails to reach a unanimous decision the Commonwealth will be entitled to have allocated to it not more than one-fifth of the reduced amount, and the States will be entitled to share the balance in proportion to their net loan expenditure during the preceding five years. Each Government will thus receive an equitable share of any reduced sum which may be borrowed, and competition will be avoided. This arrangement will also prevent an undue inflation of the "loan estimates of any particular State in the hope that even if a reduction is made in the amount asked for the State concerned will obtain sufficient for its actual requirements. Broadly speaking, the Commonwealth is to arrange all borrowing subject to the Loan Council. There is, however,' power in the agreement for a State  to borrow money outside Australia in its own name, subject ' to the unanimous consent of the Loan Council. This amendment of the original agreement was made at the suggestion of the States themselves, because it was pointed out that some of them had established a certain goodwill in the London money market or elsewhere, and that by the withdrawal of the right to issue a loan in the name of a particular State the benefit of that goodwill would be lost. </para>

' In the event of the Constitution amendment not becoming law, and of the agreement not being validated on or before the 30th June, 1929, provision is made for the States to reap the benefit of all sinking fund contributions made by the Commonwealth during the temporary period of two years. </para>
          <para>The provisions of Part III. of the agreement will not come into force unless, before the 1st July, 1929, the Constitution has been altered and the Commonwealth Parliament has passed a law validating the agreement. Subject to this procedure, the Commonwealth will take over the debts of the States as at the 1st July, 1929, and will assume the liabilities of the States to the bond-holders. Further provisions under this part include a payment by the Commonwealth of a fixed contribution towards interest charges for 58 years, amounting to £7,584,912; the establishment of sinking funds with joint contributions by the Commonwealth and the States ; the settlement of the transferred properties question by the Commonwealth relieving 'the States of all liability in respect of debts bearing interest at 5 per cent., equivalent to the agreed value of the properties, totalling £10,924,323. The sinking funds to be provided will be controlled by the National Debt Commission, which will regularly apply all money paid into the fund to the re-purchase or redemption of the debts of each State. In the same way the National Debt Commission will immediately cancel all securities as they come into its hands, and thereafter during the prescribed sinking fund period, the States concerned will pay to the Sinking Fund Commission an amount equal to 4£ per cent, per annum on the cancelled debt. The sinking fund will thus receive the ' benefit of compound interest at the rate of 4-J per cent, on the prescribed contributions. The annual contribution by the Commonwealth to the sinking fund on debts at the 30th June, 1927, will be £801,680. The annual payment in respect of new debts will be determined by the amount of new borrowing. </para>

          <para>The benefiits of this agreement cannot be over-stated. It makes the way clear for a permanent and satisfactory settlement of a problem that has hitherto proved impossible of achievement. It safeguards the position of State finances, as it ensures definite Commonwealth assistance on a satisfactory basis, and the States will no longer be dependent on the will of the Commonwealth Parliament. It provides for the giving of immediate relief to the finances of the States. It provides also for the economic management of debt and borrowing operations, and entirely eliminates any danger of cut-throat competition in the future. Above all, it will result in the enhancement of Australia's credit, and thus substantial savings of interest will ultimately be secured to the peoplp through the issue of new conversion loans on better terms than would be possible in the absence of co-ordinated debt management and adequate sinking fund provisions. To those who may cavil at that statement, I commend the position which is enjoyed by New Zealand and Canada, two sister dominions, whose assets and potentialities cannot be said to be better than ours, but whose securities are regarded more favorably than ours on the English and American money markets, because they have constituted one financial authority which speaks for the whole of the dominion. </para>

          <para>That the bill be recommitted for the reconsideration of Item 152. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">At the conclusion of the vote which was taken on another item, honorable senators had not properly settled in their places when item 152, relating to iron and steel tubes or pipes was declared by the  chairman  to be carried.  His  voice, generally, carries fairly well; but, as ' honorable senators are aware, the acoustics of this chamber are defective, and it is difficult to hear what is being said. At least two honorable senators, of whom I am one, did not hear the  Chairman  put this item ; but as soon as we realized what had been done, we endeavoured to have the matter reopened. The  Chairman,  however, ruled against us. I have received protests from the Stock-owners' Association of South Australia, whose members are affected materially by this duty, and I wish to obtain information from the Government in relation to it. If the explanation is not satisfactory, I shall endeavour to secure a reduction of the proposed duty. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman's</inline> recollection of what took place in committee is different from mine. After a vote had been taken on one item a number of other items were passed without debate before that which deals with steel pipes was put from the Chair. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> missed his opportunity to discuss it, that was his own fault. If we agree to the schedule being committed for the consideration of this item, we cannot reasonably decline to recommit it for the further consideration of any other item. I do not consider that the honorable senator has made out a good case. The discussion, if allowed, may develop into one embracing the whole of the iron and steel duties. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> will not persist with his amendment; but, if he does, I hope that he will not receive the support of other honorable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> should have informed me of his intention to move for the recommittal of this item, but he did not do so. He said that he wished to have an opportunity of referring to it again, but he did not intimate that he desired to go beyond that. </para>

          <para>. -  The Minister has made out a very weak case. The recommittal of an item or a clause is nothing new in parliamentary procedure. During the discussion of the various items in the schedule the Minister gained a number of victories. He did so in connexion with this item. If the reasons for the higher duties were sound when they were agreed to they should be sound still. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman's</inline> motion because I believe that it is our duty to give every opportunity for a full discussion of each item; We should never close the door to a further review of a subject so long as the subject warrants it. It is true that some of the items were passed - shall I say expeditiously - but that is all the stronger reason why a further discussion should now take place if the circumstances warrant it. The Minister's opposition to the motion can only be actuated by a desire to stifle discussion. The Senate should not stand for such a policy. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> fails to make out a good case he, no doubt, will also fail in his desire to lower the duties ; but I think he is entitled to express his views. </para>

          <para>.- I was waiting for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> to advance reasons why the bill should be recommitted. He did not do so. He merely asked the Minister for an explanation, and said that if it was not satisfactory to him he would move that  the duties be reduced Until we hear the ground for his motion we are -not in a position to judge whether it should be agreed to. If the honorable senator had given his reasons I might have been prepared to support him. Unfortunately, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> having spoken, cannot speak again other 'than to close the debate. I shall therefore have to wait until he speaks again before I can decide, what attitude I shall adopt towards his motion. </para>

I understand that the evidence he has to-day is what he had when the item was 'before the committee, and the only reason he has advanced for the recommittal  of  the item is that it was put through the committee too hastily.

          <para>. -  This is the first time I have heard such heated objection to the recommittal of a bill or any part of a bill for a special purpose. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> had sought to have the whole schedule recommitted, there might have been some reason for objection. I notice that most of the opposition comes from honorable senators whose States have benefited by the tariff. This is not an effort on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> to reverse a decision already arrived at, because, in committee there was no discussion of item 152. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> was anxious to move a request but was not given the opportunity to do so - my recollection of what happened is the same as his - and in the circumstances it is only a matter of courtesy to an honorable senator in the predicament of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> to extend to him the privilege of saying what he wished to say, but missed the opportunity of saying, when the schedule was originally under discussion. If the Senate agrees to recommit the bill in the terms of this motion it will be for the purpose of discussing item 152 alone. I do not think it would be very long under discussion, and of course the result would be fairly well assured. </para>

          <para>.  - I draw the attention of honorable senators to the deferred duties on iron and steel tubes or pipes, which show increases of from27½ per cent, to 40 per cent. British, 35per cent, to 55 per cent, intermediate, and 40 per cent, to 60 per cent, general. Very little information has been given to us in regard to these increases which will have a vital effect on many industries. The Tariff Board, in its report on the iron and steel industry, devotes only one page to pipes and tubes. I understand that the board met in conference the managing director of the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited, and two accredited representatives of Stewart and Lloyd, of the United Kingdom, who, in conjunction with the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited, are prepared to commence at Newcastle the industry of making iron and steel tubes and pipes. The Tariff Board simply compares the high wages paid in Australia with those paid in Great Britain, and points out that the new industry, when established, will employ about 1,000 workers. The information supplied is, in my opinion, altogether too meagre when we realize how the proposed duties are likely to affect other industries. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I believe that the Tariff Board recommended duties a little higher than those proposed by the Government. I shall not dwell upon the effect the new duties will have on home building and municipal undertakings, we have had sufficient talk about the effect the increased timber duties will have in those directions-but shall speak more particularly of the effect they are likely to have on the agricultural and pastoral industries and, incidentally, upon workers in the cities. There are small farmers in the new Mallee areas who are on the bread line. They could not exist by working only eight hours a day. These duties will place a further burden on them, and if they are driven out of the business of wheat-growing, the harm done to city and country businesses and the employees will be far greater than the good that will be brought about by the establishment of this new industry of making iron or steel tubes or pipes. If men on the better class agricultural land have these added burdens placed on them they will simply turn their attention to raising sheep, in which very little labour is required; whereas if the better class land is utilized for farming considerable employment is given in the cities. "Workers get lucrative employment in making superphosphates and machinery, and considerable employment is given on the railways, which are required to convey fertilizers and produce. Many other industries indirectly benefit very materially from farming operations. If the farmers are driven to take up pastoral pursuits, they will not feel the effect of it; they will probably do as well out of sheep as at farming; but the city industries will suffer. Let me now examine the effect the duties are likely to have on those engaged in pastoral pursuits. Sheep cannot walk more than a few miles to water in hot weather. The pastoralists have overcome this difficulty by conveying water in pipes long distances across their holdings. The gentleman who represented Flinders in the South Australian Legislative Assembly, has sunk wells and run water out by pipes for 10 and 20 miles in either direction. In that way he has increased the carrying capacity of his country many times over, and he has thus provided a great deal of employment for workers in the city. "We should think twice before we put on the extra duties. I know I shall be told that this increase is " only a little one " which will not hurt anybody. The position reminds me of what happens very often when a couple of heavy drinkers go into an hotel for a "spot." It is "only  a little one;" but they have one and then another, and another. Eventually they get to the stage of intoxication, at which they join in singing "Another little drink won't do us any harm." And so they go on. We, in our tariff debates, have now reached the stage in this economic debauch when the Minister tries to justify increases of duties by saying "Another little one will not do us any harm," but we must look at the total effect. In  1925-26,  the pastoral and dairying industry of Australia exported  £89,000,000  worth of produce and the agricultural industry  £33,000,000  worth. Surely those are industries that should be carefully guarded. I am quite aware that the industry of making iron and steel pipes and tubes is a new one, but already we have had to give increased protection to established industries because of the increases of wages that have been brought about by increasing duties in other directions. First we increase duties on the recommendation of the Tariff Board, then we have the Arbitration Court awarding higher wages, and next we have further increases of duties. And so a vicious circle is set up. The Tariff Board has warned us that unless we are careful, this country will meet with economic disaster. Not satisfied with protecting established industries, they are asking for additional protection in order to start a new industry. What will be the position? We should watch the ultimate effect of these and other duties upon industry generally. I trust the Minister will give the committee further information. If he does not satisfy me that the higher duties are justified, I intend to submit a request that the. . original deferred duties of  27½  per cent. British,  35  per cent, intermediate, and  40  per cent, general, be restored. </para>

It has been stated during the tariff debate that another very strong combination has been formed to erect works at Port Kembla, and included in their activities will be the manufacture of iron and steel pipes. The latest figures available in regard  to  importations show that  47,000  tons  of  pipes were imported during  1926-27, of  which quantity  41,000  tons came from Great Britain. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and  the  demand for an additional  100,000  tons  of  pig iron annually will substantially  assist  the iron smelting industry. The increase in output should enable the manufacturers to reduce the prices of other articles they are producing. Now that Hoskins  Limited  have announced their intention to manufacture this class of pipe, there should be wholesome competition between Stewart and Lloyds and Hoskins Limited, and there should be no danger of pipe users being charged more than a reasonable price. Honorable senators have  observed  that these are deferred duties which will not come into operation until the Tariff Board has reported that the Australian manufacturers are in a position to produce iron and steel pipes  of  good quality in reasonable quantities. The Minister for Trade and Customs will see that the manufacturers do not charge exorbitant prices. The increase in prices which may follow cannot be so great  as  to substantially affect the man on  the  land. Although we are dealing only  with  this item, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> discussed the effect of the tariff generally upon settlers on the land. I do not know what would be the position of the man .on the land if it were not for the home market which our secondary industries provide. </para>

          <para>. -  I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> was right when he said that this item was agreed to in a somewhat hurried fashion, because there are a number of points in connexion with these proposed duties which have not been ventilated. For instance, the Tariff Board in effect informed the applicants for increased duties that they did not know their own business. The applicants said that they were asking for a duty equal to 50 per cent., but the Tariff Board in its report said that they had understated their case, and proceeded to recommend duties of 50 per cent. British, 60 per cent, intermediate, and 75 per cent, general. It is quite clear that the board would have awarded even higher duties. I emphasize the point that I do not think it is within the functions of the Tariff Board to tell any applicant for increased duties that he is understating his case. According to the reports of the inquiry, no representative of the users of iron pipes was examined. The only witnesses were those who wanted increased duties. They were interested parties, and the Tariff Board came to a decision on <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> evidence. To appreciate the absurdity of these increased rates one has only to refer to page 40 of the report, where it will be seen that -the board- stated that without a subsidy from another industry or very exceptional preferences over and above the tariff Hoskins Limited could not carry on the manufacture of iron and steel pipes in Australia except at a .loss. I characterize that statement as the height of absurdity. That portion of the board's report is not in accordance with facts. What is the history of the company? I recall what was said years ago by a representative of that firm, who stayed in the galleries until the last item of the tariff affecting iron and steel duties was passed by Parliament. That gentleman and his representatives led us to believe that the industry was an unpayable one, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> died a multi-millionaire. Now the Tariff Board tells us that without a subsidy iron cannot be profitably manufactured in Australia by that firm.. Honorable senators will remember the progress the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> made in his business, how he eventually became a mighty iron master, and made millions of money in this country. Any one standing on the top of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney can see a twelve-storey building owned by Hoskins Limited which was constructed out of the profits of an industry which the Tariff Board says could not be profitably conducted without a subsidy. These are facts which cannot be successfully challenged.. The Tariff Board was not justified in making that statement. The business record of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoskins</inline> proved conclusively that he had made an immense fortune out of the iron and steel industry in this country. Why should we, by means of tariff protection, assist others to become millionaires? Let us reach finality in this matter. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> will submit his request to another place to reduce the duty, so as to make it possible for  the farmers and pioneers in our out-back country, where the rainfall is scanty, to obtain iron water pipes at a reasonable price, thus making those  areas habitable and, perhaps, profitable. To farmers in such locations water is the first essential. </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator, and having had experience of our arid areas, I can speak with, authority. We all know what the Kalgoorlie water scheme, promoted by the late Lord Forrest, meant to the people in the gold-field areas of Western Australia during the early period, and what it means to them to-day. It brought happiness and civilization to thousands of people who, till then, were suffering great privations. Under this item the Government proposes to give an additional protection of 50 per cent. British preferential to the manufacturers of iron pipes. It is about time we took stock of our position. I feel sure that no honorable senator would willingly load the scales in favour of a small section in this community, at the expense of the majority of the people who already are groaning under a heavy load of taxation. We have had a similar experience in connexion with the manufacture of harvesters in Australia. Unfortunately, the firm engaged in that business succeeded in convincing successive governments that, without high protective duties, it could not carry on. Again, the high duties sanctioned by Parliament help manufacturers to become millionaires in far less than the span of an ordinary lifetime. Why should not the unfortunate consumer - the primary producer - get a hearing? It is important to bear in mind also that the applicants made a request for duties of 30s. British, 40s. intermediate, and 50s. a ton in the general tariff on the importations of pig iron, and the board recommended duties of 30s. British, 40s. intermediate and 65s. in the general tariff - actually more in the general tariff than had been asked for. How foolish a person would be if- he insisted upon paying a shopkeeper 15s. for an article which was priced for retail at 10s., or if he insisted upon giving his tailor £9 for a suit of clothes priced at £8. Obviously the Tariff Board considered that the request for increased duties on pig iron was altogether too moderate, and, in effect, said to the applicants': - "You are asking too little. We intend to give you more than you are asking for, because we believe that you do not know your own business." Surely honorable senators will do something to put this matter right. Why do not we tell the board that it is not discharging its duties efficiently? </para>

          <para>. - I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> did not submit a request for  a  reduction in the duties on this item.  If  the honorable senator does move in that direction, he will have my support. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that in the framing of these duties the interests  of  the consumer have been entirely overlooked. People settled in. the agricultural areas of Western Australia are obliged to make provision for the conservation of water, otherwise they run the' risk of failure. The Government of that State is committed to an extensive scheme of water conservation, and accordingly it must purchase large supplies of iron pipes for the delivery of water to the various outlying areas. If these higher duties are agreed to the primary producer will again be penalized in the interests of the local manufacturers, because the State Government will be obliged to pay higher prices for the pipes and the farmers who purchase from the Government on long terms, will be called upon to meet additional capital expenditure, together with interest. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> has assured us that these increased duties will not mean an increase in the price of iron pipes. I have never yet known manufacturers to reduce the price of their output following the imposition of protective duties. If, as the Minister has suggested, the iron and steel manufacturers wish to sell pipes more cheaply than at present, why did they make a request for higher protective duties? I feel certain that they know their own business well and, unfortunately, they know what this Senate will do in the matter of increased duties. They know that these added duties will be agreed to so as to make it possible. for them to enjoy higher profits. If an industry cannot carry on with a protection of 40 per cent.,- it should not be encouraged. </para>

            <para>- Over and over again in the past representatives  of  various Labour organizations  have declared  that if an industry is not able  to  provide fair wages and employment under reasonable conditions, it should not be encouraged. As a matter of fact, with the exception of the wheat and wool production, no industry in Australia is in that favorable position. All have, at times, appealed to Parliament for protection, and in doing so have admitted that without assistance they would go to the wall. Those connected with secondary industries know that if they approach Parliament for protection, they will get a sympathetic hearing and be given all the assistance they ask for. In many instances the assistance is given without consideration of the effect which the duties will have on the people generally. It is the business of every Government, and I think this Government recognizes it, to hold the scales as evenly as possible between, the different sections in the community. I regret, however, that by its action in connexion with these duties, the Government is not observing its obligations. Every vessel that leaves Fremantle for the north-west coast ports of Western Australia is heavily laden with, iron pipes for water conservation purposes, because without such facilities it is impossible to occupy the pastoral areas profitably. If the owner of a run is lucky enough on putting down a well on his property to discover a good supply of water he considers it a better proposition to lay pipes to distant parts of his run for the watering of his stock than to incur the expense of searching for other supplies which, when located, might prove to be indifferent. It is important, therefore, that these water pipes should be available at a reasonable price, in order that the stock-carrying capacity of our pastoral areas may be increased. We heard a good  deal during the debate yesterday about the value of the rabbit industry to Australia. I venture to say that all the revenue that might be received from rabbits and rabbit skins for countless years would never-:recoup the people of Australia the loss' which they have incurred owing to the pest. The pastoral industry is much more valuable to Australia, and I appeal to honorable senators not to impose further taxation upon it in the form of these increased duties. I sincerely hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

            <para>- In my State there are some who have done pretty well. I have in mind, however, the position of the unfortunate, struggling farmers in areas remote from centres of civilization. The Government of South Australia has laid hundreds of miles of iron piping for the reticulation of country farming districts. The water in some cases has to be carried 70 or 80 miles. We are only asking that the farmer and the pastoralist shall not be burdened with the extra cost of the proposed duties. The pastoralist may be wealthy in one year, but a drought in the following year will knock him flat. We never hear of iron foundries being in that unenviable position. The Broken Hill Proprietary Limited is not a benevolent or a charitable institution; it is out for every penny it can get. How much more protection do we want than that which is afforded by 12,000 miles of sea? I hope that the Committee will support a reduction of the proposed duties. </para>

          <para>. -  I had not concluded my remarks when my time expired, but the only observation I now wish to make is that on more than one occasion the Tariff Board has gone out of its way to recommend higher rates of duty than those which have been sought. Rolled iron or steel teams are a case in point. The applicants asked for 88s., 115s., and 130s., but the board recommended 88s., 115s., and  200s. The makers of iron and steel tubes or pipes asked for 35 per cent., 45 per cent., and 55 per cent. The Tariff Board in effect told them that they had asked for too little, and recommended that they be granted duties of 50 per cent., 60 per cent., and 75 per cent. The board may be likened to a mock court; it hears what the applicants have to say, and then tells them that they do not know their own business, and are too modest in their requests. It even puts words into their mouths. If the proposed duties in this case needed anything to damn 'them in the minds of reasonable beings, it would be furnished by the action of the board. It is supposed to be the eyes and the ears of Parliament, but has failed to fulfil that requirement. Do honorable senators intend to endorse such behaviour as that to which I have referred? We would be recreant to our trust, faithless to the people who sent us here, and oblivious to the welfare of this country, if we allowed that conduct to continue. It is part and parcel of the insane policy of raising duties sky high. Has any honorable senator heard of a case where a seeker for a reduction of duty got less than he asked for? I have not. This makes one think that the Tariff Board is failing in its duty. The inevitable result is that primary pursuits will be brought to a state of stagnation. Our primary producers are fortified at present by a combination of fair seasons and good prices ; but, when prices revert to the pre-war level and adverse seasons are experienced, they will not be able to meet the demands made upon them by reason of the high duties which are imposed upon their requirements. The Tariff Board has entirely misconceived its functions. . It has no warrant to tell any applicant that the rate of duty asked for is too low: and this Parliament has no right to endorse such behaviour. We should deal with this question along rational lines. If applicants ask for duties of 35 per cent., 40 per cent., and 50 per cent., we should take them at their word and give them no more. The duties proposed by the schedule are nothing less than outrageous. </para>

      <para>This  bill covers two provisions  of  the excise tariff.  It  deals with spirits for the manufacture  of  scents, toilet preparations and essences, and the repealing  of  the excise duty  on  starch made from imported  rice. In regard to spirits it is proposed to add the words " and essences " after the word " preparation." This amendment is proposed in order that Australian manufacturers of fruit essences may be placed on the same footing as are manufacturers of scents and toilet preparations. It will bring the item into line with the departmental practice. As honorable senators are aware, the duty on imported rice has been increased. Prior to the date of the increase, Australian manufacturers of starch from imported rice obtained their supplies of rice free of duty, but had to pay an excise duty of1d. per pound on their product. Now that rice is dutiable, it is not considered equitable that they should have to pay an excise duty. Provision is therefore made in the bill for the repeal of the excise duty on starch made fromm imported rice. This will mean that any Australian manufacturer of starch from rice will have to obtain his supplies from an Australian source or pay duty on his raw material if it is imported. </para>

        <para class="block">Honorable senators will probably remember that before the Customs Tariff Bill which the Senate has just passed was introduced into another place, three different tariff schedules were introduced. On the 11th August, 1926, proposals affecting the duties on iron and steel were brought forward; on the 23rd March, 1927, the duties on rice were increased, while, on the 28th September, 1927, increased duties were imposed on chassis, the revenue derivable therefrom to be used to assist the States in the construction of roads. Later, those three schedules were merged into the Customs Tariff Bill, with which we have just dealt. This bill provides for the validation of the collection of the duties of customs contained in the tariff schedules referred to. </para>

              <para>- I should not favour the payment of a subsidy to the company, even to get messages sent at a cheap rate. It would be better for the Government to undertake the work. Government control of wireless would mean that wireless communications would be governed in the interests of every section of the community. I understand that the motion relates only to the transmission of wireless messages from Australia overseas. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> that the more popular we can make these messages the more closely shall we be in touch with our kinsmen in other lands. To my mind it would hasten the bringing about of what I might call an ideal Empire wireless chain, annihilating the vast distances that separate the nations of the British Commonwealth of Nations. If, therefore, for no other purpose than the sentimental one of uniting the Empire, the Senate would be justified, not only in agreeing to the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> but also  in going further and seeing that it is put into practical effect. Quite recently we had a very keen debate on the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth Government and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. On that occasion every honorable senator who spoke admitted the great and important part that wireless was playing, not only i'i Empire, but also in international matters, and several attempted to visualize the still more wondrous results that would flow from its further development. Looking at the matter from every stand-point, not forgetting that of defence, I am under the impression that it would be better in every way to have Id. a word wireless messages instead of the charges now imposed. I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has kept aloft the beacon he carried many years ago in regard to the control of public utilities and that he has not forgotten his association with the Labour party. He has already said that every Thursday his then colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> was accustomed to- move for the nationalization of something. I hope that honorable senators -sitting alongside <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> will see the reasonableness of his request and the advantage to be derived from giving effect to it. There is something in' the old saying that there are none so blind as those who will not see. I believe that there are honorable senators supporting the Government who, while agreeing to the principle set out in the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> may not be willing to put it into effect. I. am not a Biblical scholar, but on this occasion I ma'y be pardoned for quoting the words of the Saviour, in his parable of the sowers - </para>

          <para class="block">After listening to the excellent address delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> ]t" am. with all due reverence, compelled to class him among those whose ears are dull of hearing, and who shut their eyes, lest at any time they may hear or see something that their hearts will understand and that may convert them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> pointed out the vast difference in the cost of establishing and maintaining wireless stations as against that of establishing and maintaining telegraph stations. The. disparity is considerable. I agree with the honorable senator that just as the Government of the day in Australia controls telephonic and telegraphic communications so it should control wireless telegraphy and wireless telephony. The Government of Great Britain, which is in no sense a Liberal administration, is in full control of wireless telegraphy through its Postmaster-General. In Australia we have a very cheap telegraphic system, because of Government control, and for that reason if for no other we should seriously consider any proposal to establish government control over wireless charges. In his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> the Honorary Munster apologized for the charges i made by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. One would imagine "from the figures he quoted that the company had suddenly developed a philanthropic conscience and was conferring the benefit of cheap rates on the people of Australia. It has certainly done good work in Australia by pioneering wireless; but it has been well paid for what it has done. It has not been altogether free from blame in certain respects. When the royal commission was inquiring into wireless telegraphy, it was shown in evidence that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited was not all that it -was supposed to be. The commission in one part of its report said - . ,  </para>
          <para>The evidence disclosed that the operations of this company extended over every field of radio, and in almost . every instance have created friction and dissatisfaction. </para>
          <para class="block">Despite the report of that royal commission, the Commonwealth Government has entered into another agreement with this company. The Honorary Minister told us the other night that Australia should be proud of the company. I am not here to pay any homage to it, or to bestow fulsome flattery upon it. Nor am I here to attack it, and I do not propose to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> asked us not to bring within the ambit of our discussion the reasonableness or otherwise of the company's charges. But if the charges imposed are not excessive, what has the Government and the company to fear? The company is no philanthropic institution.  It  is run in the interests of its shareholders. It is out for big business. Like all companies, it wants to make profits and pay dividends. I do not blame it for doing so. But that is just the. difference between a public utility controlled by a company and one that is controlled by the Government in the interests of the community. Wireless is a matter that in time of  Avar  should be controlled by the duly elected representatives of the people. And even in times of peace it should be controlled by the Government, so that the charges made for the service rendered may place it within the reach of all. Dealing with this aspect of the question, the royal commission said - </para>

          <para class="block">That is another difference between a public utility, Government-controlled, and one which is managed by a private concern. What would have happened if a private company had been in charge of Australia's telegraphic service? At present, we have the most up to date and cheapest telegraphic system in the world. A private company could not have done what the Government has done in extending telegraphic and telephonic facilities in every direction, nor have taken the risks that the Government has taken ; and I venture to say that the rates charged by it would have been infinitely higher than they are under Government control. Despite our heavy cost of construction and maintenance in Australia, we have a telegraphic system second to none in the world, and the cost of sending messages to any part of Australia does not exceed Id. a word. A private company would not have given us that service. As the distance extended from 50 miles to 100 miles, so would the cost of messages have been increased. If our telegraphic system were under the control of a private company, we should probably have to pay 3d. a word for telegraphic messages. </para>

              <para>- Yes ;. and if our telegraphic system were in the hands of private enterprise the people would possibly be exploited to the same extent. Portions of the speech of the Honorary Minister suggested that he was somewhat favorable to the proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> as he stated that 43 per cent, of the total beam traffic was handled at 1 5/8d. and 25 per cent, at 2d. a word. As the people are taking full advantage of these rates it appears to me that, if the rate were lowered to Id. per word the volume of business would increase tremendously. The Honorary Minister further stated that over 68 per cent, of the messages transmitted by the beam ' system were paid for at less than 2d. a word, and that the present inwards and outwards traffic between the United Kingdom and Australia totalled about 13,000,000 words a year. If that number of words are despatched at the existing rates we can readily imagine the great increase In traffic which would follow a reduction to Id. a word. </para>

              <para>- If the rate were reduced t.o1d. a word, a large number of what I may term social or domestic messages would pass between Australia and Great Britain. If persons living in Australia could send wireless messages to England, Scotland, and Ireland at the cost of1d. a word, instead of sending letters in the ordinary course and having to wait over two months for a reply, the increase in the volume of traffic would he most pronounced. The Honorary Minister said he felt sure the company would seize every opportunity to advance its interests and to secure as much business as possible. It would be foolish if it did not, particularly as it is a business concern anxious to obtain all it can for its shareholders. He also said - </para>

          <para>SenatorNEEDHAM. - Yes, it owns a majority of the shares and has representatives on the board of directors; but I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would not favour dual control of our telegraphic and telephonic system. The representation of the Government on the board does not dispose of the fact that the service would be more effectively conducted by the Government. The Bri tishGovernment, which controls wireless services in Great Britain, has not yet instituted a ld.-a-word service ; but that Government, conservative as it is, may yet reduce its rate to a more reasonable figure. The wireless system, under government control, even with slightly higher rates, would be preferable to private control at1d. a word. Although it has been said that the company is. desirous of reducing the charges to the public, I have not as yet seen any indication Of that desire. The Honorary Minister, who did not devote sufficient time to the value of a wireless service from a defence view-point, said that a conference sitting in London was dealing with that phase of the question. Even if no other arguments could be adduced in favour of governmental control, the value of such a service to the nation for defence purposes should bc sufficiently, apparent to influence the Government to bring about a change. If, unfortunately, we should again be plunged into the horrors of war, the Government would not hesitate to assume control of wireless. If we cannot depend on private enterprise in a crisis, we should not depend upon the service it renders in times of peace. We. were also informed. that the wireless and cable companies were considering amalgamation, and this was given as one reason why the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> should be opposed. I believe that immediately amalgamation was proposed, . the shares of one of the cable companies increased in price to 70s. The suggested amalgamation was only a move on the part of certain interests to  increase the price of shares. In conclusion, I repeat that the Government should assume control of wireless at the earliest possible moment, and then reduce the charge for the transmission of messages to1d. a word. I do not think that there is much likelihood of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas's</inline> ambitions being realized whilst the service is under the control of private enterprise ; but I believe that when the people of Australia have had an opportunity to express their opinions of ' the present administration they will return a government which will negotiate for the control Of this essential service. I am fully convinced of the necessity and practicability of the claim submitted by' the mover of the motion, and I trust that we shall soon have a wireless service between the United Kingdom and Australia controlled and operated by the Government, in the interests of not only the Commonwealth, but the Empire as a whole. I support the motion. </para>
