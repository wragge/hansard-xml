          <para>The Wine Bounty Act of 1924 provided for a bounty of 4s. per gallon &#34;on fortified wine exported from the Commonwealth. Through the bounty a large trade was opened up in Great Britain for our fortified wines. In April, 1927, after the whole question of wine bounty had been thoroughly investigated, the Minister for Trade and Customs introduced a measure for the amendment of the act providing that the bounty should be ls. 9d. per gallon, together with the payment of ls. 3d. per gallon drawback of duty paid on fortifying spirits contained in the wine. This made a total payment of 3s. per gallon to exporters. When this reduction was made, the Minister made it clear that the Government reserved the right to re-open the question of bounty payment in the- event of the British Government giving increased preference for Empire wines&#39;. The exact words used by the <inline font-style="italic">Minister</inline> on that occasion were as follows: - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is to be distinctly understood that ii, during the term of the bounty, the British Government gives additional preference to Australian sweet wines, the Government reserves the right to submit to this House thai the bounty now proposed be reduced by the amount of the additional preference given. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>At that time the British preference, on paper, was 4s. per gallon. The actual preference, however, was only 6d. per gallon, because our fortified wines of a strength of 34 per cent, of proof spirit which paid, duty at the rate of 2s. per gallon were in competition with foreign wines at a strength of 29 per cent, dutiable at the -rate of 2s. 6d. per gallon. About one month after the bounty was reduced to ls. 9d., plus ls. 3d. drawback, the British budget was introduced which gave a much higher preference to Empire wines. Tha duty on the foreign wines against which we competed was fixed at 8s. per gallon, and the duty on Empire wines at 4s. per gallon. This gave Empire wines of this description an effective preference of 4s. <inline font-style="italic">per</inline> gallon, as against 6d. when the reduction in the bounty took place. The Government would have been justified in introducing a measure to provide for a further&#39; decrease as soon as the increased </para>
          <para class="block">British wine preference duties came into force. However, it was considered that it would be more satisfactory to postpone such action until there was no doubt as to the effectiveness of the new preference. During the twelve months that have elapsed, attempts have been made by British importers of foreign wines to reduce the effectiveness of the British preference by importing low-strength foreign wines at the lower rate of duty, and blending them with foreign wines of a high strength at the higher rate of duty. Though this has been attempted, the resulting blends have not been very successful, and have not done much damage to our trade in fortified wines. The Government has closely watched the position, and, after close investigation, has decided that the proposed reduction is justifiable. . </para>
          <para>The Government has taken into consideration the question of contracts made by wine exporters prior to 8th March, when the present reduction was introduced. It has concluded that these contracts should be honored, and has provided that, where the Minister is satisfied that contracts were properly entered into before that date and that they are still existing, the reduced rate shall not apply. Wines shipped according to these contracts will be entitled to1s. 9d. per gallon bounty. The quantity of wine sold under the contracts alluded to is about 570,000 gallons. Some wine exporters gave notice of intention to export wine just prior to the 9th March and their wine was either on its way to the ship or was on the wharf ready to be shipped. In some cases, the wine was actually on the ship. These wines left the Commonwealth after the reduction in the bounty was announced. It was considered fair and reasonable to allow bounty on these wines at1s. 9d. per gallon. The quantity involved is approximately 48,500 gallons. A trade with Canada is being established for our sweet fortified wines and there is promise of a big increase. As there are no effective preference duties there for our wines as against foreign wines, it has been decided to allow fortified wines shipped to Canada to enjoy the old rate of1s. 9d. per gallon. The bill is recommended to the Senate as a carefully studied measure, the. Government being sure that the suggested reduction to1s., plus1s. 3d. drawback of the duty paid on the fortifying spirit used in the wine, is quite sufficient assistance to further develop the wine export trade. </para>

        <para>The bill was framed in order to meet the wishes of the Governments of the States in which dried fruits are produced, and of the industry generally. Its main object is to provide that no grower shall receive more than a fair share of the advantages and disadvantages in regard to the sale of his dried fruits within the Commonwealth and overseas. It frequently happens that the overseas market is unprofitable, whereas the fixed prices in Australia enable the grower to receive a satisfactory return in respect of the proportion of his fruit marketed in this country. Without some measure of control, it would be possible for some growers to take advantage of the better Australian market to the detriment of others, who would be compelled to export overseas more than a. fair share of their fruit. In 1924 growers decided by a very large majority at a poll taken throughout the Commonwealth in favour of a measure passed by Parliament for the establishment of an export control board. The function of this board is to lay down a general marketing policy in respect of the sale of dried fruits overseas. It has no power to determine the proportion of fruit which must be marketed in Australia or sold abroad. The Governments of Victoria and South Australia, which are vitally interested in this industry, passed legislation later in the same year, and more recently the Governments of New South Wales and Western Australia passed similar legislation to enable boards to be established in those States. The function of these boards was to determine the proportion of fruit which must be exported, and in each State the growers by a substantial majority affirmed the principle of the establishment of State boards  in order that the industry might become properly organized. Little or no difficulty was experienced by the State boards in regard to the fixation of the export quotas until some months ago, when the Government of South Australia was involved in litigation which sought to defeat the system of legislative control in force in all the dried fruit-producing States. The South Australian board, acting under its legislative powers, compulsorily acquired a quantity of fruit held by a packer and dealer which he had failed to export in accordance with the determination of the board. It was held by the High Court that the Dried Fruits Act of South Australia was unconstitutional in so far as it prescribed the quantity of fruit which must be marketed outside the Commonwealth. The High Court took the view that the State act was an interference with the freedom of trade between the States, and, therefore, contravened section 92 of the Constitution. The Dried Fruits Acts of the other States contain a similar provision. The State Parliaments of Victoria and South Australia have amended their acts by providing, in effect, that the enforcement of the provision relating to the marketing of a proportion of the fruit outside Australia shall not operate so as to interfere with the freedom of trade and commerce between the States unless and until enabling legislation to that effect is passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. It is understood that similar legislation to that passed by the Victorian and South Australian Parliaments will shortly be introduced into the New South Wales and Western Australian Parliaments, so that the position will be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. The Government does not propose to delegate its power to the States, but to make use of prescribed authorities, which will probably be the State boards, to act on behalf of the Commonwealth in carrying out Commonwealth powers in connexion with the marketing of dried vine fruits. </para>

            <para>- That is what I have already said. It is provided in the bill that packers in those States in which there is a production greater than can be consumed within the State may engage in interstate trade only under licence issued by the prescribed authority. It will probably be a condition of the licence that before interstate trade can be undertaken the packer will he required to satisfy the prescribed authority that he has complied with the export quota conditions. The power delegated to the various State boards will enable the effective work of those boards to be carried on under the supervision of the Commonwealth in the interests of growers, and, with their full concurrence, I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

Printing  is an important Australian industry, and should receive the same measure of protection that is given to hundreds of. other industries.

            <para>- The present rate for newspapers is l&#189;d. for 20 ounces. This bill proposes to make it 2&#189;d. for 20 ounces for journals published at intervals of more&#34; than one week. That -additional tax is an unfair imposition on the proprietors or publishers of journals issued monthly or bi-monthly. Many of the publications which will be affected by this bill have enjoyed newspaper rates of postage for periods varying from ten to 50 years. <inline font-style="italic">The Pastoral Review,</inline> formerly known as <inline font-style="italic">The Pastoralists Review,</inline> was registered as a newspaper long before the foundation of the Commonwealth. It has always enjoyed the privilege of newspaper rates of postage.

Have honorable senators considered the effect that the passing of this bill will have on the printing trade and those associated with it ?

That journal, whose many readers throughout Australasia look forward to receiving it month by month, will be penalized under this bill. </para>

        <para>SenatorFINDLEY. - That power exists under the principal act. I am now dealing with the proposed increased postage rates which will have to be borne by the proprietors or publishers of journals published monthly or bi-monthly. Apparently the only object of this amending legislation is to obtain a little additional revenue for the Postal Department. </para>

            <para>- The proposed additional rates of postage will inconvenience the community in many ways. Many public utilities established for the benefit of &#39; the community do not pay directly, although they pay indirectly. Is it not a fact that the proprietors of the great daily newspapers of Australia get their telegrams and cablegrams at cheap rates, because their publications are supposed to have an educational value to the community? Monthly publications also have &#39; an educational value to the community. If this bill goes through in its present form, many readers of monthly publications will not be in a position to buy them. </para>

          <para>. -  &#34;When we were last considering this bill, the Minister in charge <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> intimated that during the week-end a deputation, representative of the various interests concerned, would wait on him or the Postmaster-General and that by the time&#39; we re-assembled he would have a statement to make. He has . not made that statement, and in the absence of it, we resume the discussion of the bill in the position in which we found ourselves on Friday last. According to this clause a publication may be registered as a newspaper, if it is &#34; a publication  which  is published in numbers at intervals of not more than seven days.&#34; The basis for the amendment  of the act is the difference set up between seven and thirty days. The  Minister  contends that a magazine giving information on technical matters is not a newspaper. I do not agree with that. I propose to. mention a  few  publications which are likely to be affected by the bill and to- ask  whether  they should not be treated as newspapers inasmuch&#39; as they contain not only news, bat also &#39;information which is very valuable&#39; to the community&#39;. &#34;Can such&#39; weekly publications as the <inline font-style="italic">Mining Standard, Golf in Australia, Wireless Weekly, &#39; Construction,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Australian Manufacturer,</inline> by the widest stretch of imagination .be classed &#39; more as news&#39;papers than such monthly publications as <inline font-style="italic">Golf, Stead&#39;s, Woman&#39;s World, A.N.A., Life, The Pastoral Review,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">the .Commonwealth Engineer?</inline> What is the difference between <inline font-style="italic">Golf,</inline> the monthly publication,, and <inline font-style="italic">Golf in Australia,</inline> which is issued weekly? Can it be. said that <inline font-style="italic">Stead&#39;s</inline> does not convey tu the people of Australia important news, and news of an educational value? Will&#39; the Minister deny that the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> and the . <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Engineer</inline> are educational publications, containing news of vast importance to the people of the Commonwealth? I think they are. entitled to be classed as newspapers, just as much as those weekly publications I have named. The Minister claims that the Government has a precedent for its present proposal in the fact that Great -Britain and the United States of America have adopted the principle of a seven days&#39; interval; but I remind- him of the vast disparity between the population of those countries and that of Australia. We have approximately only 6,000,000 people in Australia, and consequently many Australian publishers cannot publish more than once a month. There is practically no difference between many of the weekly publications and some of the monthly publications I have mentioned. They contain the same class of news . The Minister appears to lay emphasis on the fact that the additional rates of postage will not amount to more than fd. per lb. It may seem a small increase ; nevertheless it amounts to a 40 per cent, increase on the parcels postage in bulk. It will cost in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review,</inline> for instance, an extra penny to post a single copy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has already referred to the privileges which, are enjoyed by proprietors of newspapers. These privileges are cheaper telegrams and cablegrams and cheaper railway fares to the proprietors or members of their staffs when travelling interstate.  I.n the event of the clause being agreed to, thus depriving monthly publications of the right to be classified as newspapers, I want to know how these proprietors will be affected in respect of the concessions which they now enjoy. So far as I can see the bill will certainly inflict an injustice on many people in Australia, there will be an entirely new definition of a newspaper, the transmission through the post of certain periodicals which to-day are read by many people in Australia will be rendered more difficult, and an unjust tax will be imposed on those persons engaged in the business of publishing periodicals. In the circumstances I hope that the Minister will realize that a mistake is being made. </para>

The period between the issues of a publication is not, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> would have the committee believe, the sole determining factor in defining what is a newspaper. Under the proposed new section 28, a publication may be registered as a newspaper if  it is known and recognized as a news paper in the generally accepted sense of the word, and is printed and published within the Commonwealth for bona fide sale at the advertised price as a business proposition with a view to earning profit and is a publication which - </para>

Clearly it could not be the case with many of the magazines and journals which have been referred to by my honorable friends opposite, but wjiich cannot by any stretch of &#39; imagination be classed as newspapers. The proprietors of such publications have enjoyed this benefit for so long that naturally they wish it to be continued. Actually the Postal Department, in its concessions to such publications, is granting a substantial bounty to a certain section of the community. </para>

But I put it to honorable senators that if we do this, the last position of the people who are using the post office for the conveyance of this class of mail matter may be worse than the first. If the Postmaster-General exercised his power to deregister certain publications very few of them would again be included in the classification. The Government&#39;s proposal is really intended to regularize the position and to correct what is generally regarded as an anomaly. </para>

            <para>-At all events I am instructed that the press rates for telegrams will remain as hitherto. The Government&#39;s proposal is to put in one category, newspapers which are newspapers in the true sense of the term, in that they publish current news from day to day or week to week, but at no longer intervals than seven days. I cannot say how often <inline font-style="italic">The Industrial Australian and Mining Standard</inline> and that other estimable publication mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline><inline font-style="italic">Golf,</inline> are issued, but by no stretch of imagination can they be classified as newspapers. Therefore they are not entitled to inclusion in the category of such publications and enjoy the postage rates applicable to newspapers. </para>

            <para>- No. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> made some reference to the tremendous population in Great Britain and the United States of America, and reminded us of what is being done by the postal authorities in those countries. I venture to suggest that is one of the reasons why we should adopt the provisions in this bill. The Commonwealth Post Office has to carry mail matter over tremendous distances and, as we have discovered, at a consider able financial loss. At my suggestion the departmental officials were good enough to prepare certain interesting information bearing on this point. This shows that a magazine classed as a newspaper, 1 lb. in weight, is carried by the post office for many hundreds of miles for l&#189;d., and actually it costs the taxpayers of this country 6&#189;d., the cost of railage, apart altogether from the service which the post office renders by handling and distributing this class of mail matter. This is the burden which is thrown upon the postal department by publications such as <inline font-style="italic">The Pastoral Review</inline> and others which, at present, are classed as newspapers. </para>

            <para>- Speaking for myself I should say it has been going on far too long. The concessions given in this way by the Postal Department represent a bounty to a certain section of the community. For the transmission of magazines 2 lbs. in weight, the postal department receives 3d., and the cost to the country is 6&#189;d. The rates show a loss until we reach the weight of 15 lbs., when the department receives 1&#189;d. more than the actual cost for the carriage of such mail matter. Having regard to the position it is only right that we should take steps to remedy it. W. should not expect the Postal Department to incur a direct monetary loss on the conveyance of mail matter. </para>

If monthly papers, however, are eliminated from cheaper rates by legislation, the expense in this direction will be seriously increased, and very great inconvenience will be caused to this union, representing as it does nearly 16,000 members - mostly primary producers.

In classifying monthly publications as journals the cost of distribution is very considerably increased, and this we regard as a class tax on publications that could not economically be brought out at more frequent intervals, and which are of as great value as news distributors in the country as the weeklies. .We have a Monthly Newspapers&#39; Association in .Melbourne which will meet early next week and &#39; consider what action should be taken to combat the. bill. .&#39; &#39; </para>

          <para>A further injustice would be. done to this paper if it were removed from the list of news papers. We should lose the privileges of press, cable, and telegraph rates. Our cables from abroad, London, and Argentina, giving shipments and prices of wheat, wool, and. grain, for instance. Our cables from New Zealand and Africa giving results of particulars: of show-ring prizes. Also bur press railway privileges would be lost. At present in alf countries we receive press rates when travelling on the railways, and this has been our privilege since 1891.

            <para>- I am instructed that they are entitled to the benefit of press rates in regard to telegrams and cables. The <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> is a monthly publication which, at present, is registered as a newspaper at the General Post Office, Melbourne. I suggest that it is not a newspaper in the general acceptance of the term. It contains little that can be classed as news, such as that which is published in a daily newspaper. In short, it is exactly what it styles itself - a review - and, therefore, it comes under the postal classification relating to magazines, reviews and similar publications, with respect to which the rate of postage is Id. for 8 ounces. An examination of the issue of 28th February last, shows that it is a bulky publication. The weight of that issue was 16 ounces.. It contained 174 pages, of which 87 pages were devoted wholly to advertisements^. Other pages also contained advertisements. It will be seen that at- least 50 percent, is devoted to advertisements. Of the 87 pages of letterpress and illustrations 24 are devoted to a description of: certain pastoral properties, &#38;c. These articles, and illustrations are printed on a, good class of heavy paper which- adds*  considerably to the weight of the publication. The remaining pages of letterpress consist of articles such as generally appear in reviews. It is necessary only to refer to. the table of contents on page 27 to see that such is the case. Publications of this nature are not newspapers, and it is only the wide definition of a newspaper contained in the present act, and also a liberal interpretation of that definition which has enabled them to secure registration as newspapers. The time has long since arrived for publications such as the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> to be placed in the postal classification to which they properly belong, and in the main, the amendments to the act which are now proposed are to this end. The effect of the.. proposed alterations to the act is, so far as the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> is concerned, that it will be transferred from the register of newspapers to the register of periodicals, and the rate of postage will be increased from l&#189;d. per 20 ounces to 2&#189;d. per 20 ounces, an increase of four-fifths of a penny per lb. The effect so far as the general public is concerned, that is as regards the posting of a copy of the journal by one individual to another, is nil, as a periodical weighing 16 ounces will require the same amount of postage, namely, 2d., as a newspaper of that weight does to-day. As regards weekly and monthly publications of a similar character I may say that the frequency of issue of a publication is not in itself the determining factor in deciding whether a publication is a &#34; newspaper,&#34; or a &#34;periodical.&#34; To be eligible for classification as a newspaper, a publication, in addition to being issued not less than once a week, must consist in substantial part of current news and articles or illustrations relating thereto, or to other current topics. At present certain publications of a similar character are issued weekly and monthly, respectively, but this of itself will not necessarily result in the former being classified as &#34; newspapers &#34; and the latter as &#34; periodicals.&#34; If a weekly publication does not comply with the provisions of the bill in regard to news, it will be placed in the same class as a monthly publication, and each will be charged  the same rate of postage. Particular care will be taken by the department to prevent the weekly journal obtaining an advantage over the monthly publication simply by reason of its more frequent issue. </para>

        <para>I intimated to the committee when this measure was last under consideration that it was expected that a deputation would wait upon the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> at Canberra. The department communicated with the New South Wales Master Printers and Commercial Traders&#39; Association, asking it to fix a day. This it did not do, but its representative courteously sent me a communication, in which he stated that any respresentations in addition to those already made to the Postmaster-General and his officers would doubtless be of little use. He concluded - </para>

        <para>The association is anxious that a clear line of demarcation shall be drawn, as I think has already been done, between newspapers and other publications. As that has been provided, there should be little ground for complaint. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> seems to think that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of subclause . 2 of proposed new section 28, which relates to supplements, alters the original provision in such a way as to provide a different effect in regard to supplements. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of subsection 2 of section 28 of the principal act reads - </para>

        <para>The department in endeavouring to clarify the position proposes in this bill the following amended definition: - </para>
        <quote>

If the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> has outlined were carried it would have the effect of vitiating the clause. </para>

        <para class="block">I suggest such an amendment in the interests of several publications circulated in Queensland, and with which no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> is familiar. For instance, the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Mining Journal</inline> is in every respect a newspaper. It is published monthly, and contains news concerning the mining industry, which is read by many persons interested in the industry, but is not published in the daily newspapers because they cannot afford the necessary space. The same could be said concerning the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Sugar Journal,</inline> which the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> mentioned, and which contains a good deal of information useful to the sugar-growers and others interested in the sugar industry. That journal contains information of a character that daily newspapers ought to, but cannot find space to publish. There is also a publication issued in New South Wales entitled <inline font-style="italic">Harbour,</inline> containing information of great value to those engaged in the shipping business and to others. It contains news of a character that is eagerly looked for every month in the shipping world, but which owing to the pressure on space is not published in the daily newspapers.

There are other similar publications, which give valuable information concerning industries and professions; and which although not published weekly, should properly be regarded as newspapers, will be affected, I will not say seriously, by this clause. I ask the Minister to seriously consider an amendment such as I have suggested. If the period is extended from seven days to one month I shall support the clause. </para>

            <para>- We may well ask what constitutes current news. I have here <inline font-style="italic">The Pastoral Review,</inline> a somewhat bulky publication, which contains information regarding the wool and frozen meat markets in the different countries of the world as well as special articles relating to industries of great importance to Australia. Wool is our staple industry; a good wool clip means a great deal to Australia. <inline font-style="italic">The Pastoral Review</inline> contains much valuable information which is not obtainable from other journals. It caters specially for pastoralists; other journals cater for other sections of the community. I am hot pleading solely for <inline font-style="italic">The Pastoral Review,</inline> 1  merely instance it as typical of the journals which are published monthly. If the bill is passed in its present form, endless worry and anxiety will be caused to proprietors and publishers of various periodicals throughout Australia. I am greatly concerned about this bill. I was born and reared in the work-a-day world and spent many years in the printing business. I know that to-day many men who have served their apprenticeship to the printing trade, or are connected with the printing industry in various ways, are out of work. In a communication received recently from the proprietor of a journal published in Melbourne, which will be affected by this legislation, the writer stated that in response to a recent advertisement notifying a vacancy on his staff,  50 men  applied for the position. The passing of this legislation will throw more men out of employment. Some of the publications which will be affected by it have been struggling for a long time to get on their feet. The persons whom this bill will affect are now rendering valuable service to the community by supplying them not only with general news but also information of technical and scientific value. Any thing that will raise the educational standard of the people will receive my support. Are honorable senators supporting the Government not concerned about an industry of great value to Australia? Are they not concerned about the readers of the journals which will be affected by this bill? Those who are scientifically minded and wish to increase their knowledge of technical matters, or desire to be conversant with the conditions existing in industry; as well as women who read with avidity the journals published in their interests - journals containing patterns of clothing, and articles of domestic economy and hygiene - will all be affected by this bill. Some of the publications which will be required to pay increased rates of postage have been registered as newspapers for half a century; others for  25,  fifteen or ten years. Now, merely because the existing rates of postage on those journals do not pay the post office, the Government proposes to raise those rates by  66  per cent. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">Yet, the proprietors of daily and weekly newspapers, some of whom are rich beyond the dreams of avarice, are not to be interfered with; they are to continue to enjoy the existing privileges of cheap postage rate. Honorable senators should not lose sight of the fact that with an increased population many of the journals now published monthly or bimonthly would probably circulate weekly. The Post Office is not more seriously affected by the rates of postage on those journals, than it is by the rates charged in respect of newspapers published daily or weekly. While not advocating increased rates of postage on daily and weekly newspapers, I wish to repeat that if any section of newspaper proprietors is in a position to meet increased postage rates, it is that section which controls the big daily newspapers of Australia. </para>

It is quite plain from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of my second-reading speech that I indicated in the clearest possible language the&#34; distinction to be drawn between magazines and newspapers. Before I made use of the words quoted by my honorable friend, I said :  - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>The amendments to section 28 of the act are designed to place this matter on a satisfactory basis and to define as, a newspaper only those publications which are newspapers in the generally accepted sense of the term; are issued at intervals of not more than seven days and consist in substantial part of current news and articles, or illustrations relating thereto, or to other current topics. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Then I proceeded to discuss the provision . and used the words referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley.</inline> The language of the clause is plain. The object is to place newspapers and periodicals in two different categories. The present position is not satisfactory to the Postal Department in as much as these publications are being, carried on at a loss. Although we may be quite sympathetic with the proprietors of periodicals and may have no desire to impose an additional burden on them, the position calls aloud for some alteration. Everywhere a distinction is drawn between daily or weekly newspapers and magazines which specialize in giving certain information. I have every reason to admire the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review,</inline> which provides great facilities for its subscribers, but 87 out of 174 pages in one issue are devoted to advertising and 24 to illustrations of pastoral properties. Can the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> be placed on the same footing as a daily newspaper? I suggest that neither branch of this Parliament ever intended that publications of that character or those that contain reviews of literature should be classed  a3  newspapers and have the benefit of the exceedingly cheap postage rates that apply to newspapers. The distinction to which *I have referred is drawn in other countries, and I see- no good reason why the committee should baulk at passing this provision which will help to systematize the matter and put it on a better footing while doing no injustice to one class of publication as against another. </para>

            <para>- It may do so when proper relay stations are established, but the statics are too bad at present to enable remote listeners-in to take advantage of radio. I have received a communication informing me that the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian Insurance and Banking Record,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Producer,</inline> issue 21,000 copies a month and pay &#163;70 a month in postage. If this bill is carried the cost of distributing these valuable periodicals will be increased by 40 per cent., representing &#163;336 a year. It is questionable whether the publishers of these papers will be able to stand the extra impost, and if they are compelled to cease publishing their subscribers will be deprived of very valuable information. For instance it is of untold value to the pastoralist to know how the wool market stands at any time and when it is best for him to export his wool, and he may be deprived of that information if the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> is compelled to go out of circulation. I have a letter from Fitchett Brothers, publishers. They state that this bill will penalize them to the extent of 66  J  per cent, of their present circulation. They have been publishing for the last 30 years and during that period have spent &#163;40,000 in postage and have received &#163;150,000 through the post in connexion with other business associated with their papers. Thus there is another side to the question. People advertise in periodicals with a view to bringing in business, and in that way extra business is brought to the Postal Department. For instance, mail orders are sent by post. It is questionable if the extra business gained by way of additional postage and money orders in that way does not make up for the small loss which the department declares it suffers through carrying periodicals at the present newspaper rates. I think the Minister might accept the suggestion to make the period one month instead of one week. Provision is made in the bill by which the proprietor of a periodical who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Postmaster-General may appeal <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the High Court. The man who thinks about applying to the High Court had better see first where his fortune is - if he has any - because if he does so the possibility is that in the end he will have very little of it left. I have had my experience of the law. The case in which I was &#39;concerned did not last for more than five days but it was sufficient to cause me to realize that when one goes to law one is out of pocket. The time it would take to secure finality would be fatal to a publisher&#39;s business in many cases. Many publishers may not be able to afford to appeal to the High Court, if their publications are not classed as newspapers, and they will simply have to go out of business. If there is to be an appeal it should be made a less cumbersome and less costly process. I have received quite a number of letters protesting against this bill, and it seems to me from perusing, them that the only effect of the measure will be to disorganize a big industry and possibly cause a considerable amount of unemployment. Last week the Minister said that he did not think the bill would make much difference to the revenue of the department, but now he tells us that the retention of the existing section will entail a loss on the department* That loss is unimportant seeing that this great industry is serving Australia in an educational way and conferring considerable benefit upon outback people by supplying them with information which they would not otherwise be able to obtain. The Government would be well advised to reconsider the clause. </para>

          <para>. - As I said on the second reading I have the greatest possible sympathy with the Postal Department in its desire to amend the act. I quite agree with the Minister that the present rates for the carriage of newspapers and other publications are such as to &#34; show up &#34; the post office in many respects, and that something should be .done to remedy this state of affairs, but I cannot see how this bill will do it. The Minister has told us that at present as many as 80 newspapers can be sent through the post to addresses all over Australia for ltd. It appears that if this bill goes through these 80 newspapers will be carried for 2&#189;d. The department thus will gain Id. more if 80 newspapers are carried, lOd. more if 800 are carried, and 8s. 4d. more if 8000 are carried. It does not seem to me that the amendment will improve the revenue of the department to any great extent. Of course the Minister might ask why honorable senators should bother about such a trifling extra impost. I am ready to advocate anything that I think is worth while even if it may be unpopular : but I cannot understand why the Government should advocate something that is unpopular when material gain is to be secured by doing so. I do not regard this measure as drastic. The departmental view is that it represents a reform; but in my judgment the reforms to be achieved by it are so slight that they are not worth troubling about. If the Government proposed to adopt rates such as those obtaining in New Zealand or England, where the charge is so much for every copy posted, the reform might be worth while. </para>

            <para>- At all events it would achieve something. It is to be regretted that the Minister is not in a position to state the estimated additional revenue expected to accrue from this reform. Such an answer to a question seeking that information may be accepted in the Senate, but I imagine that if the Postmaster-General in another place furnished such an indefinite reply he would have a few unpleasant minutes. at the hands of honorable members. Are we to believe that the department does not know what increase in revenue will result from this so-called reform - whether it will be &#163;5, &#163;5,000 or &#163;50,000? I understand, that under the new rates periodicals may be posted in bulk. Can the Minister say how this will affect the revenue ? </para>

I listened attentively to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and I understand from the Minister&#39;s reply that if newspapers are published at intervals of not more than seven days, they will remain in their present classification. This will unfairly affect a number of publications. I have two in mind <inline font-style="italic">- Grit,</inline> published once a week, and another called <inline font-style="italic">Liberator</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Victory,</inline> which is published once a month. Both are  temperance newspapers.

            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Thomas</inline>has just  said that, according to a departmental view, the bill represents a reform. I regard it as a reactionary measure. , We have spent the best part of . three days in endeavouring to ascertain, from the Minister in charge what will be the probable increase in revenue, and he is unable to inform us. I could understand this lack of information if the bill were being disposed of hastily; but, in the circumstances, the Minister&#39;s admission is most unsatisfactory <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman</inline> has indicated that he proposes, to submit an amendment to reinsert sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of section 28.

I gathered from his remarks that&#39; the Postmaster-General was reviewing the classification of a number of publications, some of. which are,. in his opinion, improperly registered for transmission through the post as newspapers, I understand that the Minister has the power under , the existing act  to either  agree or refuse to register as a newspaper any. publication. . The way is, therefore, clear for the department to rid itself qf the objection which attaches to the carriage of publications of a bulky nature. I trust that when the bill becomes law the department will give the widest possible interpretation . to the definition of &#34; newspaper &#34;. Replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> the Minister said that the department has been carrying many publications at a considerable loss, and he cited an extreme case to justify his. contention. He referred to the long distances covered, but ignored the fact that bulk postage is. paid in the majority of cases, and that such publications are distributed mostly in the larger centres of population. We should endeavour to popularize the distribution of magazines and other periodicals in the outlying districts, where the population is sparse, and the people do not enjoy the amenities of the cities and towns. The Minister also referred to the bulky nature of much of the postal matter that the postmen have to handle. That argument does not apply to the small, outlying districts, because in those centres the residents have to call at the post offices to collect their mail matter. </para>

            <para>- The post office should not be used as a tax-gathering machine to obtain more revenue than is necessary to enable it to carry on its operations. I intend to move at the appropriate stage, that all newspapers, magazines, and other publications which are donated to public hospitals and other charitable institutions shall be carried free of postage. I shall be glad if the Minister will indicate the clause in which that provision can be inserted. It would be a step in the right direction, and should receive the favorable consideration of all honorable senators. Many persons are actively engaged to-day in hospital and other charitable work, a portion qf which consists in collecting and sending to the inmates, newspapers and other reading matter. This country should encourage those efforts, and be generous enough to carry such reading matter free , of charge through the post. </para>

        <para class="block">Some members of the committee appear to think that the provision would be too wide if the word &#34; practical &#34; which appears in the principal act were also added; therefore, I have not included it in my amendment. The whole of the administration seems to depend upon the proportion of advertisements to news matter. According to the definition in the bill, for the purpose of registration a publication is to be regarded as a newspaper &#34; if it consists in substantial part of current news and articles or illustrations relating thereto, or to other current topics.&#34; Apparently technical and religious information is not to be regarded as news, although up to the present it has been so regarded, and has warranted the registration of the publication in which it has appeared. An issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> that I have received contains no fewer than 105 pages of news matter; yet, under the proposed definition, it . is not to be regarded as a newspaper and thus will be denied registration. If honorable senators will study many of the daily newspapers they will find that the volume of advertisements is three times as great as that of news. </para>

            <para>- They are not. This is specialized information, which those who subscribe to this journal cannot obtain from the daily newspapers. The information iri relation to Australian wool shipments, stud sheep and other matters is given &#39; in greater detail than in a daily newspaper.&#39; But, because the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> commits the sin of publishing only once a month, it is proposed to refuse it registration as a newspaper. Honorable senators probably have seen in some newspapers as much as two pages of advertising matter supplied by one firm. I am informed that firms who advertise on such a scale purchase large numbers of the issue for advertising purposes, because they are allowed to send a certain number through the post without paying anything more than bulk postage on them. The periodicals upon whose behalf <inline font-style="italic">1  &#38;m</inline> pleading publish a good class of reading matter upon technical, educational and art subjects; yet, according to the definition in the bill, if it is not current news they cannot be registered as a newspaper. Information such as that published in the press the other day concerning an outrage in Sydney is regarded as news, but that of an educational character, unless &#34;current,&#34; is not. I trust that my amendment will be carried so that religions or technical information will be regarded as news. I also trust that publications such as the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review</inline> will not be removed from the list of registered newspapers merely because they are published monthly. </para>

            <para>- Yes. Throughout the debate I have urged that we should strike out the whole clause and so retain that provision in the principal act. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> referred to the <inline font-style="italic">Pastoral Review,</inline> to which I understand he subscribes, as a bulky publication. From the information which he gave, he has apparently had some one busily at work to ascertain the number of pages in that journal which are devoted to news and to advertising matter. He endeavoured to prove that it was not even on a &#34; fifty-fifty basis, and advanced that as a reason why it should not be classed as a newspaper. I have gone to the trouble to ascertain the quantity of space devoted to news and advertising matter in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which is one of the oldest established daily newspapers in Australia. Last Saturday&#39;s issue of that newspaper consisted of 30 pages and 240 columns, 71&#163; of which comprised illustrations, sporting, commercial and general information which can be regarded as news, and 167&#163; columns comprised advertisements. That is considerably over the &#34; fifty-fifty &#34; basis mentioned by the Minister, and I think we can say that a similar proportion of the space in many other journals published in the capital cities, particularly in the case of Saturday issues, is devoted to advertising matter. </para>

            <para>- Yes, the number of advertisements is evidence of the value of the paper not merely to readers but to the advertisers. Trade follows the flag, and it is true, also, that advertisements follow the circulation of a newspaper. Newspapers which receive the greatest number of advertisements have the largest circulation and are newspapers within the meaning of the act. It has been said that the pen is mightier than the sword. We know what the world owes to those who, as a result of their writings, have been instrumental in bringing ab&#38;ut reforms highly beneficial to the community. As the Minister has said that the object of this amending measure is mainly to secure additional revenue, I am justified &#39;n asking if we are to measure every proposition from a financial viewpoint. In Victoria the railways commissioners have, at the expense of the community, equipped a costly train known as the Better Farming train. This train carries experts on different subjects, who instruct farmers in the best methods to employ in cultivating the  soil and in breeding stock. It also carries nurses who instruct mothers in the care of children, and women lecturers who speak on domestic economy and hygiene. There is no direct return from such services, but they are of wonderful educational value to the community. The great White Train in New South Wales which tours the whole State does not pay, but is of undoubted indirect benefit to the people. In these circumstances we are justified in contending that it will pay the Postal Department to carry journals which it does not regard as newspapers, at the existing rate as the knowledge thus disseminated will make for higher education and a healthier community. I ask honorable senators who usually support the Government not to be induced to agree to this clause merely because it is necessary to raise a little more revenue. Our education system is not expected to pay, neither should our telegraphic and telephonic services be expected to show a profit. Just as the losses on some services &#39; are borne, not by those who  receive the direct benefit, but by the whole community, so the loss, if any, incurred in carrying periodicals at the newspaper rate should he shared by the people. We must also consider the effect of this amending legislation upon those who are engaged in the printing and publishing business, and the extent to which the efforts of Australian writers and artists may be discouraged. I know men in the journalistic world - &#34; free-lances &#34; - who obtain their livelihood by writing special articles for journals which will he affected by this bill. If the proprietors or publishers of such journals are penalized to the extent of 66$ per cent, in respect of postal rates an unfair burden will be placed upon them. If this measure becomes law the size of some of the journals may be reduced and others will probably cease publication. This would have the effect of throwing men out of employment. If the Government will not agree to the amendment I have outlined&#39;, it is my intention to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chapman&#39;s</inline> proposal. I have risen several times during this discussion because I am firmly of the opinion that this provision will be harmful not only to the publishers but to the general community. I earnestly appeal to the Minister to consider the facts I have placed before him. </para>

          <para>. -  In order to ascertain the additional revenue likely to be derived under this proposal it would be necessary to analyse the postage paid on each publication now registered as a newspaper and also to closely scrutinize the figures in respect of each journal published weekly or less frequently. The Postal Department is apprehensive concerning the ever increasing number of magazines and periodicals being registered, and as it has permitted certain publications to be registered as newspapers it is difficult in the absence of amending legislation to deny that right to the publishers of similar journals. The volume of work is becoming so great that the department has felt it necessary to suggest an amendment in this direction. </para>

            <para>- I intimated earlier that there has been a considerable  loss on the carriage of these publications. A complete analysis of the position would occupy weeks, but I suggest that as the financial aspect is not of major importance it should not be given undue prominence. From the figures I have quoted it will he seen that as service is being rendered at a loss the department is compelled to institute a change. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> painted a very striking picture of the services rendered to certain sections, the cost of which is met by the whole community. As a Scotsman I prefer to see the hard cash every time. The suggested benefits are all mythical; we cannot lay our hands on these things. In this case the revenue of the post office will be, to an extent, safeguarded. I ask honorable senators not to reject the clause. </para>

If considerations of cash alone are to guide the actions of any government, we shall fall far below our ideals - if, indeed, ideals are to be contemplated, which would not appear to be  the case from the Minister&#39;s speech. Apparently he would not support legislation to extend educational facilities through out the country, because the benefit would Be merely mythical, and we could not lay our hands upon them. </para>

          <para>- The matter before us is not so much the amount of the additional postage, but the benefit which the journals which will be affected by this legislation confer on the community. The rate which shall be charged for transmitting these journals through the post is to be determined on a nonsensical basis - whether they are published once a week or once a month. Western Australia will probably be the State most affected by this legislation, because of the remoteness from the centres of population of many of its people. Many of those dwellers outback depend largely for their instruction and enjoyment on the articles contained in magazines published monthly. I am desirous that they shall continue to enjoy the privileges, which are still to be enjoyed by newspapers published daily or weekly. I remind honorable senators that these people are doing a great deal more to develop Australia and increase her prosperity than are many of the individuals who receive their daily newspaper otherwise than through the post office. Rather than that this clause should be agreed to, I should prefer that things remain as they are. The principal act makes special provision for publications which are of a religious, technical or practical nature. Journals of that description should not be prevented from reaching&#39; the outlying portions of the Commonwealth through the post. My concern is chiefly for the people outback. The Minister said that considerations of cash were practically the only reason for this new provision. </para>

          <para>-The post office could well lose a little in such a good cause - I refer to the educational value of many of these journals. Probably the journals which are published monthly are of greater educational value to the community than are the daily and weekly newspapers. Most of them deal with technical, religious, and other subjects of considerable value to the people for whom they are written. </para>
