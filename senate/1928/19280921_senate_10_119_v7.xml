                            <para>The rates fixed for New Guinea and Papua were determined by a classification made in 1925, based upon rates paid in Australian hospitals, with the addition of a sum to meet tropical conditions. The North Australian rates were fixed by a classification made this year. They are practically the rates paid prior to the classification and it was not considered desirable to disturb them with a view to making them uniform with the other territorial rates. The rates for the nursing staff in New Guinea and Papua are at present under consideration as to review in the light of altered conditions. </para>

                    <para>. - I have had an opportunity to read the bill and, with the right honorable the Leader of the Senate, I have to confess that I cannot claim to have expert knowledge of measures of this nature. The first Federal bill imposing estate duties was passed in 1914, in which year the Commonwealth Government entered that arena of taxation in order to secure additional revenue urgently required for the conduct of the war. At the time it was thought that the taxation would be temporary; but having entered the field, the Government is reluctant to vacate it notwithstanding that the war has been over for ten years. Prior to 1914 estates were heavily taxed by State authorities and, so far as I can gather, they are still being exploited by State Governments. As I understand it, the object of this measure is to stop the leakages that have been responsible for certain losses in revenue. Frequently this form of taxation falls heavily upon those who have to pay it. This is particularly true of small estates. In addition to Federal and State taxation, certain estates have to provide for heavy legal and administrative expenditure. Estate duty is levied on the taxable value of property at the time of the death of the testator when it passes to other persons named in the will or when the owner dies intestate. I understand that as a result of the practice of transferring property immediately prior to decease, there has been a considerable loss in revenue and the object of the bill is to protect the revenue. The experience of the department shows that these transactions occur frequently, with the result that considerable revenue is lost. An independent valuation by a competent valuer would, in many instances, reveal a higher value than that included in the returns submitted to the department. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The bill contains a departure from the practice hitherto followed in connexion with joint tenancies. In the past it has not been the practice to collect estate duty from the survivor or survivors when one partner in a joint tenancy died. In the case of a joint tenancy comprising three or four partners, it would be reasonable to expect that estate duty would not be charged until at least two of the partners died; but the Government proposes in this bill to make the duty payable at the time of the first death occurring among the partners. Apparently the experience of the department has been such as to justify this short cut being taken, and therefore I shall not offer any objection to the new proposal. I hope, however, that in administering this legislation the department will not act harshly towards citizens, who, not fully understanding the law, and without any attempt to evade payment of estate duty, fail to comply with its requirements. I support the second reading. </para>

                <para class="block">The amended wording now suggested for inclusion in the bill in place of the present wording of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> in clause 5, has been found necessary in order that all cases might be covered. The House of Representatives inserted the wording, of the Victorian Probate Act in reference to joint tenancies, but that wording is not as clear as might be desired. The bill as introduced into the House of Representatives had provided for the inclusion in the dutiable estate of a deceased person of the value of any property which' he had vested in a joint tenancy of himself and other persons, and in which he had a beneficial interest immediately prior to his death. That House amended the provision with the intention to include in the dutiable estate only the value of the deceased person's beneficial interest in the joint tenancy. It is desired to express that object more clearly and concisely than has been done by the amendment  made in another place, and that result will be secured by the amendment now submitted, which is, in substance, really the same as what is now contained in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of clause 5 of the bill, but expresses the intention of Parliament in clearer language. </para>

                <para class="block">Will the amendment make the law harsher in its application to the survivor or survivors of a joint tenancy? I have already indicated that this estate duty assessment law sometimes operates harshly upon those who have to pay it, and I gave my reason for that assertion. I accepted the bill as it was originally presented to this chamber, but now we are confronted with a hurried amendment with which, perhaps, even the Leader of the Senate himself is not fully conversant. The honorable gentleman has informed the committee that another place inserted certain words, and that this amendment is intended to clarify the position. Clarification may be necessary, but I wish to be sure that the amendment will not inflict any additional hardship upon the survivor or survivors of a joint tenancy. </para>

                    PEARCE (Western Australia - Vice-President of the Executive Council) [11.25].  -  Anybody who reads clause 5 of this bill must admit that it is very involved and difficult to understand. The purpose of paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">d</inline>
                    is this: Suppose that a person had £10,000, with which he purchased shares or a property in the name of himself and others as a joint ownership, and that within twelve months of the transaction he died. When his death occurs that £10,000 is not dutiable, although obviously it be longed only to the individual who died. That practice is a common form of evasion of probate duty. Technically it is a joint ownership, but actually the ownership is confined to an individual. The amount passes to the nominal survivors of the partnership, and the beneficiaries can repeat the process, so that the estate never becomes dutiable. The intention of paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">d</inline>
                    is to combat such practices, and to bring the amount involved into the taxable arena. It was found that the wording of the paragraph did not quite meet the case, and it is considered that this amendment does so in a simpler and more effective form.

                    <para>. - I did not speak on the second reading because I realize that it is usually futile to raise one's voice on such matters. However, I now register my protest against the Government enlarging its sphere of direct taxation, when it has led us to believe that it is vacating that field as fast as it can. The method of establishing a joint ownership is a practice advised by lawyers to married people, in order to avoid the expense of probate. </para>

It seems to me to be particularly reprehensible and abhorrent for the Government and its taxgatherers to be hanging around the deathbed of a man, practically waiting to snatch the* bread out of the mouths of the widow and children. It reminds me of nothing so much as a shoal of sharks hanging around a boat after a death has occurred aboard. </para>

                        <para>- But it is aimed at the usual provision recommended by lawyers to people in a married state. Although nominally the husband may own the money, the wife, by her labour, is entitled to her share of it. <inline font-style="italic">II</inline> the husband fails to effect a joint ownership, the taxgatherers come round at his death and claim their pound of flesh. The whole thing is repugnant to any fair-minded individual. It is not always wise for a man to make over the whole of his estate to his wife, as there is a possibility of a dispute occurring which may result in divorce, in which case the wife would have complete control. If an estate is held in the name of both, each party is entitled to a share. It would be exceedingly dangerous for any man to allow his property to be held under a joint tenancy or ownership with another person even with whom he was on the most friendly terms in order merely to escape estate duty. I have great respect for the Leader of the Opposition, but I would not enter into a joint tenancy with him merely for the sake of avoiding estate duties. Human nature is a check on any attempt to defraud the revenue, as there is always the risk under a joint tenancy of one of the parties after the death of the other putting in a claim for the whole of the estate. Under such a system the estate reverts to the survivor. </para>
