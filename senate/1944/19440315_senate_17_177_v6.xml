                        <para>The Minister for Munitions had not read the newspaper article in question until his attention was drawn to it bv the honorable senator, but he lias been advised by his department that in the absence of specific information as to firms concerned and projects it is unable to trace the allegations made. It can be said, however, that ordinarily the department deals with contractors only, and (hat sub-contracts are usually the responsibility of the contractor, while aeroplane parts are not under the control of the Department of Munitions. Every endeavour is made to place as many contracts as possible with Western Australian firms. It is the definite intention of the Department oi Munitions, when .placing contracts in Western Australia, that the contracts should ibc executed in that State. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Leader of the Senate read the report of a speech by Representative Crowley in the United States Congress dealing with lend-lease exchange and Australian aid for America in which he stated that the figures which had been published understated the value of Australian aid for America because of the lower Australian prices? For example, he said Australia was supplying blankets at $2.64##'## each whilst the same article in the United States of America fetched $7.67. Similarly, important foodstuffs cost only half as much in Australia as in the United States of America. Will the Leader of the Senate state whether the facts are as Representative Crowley has alleged? In view of the fact that Australian aid to the United States of America is less than that received by us from that country, and we are not looming so large as we should in regard to the lend-lease arrangement, will a better method be considered by the Government of computing the value of our contribution so that the people of this country will know the value of what they are putting into the common pool? </para>

Towards that end all diplomatic activity should be directed. The maintenance of friendly relations with all our Allies, and particularly America, should be a sufficient task for our fledgling diplomacy. Any suggestion that the British Empire has more than one family policy in war or peace tends to weaken its bargaining power. Differences, if they exist, between governments should be ironed out. Pacts and agreements publicly and ostentatiously proclaimed are unnecessary where daily consultation by cablegram and air-mail are possible. </para>
                    <para>The Australian-New Zealand agreement is this Government##'##s first essay in pact or treaty making. It bears some of the hall marks, and some of the hoof marks, of its makers. When one stops to think of its handling of many of our major problems, the hope is paramount that its future efforts will be, if not actually beneficial, at least free of downright damage ##'##to our good reputation. The present agreement, which shows no lack of numbers in its making, is singularly deficient in a display of the courtesies that should mark such documents, and is practically devoid of a sense of the realities of the present Pacific situation. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> classed it as a ##"##Pacific Charter of permanent collaboration and co-operation ##"##. Nobody, least of all Britain and America, has in any way tried to prevent such a laudable relationship. With victory achieved, nobody outside Australia and New Zealand would or could destroy such co-operation in the minds, the hearts, and policies of the peoples of the two dominions. A government which almost completely turned its back on Great Britain in 1942 and cried aloud to America for help, which it received, now presumes to ##"## fence off ##"## the South and South-West Pacific Areas with a sort of Monroe doctrine based on an Australian-New Zealand partnership. The main distinction in this parallel is that Monroe framed the act, which bears his name, to warn a continent##'##s invaders and to suppress disruption and war in the two Americas, whilst this agreement warns off our kinsmen, our Allies, and our friends. Such a form of, control has been notoriously weak and ineffective wherever it has been tried. I shall make no attempt to deal with the many clauses contained in this document, neither do I propose to deal at length with the merits of the agreement at this stage. I am firmly of the opinion that matters such as those contained in the agreement should be approached by those, who attend the Peace Conference, with open minds and in the best spirit of co-operation, goodwill, and common sense. My main reason for speaking on this motion is to tell the people of Australia, in fact, the- people of the world - and particularly the members of the United Nations - that the views of any one particular Minister in Australia##'## do not necessarily reflect the views of the Australian people. I am prepared to go further and say that the contents of this document do not reflect the considered opinion of even this Parliament. </para>
                    <para>The Curtin Cabinet has in its wisdom, or, as I prefer it, lack of wisdom, entered into this pact without first giving to Parliament an opportunity to discuss its merits. In matters of this kind, it is my firm, conviction that the Commonwealth legislature would do well to copy the .Senate system in the United States of America, where there are in existence standing committees with constitutional rights to deal with national problems on non-party lines. I ask the Government, and I ask Senate, to consider seriously once again a proposal for the establishment of a special Senate standing committee on foreign affairs. The purpose of the special committee would be to secure from all possible sources the most up-to-date and authentic information on external matters, for the purpose of educating, not only members of that committee, but also parliamentarians generally on questions which we have, shamefully we must admit, sadly neglected in the past. The presentation to such a committee of matters having relation to problems outside the realms of home administration would be of great benefit to all concerned. I make that suggestion to the Government, and hope that the day is not far distant when we shall see some definite action taken along these lines. </para>
                    <para>This agreement reeks of isolationism, which makes the New Zealand approval more remarkable, although we must of course remember that the Japanese did not invade New Zealand island dependencies, and that no limits on the use of New Zealand manhood have ever existed. This document lays down what we shall demand at the  peacetable,  and in the making of peace we ##'## have imposed certain painful but well-known limits on our own activities. It does not achieve anything in the way of war, peace, or security that could not have been achieved equally well without it. It lays down, for instance, conditions of civil aviation, and immediately provides that if these are not obtainable, something less will be accepted. Let us look for a moment at the inconsistency of recent utterances in relation to recent action.

                    <para>To those who have studied the agreement, that statement of the Prime Minister must surely create a degree of wonder and amazement now that the agreement is a <inline font-style="italic">fait accompli.</inline> We all appreciate the glorious spirit, deeds and traditions of Anzac - a wonderful and outstanding example of - inter-dominion co-operation without the need for an ostentatious proclamation. We all, too, I am sure, recognize the need for the closest possible co-operation with New Zealand, not only in war-time but in peace-time, and the need for both Australia and its sister dominion to assert themselves in the performance of their full part as a unit of the United Nations. There is no justification for unilateral agreements at this stage. I believe that a written agreement, particularly at this time, is unnecessary, provocative, and may well cause disunity and misunderstanding in matters of high international policy where unity and cooperation should prevail. We find such disagreement becoming the subject of a local controversy, and the Minister for External Affairs only the other day made the following astonishing statement : - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>The most amazing and most offensive provision in the agreement is the blunt declaration of intention to resume control of our island possessions, for the regaining of which it is doubtful if we have paid most of the price in men or materials, and on some of which few, if any, of our men have even appeared. The migration clauses are singularly illtimed. The invitation to an international conference, which the realities of the situation make us daily less qualified to call, is hardly likely to find a speedy, willing and hearty response. The agreement concludes with the inevitable secre- tariat, which apparently is as essential to validity in the eyes of this Government as the signatures themselves. The agreement is unlikely to please anybody but the two Governments concerned. It is weak in conception and amateurish in statement, and leaves the Government##'##s brow encircled with thistles which in their enthusiasm and haste it mistook for laurels. Publication of the agreement will pain our kinfolk overseas, although they may be too polite to say so. It may well alarm those Americans who have taken a friendly interest in our welfare, and who have wished us perhaps better than our past peace-time efforts have deserved. It will encourage American isolationists. Preceding the unpardonable insults of the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> it will tax to the limit the diplomatic skill of the Prime Minister to explain it to both  President  Roosevelt and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline> Churchill as anything but a blatant blunder. At its worst, and on the Prime Minister##'##s own special pleading, it may pass for an act of those who are more preoccupied about the peace for which we all yearn than about a victorious war without which no lasting  peace can be obtained. At its best, it may remind the diplomatically matured of two nice little brothers who decided to be friends for evermore and to live in a wig-wam of their own construction and design, in their own back-yard, having out of kindness omitted to tell Mother Britannia, who was busy in the kitchen, what they were doing in the yard, or to thank Uncle Sam for the materials they had obtained from his workshop next door. </para>
                    <para>I am satisfied that had the intention of the Commonwealth Government to enter into any such unilateral agreement with New Zealand been presented for discussion by this Parliament, this Legislature would have said that, with the existing close relationship and co-operation between Australia and New Zealand, held by the crimson thread of kinship, and the heroism displayed and sacrifices made by the fighting forces of both dominions, such a written agreement was not necessary. Let us all hope that it will silently, speedily and painlessly pass into the realm of history, a  mute warning to those who would walk this way again, and that its authors will assume their former roles, forgiven without a penalty under the British Empire Family First Offenders Act. </para>

                            <para>.- The subject matter of this paper is of more than ordinary importance, and I must confess that I was astonished to find the moment there appeared to be some disposition to criticize the agreement the Government has entered into, that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> should decide that the time had arrived to adjourn the debate, notwithstanding that, so far as I am aware, there is no other business for the Senate to proceed with. I have never had any objection to the Government seeking the closest consultation with the Government of New Zealand ; it would be most undesirable for the Commonwealth Government to seek to carry out its international policy otherwise. For that reason, I welcome any procedure which is likely to bring about closer contacts be tween Australia and New Zealand in relation to international matters, because many important problems will arise for determination in the immediate future. But I am also conscious of the fact that Australia and New Zealand do not represent a very big force in international affairs. If those two countries are to achieve the things which they desire to bring about, they must necessarily rely in some measure for their defence upon the help of other peoples. My belief is that Australia and New Zealand will gain the greatest measure of security by continuing their association as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. By that I mean not merely that the two Dominions should be members of that great association in name, but also that they should be anxious at all times to collaborate with the Government and the people of Great Britain and of the sister Dominions in matters which are of common concern to every member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. If that be a sound approach to these problems, it seems to me that we are proceeding along a curious path if, when we should seek the co-operation of all members of that Commonwealth in pursuance of a common policy, two members - Australia and New Zealand - publicly set out a number of propositions which, apparently, they wish to lay down as the international law which should operate in the Pacific area. I find it exceedingly difficult to justify that conduct in present circumstances. I can well understand Australian and New Zealand Ministers exchanging ideas, but they will not get very far by themselves. They can achieve success in the direction they desire to go only if they also have the collaboration and approval of the Government of Great Britain, and, we hope, in as many respects as possible, of the Government of the United States of America. It does not seem to me that we enhance the possibility of getting the assistance and co-operation of the Government of the United States of America by entering into a quite unnecessary agreement which lays down a number of principles which we have not discussed with the Governments of either the United States of America or Great Britain, and with which they may not be in entire agreement, or to some of which they may in fact be opposed. We are not in a position to lay down our own law with regard to these matters. We need for our protection, and for the achievement of the policy which we desire to pursue, the assistance of other governments and other peoples. It seems to me somewhat presumptuous on the part of the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New Zealand to state in a formal agreement that they will call a conference of the Pacific powers. That does not seem to me to be the line of approach which is most likely to bring about a conference of Pacific powers and to produce satisfactory results. </para>

That would be more likely to lead to success than the adoption of a presumptuous attitude by governments representing 7,000,000 people in Australia and 1,000,000 or so in New Zealand by announcing that they intended to call the great nations together to discuss Pacific problems. Clause 34 of the agreement appears to be about as presumptuous a statement as one could imagine in an international document of this kind. It states that Australia and New Zealand are to call into conference representatives of  His  Majesty##'##s Government in the United Kingdom, the Government of the United States of America, the Government of the Netherlands, the French Committee of National Liberation, and the Government of Portugal, and that  His  Majesty##'##s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia is to take the necessary steps to call this conference together. If it were not so serious to find the Commonwealth Government acting in that way, the position would be farcical, but inexperienced men who happen to be in control of our affairs to-day do not seem to realize that there are. ways in which these things can be achieved without rushing into print and publishing to the world at large statements such as those contained in the agreement, thus, perhaps, offending the very people whose ##'##collaboration we desire to get.

                                <para>- It is trying to wag four dogs. The reference throughout the agreement to the French Committee of National Liberation appears to me to be very undesirable in present circumstances. Apparently, it is assumed that, after the war, the French republic will still have interests in the particular part of the Pacific region with which we are concerned. That may well be so. I do not suggest for a moment that it would be undesirable that France should retain its interests in this area, but are the people of Australia and New Zealand in a position to determine that for themselves? Is not that, perhaps, one of the important questions which must be determined at a peace conference? Should other governments having much greater power in international affairs than Australia then determine that these interests of the French Republic are not to continue in the Pacific, shall we, by virtue of this agreement, be bound to resist those views? That is surely a matter which at this stage should not be discussed between the Governments of Australia and New Zealand in the form of a declaration of principles in a public agreement. The representatives of those governments may very properly hold the view that it is most desirable that the French  possessions  in the Pacific should be restored to the French Republic after the war. That may be their honest view, and it may be a correct view; but such a view should not be expressed at this time in a public agreement like this. It should be discussed with the representatives of the governments of the United Nations, as those governments are interested in this very problem. We might do some very valuable work if the representatives of Australia and New Zealand made representations to the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America that, in their view, French territories should be restored to the French Republic. At the moment, F am not discussing that issue, but should that be the view of these two governments the proper place in which those representations should be made is through diplomatic channels and with the representatives of the governments concerned. We do not do our own cause or the cause of the French Committee of Liberation any good by taking this step. </para>

                                <para>- We do not do our own cause or the cause of the French Committee of Liberation any good by making public matters of this kind. ##[## have not so much faith as some people have in the conception that all international agreements should be negotiated in the open, and that everybody should see from day to day what is going on. There is a good deal to be said in the international sphere at least for preparing the way and carrying on negotiations with one party .and another party behind closed doors. In the long run that method is likely to prove more effective for the Commonwealth of Australia than rushing into an agreement of this kind which states a number of  prinples  which we are not in a position to put into effect, but in relation to which we must obtain the support of great allies; and to obtain their support we must first obtain their agreement. Let me refer to one of Ihe other pretensions contained in this document. The two governments purport to lay down in this document the method by which civil aviation is to be controlled after the war. </para>

                                <para>- I agree; I have already said that. But great harm is done when, before we have obtained the support of other governments whose support is necessary if we are to achieve our objectives, we put out to the world the fact that these are the things we are going to fight for, and shall insist upon having. Can any one imagine anything more difficult at present than a consideration of what is to be the best method of controlling civil aviation after the war? It is very proper that the Commonwealth Government should direct its attention to that matter, and that the New Zealand Government should confer with the Commonwealth Government on it; but why enter into a public agreement which says that control is to be vested in an international air transport authority, and suggests that international air services are to be conducted by government enterprise, and not by some other form of control. I am not discussing whether the proposition is sound or unsound. What I do say is that it i9 ludicrous for Australia and New Zealand to pretend to lay down what is going to be the law governing the control of civil aviation after the war. </para>

                            The honorable senator is usually in favour of any proposal which this Government puts forward whether he believes in it or not. We shall assume that, following his usual course, he would wholeheartedly support the principles laid down in this agreement. Does he seriously think that the course which is stated here to be the course which Australia and New Zealand favour, is supported by our blatantly stating the policy which we intend to pursue without first consulting the other governments concerned.

                                <para>- I know that, because the Governments of the other United Nations have not consented to this agreement. If it be a fact that the Commonwealth Government has been able to so impress its will upon the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America that it has induced those two Governments to accept its point of view, I cannot believe that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> is keeping that great event a secret. This trumpery agreement - that is all it amounts to - between Australia and New Zealand was hailed as an historic event. It was signed on a special table with a special pen, and cinemas and photographers were on the spot to make a record of the historic occasion. I cannot believe that if agreement had been reached not only with New Zealand, but also with the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America in relation to this matter, that fact would not have been made the occasion of a great public event, and heralded throughout the land as one of the major achieve ments of the gentleman who happens to control the External Affairs Department of this country at the present time. All that we can assume from this is that the only agreement on this matter is one between Australia and New Zealand. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly, that is what I have been saying all along - that that is all that it pretends to be. The important thing is that this is an agreement between these two Governments in relation to a matter which they are of necessity unable by their own power to bring to fruition. They can achieve what they desire in respect of civil aviation only if they do get the consent and approval of that policy of the Governments of the other United Nations, and in particular of the Governments of Great Britain and the United States of America. </para>

                                <para>- I shall be glad to hear what the Minister has to say about it. I should like him to inform the Senate whether there has been any interference by the censor with communications to Australia purporting to state the views of certain American publicists and members of Congress in  relation to this agreement. It is extraordinary that, although discussion of this matter appears to have been going on, very little of the American discussion has appeared in the Australian press, and the most that we get is an occasional comment that appears to be favorable. I realize that this Government is very conscious of criticism - very susceptible to it. </para>

It is named <inline font-style="italic">From Suez to Singapore,</inline> by Cecil Brown, an American author, who visited this country. The only justification for this censorship appears to be the fact that in it the author refers to what he describes as ##"## <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt##'##s</inline> bitterly anti-English attitude ##"##, that it does not show up the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> in a very favorable light, and happens to contain some criticism of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and some adulation of the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline></para>

I cannot even obtain a copy of it in the library of this Parliament, so, having regard to the fact that the Government has taken that action in respect of abook, I can well understand that, when it finds an American newspaper making caustic reflections about this agreement, it takes good care that I cannot read them in an Australian newspaper, for fear that they might undermine the prestige of the Government. I am therefore not impressed when the Leader of the Senate tells me that the comments overseas have been favorable. </para>

If we could balance them up we should probably find that there were far more unfavorable than favorable comments on this agreement. It is in every respect a most unfortunate document. All or a great deal of the . good that can be achieved - and I do not deny that it can be achieved - by close consultation between New Zealand Ministers and Commonwealth Ministers is destroyed when we proceed to record their agreement in a public document, and notify the world at large that one of the things we seek to achieve is to lay down rules and laws not only for ourselves, but for other countries with whom we have not consulted and whose consent has not been obtained. </para>

That is most desirable. But what I complain about is that apparently, in order to give this agreement an aroma of importance, decisions which were reached between these Ministers and which, at this time, could have remained secret, have been recorded in a public document in such a way as to give offence to nations whose assistance we need and must seek. By giving that offence, we render it less likely that we, together with our sister dominion, will achieve the ends which we seek to achieve, or promote to the greatest possible extent our own well-being in the settlement of these difficult problems. </para>

                        <para class="block">Australia and New Zealand has been most cordial for a long period.  The comradeship of Australian and New Zealand soldiers during the last war, in itself, was sufficient to create everlasting sympathy and kinship between us. I am sure that the Australian people wish for the continuance of these very happy relations. It is well known to the Australian people that, since the outbreak of war, continuous and cordial consultations have been taking place between representatives of Australia and New Zealand. I can assure the Senate that as a Minister in the Menzies Government, controlling the Departments of Munitions and Supply and Development, I had personal experience of some of these consultations. Whilst Australia itself was not a highly industrialized country at the outbreak of war - it is, of course, much more industrialized now - we had a greater volume and variety of manufacturing industries in this country than did New Zealand, and consequently it was inevitable that New Zealand, owing to its own lack of industrial capacity, should look to Australia, Great Britain, the other dominions, and the United States of America for material, equipment, and general assistance. I am sure that the people of this country are fully aware that during the whole period of the war New Zealand has received from this country the greatest possible consideration and assistance. From time to time Ministers have made public statements supporting that view. Consequently, the people of this country must have been surprised and even confused to learn that, at this late stage of the war, the Commonwealth Government should have felt obliged to invite representatives of New Zealand to this country to engage in consultations and, as we now find, to make an agreement. </para>
                        <para> One of the outstanding features of this Government##'##s policy - I admit that it has been a traditional feature of the Labour party for a long time - is its isolationism. We had hoped that with the responsibility and the knowledge which fell to the lot of present Ministers when they assumed office, they would have realized the futility of continuing their isolationist attitude; but one of the first things that the Government did when it assumed office, even in the midst of a war, was to ratify the Statute of Westminster, for the sole purpose of illustrating to the world Australia##'##s independence. </para>

                                <para>- My view is strengthened by the interjections of honorable senators opposite. Apparently they believe that although we are in the midst of a war in which we have no hope of survival without the assistance of the British Empire and our other Allies, we should flaunt to the world our puny ideas of independence. However, we did hope that, after further experience, the Government would have recognized the futility, weakness, and even the danger, of the policy of isolationism, and so I personally was very concerned when I read in the newspapers of what was taking place in Canberra some weeks ago. I was even more concerned when I learned what had resulted from these consultations, because if there is one thing that has now been made abundantly clear to the rest of the world, it is the fact that this Government has reverted to its policy of isolationism. Admittedly, that isolationism has been extended from Australia itself to include the Dominion of New Zealand, but the fact remains that the Governments of these two countries have announced to the world that they intend to create in this area of the Pacific a group which, according to the terms of the agreement, is to be paramount in certain directions. I realize, of course, that Labour politics are governed largely by groups. The ordinary citizen gets a very raw deal from Labour governments, unless he is a member of an organized group, and I am not surprised to find that group control which operates in Australia is to be given effect outside Australia also. The signatories to the agreement have stated, in effect, that they intend to establish a regional group which will decide the affairs of the particular area in which it operates. It is generally recognized that Australia and New Zealand have been very fortunate during the whole of their history in that they have been able to develop under the protection of the British Empire. It is recognized also. </para>

                        <para class="block">I think, by most reasonable people, that that happy position cannot, and will not, continue after this war. Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, the British Empire, which is based mainly upon the strength of Great Britain itself, cannot possibly give to us the same protection in the future that we have enjoyed in the past. I am not suggesting for one moment that because of that altered relationship we should endeavour to loosen the ties which bind us to the Old Country and the Empire generally; I am merely stating that these new conditions will make it more essential that we should have a solid foundation for our hope of <inline font-style="italic">security in the future.</inline> We know to our sorrow that after the last war efforts were made to establish permanent peace throughout the world. Because of an almost fanatical adherence to that idea, Great Britain and some other nations allowed their defences to fall below a reasonable margin of safety. The League of Nations had the real support of a large number of people, find also the lip-service of others; but when the time for action came it proved <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be helpless. The <inline font-style="italic">only</inline> basis upon which we can obtain world peace is by an organic union, such as already exists among the components of the British Empire, and which I hope will continue in the future. Having maintained our membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations, we must go farther in the future; we must realize that the Pacific area is of great interest to Australia, Canada, India and other British countries. Fortunately for us, that area is of interest to some other nations also, particularly the United States of America and China. Consequently, it will be necessary for Australia, as a partner in the British Empire, not only to stand four-square with other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, but also to secure the support of the United States of America and China. No honorable senator will suggest that the approach which has been made to this subject in the Australian-New Zealand pact is likely to find much favour in either of the two nations that I have mentioned. In addition to them, Russia will have a big interest in the Pacific area in the future. At the moment, owing to the fact that Russia is not at war with Japan, Russia##'##s interest in this area is not so apparent as it will be in the future. It cannot be denied that when Japan entered the war Australia was largely unprepared. I say that as a Minister in a Government which had been in power since the war broke out in Europe. That Government believed that it was its duty to make available forces and equipment where they were most needed. But when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour, and the trend of the war took an unpredicted course, the position of this country became precarious. There is no question about that. I have no complaint to make with the action of the present Prime Minister in appealing to the United States of America for help, although I deeply resent the manner of his appeal. . I suggest, moreover, that the right honorable gentleman knew that that help would be forthcoming; he was not ignorant of the strategic plans that were then in hand. Following his appeal, the United States of America and Great Britain sent to Australia all the assistance of which those countries were capable. Every one will admit that the forces sent to our aid at that time saved Australia from invasion by Japanese troops. But after the clanger of invasion had passed, Australia becamesomewhat arrogant and dictatorial. That may have been due to the exuberance of youth, but I regard it as pure effrontery for Australia to attempt to lay down what is to be done in certain directions, as, for instance, in relation to the future of New Caledonia. </para>

                                <para>- No. The Governments of those two countries have said, in effect, that no changes must be made without their full concurrence. That may be a laudable idea, hut it is not something which we should wave in the face of the people who are now fighting to obtain possession of various areas in the Pacific. It is useless for the Leader of the Senate to say that the reactions to the pact have been favorable. We know that Great Britain  has had centuries of experience with colonies and dominions which have got a little bit out of hand; indeed, it is because of the tact of the British authorities in handling awkward situations of that kind that the Empire has held together foi##"## so long. We know that, although the British Government ##"##was not invited to send a representative to the conference, some British newspapers applauded the agreement when it was published. No doubt the Attorney-General could refer to the generous attitude towards the agreement of such newspapers as <inline font-style="italic">The Times</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Observer,</inline> but I suggest that when the Prime Minister reaches London something less generous will be said to him. I do not suggest that what will be said will be made public; but one of the jobs which await the right honorable gentleman is that of explaining the agreement. That task will be an unnecessary addition to his already onerous duties. I wish to draw attention to  some  comments regarding the pact which have appeared in newspapers published in the United  States  of America, a country which I suggest is of importance to the future welfare of Australia. </para>

Great difficulty has been experienced in the last few months in obtaining the necessary man-power for essential services in this country, so we could reasonably expect that the Government would take early steps to rationalize man-power so that more labour could be made available than at present for essential services. </para>

                                <para>- I am keenly interested in that matter because Australia is the only country engaged in the present war which considers that it can carry out its war effort on the extravagant and inefficient and morale-breaking system of two separate armies. I am aware the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has said that 86 per cent, of the able-bodied men in the Army have volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force, but he did not say how many of them were now in the Australian Imperial Force, and how many had been refused admission to the Australian Imperial Force because of the disastrous system which has operated here. If there is any suggestion that something should be said about this rather appalling position we immediately find that the people of this country - I do not say that we are deluding the people of other countries - are not to be permitted to know the facts. The censorship is imposed, not for the security of this country, but the security of this Government, which prevents the people from knowing the true position. I have before me an example of the censor##'##s art in deleting unpalatable passages from matter awaiting publication. </para>

                        <para>In my view we have not a common doctrine in that sense operating in Australia at present. Whereas New Zealand has a one-army organization by which it increases army efficiency and conserves man-power, Australia has a different system. I was just saying that the public of Australia do not know how extravagant and inefficient our two-army system is ; in order that the public shall not be told of that fact the Government gave instructions to the censor to excise certain passages from the article which I propose to read. I am endeavouring to show that our one-army system is completely out of harmony with the terms of the agreement. Yet that state of affairs is condoned by the Government, and in order that the public shall not learn of the inefficiency of the present <inline font-style="italic">system,</inline> and its adverse effect upon the morale of our men, such statements as I propose to read have, under instructions from the Government, been excised by the censor.

                                <para>- I hope that the Government is sincere in making this agreement. I believe that it is. I believe that any weaknesses in the agreement :ire due not to lack of sincerity on the part of the Government but to its youthful exuberance and lack of experience in the diplomatic field. This subject forms an important part of the agreement. I am raising these matters because I want f-o know whether the Government intends  to  carry out those parts of the agreement which, while not affecting other countries, vitally affect this country. Whilst I do not suggest that Australia will exercise very great influence at the peace table, nevertheless it is in control in this country and, therefore, has the power to operate any provision of this agreement by deed as well as by word. So far, however, I have not seen any evidence at all that the Government has departed one inch from the Army administration policy which it pursued prior to the signing of this agreement. The censorship is being used to keep the people in ignorance of our present military set-up, and to hide from them the fact that that organization is entirely out of Une with this agreement, and adversely affects our war effort. Therefore, I think that it is only reasonable that I should be allowed to draw attention to actions of the Government which arc designed not in the interests of the security of this country, but in the interests of the security of the Government itself. In view of this evidence I can hardly hope for a change of policy on the part of the Government in respect of the organization, equipment, training and exercising of the armed forces under a common doctrine as prescribed in the agreement. Therefore, I submit that it is germane to a debate on this matter to explain to the people exactly the difference that exists between our military set-up and that of New Zealand, and the manner in which our inefficiency in this respect can be remedied. However, it cannot be remedied unless this Government takes appropriate action. The article continues- </para>

                                <para>- So far as my reading of the agreement goes I do not think that it deals with the policies of the respective Governments with regard to the set-up of their Army organizations. I do not think that there is anything in the agreement with regard to a two-army system in Australia as distinct from -a one-army system in New Zealand. Common agreement is reached in respect of the defence of Australia and New Zealand. </para>

Having admitted that the two Governments are not in line, what does our Government propose to do about it? It seems ##'##to me, judging by the action which it has taken to keep people in ignorance of the actual set-up, and of its effects, that it does not propose to do anything to put that portion of the agreement into force. When the Government deletes from an article written on the subject of the Militia and the. Australian Imperial Force, passages such as I have already read to the Senate, it docs not give me any hope that it really intends to do what it undertook to do. I shall not weary the Senate with very much more of this; but I think that I should be allowed toread the following paragraph in the censored article :  - </para>

                                <para>- As I have pointed out, the agreement is a definite affront to all those people whose friendship we need now, and shall need to a degree quite as great in the future. I have no doubt that one of the big tasks which the Prime Minister will have to undertake during his trip abroad will be to explain away some of ##'##those things which have been incorporated and blazoned forth to the world in this agreement. I have no doubt that he will find it very difficult. Apart altogether from the actual substance of the agreement, the way in which it was publicized in Canberra, at the time of the meeting of the conference, has never been paralleled in this or any other country. We had the spectacle of the two less populous dominions setting out - no doubt because their Governments have common political views - to decide the policy which they hope will he discussed and adopted at the Peace Conference. It seems to me that theurge by the Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs for publicity ##'##and prestige has not brought any prestige to Australia. It was the greatest bit of burlesque, or theatrical dramatism, that has probably ever taken place in this country. The display of moving pictures of the conference, and the publicity in advertising the signing of this agreement, which, in fact, has no effect on the course of the war and will have, I suggest, no effect on the Peace Conference proceedings, showed how completely the Prime Minister and Minister for <inline font-style="italic">##'##External</inline> Affairs were out of step with realities. </para>

                                <para>- The people, unfortunately, make mistakes, because they are human, but the hopeful fact is that they will have in the future an opportunity to decide these questions again, what has been done will not add lustre to Australia##'##s performance in the war. It will not strengthen the hands of Australia##'##s representatives at the Peace Conference, but, before it is too late, it is as well that those countries which have taken real exception to what has been done should be told that, while the agreement is the child of this Government, which recently returned with a substantial majority from the polls, this agreement was not one of the matters upon which the people of Australia voted on that occasion. They should be told that the Australian people are not so out of stop with realities as to believe that Australia can dictate peace terms and final arrangements regarding the disposition of troops, and of territories regardless of what other nations may desire. Not only do we rely now on the assistance of Great Britain and the United States of America, but in the future it will be necessary to do so. None of us can look very far ahead, but I remind the Senate that there are to the north of Australia countries with populations totalling over 1,000,000,000 people, whose living standard is much lower than ours. Those millions are land and commodity hungry, and as they develop, they will cost their eyes farther afield. If, when they do so, Australia has to rely on its own power, it will be overwhelmed. It is a vital mistake that the Government should pursue its policy of creating power groups, and that certain Ministers, including the Prime Minister and the Ministerfor External Affairs, should be so overwhelmed by affairs on the other side of the world, that they should wish to push themselves into the public gaze by taking a step such as this, which I consider is completely out of line with the concensus of opinion in this country, and is not in the best interests of Australia or New Zealand. </para>

It concerns a soldier, who was discharged after serving three and a half years. Within three weeks of his discharge, his mortgagor sent a request for payment.
