I had intended to submit a formal motion for the adjournment of the Senate, in order to direct attention to this matter; but, with a view to expediting the business of the Senate, the present sittings of which will conclude shortly, I decided to seek leave to make a statement. I. have received a communication from the Electrical and Radio Federation, Queensland, regarding the treatment of one of the members of its organization by the Queensland Branch of the Department of war Organization of Industry. The letter states - </para>

          <para>This federation wishes to bring to your notice, with the object of making suitable representations, a matter that is considered a grave injustice in regard to the implementation of the Control of Radio Service Order. </para>
          <para>Under this order all radio service firms and all available radio mechanics were listed and licensed by the Department of War Organization of Industry, and in due course all firms were given their licences with the names thereon of the mechanics allotted to them. </para>
          <para>Weare, therefore, gravely concerned over the principle involved by the policy adopted by the War Organization of Industry in this State. The example we wish to cite is the case of one of our members who conducts one of the oldest established radio service firms in Queensland. They were officially licensed by the Department of War Organization of Industry and the four mechanics allotted to them named. Two months ago one of these mechanics left, and although application was immediately made to the War Organization of Industry (who control the allocation of mechanics) for a replacement, up to date they have been unable to find one, giving the reason that there arc no men available. In face of this situation, the War Organization of Industry approved of an application by two of the licensed mechanics of this firm to be granted licences to start out in business as independent servicemen. The men concerned have, therefore, given notice to terminate their employment. </para>

The Minister is not the Leader of the Senate, although he was formerly. He has been  removed from that position by a vote of his own party.

It is recognized that the Senate is always at some disadvantage in the handling of business compared with the House of Representatives. From time to time, suggestions have been made that more legislation should be initiated in this chamber. I think that all honorable senators are agreed that it is desirable to discuss here as much of the business of the Parliament as possible early in each sessional period, rather than have to wait for business to come here from the other chamber. This is a matter which is under consideration, and it is hoped that in the next sessional period there will be an improvement. </para>

          <para>. -  I regret the necessity to address the Senate on the motion for the adjournment, but I am impelled to do so because of statements which reflected on my personal honour and integrity which were made here by an honorable senator yesterday. Unfortunately, I was not in the chamber when those statements were made, but I have perused an uncorrected proof of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> containing them, and I am amazedthat any one should make such a vile accusation against me. I should like the honorable senator to repeat, before witnesses, outside this Parliament what he said here, because then I should have my remedy. He mentioned my connexion with an organization that was created for a special purpose in, Tasmania about twenty years ago. He said that I had collected moneys on behalf of that association, and that no one else knew what had become of those moneys because the organization had never issued a balancesheet. The inference is clear, namely, that there was something discreditable in my actions. I shall state briefly the history of the organization. It came into being for a special purpose. Tasmania had been badly treated, in that there were frequent shipping disputes which caused much inconvenience and loss to that State. The coastal provisions of the Navigation Act operated to the detriment of Tasmania. People were leaving Tasmania for the mainland and the population of the State was falling. In order to check that retrograde movement the citizens of Tasmania decided to form a purely voluntary organization which would work in the interests of their State. Many leading citizens, of whom the late exSenator Grant was one of the most prominent, were associated with it. I, too, was a member. The organization sought to bring to the notice of the Bruce-Page Government the position of Tasmania, as a member of the federation, about which the people felt so keenly that there was talk of seceding from the Commonwealth. The organization was a great success. In its interests I visited almost every municipality in Tasmania to organize the people in the interests of the State, with the result that in January, 1926, a petition was presented to the House of Representatives by the then honorable member for Bass, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson.</inline> It contained over 13,000 signatures, all of which were&#34; genuine. As the result of the agitation, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline></para>

        <para class="block">Nicholas Lockyer was sent to Tasmania in February, 1926, and, following his visit, a grant of &#163;378,000 was made to Tasmania by the Commonwealth. Having achieved its purpose, the organization ceased to exist. I emphasize that it was a properly constituted body, and that its accounts were audited by a firm of chartered accountants in Hobart, which found that every penny collected had been properly accounted for. The statement made in this chamber, and the insinuations of the honorable senator who made it, were most vile. I was associated with the Tasmanian Eights League for about five months - from April to August, 1925, as assistant secretary and travelling organizer. The honorable senator stated that membership of the association cost 5s. ; the membership fee was only 2s. 6d. A considerable sum was expended in propaganda, office rent and expenses incurred by and on behalf of the secretary. The statement that no balance-sheet of the organization was ever produced, and that I was the only person who knew what became of the moneys collected, is a vile one. The honorable senator went on to say that some day I might explain what became of the money that I collected. I suggest that he should visit the firm of chartered accountants in Hobart who Audited the books of the organization and see for himself what became of the money. There is no truth whatever in what he said, and for any man to go back twenty years and rake up filth of this description is something of which I did not thing that any honorable senator would be guilty. The statement that I used the Tasmanian Eights League to assist me in my candidature for the Senate is entirely incorrect. At the time that I decided to contest the Senate election I was not a member of the league. I had previously resigned from that body, and also from the position of local  president  of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia. I contested the election at the request of a number of returned soldiers and others. The Tasmanian Eights League was entirely non-political; its members included persons of all shades of political thought. They were concerned, not with party political matters, but with the interests of their State. Fortunately, our efforts were successful. As I have said, the league disbanded after having achieved its object. </para>

          <para>. - It has become a custom to initiate almost all legislative proposals in the House of Representatives. I recognize that that is necessary in respect of measures which involve the appropriation of public moneys, but the practice sometimes means that the Senate has little business to perform, and adjourns soon after honorable senators have, been called together. Those adjournments are frequently not of sufficient duration to enable honorable senators from distant States to return to their homes, and, consequently, through no fault of their own, they have to &#34; stand by &#34;. I realize that the first duty of legislators is to the nation, but I suggest that consideration be given to the initiation in this chamber of legislation not involving the expenditure of public moneys, and also that subjects of great national importance be brought forward here so that honorable senators may have an opportunity to discuss them. That would tend to raise the prestige of the Senate. During the 22 or 23 years that I have been a member of the Senate the practice of initiating legislation in the other chamber has been followed. Under the present procedure the Senate does not count. Even bills which could very well be introduced in the  Senate  are first debated in the House of Representatives. with the result that when such measures reach this chamber we receive from Ministers only a rehash of the Government&#39;s views. At the same time, the subjects have lost all news interest to the public, and, consequently, discussions on such measures in this chamber are practically of no interest to any one. It is the duty of the Senate to preserve the dignity of this branch of the legislature. On Wednesday last, the Appropriation Bill was introduced, and, following the usual practice, its consideration was rushed. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We had to stage a sort of field night in our attempt to deal intelligently with it. No honorable senator can say  that that is the proper way to discuss the country&#39;s finances, which, in fact, are the foundation of our welfare. The Leader of the Senate should press for an alteration of the present procedure of submitting business to the Senate, bearing in mind the necessity for preserving the dignity of this chamber. Several important bills which have been on the notice-paper of the House of Representatives for some weeks could have been thoroughly discussed by now in this chamber, but they have not reached us owing to the pressure of other business in the House of Representatives. Two of those measures deal with very important subjects, upon the consideration of which we could have employed ourselves to the advantage of the people during the time we have been obliged to waste during the past few weeks. </para>

          <para>. - When I was speaking on the motion for the first reading of the Appropriation Bill, I dealt at length with the growing problem presented by soldiers going absent without leave. Although I made those remarks only a few days ago, I have already received numbers of letters from soldiers themselves and parents of soldiers. This fact reveals that the subject is urgently exercising the minds of many people. Therefore, I again urge the Government to investigate this problem as soon as possible. Such an investigation should not be entrusted solely to those in charge of military affairs, but should be considered by the War Cabinet also. As I said previously, many soldiers start off by being absent without leave for a few days, and, as the result of fines and periods of detention, during which they receive no pay, they very soon incur substantial debits in their pay-book; and the knowledge that they will have to wait for many months to make up that leeway deters them from returning to their units. What is still more unfortunate is that many of these men who are anxious to return to their units are, more or less, fugitives from justice, because they know that provosts are looking for them. Therefore, they do not like to run the risk of taking a job. I admit, of course, that a number of men who habitually go absent without leave have bad military records. I again urge the Government to consider making a special appeal to all men now absent without leave to return voluntarily to their units, and give an opportunity to large numbers to turn over a new leaf on the understanding that, provided they incur no black mark for a certain period, they will be given an entirely clean sheet in respect of past offences. </para>

          <para>. -  The matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> undoubtedly calls for urgent attention. I am not in possession of any figures on the subject, but the matter must be handled with the greatest possible caution. If it is a fact that great wastage is occurring as the result of men going absent without leave, the efficiency of the armed forces must suffer correspondingly. In one army at one stage in the last war, one-third of the personnel were listed as sick, or wounded in hospital, one-third were absent without leave or for other reasons involving breaches of discipline, and only one-third were available for the purposes of the campaign. In this matter, it is, primarily, the responsibility of our military leaders to find a solution; and, if the Government is dissatisfied with the present position, its proper course is to instruct them to effect an improvement as quickly as possible. </para>

For instance, the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission was not made available to honorable senators before the introduction of the States Grants Bill. In those circumstances, no honorable senator could be expected to study the proposals of the Government properly. I welcome the intimation by theLeader of the Senate that he will give consideration to this matter. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>On the 20th June, 1944, I was retired from the position of station master at Tallarook, Victoria, by the Victorian Railways Commissioners, sixteen months before I attained the retiring ago of Co years, on account of dangerously high blood pressure and failure of vision, on a superannuation of &#163;2 per week - my sole income. </para>
          <para>Besides having paid for this superannuation by my contributions, I put all my life&#39;s savings into a small suitable home situated at 3 Napier-street, Mentone, Victoria, for purpose of retiring into for self, wife and two daughters. I recently spent over &#163;200 upon renovating, repairing, improving, painting, and sewerage, &#38;c, and even installed new window blinds right through the house and also new globes and shades for electric light in every room. Power point was placed in kitchen, where already gas and fire stove were located. It was duly passed by the Housing Commission and I had a tenant placed in same at the low rental of 25s. per week, and rent was kept specially low so that no hardship would be inflicted on tenants. House consists of six (C) rooms, bathroom, washhouse and a semi-enclosed verandah capable of holding four singlebeds easily as a sleepout, thus equalling nine (9) rooms. I have had three tenants, the present ones being <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. and Mrs. Henry,</inline> who took possession in June, 1943. </para>
          <para>Immediately upon retirement I got in touch with tenants and placed my position before them. They agreed to vacate house if I obtained a suitable house for them. After searching district I could find no house. I then offered to share house with them until they could be placed. They definitely refused stating place was too small for two families. I then took legal proceedings to secure possession of my own house as the departmental house in which I am still residing is required for my successor in office, who has his furniture stored here meanwhile. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Henry</inline> considered herself insulted when I kindly asked her to vacate house, and definitely refused service of writ of ejectment telling me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> was the correct person to be served at the house. Upon attempting to serve notice on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> at his job, he also refused to accept service and told me to get to hell out of it and that I wanted a lift under the bloody jaw. I immediately saw the constable in charge at police station, Mentone, and under his protection I served the notice at the house. </para>
          <para>On Friday, the 22nd September, 1944, the case was tried before Judge Gavan Duffy, who decided in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Henry,</inline> who is receiving an allotment from her son at the front, this being her income. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry,</inline> who was working when I instituted proceedings, stated he had received an injury at work and could work no more, and has applied for the old-age pension, thus securing a point over me through hardship. During July accommodation was secured for tenants but they refused to occupy same. I may state that no other house can be secured at Mentone or district, in same class and condition, as cheap as therent I charged. </para>
          <para>Practically all the small amount of cash I had on hand hasbeen used in this prosecution. </para>
          <para>The railway department is going to eject me from their premises, and I have no money to fight them, so I will be tipped out on the street with absolutely no prospect whatsoever of keeping my family anywhere. I may state that my two daughters are boarding at the Y.W.C.A., Richmond, and the younger aged seventeen has to be assisted by me out of my &#163;2 per week. The railways charge me 17s. 6d. per week rent. I am left with 22s. 6s. per week to live on. What a hopeless prospect! The 25s. per week rent is of practically no use to me, as after paying commission, rates and taxes on property there is hardly enough left for repairs. </para>
          <para>I may state that I have been a good officer of the railways for 46 years and have an absolutely clean record.When the war commenced Tallarook became one of the key positions for military movements. Being of&#34; absolute British descent for generationsI whole-heartedly rose to the occasion and for three years never worked so hard in my life before, Sundays included, the result being that the excessive strain at my age of 60 has proved too much and my life&#39;s work is finished. </para>
          <para>I understand from the judge&#39;s ruling that his only course was to give verdict to my tenants as under the National Security Regulations the allotment clinched the whole matter. Surely in my case the National Security Regulations were not meant to apply. I have lived within the law all my life and have followed out the best traditions of British practice in that I have made provision for my old age. This provision is denied me. I have lost my home. To me this condition is calamitous. </para>
          <para>I am sending this circular- letter to all federal members in the hope that my case&#39; will be looked into by them, as this is an absolute super tax on my life&#39;s savings, in that I am barred from its provision and am forced to allow another person to enjoy its benefits. If my tenants are in necessitous circumstances, the simple fact remains that I did not receive sufficient salary during my life to keep another family. Cannot the Government make arrangements for these people and allow me to occupy my own house? In the name of British justice I sincerely ask that my case be looked into. </para>
          <para class="block">I shall he pleased if the appropriate Minister will give consideration to the necessity of meeting such cases as this. I know that the housing question is most vexatious and difficult, and that hut for the landlord and tenant regulations there would probably have been wholesale evictions of reputable tenants by unscrupulous landlords who were seeking increased rentals, but cases of this kind merit serious consideration, andI trust that something will be. done by the Government as the result of my representations. </para>

            <para>- All the landlord and tenant regulations are at present under consideration with a view to proposed amendments, some of which are to help the landlord and others to help the tenant. As the honorable senator said, if there is any part of the price- fixing policy which has been 100 per cent, successful it is the control of rents. House rents are relatively easy to control now, as we caused them all to be pegged as from December, 1939. The fair rents courts are open to everybody free of cost, and any person who has a grievance with regard to a flat, room or house has merely to go to the local clerk of the court and state it. Thereupon the magistrate sits in a room to which no lawyers are admitted, the applicant and the landlord state their cases, if necessary the magistrate views the house, and he then makes his award on the spot. In the old days it would have cost a litigant at least &#163;8 in fees and other costs to have his claim heard, perhaps for the reduction of his room rent by a few shillings a week. The real trouble is that housing conditions are appalling, and I see no prospect of their immediate or early improvement. People have been attracted from all parts of the country, which badly needs population, into the already overcrowded cities, where accommodation was already inadequate. Decentralization is imperative in order to get the people out of the cities, and the Government will, as opportunity offers, continue to give effect to its announced policy in that direction. It is a waste of money and man-power to abolish slum areas and then rebuild slums on the same spot. The matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> will have the early attention of the Attorney-General. </para>
