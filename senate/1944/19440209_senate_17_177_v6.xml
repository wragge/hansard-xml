He was elected to the House of Representatives for the division of Fawkner, Victoria, at the general elections in 1906, and was re-elected in 1910. He was elected to the Senate as a representative of Victoria in 1917. He was a member of the Public Accounts Committee from September, 1917, to May, 1918. He did not seek re-election in 1922, and retired from the Senate on the 30th June, 1923. He was Agent-General for Victoria in London from 1924 to 1927, and he was created a Knight Bachelor in 1926. Many of us will have no personal recollection of the deceased gentleman, but, in keeping with the tradition of the Senate, I move - </para>

By the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Fairbairn a link has been severed with one of the best-known pastoralist families in the Commonwealth. The history of Australia would be incomplete without reference to the name of Fairbairn, both with regard to its pastoral development and its political life. To his widow and family we extend our deepest sympathy in their bereavement.  His  selection as Agent-General for Victoria in London in 1924 was one of the best choices ever made for that appointment, and during the three years he occupied that position he rendered excellent service to his country.  His  death will be widely regretted, because he was one of Australia's leading citizens. </para>

The late ex-Senator had had a parliamentary career extending over a period of more than 40 years. In 1891 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New South "Wales for the electorate of Murrumbidgee, which he represented till 1894. He entered the Commonwealth political sphere in 1910, when he was elected to the Senate as a representative for New South Wales. In 1913 he was a member of the select committee  which inquired into the case of H. China, and he  wa3  also a member of the Select Committee on the Fitzroy Dock. He was re-elected to the Senate at the general elections in 1928. He was a member of the Select Committee on the Standing Committee System which sat in 1919 and 1920. He retired from the Senate in June, 1935. I move - </para>

Before entering the Commonwealth Parliament, he had been a member of the House of Assembly, Tasmania, having been elected to that chamber in 1922 for the electorate of Denison. In July, 1925, he was elected to the Senate as  a  representative of Tasmania at a joint sitting of both Houses of the Parliament of Tasmania, in accordance with section 15 of the Constitution, but was defeated at the next general elections. He was re-elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly for the electorate of Denison at the general elections in 1928, and again in 1931. Ex-Senator Grant  was  Honorary Minister from the 15th June, 1928, to' the 2nd March, 1932, when he was again elected to the Senate hy the Parliament of Tasmania to fill the vacancy caused by the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden.</inline> He was re-elected to the Senate at the general elections in 1934 and was a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees from October, 1935, to December, 1939.

Right up to the time of has death I visited him frequently and on such occasions he never failed to inquire about his former colleagues in this chamber. He was a keen business man who did a great deal for the State of Tasmania which he served with distinction. Until the end he took the keenest interest in public affairs.

          <para>- It is the desire of the members of the Australian Country party to associate themselves with the motion, and to pay tribute to the memory of the deceased gentleman. The late ex-Senator Brennan was a successful advocate at the bar, a clear thinker, a good senator and a capable Minister. He was admired by all. He had a keen analytical mind as well as a delightful sense of humour, so that his extremely interesting speeches were always listened to with rapt attention. Men like him are always greatly missed from such an assembly as this. To his relatives we extend our deepest sympathy. </para>

          <para>. - It is with great regret that I announce to the Senate the death of a former  President  of .the Senate, the Honorable Patrick Joseph Lynch, who died in Western Australia on the 15th January last. The late ex-senator was elected to the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia in June, 1904, for Mount Leonora, which seat he. held till November, 1906, when he resigned. He was Minister for Public Works from June to August, 1905. He was elected to the Senate for Western Australia at the general elections in 1906, and was re-elected in 1913, 1914, 1919, 1925 and 1931. He was a member of the Royal Commission on the Fruit Industry in 1912-14. He was Vice-Chairman of the Public Works Committee from 1914 to 1916. He was the first  Chairman  of the River Murray Waters Commission being appointed to that position in 1916. He was Minister for Works and Railways from November, 1916, to February, 1917. He was a member of the Public Works Committee from July, 1923, to June, 1926. He was also a member of the Select Committee on Standing Committee System which sat in 1929 and 1930. </para>

        <para class="block">I am sure, very deeply regret the passing of ex-Senator Lynch, because nearly all of us were closely associated with him in this chamber. It is fitting that we pay special tribute to his strength of conviction and great courage.  His  long service as a representative of the State of "Western Australia in this Parliament is sincerely appreciated by a great number of Australians. In " Paddy '' Lynch the people of that State had a champion fighter, and the people of the Empire a staunch supporter.

          <para>- As a Western Australian I should like to add to the remarks which have already been made concerning the late ex-Senator Lynch. I had the privilege of knowing him for a considerable number of years, and of serving with him as a colleague. He left his native country at a very early age, and made Australia his home. It would be very difficult to measure the value of the services which he rendered to this his adopted country. The late ex-senator led a very interesting life. It was a very constructive life; and many of the things he achieved for his country will live in the recollection of the present generation. He had his loyalties to which he always adhered uncompromisingly. He was a very loyal churchman; and I have no doubt that he displayed his loyalty not only to his friends, but also to others. I join with honorable senators in extending our deepest sympathy to his widow and family. </para>

          <para>- I add my tribute to the memory of the late ex-Senator Lynch. He had a distinguished career not only in the Parliament of Western Australia, but also in this Parliament. Most of us here will remember him as a former  President.  I shall always remember him as a good, staunch, loyal Western Australian who was always in the forefront in advancing the claims of Western Australia as well as those of the Commonwealth and the British Empire. We shall miss him because he was a great figure in Western Australia where his works will long remain as a monument to his unselfish devotion to a great cause. To his widow, his son and daughters, and their families, I offer my condolence in their bereavement. </para>

          <para>- I should like to add a few remarks concerning the passing of ex-Senator Lynch. Someone has said that death is but the confluence of two eternities, whilst another has said that life is only bottled sunshine and death the silentfooted butler who draws out the cork. I believe that life is far more than that. Schopenhauer once wrote that the principle of life was merely one's will to live; but another German philosopher, Nietzsche, with whose philosophy we may not agree in the main, stated that life is more than the will to live; it is the will to express oneself. I agree with that view. The more forceful individuals in the community look upon life in that way. The late ex-Senator Lynch was a man of powerful character who did not merely exist, or merely subscribe to Schopenhauer's dictum that life is merely the will to live. He exemplified Nietzsche's definition. He expressed his own character, and impressed his personality upon this legislature. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I take the opportunity to speak on this occasion, because, although a change of political fortunes took the late ex-senator away from the party to which he previously owed allegiance, I have happy memories of my association with him in the Senate. I readily recall the fight which he put up on several occasions in this chamber to maintain the right of honorable senators to express their  opinions without restrictions. At one time an effort was made, possibly in all sincerity, to limit unduly the scope of debate. I refer to the attempt to deprive honorable senators of the right, on the motion for the first reading of certain measures, to speak on matters not contained in such measures. I well remember ex-Senator Lynch on that occasion stating that it was only right that the opportunity should be given to honorable senators to express themselves upon matters in which they were interested. Upon another occasion, when an attempt was made to limit the power to grant extensions of time in debate to honorable senators, ex-Senator Lynch bitterly opposed it. He was a colourful character, and a fighter, and it is because he was a fighter, always prepared to say what he believed irrespective of whom he hurt, that I appreciated his work. It is well that we have in this community men who are game enough to express their ideas and their characters by their voices and by their actions. </para>
        <para>We are now waging a fight for freedom of expression. Ex-Senator Lynch throughout his life was one who strongly advocated freedom of expression, and I rose to-day to voice my high appreciation of his work in that direction. I join with other honorable senators in their expressions of sorrow at his passing, and of sympathy with those he has left behind. </para>
