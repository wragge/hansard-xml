          <para>. - Honorable senators will have read with deep regret of the death, at Burnie, Tasmania, on the 5th March, of the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> John Bell, K.C.M.G., a former member of the House of Representatives, who for some years held the high office of  Speaker.  The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Bell was elected to the House of Representatives for the division of Darwin at the general elections in 1919, and was re-elected as the representative of that division at the general elections in 1925, and at all subsequent elections to 1940.

          <para>- I second the motion. The brilliant record of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Bell and our recent association with him in this Parliament are fresh in our memories. We all appreciate the valuable services rendered by him to his country as a soldier, as a Member of Parliament, and as a former  Speaker  of the House' of Representatives, We also admired him as a man and recognized his great strength of character and determination which made him respected by all. sections of the community. On behalf of the Opposition I join with the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> in expressing to the widow and family and the other relatives of tha deceased our deep sympathy in their irreparable loss. </para>

The passing of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Bell is deeply regretted. He was a staunch and loyal friend. As has been mentioned by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> the deceased had a distinguished military career, and served in both the South African War and the last war, in which he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. On his return to Australia he gave over twenty years' service to the public and after many years as a member of the House of Representatives attained the high and distinguished office of  Speaker.  Men of his character set a high standard in public life that provides an example for others to emulate. To the widow and family we tender our deepest sympathy. </para>

          <para>- It is with feelings of deep regret and sorrow that I pay a tribute to my dear old friend and comrade in arms, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Bell. I had known him for well over 40 years and was closely associated with him on the Gallipoli Peninsula in the operations at Pope's Hill and Quinn's Post, and when the Australian Light Horse, leaving their horses in Egypt, came to Gallipoli to reinforce us early in May, 1915. The splendid record of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Bell - it is one of which any man should be proud - is included in the official history of the Australian Imperial Force in the Palestine campaign. He was a great soldier, staunch and determined, always justand fair to his men, but hard on the slacker. I was also associated with him very closely in the Australian Military Forces after the last war, and I always found him to possess the same characteristics as were displayed by him in earlier years. I have a sense of personal loss at the passingof this great Australian. I support the motion expressing sympathy to his widow, sons and daughters in their sorrow. </para>

          <para>- I support the motion now before the Senate. It was my great privilege to know the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Bell for many years. One has exceptional opportunities of appreciating the qualities of a man if he happens to be one's travelling companion, and I became intimately acquainted with the deceased gentleman during many journeys between Tasmania and the mainland, first when the Commonwealth Parliament met in Melbourne and later in Canberra. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Bell was a man of great courage and a keen advocate of the principles which he believed to be right. Many years ago he tookup an area of bush country in Tasmania and converted a dense myrtle forest into a splendid farm on which he built abeautiful home. As in his civil life, so also in his military career, he displayed a strong determination to succeed. We know from those who served with him the great regard that they had for him as a soldier. From his place in this Parliament, too, he fought for these things which he believed to be right. He was ever active in the interests of Tasmania and his efforts on behalf of that State met with considerable success. That he was highly esteemed by those among whom he lived was made clear by the tribute paid to his memory by residents of the district on the occasion of his funeral. Within the last few weeks, similar motions have been carried in connexion with the death of several public men who served their country well ; among them were three former members of this Parliament who represented Tasmania. Truly, it can be said that time marches on. I join with other honorable senators in extending sympathy to the widow and family of the deceased gentleman. </para>

          <para>- I join with other honorable senators in paying tribute to the memory of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Bell. The deceased gentleman will be missed by a large circle of friends and admirers. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays has said, he was a pioneer farmer who converted the virgin hush into productive farm-land. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Bell was not only a good farmer; he was also a good citizen, as the residents of Burnie, where he spent the last years of his life, can testify. The decorations which he wore, and the honours which were conferred upon him for his war services, are evidence of his ability as a soldier. In the performance of his parliamentary duties he set an example to all other honorable members; for his outstandingqualities he was elevated to the highest post in the gift of the House of which he was a member, when he was elected  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. I tender my sincere sympathy to his widow and family. </para>
