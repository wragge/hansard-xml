Since I have never pursued the policy to which he has referred I can have no intention to continue to pursue it. If the honorable senator has in mind a certain incident on a specific occasion, I may say, in order that I shall not be accused of misrepresentation, that I received a deputation which I had agreed to hear, and refused to receive another deputation of which I had not been advised. </para>

                            <para>The purpose of the Government##'##s price stabilization plan was to stabilize prices and cost of living at about the level for March quarter, 1943. A ceiling was imposed on prices as at the 13th April, 1943, and stabilization was to be achieved by the aid of government subsidies. It was found impossible to adjust all increased costs in the first quarter of the plan, and as the index for June quarter showed an increase over March quarter, consequential adjustments were made to the basic wage. In August, 1943, government assistance running into several millions of pounds was provided by subsidies on tea and potatoes, and reduction of sales tax on clothing from 12##½## per cent. to 7##½## per cent. As a result of these and other subsidies the cost of living index for the six capitals forDecember quarter, 1943, was the same as existed for March quarter, 1943, but there has been some variation in the index movements in some of the States. </para>

                    <para>.- As my amendment means that persons who come to Australia from Allied countries would have to remain five years before they could enjoy the benefits of this legislation, I should not object if the period were reduced to three years. The reason for the amendment is that, as the clause stands, foreigners who came to this country would immediately be eligible for the benefits provided by this legislation, whereas, in my opinion, they should not have any advantage over a British subject who would have to reside here for twelve months before he could benefit from it. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment. The people whom we should encourage to come to this country are those who wish to make Australia their home and to adopt an Australian nationality. We do not want those who come here intending to stay only for a short period, during which they are determined to get as much from this country as they can, and then to return to their national home. I saw the danger of that kind oi thing when I was in Palestine. That country was flooded with refugees who had fled from European countries in order to escape from persecution. In conversation with many of them, I found that only a limited number intended to make their permanent home in Palestine. They freely admitted that it was their intention to return to Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, or other countries from which they had been driven, as soon as it was possible to do so. Although I am of the opinion that we should extend to those who are prepared to make Australia their home the same benefits as are enjoyed by our own citizens, I do not think that these other people should receive similar treatment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson##'##s</inline> amendment would enable any British subject, or any naturalized British subject, to get the benefits of this legislation after a year##'##s residence in Australia. If a migrant is not prepared to apply for naturalization, he should not, in my opinion, be eligible for the benefits conferred by this legislation. I urge the Government to accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - As I indicated earlier, the Government will not accept the amendment. The residential  qualifi- cation period of twelve months is embodied in the New Zealand legislation. Honorable senators opposite have raised  a  bogy about internees, contending that these people will qualify for benefits under this legislation immediately it is proclaimed. Internees will not be covered by this legislation so long as they remain internees. I again emphasize the importance of this legislation as an encouragement to migration. All honorable senators will admit that we cannot hope to confine our migration policy to people of British stock. We must encourage newcomers from non-British countries; and once such people come here and accept Australian citizenship, they are entitled to the benefits of that citizenship. With respect to sickness benefits, I point out that all foreigners must be passed as medically fit before they are admitted to this country. </para>

                    <para>. -  If it could be said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson##'##s</inline> amendment would encourage aliens to become naturalized British subjects, it would have some merit. However, from my experience with aliens, I believe that the unemployment and sickness benefits provided under this legislation will not be a very great- inducement to aliens to become British subjects. If that is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibsonhas</inline> in mind, I do not think that his amendment will help us. I also disagree with the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson##'##s</inline> amendment will materially reduce  the  cost of benefits by excluding numbers  of  aliens. We shall not stand idly .by, and allow aliens in our midst to be reduced to needy circumstances, or to a condition of sickness, without coming to their aid. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> suggests is that the people of Australia would ignore such sick or needy people, but I am sure that he does not mean that. However, that is what could happen if his amendment were carried. The unemployed or sick alien, if not a charge on this fund, would, if the amendment were carried, become a charge on some welfare fund of th.-. State in which he resided. Work must be found for him, or he must be given gome amelioration of his conditions if he is unemployed, and, in case of sickness, he must be helped with medical services and medicine. For those reasons ##[## am opposed to the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister##'##s reply was very weak. I propose to test his sincerity in relation to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> which provides that every person who ##"## . . . . has attained the age of sixteen years, but has not attained the age of  65  years or in the case of a female  60  years . . . shall be qualified to receive unemployment benefit##"##. What is the position of a man who comes to this country at  50  years of age? He cannot get the old-age pension until he is  70,  and his benefits under this measure cease at  65,  so that for a period of five years he is not entitled to any help whatever. If the Minister is sincere, he will make provision for that man for the intervening five years. The objections raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald are also weak. The people to whom I refer have resided in Australia for a year or two, are working on farms, pay no taxes, and, immediately this measure comes into operation, receive its benefits. Why should they receive benefits when a British subject must reside here for twelve months before he can receive them? The bill is most inconsistent. I hope that the Minister will answer my criticism of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> more fully than he has answered the case  for  my amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- In speaking on the second reading I asked a question regarding paragraph c, which provides that ##"##... every person who satisfies the Director-General that he is unemployed, and that his unemployment is not due to his being a direct participant in a strike . . . shall be qualified to receive unemployment benefit ##"##. What does the Government mean by ##"## a direct participant in  a  strike ##"## ? If a strike occurs, is any one refusing to work in the industry in which it occurs a direct participant? If members of another union decided not to work, would they be direct participants in a strike? If some men were absent on sick pay and returned to work after the strike had begun and then refused to work, would they be direct participants in a strike? A great deal of clarification of this paragraph is needed. A man may claim not to be a direct participant in the strike because he was not there on the day on which the strike started. I can forsee much misunderstanding occurring with the members of other unions who stop work and claim that the stoppage is not a strike because they are only acting in sympathy with the men who are striking. Will they be direct participants in a strike? Although I am in sympathy with the object which the Government seems to aim at, I am sure that it will be necessary to make the meaning of the clause clearer to prevent all sorts of legal quibbles and objections. I presume that this paragraph does not apply to sickness benefits, and that if a man who is on strike becomes ill, the intention is that he shall receive them. It is further provided that ##"##... every person who . . . satisfies the Director-General that he is capable of undertaking and is willing to undertake work which in the opinion of the Director-General is suitable to:be undertaken by  that person . . . shall be qualified to receive unemployment benefit ##"##. When I referred to this provision during the second-reading debate, the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> interjected that a man was entitled to get work at his own trade. I instanced the case of a coal miner able to work and who was offered work in some other industry. According to the interpretation given by the Leader of the Senate, that man would be able to say, ##"## Oh no, I must have work at my own particular trade##"##. The Minister surely sees at once that if the test as to whether a man is unemployed or not is that everyman must be employed at his own particular trade, the provision becomes ridiculous. Must a carpenter get work at the carpentering trade, although he is quite able to work at some other trade, and does the same thing apply to a stonemason or a slaughterman ? </para>

                        <para>- Many carpenters could very well act as slaughtermen if they were allowed to do so. If a man is unemployed and there is work for him as a slaughterman, he is not allowed to take the work because he does not belong to the slaughtermen##'##s union; but does that release him from the obligation to work at some other occupation ? Does the fact that he cannot get work at his own trade debar him from the benefits of this measure? Is he debarred because although he is ready to work as a slaughterman he is not allowed to do so? I was alarmed to hear the Leader of the Senate give the interpretation that work must be provided for a man in his own trade. </para>

I am sure that the Minister will appreciate the need for clarity in both these matters. First, there should be a clear definition of what is a  participant  in a strike, and, secondly, there should be a general instruction, or at least an understanding, that if an unemployed person is offered work which he i3 able to perform, whether it be at his own trade or not, he must accept that work or become ineligible for the benefits set out in this measure. </para>

                    <para>. - I have experienced considerable difficulty in following the points that have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline> I shall deal first with the question of strikes : It is most undesirable that in the event of a strike in, say, a colliery or perhaps in the Sydney transport system, such as that which occurred recently, the gun should be held at the  head of an unemployed person to force him to accept work in that industry, merely because the regular employees are on strike. We do not want this legislation to be used to compel men to ##"## scab ##"## on their fellow workers. In regard to the second part of the honorable senator##'##s remarks, it is not the intention under this measure to compel men to be kept strictly to their own trades in the event of unemployment. I remind honorable senators that during the depression years carpenters, butchers and, in fact, tradesmen of all classes were only too pleased to accept jobs of any kind. Obviously, this measure would not be used to compel a municipal employee in a southern State to accept employment as a wharf lumper at Darwin, merely because there was a job there for  him.  However, he might be offered work as a wharf lumper in a southern State. Conversely, should a wharf lumper be unable to obtain a job at his own trade, as many were during the depression, he could be employed on  municipal  work. The bill does not provide that a man must work at his own trade, or be paid unemployment benefit. </para>

                    <para>. - I am concerned with the words ##"## a direct participant in a strike ##"##. Very often strikes are caused by noisy minorities, and agreed to perhaps by the very barest of majorities. Sometimes workers are forced to go on strike, as was the case in the recent transport strike in Sydney, when many employees were anxious to work, particularly in view of the fact that lack of transport facilities meant that large numbers of munitions workers could not reach their places of employment, with a consequent loss of production. I realize that a majority of members of the union concerned in the transport hold-up voted for the strike, but there are many cases in which the decision to cease work is made by a comparatively small majority. It also happens on occasions that men are called out on strike without a vote being taken. Also, there are certain unions in which officials reign supreme. For instance, I understand that the officials of the Ironworkers Union do not have to publish balance-sheets. The secretary of that union is known as ##"## Balance-sheet ##"## Thornton. </para>

Consequently, this measure goes so far as to provide that an unemployed person can refuse a direction to work in an undertaking in which the usual employees are out on strike, and still be eligible for benefits under this measure. We in this Parliament have to abide by majority decisions, and that applies also to members of trades union organizations. </para>

                <para class="block">The effect of that amendment if adopted, would be that if a man were on strike, he would be acting illegally, because all strikes are illegal, and therefore he would not be entitled to the benefit of the law. It should be  a  simple matter for the Director-General to decide whether or not a person were entitled to the benefit of this legislation. If there were work waiting for him - that is suitable work in which he could be employed - and he refused to accept that ##'##work, then he would be acting illegally and should not be entitled to benefits. I should think that the word ##"## direct ##"## will provide a field of argument for lawyers for many years. What is a ##"##direct##"## participant? For instance, somebody moves a resolution that certain tram waymen go out on strike. Somebody seconds that motion, and it may be said that the mover and seconder are direct participants in the strike, but how can we say that anybody else is  a  direct participant? We do not know who voted for the motion and who voted against it. What would be the position of a man who goes on strike contrary to the advice of his trade union and against an award of the Arbitration Court? Take the clearest case one could have of an illegal strike - that regarding which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has made strong statements urging the men who are striking illegally to return to work. A person may claim the benefit and the Director-General may say, ##"##No, you are on strike ##"##. The man may reply, ##"## But I am not  a  direct participant. I did not move the motion in favour of the strike. I did not second it, and did not even vote for it.##"## The man may  even  contend that he did not wish to go on strike. The Government means either that every striker automatically deprives himself of the benefit of the bill, or that a person can both be illegally  on strike  and get the benefit of the bill. I  ask  the Minister to eliminate the word ##"## direct which causes all the confusion. Both the Government and the Opposition are in agreement that persons illegally on strike should not get the benefit of  the  bill. Therefore, I contend  that the  amendment should be accepted. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not understand the significance of the word ##"##direct##"##. Either a person is a participant in  a  strike, or he is not. If he is a participant, the intention of the Government is  that  he should be excluded from the benefit of the bill at the discretion of  the  Director-General. What point is given to the clause by the inclusion of  the  word ##"## direct ##'####'## other than to create  a  difficulty for the Director-General  in  determining whether or not a person  is a  participant in a strike? The word ##"## direct ##"## is liable to lead to  a  great deal of confusion. In some instances unionists go on strike in sympathy with their fellow unionists in another industry. In such circumstances could they be correctly described as direct participants? Perhaps the Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> could throw a little light on the matter. I do  not  desire to agree to an alteration which would leave the clause too vague without a direction to the Director-General, upon whom a great responsibility will be cast. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister appears to have got himself, as well as honorable senators generally, in a tangle. Should a man employ some one to take his place during his illness and pay that person, say, ##£##5 a week while so employed, it is not intended under this sub-clause that the Government shall reimburse the employer. Instead, it says, in effect, ##"## During your illness you are losing ##£##5 a week, which means that your income for that period is less than ##£##1 a week, and for that reason you come under the provisions of this legislation Is that what the sub-clause provides? </para>

                    <para>. - Sub-clause  2  appears to be out of place. Moreover, the inclusion of so many brackets adds to its complicated nature. Its meaning becomes clearer if we, for the moment, disregard the words within the brackets, so that the clause would read : ##"## ##"##Where any payment is made by a person to any other person  who acts as his substitute during any period of incapacity, the Director-General may . . . regard the first mentioned person as having suffered a loss of income equal to the amount of that payment ##"##. Clause  16  enables certain persons, whose qualifications are set out in the clause, to obtain certain sickness benefits. Are we to superimpose a further liability to reimburse such a person for payments made by him to some other person who has worked for him during a certain period? I cannot see the reason for the insertion of this provision in clause  16  unless it is to link it up with something that has been passed by the Committee. But sub-clause  2  is foreign to the clauses that have been passed, because the benefit in respect of sickness or unemployment is a benefit bestowed by certain legislation. ##"##We are not here providing for the substitution of some one else for the person who is entitled to the benefit. I thought that the bill was aimed at making provision for a person who is unemployed, or is stricken by illness, and therefore sub-clause  2  appears to be foreign to the purpose of the bill. The numerous brackets may be necessary, but they certainly do not make the sub-clause more easily understood. I can imagine legislation of this nature causing difficulty in the event of litigation arising. The Minister may agree to postpone the consideration of this clause with a view to submitting a clear statement as to itsmeaning, and thereby shortening the timeof the discussion. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is quite obvious that a number of honorable senators do not understand the meaning of this clause. The Minister himself has an impossible task in being asked to explain a bill which, because it is so badly drafted, is inexplicable. Take, for instance, sub-clause  2  of this clause. Having regarded the first mentioned person ##"## as having suffered a loss of income equal to the amount of that payment ##"##, what does the Director-General do? That sub-clause does not make sense. I suggest that the bill be re-drafted in ordinary English, which honorable senators and the general public can understand. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but honorable senators know, as every one knows, that occasionally doctors##'## certificates are obtainable when they should not be obtainable. In order to overcome that possibility paragraph c prescribes that the Director-General must be satisfied as to the bona fides of an applicant. Collusion may also arise in the case of brothers who own adjoining farms. One, alleging sickness, may decide to take a holiday on the understanding that his brother next door will look after his farm in his absence. Should the Director-General suspect the bona fides of an applicant who produces a medical certificate, he will have the right under this provision to demand that the applicant be examined by a special medical officer. Briefly, the effect of paragraph c is that it gives the Director-General the final word in determining eligibility for benefit. </para>

Take the case of the small shopkeeper mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney.</inline> In order to receive benefit, the shopkeeper must show a loss of income. If, for instance, a shopkeeper were making ##£##6 a week profit from his business, and, during his absence owing to illness, had to pay another person ##£##5 to carry on the business, his actual income would be ##£##1 a week.

                    <para>. -  It would be preferable to omit sub-clause 2 ##'##entirely. So far as I can see the object of this subclause is to provide against very involved complications that may arise, and with that object in view the draftsman is endeavouring to- limit and, at the same time, widen the functions of the Director-General. I point out that under clause 36, sufficient powers will be vested in the Director-General to determine cases of this kind. Sub-clause 2 seems to add complications to a provision that was tolerably clear. The administrative officers would be in a far stronger position if this sub-clause were omitted. All that an applicant is required to do, as set out in paragraph c, is to satisfy the Director-General that he is ##"## temporarily incapacitated for work by reason of sickness or accident, and has thereby suffered  a  loss of salary, wages or other income ##"##, and the Director-General has sufficient discretionary power under clause 36 to determine the application. The retention of sub-clause 2 will only give severe headaches to the Director-General. It is  a  work of supererogation, and will- only tend to complicate the administration of the scheme. I am certain that the draftsman would take no exception to the deletion of sub-clause 2. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to refer particularly to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> which provides that continuous residence in Australia shall be deemed not to have been interrupted ##"## by any period of absence during which the claimant##'##s home, any of his children, or his furniture remained in Australia ##"##. A man could go away for ten years. The ages of his children are not specified. If the clause provided that they must  bp  under sixteen, it would be understandable. In respect of furniture, a man might have left simply a table and a ah air with a neighbour or friend, and might stay away for ten years, yet under the clause he would still be qualified to receive benefit. The same result would follow if he left grown-up children in Australia. I suggest that paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and c cover all that is necessary. I would agree to leave out the words ##"##in the aggregate##"## from paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> The Minister must admit that the clause as it stands is open to a good deal of abuse, and might even allow a swindle to be perpetrated. Its draftsmanship also leaves a great deal to be desired. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> serves no useful purpose, and I ask the Minister to agree to delete it. </para>

                    <para>.- I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> would express considerable indignation at the distinction drawn between men and women. I can see no reason for it. I could understand the clause if it provided that ##"##no married person shall be qualified to receive benefits under this bill unless the Director-General is satisfied that it is not possible for his or her spouse to maintain him or her ##"##. No married woman can get the benefits under the bill if her husband can maintain her, but if a man is out of employment or jil, and his wife has an income of, say, ##£##1,000 a year, he may obtain benefit. </para>

                        <para>- The wording of the bill does not support the Minister in that contention. It is entirely unfair to differentiate in this way between men and women. The onus is upon a man who has a good income to maintain his wife. That is only right, and I have no objection to it, but I contend that if a wife has a reasonable income, there should be an obligation upon her to keep her husband in the event of sickness. It should work both ways. The tendency to-day is for many married women to work, to own property, and to earn their own incomes, and I cannot see any reason for differentiation in this clause. I urge the Minister to agree to an amendment on the lines which  I  have suggested, namely, the substitution of the words ##"## married person ##"## for the words ##"## married woman ##"##. Is there any reason why that could not be done? </para>

                    <para>.- Does the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> intend to leave the matter at that? If so, I am astounded that an anomaly of this kind should be allowed to exist. It is altogether illogical and unfair. The Minister emphasized the desire of the Government to protect the revenue of the country, but he is not doing so by permitting a state of affairs in which abuses may occur. The request which I have made for an amendment of the clause is fair and reasonable, and if the Minister will not accept my suggestion, then he must accept the responsibility for his action. I repeat that he is differentiating unfairly between men and women. </para>

                    <para>. -  The reason for this clause seems difficult to understand, because it deprives the Australian aboriginal of unemployment or sickness benefit, unless the Director-General is satisfied, by reason of the character, standard of intelligence and delevopment of the aboriginal, that it is reasonable that he should receive the benefit. A refugee who has been a resident of this country for only twelve months is to be entitled to receive benefit, but the oldest inhabitants of this land, who have been here throughout their lives, are  to  be excluded. To deprive them of the benefits of the bill would be shabby treatment. In view of the fact that a refugee, whether German or Italian or of any other nation, is to get the benefit  of  the bill after twelve months##'## residence, why does the Government intend to deprive the Australian aborigines of the benefit? </para>

Experience of social service legislation has shown that because of the widely different legislation in the various States it is better to deal with each case on its merits. Where  an  aboriginal is normally engaged in earning his livelihood, like a white man, and becomes sick he will be entitled to the benefit of this bill; but if he leads a nomadic life and does not normally engage in work he will not receive it. </para>

I appeal to the Minister to show a little sympathy towards friendly societies. The Government has said that it appreciates the work of those organizations. It has an opportunity now to show its appreciation in a practical way. I shall be very disappointed if the Minister rejects my amendment. </para>

Within the last few days I have discussed this measure with representatives of the major friendly societies. They informed me that this scheme will not affect friendly societies at all. They pointed out that under this scheme, which is non-contributory, benefits will be made available free of cost. </para>

                    <para>. -  I shall oppose the clause, because the means test is completely unjustified.  If the Government is right in its contention that the scheme is contributory, because the benefits are to be paid on account of contributions that have been made by way of taxes, then they should be paid as a right. If they are a right, why should a means test be imposed? I have often heard honorable senators who now occupy the Government benches criticize the means test, but immediately they assume office and introduce a bill dealing with social welfare, we find the same means test standing out prominently. The result is that the person who, complying with the wishes of the Government and the advice of members of this Parliament, has been thrifty in war-time and subscribed to war loans is penalized. </para>

In any circumstances the means test is unjustified. The Government cannot claim that the scheme is contributory, and payments merely a refund, on a certain basis, of taxes that have alrea##'##dy been paid, while denying similar rights to others because they have saved money. I believe that payments should be a right and not a dole. If the benefit is a right, it should be given irrespective of the means of the recipient. </para>

                    <para>. -  I wish to make my position clear on the clause, which involves the principle of the means test. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> that we should have a comprehensive scheme on a contributory basis and that there should be no means test. We as an Opposition were successful last week in deleting a clause from the bill, as a suggestion to the Government to finance the scheme on a contributory basis. As I know definitely that the Government does not propose to take any notice of the directions given by the Opposition I ask if it is the intention of the Government, if this clause is defeated, to provide -the funds out of Consolidated Revenue and do away with means test altogether? It that is so, I shall not be able to support the bill, because the financial responsibility will be greater than we can carry. If, however, the Minister is prepared to say that a new proposal will provide a contributory scheme, that will help me to make a decision. </para>

                        <para>- Then it is right for the Labour party to introduce a means test, but very improper for an antiLabour government to do so ! The fact that the Labour party introduces a means test apparently absolves all those orators who have referred to it on the public platform as an infringement of the liberty of the subject. Not one honorable senator opposite rises to express his opinion of the clause in its present form. The Minister gave no reasons why the Labour party in caucus had decided on a means test. He simply said, ##"## There is going to be a means test, we have the numbers, we have the majority in caucus, and all those who previously declaimed against it must keep quiet##"##. The Ministry is to be congratulated on the supreme obedience of the members of the Labour party. Those who previously proclaimed their opposition to the means test now sit down meekly and say, ##"## All right, we will accept this, although it is against our principles ##"##. I expected some protest from honorable senators opposite. I thought perhaps they might say, ##"##We do not believe in this, but we are abiding by the dictates of caucus ##"##. I am astounded that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has not been supported by them, because the claim which he made in regard to the means test is really that which honorable senators opposite have been making for many years, namely, that it is something which should not be permitted in a free democracy. I am inclined to that view, but unfortunately I am in the same difficulty as before, because the scheme is not a contributory one. I realize that there will be an unwarranted call upon revenue for which no provision has been made, but at the same time,##'## I express my disappointment that the Government has not seen fit to accept the view of a great majority of its supporters who have expressed strong opposition to the means test on every possible occasion. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the clause. I see no reason why the Government should subsidize in un employment and sickness those individuals who have exploited the community for a great number of years, and feathered their nests. I believe that the clause is generous. It takes into consideration the assets of the individual. However, I should like to know what is the position in regard to the liquidation of assets. When an asset is liquidated, is the money received from such an asset to be taken into consideration, and if not, why not ? </para>

                    <para>. - I regret to say that I may have misled the honorable senator when I answered his question earlier in the debate. The main intention of this clause is that a person suffering from a particular disability shall not receive a double benefit in respect of that disability. For example, if a person is in receipt of a war pension for a disability which incapacitates him, the intention is that he shall receive any necessary benefit from the Repatriation Commission, instead of by way of sickness benefit under this measure. If, however, he has a disability other than that which incapacitates him, he will be entitled to have any pension or other payment payable to him because of that other disability treated as income, so that he may receive the amount of his other benefit up to ##£##1 in addition to full benefit under this measure. </para>

If the insurance authority offers to pay him ##£##100 in a lump sum instead of by weekly instalments, what is the effect of that decision upon this legislation? Is it to be regarded as ##£##1 a week for 100 weeks, or at the rate of his usual weekly wage until the ##£##100 is absorbed? Say, for instance, a man is injured by a motor car and received damages from an insurance company under a third party risk policy. How is the amount which he receives to be computed for the purposes of this clause? The damages will be made up of three or four considerations, including compensa tion for pain and suffering, loss of wages and other factors. Obviously money which a man receives as compensation for pain and suffering cannot be regarded as income. If the amount were ##£##100, surely the authorities administering this scheme could not say, ##"## We shall regard this ##£##100 as if you were receiving ##£##1 a week for 100 weeks; therefore you cannot come within the provisions of this scheme for 100 weeks##"##.

                        <para>- I am not satisfied that the Director-General can be relied upon to decide satisfactorily all of the issues that may arise. That would impose ##'## too great a strain on any official. The Minister ##"## passes the buck ##"## by saying, ##"## The Director-General will decide ##"##. The Government should give an indication in the bill as to how money received by way of compensation for injury will be distributed. Such money might be distributed fairly, but it might also be distributed very unfairly. The hill should be more definite than it is as to how lump sums should be distributed. Lump sums are commonly awarded by insurance companies. A person might be mistaken in estimating the time that he would take to recover sufficiently to enable him to resume work. If he took a week or a month longer than he expected, considerable injustice might be done to him. In other circumstances, great injustice might be done to the fund. The terms of the clause should be as precise as possible, relieving the Director-General of some of the responsibilities proposed to be placed upon him. </para>

Actuarial advice will not be sought with regard to individual cases, but only in respect of the basis of calculation. Under the workers compensation law in Victoria a person receives two-thirds of his usual wages from the day on which he receives an injury, but after the lapse of a month he may be agreeable to accept ##£##50 as a lump sum. To how much is that man entitled under the bill? When does the ##£##50 become exhausted ? </para>

                        <para>- An insurance company may prefer to pay a lump sum to the injured man, but he may refuse to accept a lump sum, and elect to receive regular payments. Nevertheless, the cases in which a lump sum is accepted are numerous. The point then arises whether the lump sum is to be charged against him for a long period, or for a short period. There must be some basis to guide the actuary. The Minister should be definite in a matter of this kind, first, in order to protect the revenue, and, secondly, to ensure that no cases of hardship arise. The more I look at this matter the greater the number of pitfalls I see. </para>

                    <para>.- I am grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Large</inline> for his explanation, but the case as presented by him differs from the position which now exists, ##'##because under the existing legislation a man is entitled to only two-thirds of his wages during the period that he is absent from work because of an accident. If he be entitled to full wages, as explained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Large,</inline> it will be seen that the period covered by the payment of a lump sum will be less than if the calculations be made on the basis of two-thirds of his weekly wage. Who is to decide the period? </para>

                        <para>.- Sub-clause 1 provides for the furnishing of medical certificates as to such matters, and containing such information, as the Director-General requires. Few doctors will be willing to issue certificates covering more than a week, so that a sick man will have to visit his doctor every week in order to obtain a further certificate. Or does the Government contemplate authorizing certain doctors to certify to certain things? If not, will it be possible for a man to select a doctor who is likely to be lenient in these matters ? </para>

                        <para>- A doctor may say that a man with a cold must remain at home for a week, but should he not have recovered at the end of a week, he would have to submit another claim, which would need to be supported by another certificate. I desire to know whether there will be a fixed charge for such certificates, and also what steps are contemplated to relieve doctors from the necessity of issuing hundreds of certificates each week. It is not unlikely that a medical practitioner in each district will set up as a ##"## signer of certificates ##"##. If so, he should do well. Some provision should be made in this bill to fix the rate which a doctor may charge for a certificate. I do not like to envisage the application of this provision in an industrial suburb where, because of the volume of sickness, many doctors may be tempted to set up merely as ##"##signers of certificates ##"##. My object is to relieve the unfortunate person who is obliged to claim sickness benefit of possible heavy expenditure in respect of medical certificates. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> mentioned the case of people who may be situated many miles from a doctor. In such cases, the doctor includes in his fee a travelling charge ona mileage basis. I imagine that such cases will come within the category of special circumstances. I have cited the industrial suburb because of the comparatively greater volume of sickness in such suburbs, and for this reason it would pay an unscrupulous doctor merely to set up an office in which he would do nothing but sign certificates without investigating cases very carefully. I do not think that the Government is quite fair to recipients of benefits under this measure unless it relieves them to some degree at least of the comparatively high expenditure which, in many cases, they will be obliged to incur in obtaining a doctor##'##s certificate. The Government should accept responsibility for the payment of part of the cost to an applicant where, owing to special circumstances, the doctor##'##s fee is comparatively high. It should also ensure that doctors who supply certificates are of the highest repute. I am not implying that doctors generally are dishonest. However, in exceptional circumstances of the kind which I have mentioned, a doctor is entitled to charge a comparatively high fee,and he should be paid at a fair rate for his valuable time. The Government, therefore, should accept responsibility for a part of the medical fee incurred by an applicant in such circumstances. </para>

                    <para>. - I apprehend that in extensive legislation of this kind the Government##'##s approach to administrative problems will be to profit by experience, and that this will be the case in respect of the administration of medical benefits as well as other benefits.Clauses 25 and 26 appear to me to be drafted in broad outline, and the gaps will be filled in later as the administration gains experience. At the moment, I cannot discern where a man##'##s right to obtain sickness benefits terminates. However, the medical certificate must be in such terms as the Director-General determines. . He will give his determination in the form of regulations, and in framing his determinations I have no doubt that he will be guided by the customs and practices of friendly societies. Clause 26 throws the mantle of protection around the Government##'##s expenditure. It is true that under the clause as it stands some burden may be placed upon citizens in exceptional circumstances such as those mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline> Up to date, the mind of the Government naturally has been to take account of circumstances existing in great industrial centres where doctors are close at hand. There may be recurrences of expenditure as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has said, but anomalies will gradually disappear as the administrative machinery runs itself in. I do not think that in respect of a small benefit the </para>

                <para class="block">Government would tolerate recurrence of expenditure on the part of any person by obliging him to obtain a medical certificate week after week. It is only proper that applicants be required in the first place to produce a medical certificate containing such information as the Director-General requires. Should the Director-General be in any doubt as to the continuance of benefit he has power under clause 26 to call for another certificate, or to insist that the applicant be examined by a special medical officer. I realize that applicants living in remote localities may be under some disability, but difficulties of that kind will gradually smooth themselves out. In extensive legislation of this character it is impossible to expect perfect working conditions immediately. However, whilst there is ground for the argument I do not think that we can remedy the difficulty at this stage. </para>

It is always in the interests of the institution or of the benefit society to which he belongs to see that the claim is made promptly. Under the workers##'## compensation acts of almost all the States a period of six months is allowed within which to put in a claim. I take it that under this clause the Director-General will see that it is made. If it is not, he has the necessary power to institute proceedings to recover the money. </para>

It is not sufficient to say that the Director-General has to decide these things, or that the actuary will work them out by some method of his own. If the bill does not define misconduct, the whole thing is left in the air, and a man may be penalized or receive benefits at the caprice of the Minister or the Director-General. </para>

I am- not reflecting on Ministers opposite. In considering the bill we should forget personalities and deal with principles regardless of who ia in office. A bureaucrat or an unscrupulous Director-General could do great harm. The bill needs redrafting. I regret that we have not the numbers to amend it, and that the Government refuses to take any notice of suggestions for improvements made by the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>. - Under the clause the powers of the Director-General are unlimited. He may in his discretion grant assistance, or direct that it be granted, in all cases other than those specially dealt with in other clauses of the bill.  His  powers should be curtailed. The bill seems to have been prepared in order to cover all classes of sickness and unemployment, but this clause overrides all others. I do not know why this officer is styled the Director-General. It gives him a title resembling that of a Governor-General. Why not designate him the Director! This is not the time to take exception to it, but it is a remarkable title to give an officer. There should be a director and a  deputy  director. The clause confers upon the Director-General power to deal at his discretion with all cases for which no specific provision has been made in the bill. To me that seems to be taking from Parliament and the Minister control of the administration of this measure. It is a ##"## grab-all ##"## clause, and I am sure- that such a sweeping provision was never contemplated when this measure was being prepared.  I should like the Minister to tell me whether or not my interpretation of the clause is correct, and if not, what limits are placed upon the authority of the Director-General. </para>

                    <para>.- Apparently honorable senators opposite have a new ##"##swan song##"##. Until now they have always argued that administration of this kind should be completely free from political control. The clause vests the general administration of  this legislation in an individual independent of Parliament, hut apparently honorable senators opposite, who for so long have advocated freedom from political control, do not like it because they fear that the power may be abused. My view is that this clause is necessary. For instance, I know of a very worthy woman who is 59 years of age. She is unable to secure a widow##'##s pension because during the depression years she left her husband. She is an excellent citizen, and she has done fancywork all his life. She cannot see sufficiently well to continue in this vocation, but she is not eligible for an invalid pension. She is not old enough to receive the old-age pension. This clause confers upon the Director-General power to deal with such worthy cases. </para>

                <para>I take it therefore that clause 36 does not mean that the Director-General will not be responsible to the Government of the day, and his administration at all times shall be subject to the authority of the Minister in charge of this department. Whilst I appreciate the need for a ##"## concertina ##"## clause to widen the scope of this legislation to meet special cases, I should like to know from the Minister what exactly is contemplated under this clause. It appears to me that the Director-General is absolutely supreme, and that the only appeal is from the Director-General to the Director-General, which really means that there is no appeal at all. Presumably the provision for an appeal is designed to enable the Director-General to review his own decisions in the light of new information. </para>

                        <para>- Are we to take it that this Director-General is to listen to every member of Parliament who wishes to place a case before him? Surely he must decide these things on their merits. My complaint is that there is no appeal from the decision of the Director-General. No doubt the person holding this responsible office will be well qualified to administer the legislation but after all no one is infallible. I ask the Minister how far the administration of the Director-General under clause 36 will be subject to clause 5. My personal view is that the Director-General should be absolutely independent, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> has suggested, but there should be a right of appeal to another authority, such as a board, because it is only human nature that after one has arrived at a decision, one tends to adhere to it. </para>

However, I am not discussing those elusive things which happen outside of Parliament; what I should like to know is whether or not the Director-General, in making a decision under clause 36, is subject to the control contemplated under clause 5. If not, he is virtually a dictator because there is no appeal from his decision. I feel strongly about this matter and I hope that the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> will be good enough to elucidate the position. </para>

                        <para>- No, but there is an appellant tribunal. Surely the Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> is not unaware of that. I thought that all honorable senators were inundated with letters from individuals whose claims had been determined by the Repatriation Commission, and had been made the subject of an appeal to the higher tribunal. I realize the administrative difficulty with which the Government is confronted, but surely some method can be provided  whereby the unfortunate individuals who will seek benefit under this legislation, will have a right of appeal should their claims be rejected initially. In civil matters, such fis police courts, there is always a right of  appeal,  even if it is only against a fine of ##£##1. Here, a person##'##s living or his welfare may be at stake. Unfortunately it frequently happens that persons who are failed upon to administer this type of legislation for many years, become largely influenced by the governmental viewpoint - I do not suggest that there is any improper influence brought to bear by a Government. We find examples of that attitude in the inferior courts where magistrates, who for a long time have been dealing with certain classes, of individuals find it most difficult to see the other side of the picture. Only too often it is merely a matter of saying, ##"## fined 10s. ##"## without any further discussion. Whilst an administrator may be quite justified in taking that attitude in nine cases out of ten, we must have <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> consideration for that tenth case. As this legislation will soon be placed upon our statute-book - no doubt it will be amended from time to time - I think we should have these matters clarified. The administration of this measure will harden the Director-General, I fear, to a degree which I do not think either the Government or the Committee intends. We should consider whether any relief at all can be given to a person who is prima facie entitled to benefit, but is refused benefit hy the Director-General. As the case stands there is an appeal from Caesar to Caesar. The Director-General, having formed an opinion, is not likely to change his mind. </para>

                        <para>- But Parliament, has the right to amend any act, if it considers that powers have been abused. A provision similar to the clause under consideration is embodied in the New Zealand measure. There are not many instances where special benefits are necessary, but, if a Deputy-Director in  one  of the States made a recommendation to the Director-General that in a special case some alleviation should be given, the recommendation would as a rule be adopted. We find that practice observed with regard to invalid pensions. I, as Minister, have overridden a decision even of the Director-General in such a matter, and have asked that the individual in question be examined by an independent, doctor, so that upon that investigation a proper decision could be reached. I cannot conceive of any method of dealing with these cases except that provided in the clause. The case cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> is typical of others. The clause gives to the Director-General power to consider such cases, and make the necessary financial payments. </para>

There are the cases of old-age pensioners to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has referred, and the Minister has not stated whether an amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act will be made to provide for them.

                        <para>- The Minister has contended that this measure can be amended, if necessary, but it is desirable to build on as sound a foundation as possible, and to give relief by granting a right of appeal in certain cases. I assume that the number of appeals would not be large, because most of the decisions will have been made, in the first instance by a  Deputy  Director-General, and the Director-General himself may have a free mind in the matter, but there should be some relief from a dictatorial power which seems to me to be extremely dangerous. </para>

                    <para>. - The reply by the Minister does not clear up the doubt. This clause provides that the Director-General may, at his discretion, grant special benefits, but he also has the discretion to decide whether certain matters shall be referred to the Minister. Under this clause he has full power to do anything he wishes in the matter within the four corners of the bill, and he is not bound to refer anything to anybody else. I take it that the provision in clause 5 with regard to the Director-General##'##s administration being subject to ministerial direction is nullified by clause 36. The Director-General is given full power, and he will be the ##"## Dictator-General##"## with regard to the administration of the act. There is no provision in the bill that the Government shall have control over the actions of the Director-General. </para>

Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> authorizes the Director-General to require a claimant to ##"##undergo any course of training for the improvement of his physical or mental capacity##"##. Should the claimant be an inmate of an institution, I presume that he would not be paid because he would be kept while in the institution; but if he is undergoing a course of training elsewhere, some one must pay for it. Some provision must be made for the medical treatment or training of persons who require it. It would be ridiculous to compel a man to undergo treatment for which he must pay if he is unemployed and has no means. These people seem to be in a hopeless position. </para>

                    <para>. - I again remind honorable senators opposite that this legislation is only a part of the Government##'##s social security plan, all of which I hope will soon be implemented. This clause provides that as a condition of the payment of benefit a person shall undergo training or medical treatment, or perform any work required of him. The object of the provision is to give to the Administration the power to deal with chronic cases - persons who are not prepared to do anything to improve their capabilities or state of health, or in which there is good reason to believe that training or medical treatment would bring about such improvement. It is really an extension of the provision on the statute-book enabling the department to continue the payment of an invalid pension for any period during which an invalid is undergoing a course of approved training or instruction, and to regard the trainee as an invalid while the training or instruction is in progress. </para>

                <para class="block">That is an extraordinary power to vest in the Director-General - a power which usually is vested in a magistrate or a court. Is it intended that the Director-General shall be empowered to compel doctors, as well as ministers of religion, priests, or other persons to supply personal or confidential information? It would appear that the Minister has obtained his ideas from Hitler or his Gestapo, and wishes to make the Director-General a dictator. The clause goes too far. The Minister should be compelled to answer points raised in regard to such a far-reaching clause. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to have it both ways, but I do want to take this power out of the hands of the Minister, not because I object to the Minister having that power, but because it would be physically impossible for him to deal personally with all the cases which might arise throughout the Commonwealth. If an offence against this act shall not be prosecuted without the written consent of the Minister, months might elapse before a person in a remote area of the Commonwealth could be prosecuted. It would be better to substitute ##"## the deputy director of the State in which the offence is committed ##'####'## for the words ##"## the Minister ##"##. That would leave the power to prosecute in the hands of a responsible person. I do not wish that every public official throughout the country should have the right to institute prosecutions, but the deputy director in each State, not the Minister, should be empowered to consent to a prosecution. Is the Minister willing to accept that suggestion? Evidently he is not willing, and therefore I move - </para>

                        <para>- It will lead to centralization of the worst kind. I have, drawn attention to the gravity of this error, which still remains an error whether a similar provision was inserted in a previous measure or not. One does not require much imagination to foresee that, as the clause stands, the Minister will be obliged to carry on voluminous correspondence with officials in such remote centres as Darwin, Broome, Geraldton, or Normanton, or in some centre on the west coast of Tasmania where mails are delivered only every three or four weeks, in order to clarify his mind on one or two points arising in cases submitted for prosecution. Obviously, very few, if any, prosecutions will be lodged if that procedure is to be followed. Is that the wish of the Minister, or does he wish that the taxpayers be safeguarded against fraud? Does he believe that any offender under this measure should be prosecuted, or that unscrupulous persons should be free to cheat the revenue? </para>

                    <para>. - I have always held it to be a fundamental principle of democratic government that the Government through its Ministers should accept direct responsibility for all its legislation, and, therefore, should clothe Ministers with complete administrative powers. Any government which is not big enough to shoulder that responsibility should relinquish office. In this instance the issue is whether the Minister should have the final say in the launching of prosecutions. He should have that power and that responsibility, because he represents a Government elected by the people. We should combat any tendency to surrender such powers to administrative officials. They are not elected by the people and, therefore, should not be asked to shoulder such a responsibility. A government which surrenders powers of this kind to any official is no longer fit to govern. In this instance, the Minister should have sole power to authorize prosecutions. Should he fail to discharge that responsibility to the liking of the people, he will be answerable to them in due course. However, the Director-General, or any other official, is not elected as a representative of the people. He is a nominee of the Government, and must be made responsible to the Minister. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> who has done the afternoon shift for the Opposition in delaying ##'## this measure, spoke with his tongue in his cheek on this matter. </para>

                        says that he does not believe that powers of this kind should be given to an official. I point out that all through this debate the Minister##'##s reply on similar issues has been that the Director-General will have power to do many things. Indeed, this is the only power which the Minister is given under this bill. The Minister has repeatedly told us that the Director-General will decide all the problems to which we have drawn attention in this discussion. In view of those facts

Apparently, if a man has a table and three or four chairs, and leaves them in Australia while he goes abroad for a number of years, he will be eligible for benefits under this measure immediately upon his return. That provision is far too wide. </para>

It is absolutely ridiculous to place the furniture which a man may leave behind him in Australia when he goes abroad in the same category as his home or family.

What sort of legislation are we passing ? Are we to leave the door wide open to all sorts of frauds? Under this clause the man who may leave  a  few chairs and a table stored in  a  warehouse in some city can claim upon his return from abroad that his residence has been continuous because he left his furniture here. I appeal to the Minister not to allow this chamber to pass such  a  provision. He has already modified the original clause by moving for the deletion of what I considered to be the least objectionable part. </para>

                        <para>-  The point is whether the recommittal of the oil! is  a  recommittal to the same committee. I venture to suggest that it could not be anything else. The report of the committee was made to the Senate by the  Chairman  of Committees, and the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator. Fraser)</inline> moved its adoption. Then the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> moved that the bill be recommitted. That motion was carried. What does ##"## recommittal ##"## connote? To me it connotes a recommital to the same committee which has already considered the bill. That being so, Standing Order No. 265 becomes operative. The Minister then moved for the reinsertion of clause 42, thus reversing a decision which the committee had already made. I contend that it is incompetent for the committee to consider that motion, having regard to the clear terms of Standing Order No. 265. The suspension of the Standing Orders cannot alter the position, because sessional Standing Orders are suspended for a special purpose, namely, to enable a measure to be passed through its remaining stages without delay. That is the normal procedure of the Senate, which should be protected in every -way. In my opinion, the committee is not entitled to reverse its previous decision. </para>

                        <para>-  But it was made by the same committee. It does not matter when the decision was made, bo long as the same committee is reconstituted; the bill cannot be recommitted to any other committee. The word ##"## recommittal ##"## indicates that the measure is returning to the committee whence it came. There is no escape from the explicit provisions of Standing Order No. 265. There may be other means by which the Minister may be able to overcome the difficulty, but, in accordance with the Standing Orders which have been quoted, the committee cannot reverse its decision in the manner suggested. </para>

                <para>In this, case a recommittal of the bill intervened. If the argument adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan were valid, at what stage would it be possible for a bill to be recommitted? If the ruling by the  Chairman  of Committees in this instance could not be sustained, it would appear that there would be no period at which a clause or amendment could be dealt with under Standing Order No. 202. It would be absurd to insert in that standing order the words ##"##unless a recommittal of the bill shall have intervened ##"##, unless it were intended that it should be possible for a clause or amendment to be recommitted at some stage. Those words have been inserted for the specific purpose of allowing the Senate to take the action which was taken on this occasion. The motion that the bill be recommitted was carried. It is now quite in order for the motion before the committee to be discussed. </para>

I submit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that the proper procedure under that Standing Order is to fix a subsequent day for taking the report into consideration. The contingent notice of motion for the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders in no way affects Standing Order No. 212, which is for an entirely different purpose, namely that of dispensing with unnecessary delay. Standing Order No. 450 states - </para>

                <para class="block">The suspension on this occasion was sought by the Minister for one purpose only, that of enabling the Government to deal expeditiously with certain legislation. I am sure that the Minister will admit that it was never intended or suggested that that motion was made to cover the present situation. It is clear under Standing Order No. 450 that the suspension was limited entirely to the particular purpose for which the suspension was sought. I defy the Minister to say that he sought the suspension for the present purpose. The Opposition has been, is, and will be, from time to time willing to assist the Government to get legislation passed expeditiously provided democratic methods are adopted and not the fascist and dictatorial method of applying the ##"##gag##"##. I submit that under Standing Order No. 212 this motion cannot be dealt with now, but must be considered on a subsequent day as provided in the Standing Orders. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know what was in the mind of the Minister when he moved the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders, and I must be guided entirely by the Standing Orders. If my memory serves me aright, a certain motion was agreed to, providing that so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the bill being passed through its remaining stages without delay. One of the stages could be the recommittal of the measure which occurred this evening. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> now submits that under Standing Order No. 212 a subsequent day should be fixed for taking the report into consideration. That would involve a delay, but the Senate has already agreed to the suspension of so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders as would cause delays. Therefore, I uphold the ruling of the  Chairman. </para>

                    <para>.- As there seems to have been some misapprehension as to war pensions, I point out that they are in three categories - a special pension, a service pension, and what might be termed an ordinary pension. The total number of pensions granted to the 30th June last, according to the Repatriation Commission##'##s report which was tabled on the 10th February, was 86,096. That number included sailors, soldiers and airmen of the last war and also of the present war, but excludes widows and dependants. Of that total, 4,621 or 5.3 per cent., are on a special pension because their war injuries prevent them from working. They do not come under the benefits of this bill. Nor do the service pensioners, who are bracketed with invalid and old-age pensioners, because they are unemployable. They number 8,417, or 9.5 per cent, of the total. The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> related to the other 86 per cent, who draw pensions ranging from 2s. 6d. to ##£##2 10s. a week. The rejection of that amendment means that the pensions of 73,048 ex-servicemen will be taken into account when assessing the benefits they are entitled to receive under this bill, should they become unemployed. Although it is true that a considerable percentage of those pensions may not be eligible, for various reasons, to receive any benefits, the fact remains that the majority of them, who are in receipt of wages or low salaries will forfeit all or portion of their pensions in order to come within the scope of the statutory income* limitation of ##£##1 a week. The Government should reconsider this question and bring in amending legislation on the lines of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson##'##s</inline> amendment. By so doing, an injustice to men of this war and of the last war would be removed. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill can be summed up briefly by saying that it proposes to provide increased prenatal and post-natal payments to mothers bearing twins or triplets. Under the present act a payment of 25s. a week is paid to the mother for a period of four weeks immediately prior to the birth of a child and for four weeks immediately following the birth. Under this bill it is proposed to increase the weekly payment from 25s. to 37s. 6d. in the case of twins, and to 50s. in respect of triplets. In other words, the mother of twins will receive an extra ##£##5, whilst the mother of triplets will receive an additional ##£##10. </para>

                    <para>The bill also provides for the raising of the age of ##"## other children ##"## from fourteen to sixteen years. At present, the mother of a child is paid ##£##5 where there are no other children; she receives ##£##6 where there are one or two other children, and ##£##7 10s. where there are three or more other children. Under the act the age of ##"## other children ##"## is given as fourteen years. The proposal to substitute sixteen years for fourteen years will provide uniformity with other social legislation, and is therefore desirable. The extra cost of this provision is estimated at ##£##15,000 per annum. The bill also provides for the inclusion in that section of the act dealing with payment of allowances to aboriginal natives of an extension of the term ##"## aboriginal native ##"## to include halfcastes, and, in certain cases, white persons living as aboriginal natives on government stations and reserves. I have examined the proposals, and intend te support the bill. </para>
