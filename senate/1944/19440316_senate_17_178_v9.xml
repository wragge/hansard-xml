                    <para>My attention has been drawn to the article to which the honorable senator has referred, and I assure him that the Government, by its action in establishing the manufacture of penicillin at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories,  has prevented any possibility of a clash of commercial interests such as is reported to have occurred in the United States of America. The possibility of the profit motive producing an undesirable situation in this country is indicated in the statement of Sir Trent de Crespigny, the  chairman  of the Adelaide Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, when he said that the institute would produce penicillin for the services at cost price without any profit, but would expect a reasonable return for any penicillin that might be diverted to civilian use. The Government foresaw the possibility of civilians who required penicillin being charged high prices, and prevented this by arranging for its manufacture at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. </para>

                    <para>.- The purposes of this agreement have been misinterpreted by members of the Opposition.

The only fault that can be found is that the agreement was not made many years ago. At long last, the </para>

                <para class="block">Governments of these two important portions of the British Empire have announced to the world that they have a vital interest in the future of the Pacific. Whatever criticism has been voiced must be regarded as criticism of the Governments which made the agreement. It has been argued that the making of the agreement is tantamount to showing some disrespect to both the United Kingdom and the United States of America. I remind honorable senators that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who initiated the discussions and was the principal representative of the Commonwealth in the negotiations which resulted in the making of the agreement, made two visits abroad, and was a singularly successful diplomatic representative of this country in both Britain and the United States of America. That claim will not be challenged. Nor can it be denied that when the Commonwealth Government sought , the intervention of the United States of America in measures concerning the defence of this country, the right honorable gentleman went out of his way to insure that there  should be no possible slight of the Old Country. I have said on different occasions that at that particular time there was complete realization in this country of the fact  that  Britain had its hands full. and could not send to us the assistance which we ultimately received from the United States of America. It is utterly absurd to suggest that the making of this agreement can have any significance from the aspect of disloyalty. When the history of the Empire has to be written, the part ti1 at has been played in it by Australia and New Zealand, particularly in the three wars that have occurred in our lifetime, will be given singularly creditable mention, lt is admitted that the work done by our men has been excellent. I -commend the Commonwealth Government "which gave all the aid that was possible to Britain in the parlous state in which it found itself after the evacuation of Dunkirk. The evidence is overwhelming that Australia is all the time conscious of the fact that it is British. In making this agreement, it is preparing for a joint presentation of views at the conferences that will ensue upon the cessation of hostilities. To describe it as a retrograde step, is not right. The press of both the United States of America and the United Kingdom has paid tribute to the initiative that has been displayed in preparing for future events, despite our intense absorption in the war effort. Honorable senators opposite eulogized the Government of New Zealand recently during the consideration of social security measures, and described it as a wonderfully moderate Labour Government. It is a Government of the same political colour as the Commonwealth Government. Being a Labour Government, it naturally plans ahead. That is the " long suit of Labour administrations; they are always looking for social improvement and means of providing for the future safety of their country.

General MacArthur has said, openly that the effort of the 7,000,000 people of Australia is unexampled in any part of the world. Both New Zealand and Australia are to-day providing supplies for the Allied Nations to their fullest capacity. The problem is a tremendous one, in view of the limited man-power that is available. This agreement will provide a basis for discussion that will be held when the war has terminated. The Australian people are entitled to claim that in 1900 they became a nation, the objective being one Parliament and one people. </para>

This agreement between New Zealand and Australia will cement further the bonds of Empire, and will prove of practical value to other parts of the Empire when they are in need of assistance from us. The object of the agreement is simply to articulate that viewpoint; and there can be nothing wrong in that.

                    <para>The fuller reports of the agreement between the two Pacific Dominions will increase the welcome that has already been given to it. Chey have decided to act closely together in international concerns and in defence, in domestic questions like immigration and native affairs, in the measures to be taken during and at the end of the war, and, in particular, in the post-war settlement of international air routes. There is nothing exclusive or narrow about their plans. They aim at "" regional collaboration" within a great international system. Losing no time - and the making of this arrangement is in itself a good example to us - they want the other governments interested in the South Pacific to meet  them  as soon as possible to carry the arrangements farther. Co-operation both in defence and in polities is aimed at, and these Dominions are anxious to be working out the plans even though the Pacific war is certain to go on for a long time after the European war is over. </para>
                    <para>One admires their energy and clearsightedness. Their view of the air problem is an illustration. Each country is to conduct air services within its own boundaries. The international air routes, however, should, in their view, be controlled by an international authority which would also own the aircraft and equipment (and presumably the pilots). If this cannot be secured, then they desire a system of trunk routes operated by the Governments of the British Commonwealth under government ownership. The sooner the proposed Pacific regional conference meets the better, with these Dominions taking a leading part. The war has wrought a transformation. Australia and Now Zealand can no longer remain quietly at home, leaving both defence and, for the most part, foreign policy to the Home Country. They have been close to invasion; in the future they have to act together, but in close conjunction with the other Pacific Powers, both great and small, in order to obtain a secure future for themselves and the whole area in which they lie. It should mean, among other things, greater strength for the new international order and for the British Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>Not even after the last war - when Australia took charge of Papua and New Zealand of Samoa - was there any correlation of policy. This development coincides to some extent with doctrine from time to time to put forward in Australia that Commonwealth is, itself, empire within an empire, the power that will in future dominate South Pacific as it is presumed that the United States proposes to dominate the north from Equator to Alaska and Aleutians. These vast issues will not be determined in a day or even a decade and they arc complicated, especially in the case of Australia, .by the need of internal development and an increase of population. But nascent ideas tend to show development of future, and, in some cases, even decide it and. in that sense, it may well be that the Canberra Conference this week will be a milestone in history. </para>

                    <para>Curtin has not waited on holding of British Commonwealth talks in London but has proceeded with his plan at the periphery by securing agreement with New Zealand. There is nothing disruptive in this procedure. So far as foreign a/fairs are concerned Dominions have the right to act independently of United Kingdom and it seems to be a matter for congratulation that Australia and New Zealand have decided to act in future as much as possible together. There is, in fact, a welcome touch of realism in their thinking, for Imperial defence has, in the past, been rather too much of an Imperial and too little of a Dominion problem. It should bc noted, however, that Curtin and Fraser have no intention of breaking up unity of Imperial defence. Weakness of our defensive system in the Pacific as demonstrated by Japan's success is clear argument for close co-operation in Empire defence, combined with development of .regional system based on island screen which could be made more effective protection for the two Dominions. Their contact with other nations associated with Pacific questions may be the key to successful international collaboration. </para>

So the principle of trusteeship extends from London to Canberra and to Wellington - to places where its vigorous application can restore most effectively white man's prestige in the Far .East.

                        <para>- The only criticisms I have seen were those in a certain section of the press in the United States of America representing isolationist and anti-British elements. I do not propose to quote from them. It has been alleged that the censorship has been used to prevent comment on this agreement from being sent abroad. That is denied by the Government. I have made inquiries, and I can discover nothing to support the allegation. On the other hand, the Attorney-General and the Department of Information very properly released statements about the agreement to the Australian press and for transmission to other parts of the world, regarding it as an important item of news. The making of this agreement indicates that Australia and New Zealand are looking ahead. They are not seeking to impose their will on the bigger nations, but they are taking this opportunity to let the world know their views on defence, aviation and the control of native populations. The action of Australia and New Zealand can in no sense be construed as arrogant or offensive to our Allies, whose assistance has been almost indispensable to our protection. The only defect I can see in the agreement is that it is eighteen or twenty years too late. Australia and New Zealand are now making their voices heard in the world for obvious reasons. Two years ago, we were in a very serious situation because of our unpreparedness. I do not seek to lay the blame for that on any political party. The situation that arose was extraordinary, and one for which no one could have fully prepared. </para>

Speaking as an Australian, and as a member of the Commonwealth Government, I am proud of this agreement. I am proud that, at last, Australia, in conjunction with New Zealand, is speaking to the world at large, and announcing what we think ought to be done. We say to our allies in the United Kingdom and the United States of America that we will carry on to the end of the war, and if we cannot put more men into the Army, we can, at any rate, supply them with all the food that we can produce. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> will visit me at my office some day, I shall show him figures regarding the quantities of food that we have exported, and I shall show him also how serious was the position in regard to shipping. It is common knowledge that, up to a year ago, the Allies had lost 19,000,000 tons of shipping. We were in sore straits to provide shipping even for our own coastal trade, quite apart for the shipment of produce overseas. The Government will not yield to any one in its appreciation of the efforts which Great Britain has made in this war. It is recognized that, before the United States of America or Russia entered the war, Britain alone held the fort. I repudiate the suggestion that any laxity has been shown in supplying Great Britain with as much food as we have been able to spare. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday, we were anxious that honorable senators should have an opportunity to prepare for this most important debate. I emphasize that, as an Australian and as a Britisher, I am proud of this agreement. It is an important step towards cementing more firmly the ties of Empire. The agreement will prove to be of definite benefit to Australia, and I believe it has the approval of the vast majority of the electors of all parties. It will promote the safety of Australia, and will define more clearly our place among the great nations of the world. I do not suggest that as yet we are a great nation. One day, it may be long after I and other honorable senators have passed on, Australia will be a great nation, with a large population. In this agreement, Australia has stated its position explicitly, and without disrespect to Great Britain or the United States of America. We have blazed a trail which future governments will be glad to follow. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators on this side of the House expected the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> in the course of his speech, to deal fully with the agreement.' They expected him to give' reasons for entering into the agreement.  and to answer the criticism levelled against it by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay), Senator Spicer</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride.</inline> Each of them dealt very fully with the agreement, and I am sure that all of us oh this side are disappointed that the Minister, in his defence of it, did not go more thoroughly into it. In the concluding part of his speech he referred to questions affecting Australia and Great Britain. We agree with a great deal of what he said in that regard, but I am anxious to know why the agreement was entered into at all. Where was the necessity for creating any such document? Are we -to assume that, before the conference was held and the agreement made, relations between New Zealand and Australia were unfriendly? Is not the contrary the case; that the most happy relations have existed between them throughout the years? Is it not a fact that there has never been any conflict between that Dominion and the Commonwealth? It is not long since they entered into a reciprocal trade agreement with one another, since when they have traded with one another in the most friendly way. Where was the necessity tor drawing up a document which implies that unhappy relations had previously existed ? Why create the impression that our relations were ever in doubt? It would have created a much plea san te r feeling, if such an agreement had been necessary, to place it before the Parliaments of the two countries for ratification. It is not like making an agreement with a foreign country, with which our relations were doubtful, by means of ambassadors 'and diplomats, to be followed later by an open or secret treaty. It is strange that New Zealand and Australia should  now have to declare to the world that they have at last reached agreement on what are practically internal matters, seeing that they are friendly members of the one Empire. Not only that, but they also announce agreement on international and inter-allied affairs. It is a moat unfortunate and ill-timed happening, seeing that we are now looking to directions other than New Zealand for substantial support. </para>

                <para>Some of the provisions of the agreement may in the future be of great embarrassment to both countries. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> will shortly attend in London a conference of representatives of the self-governing portions of the Empire, at which this agreement will pro hahbly cause him great embarrassment.

                    <para>That all the words after "That" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words : - " in the opinion of the Senate the agreement entered into by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government, of the Dominion of New Zealand is ill-timed and should not be implemented until such time as the Prime Minister of Australia attends the Imperial Conference to be held this year, as the contents of such agreement may cause embarrassment to the Prime Minister in discussing Km pi re and inter-allied questions which form part of the agreement, and may prejudice Australia's position at such conference ". </para>

                <para class="block">This is the only opportunity that we in the Opposition have of expressing, in a definite way, our disapproval of the agreement as a whole. We do not disagree with all its contents, as many of its provisions have been long and  honorably  observed between the two countries. In what position will the Prime Minister find himself in London in ' a few months' time, when the members of the family of the British " Empire gather round the conference table? What is he to say when inter-allied, international and empire questions dealt with in the agreement come up for consideration? They are bound to be discussed at the conference, at which he will be present to represent the Parliament and people of Australia, and he will be bound by this agreement, described as a solemn compact, in which this Parliament has not had a voice. But that is not the worst aspect, for the agreement deals not only with matters affecting Australia and New Zealand, but also is all-embracing and cuts right across international matters on which the signatories have formed immature judgment on matters which would not have been dealt with had the proposals been postponed until after the Imperial Conference. What need existed for this agreement? The two dominions were friendly to each other, perhaps more friendly now than ever before, and they were amicably trading with each other. I doubt whether the relationship between the two countries could be closer. The agreement refers to defence, but who would suggest that the defence policies of the two dominions are inconsistent. Whichever way one examines the agreement one must conclude that it is not only unnecessary, but also unwelcome, in that the interests of the United States of America are ignored. Who knows but that it might not be a disturbing element in the relationship between this country and America? Moreover, who are we to act in this way without reference to the feelings and interests of other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations? Other British countries may consider this agreement most obnoxious. What therefore shall be our position at the Imperial Conference if the representatives of Great Britain and the other dominions, which have been ignored in this agreement, take exception to it? </para>
                <para>This agreement has been put before us as a document which we may only discuss. "We cannot do anything else. It is improper that an ' agreement of such far-reaching character should have been made, except tentatively and subject to the approval of the Commonwealth Parliament. I am sure that no other two dominions would be so foolish as to enter into an agreement like the AustralianNew Zealand Agreement, but what attitude would our representatives take at the Imperial Conference if South Africa and Canada sent their representatives to that conference with their hands tied by an agreement which they had made without reference to us or to any other member of the British Commonwealth? We should not like it, but that is the position into which we by our precipitate action have forced Great Britain and all the other dominions, except New Zealand. When the Prime Minister of Great Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill^</inline> calls the British Dominions into a family gathering to discuss measures to ensure their mutual safety and the policy which the Empire shall apply in international affairs, he will be confronted by the Prime Minister of this country - and it may be not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> as the result of the swing of the political pendulum - having in his hand, signed and sealed, an agreement relating to the Pacific made with New Zealand. Whoever he may be, the Prime Minister of Australia will have to say, "I am sorry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill.</inline> Although I agree with the attitude of Great Britain and the other dominions in respect of the matters of foreign policy which you have put forward, my hands arc tied. I ought not to have attended. Australia has already made an agreement with New Zealand which runs counter to what you have in mind. We have entered into this solemn compact and, therefore, I cannot discuss matters which should be to our mutual benefit ". What a disastrous position we shall have reached. The Prime Minister signed this agreement with a full knowledge of its terms and implications, and fully aware that he, or another Prime Minister, would be attending' the </para>

Knowing that whoever represents Australia at that Imperial Conference should have a mind entirely free from prejudice, he ought to have taken a different course, and it is to be deplored that he failed to do so. I remind the Leader of the Senate that the Prime Minister is the Prime Minister of Australia, not the Prime Minister of the Labour party, and that he will go to Great Britain to speak for Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">SO, but he should go to Great Britain completely untrammelled as will the representatives of other dominions with the exception of New Zealand. It would be interesting to hear  the  Leader of the Senate say what led up to the making of this agreement. To assume that New Zealand took the initiative is inconsistent with everything that New Zealand has ever done in international matters. It is clear that this Government took the initiative. Whoever was responsible has no bearing on whether the agreement is good or bad, but where the initiative lay "is clear. I move my amendment with feelings of goodwill towards the Government. I believe that it sets out the proper course to take, for, if ever there was a time in the history of the British Empire when its members should be able to take counsel together free of prejudice, it is now. In justification of this agreement the Leader of the Senate quoted a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Manchester Guardian</inline> ; but what do honorable senators opposite expect the attitude of a British Prime Minister, or of a newspaper such as that mentioned, to be in a case like this. Would they attack a dominion for having taken this action? No, they are too generous; they do not do such things in Great Britain. Rather would they say, " Poor fellows, we are sure that they are well-intentioned. They have made a mistake, but probably no harm is done, and when their representatives come over here we shall talk to them kindly and no doubt they will repent, and perhaps take early steps to have the agreement reviewed . This is a most unfortunate happening. It will embarrass the Prime Minister when he goes overseas, and prejudice the interests of this country when Empire  problems affecting us are being considered at the forthcoming conference. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not sure that the amendment which has- been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays is in order. Early this year, the full Cabinets of Australia and New Zealand determined that the agreement would have to be ratified by the respective dominion governments. In January, the Commonwealth Government ratified the agreement, and in February, similar action was taken by New Zealand, so that the agreement is now in operation. I am at a loss to understand what the mover of this amendment hopes to achieve. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> read a long screed which, no doubt, somebody had prepared for him, and. which, from start to finish, was a condemnation of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the Labour Government for having conspired with representatives of the New Zealand Government, for the sinister purpose of reaching an agreement; yet we find that the amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays proposes to protect this " sinister " person when he attends the forthcoming Imperial Conference. It is also so much " hooey ". The people of this nation will not bc interested in the amendment because it has been moved with the sole purpose of endeavouring to discredit this Government merely because it proposes no longer to be a marionette in the scheme of things. The Commonwealth Government will not go on as a " Yes " man as did the governments of which the Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> were members. In the past, governments of this country have been called upon to agree to many things which, although they may have been in the interests of the British Commonwealth of Nations generally, were not in the best interests of Australia. As a consequence, we have just drifted along; but now we have reached an agreement with our sister Dominion of New Zealand and when the war ends, delegates will be sent from these two countries to the peace conference, who will speak with one voice in the interests of British people living in this part of the world. That is a big step forward, but apparently it is greatly resented by big business interests, such as the banks, insurance companies and shipping companies, who, no doubt, would like very much to see the amendment carried so that the agreement would be inoperative. It is most important that Australian and <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> Zealand delegates to the Peace Conference should be in complete agreement. I believe that intelligent people all over the world regard this agreement as desirable for Australia and for New Zealand. In this part of the world, we are far  - removed  from the heart of Great Britain and so it was very difficult for that country to render to this nation any real assistance when an invasion by the Japanese seemed imminent. I do not wish to detract from the wonderful waieffort that has been made by the peopleof Great Britain, but when our shores, were threatened and it was feared that bombs might fall upon the women and! children of this country at any time,, Great Britain was unable to render any effective assistance to us. We recall, for instance, what happened to the ships that were sent to Singapore. We do not want that state of affairs to recur in future. If we were to continue in the future as we have done in the past, and acquiesce in actions which might be in the interests of Canada or of South Africa, but certainly were not in the interests of Australia itself, we should soon find ourselves in trouble in the postwar .years, when we shall be called upon to hold our own with whatever powerful nations may emerge in the Pacific as a result of the war. </para>

                <para>The interests behind the Leader of the Opposition and his supporters are keenly anxious to scrap this agreement. Australia and New Zealand have decided upon a form of control of civil aviation in the post-war period, which may detrimentally affect shipping companies and other vested interests. Week after week they send propaganda to members of this Parliament urging them to advocate that civil aviation in the post-war period should be conducted by private enterprise. They do not desire the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New Zealand to speak with one voice at an international conference on civil aviation. </para>
                <para>As I stated earlier, successive Commonwealth Governments sent representatives  to imperial conferences but they were only " Yes " men. They were anti-Australian and they 'left this country without any real protection." If the Japanese had invaded Darwin after they had bombed it so heavily, I do not know what would have been the fate of the people there. I am proud to support this Labour Government which has ratified the agreement with New Zealand, which spells progress and will have a beneficial effect upon the future of this nation. A majority of the newspapers have commented favorably upon the ratification of the agreement. Members of the Labour party have been charged with being isolationists. I remind our critics that Australia is isolated from the heart of the British Empire, and the object of this agreement is to secure adequate protection for the Commonwealth in future. Aviation has conquered distance. Whereas a sea voyage previously occupied weeks, an aircraft can cover the distance in a few days. Consequently, nations have been brought much closer together. The representatives of the Common wealth, who attend the Peace Conference will be mindful of these matters and will ensure that Australia and New Zealand shall, in the future, get a bigger share from the pool of the Commonwealth of Nations. </para>

                <para class="block">With a menace of that kind hanging over us, it is almost futile for Australia and New Zealand, both countries with very small populations, ito attempt to make a defensive agreement such as that contained ' in the New Zealand pact, without consulting our great friends and relatives, the peoples of Great Britain and the United States of America. Goodness knows how long it will take Australia to attain a population of 50,000,000; but, until that has been reached., no matter how willing and proficient we may be, we must rely on the assistance of Great Britain and the "United States of America. Apart from treaty making, no matter how attractive it may be from the propaganda and publicity angles - and the Lord knows that enough was made out of the signing of the agreement - there is the wider field still to be thought of. Nothing we do should endanger our future relations with Great Britain and the United States of America. Australia, and even New Zealand, are only inviting trouble by entering into such pacts without consultation, first of all, with our stronger friends, Great Britain and the United States of America. We are deliberately provoking retaliation on the part of our Allies by entering into such agreements. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> has mentioned the commendation of the press of Great Britain with regard to this pact, but I contend that Australia and New Zealand have done something with which many people in Great Britain possibly do not agree, although they would probably not say so. The press of Great Britain looks upon these dominions like an indulgent mother who in an admiring way, sees the young cubs of the Empire at play; but should their attitude be mischievous, the mother would cease to be so indulgent and would become more of a realist. The reports seeping through to the Mother Country with regard to this agreement were entirely those given out by the Department of Information, and I doubt whether some of the press correspondents had actually read the agreement.

                    read by the Leader of the Senate, I should say definitely that they had not read the agreement. To ignore the Mother Country and the United States of America on the one hand, and yet to include in the agreement a reference to future consultations with them regarding the defence zone of the Pacific, is one of the features of the agreement which rather astonishes me. Clause 22 of the agreement states -

                <para class="block">In clause 30 there is another reference to the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America and to the French Committee of National Liberation. It is astonishing to me that this agreement was made between two British Dominions without consultation with the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Had those two Governments been consulted, I think that the Leader of the Senate would have answered the question I addressed to him three weeks ago regarding the matter, but he ignored it. It is strange that a pact should be made between two countries and that provisions should be made in it with regard to other governments which have not been consulted at all as to the drafting of the agreement. That indicates an amateurish hand, and does not promise well for future agreements in which Australia may be interested. </para>

                <para class="block">If we described an arc off the western coast of Australia along a line representing about 113 degrees east longitude to the north of the Equator and down to western Samoa, which would be about 164 degrees west longitude, we should take in approximately the "whole of the Netherlands East Indies, the Portuguese possession of Timor, the Carolines, and the Mariana Islands. We could go still farther north to the south of the Philippines and then down to western Samoa. That would embrace an area which has nothing whatsoever to do with Australia or New Zealand. In fact, it is impertinent to put into this agreement vaguely worded expressions which could be construed to mean almost anything. If we are to enter into a specific pact, as this agreement purports to be, we should, be specifie in our language,, or we may be misunderstood. To suggest that Australia and New Zealand, without consultation "with the Mother Country or the United States of America, will draw an arc, defining a common defence zone through former possessions of the Kingdom of Holland, the Portuguese Republic and the United States of America is sheer impertinence and may lead to complications to the detriment of Australia in negotiations with those countries at the peace table. Therefore, this agreement is a very poor example of Australian diplomacy and the publicity associated with the signing of the document was wholly unwarranted. I realize. . that among Australians can be found men of sufficient ability and experience to prove themselves the equal of statesmen in any other country in the drafting and making of treaties, but I suggest that this pact shows the imprint of an amateur, and the hand of a minor Napoleon who is rather ruthless in his definitions and statements so far as the interests and feelings of other countries are concerned. I repeat that until Australia's population reaches: the 50,000,000 mark we shall, have to be very careful of what we say or do in any matter that concerns any of our Allies ; and we should avoid giving gratuitous insults to those countries, because this pact is a gratuitous insult to some- of our Allies.

Listening to the remarks made by the- Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> and his colleagues, one would come to the conclusion that the leaders of the two Governments merely conspired to devise a nefarious arrangement to the detriment of Great Britain. I think that I shall be pardoned for placing that interpretation upon, their remarks. No valid objection can be raised to this agreement. It is simply an attempt on. the part of Australia and New Zealand to reach a common understanding for the purpose of ensuring the economic security of the respective countries in the post-war period. That is the essence of the agree-' ment, and, therefore, I cannot understand the attitude now adopted towards it by honorable senators opposite. It would appear that they merely desire to drive a wedge 'between Australia and our Allies.

I submit in all sincerity that the Prime Minister would not sign such an agreement without realizing the full extent to which he was committing himself and his country. I have every confidence in him. lam sure that in no circumstances would he be a party to an endeavour to break the friendly relations existing between Australia and the Mother Country, and between Australia and the United States of America. When he associates himself with an agreement such as this he knows what he is doing. Much of the hostility to the agreement displayed during the debate by honorable senators <inline font-style="italic">oDposite</inline> arises from their dislike of the existence of Labour governments in Australia and New Zealand. Both governments, being possessed of vision, are looking ahead to see what can be done in. the interests of 'the people of this country and of our New Zealand cousins, so kindly referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald. The members of the Opposition are even prepared, judging by their contributions to this debate, to damage the reputation of those two countries in the opinion of other nations. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Government had prescribed limits beyond which Australians were not allowed to fight. I do not know why he and another honorable senator opposite mentioned that matter, but I do know, on authentic information, that in this country there were 850,000 soldiers prepared to fight anywhere in the world. </para>

I have a son in the Navy, and have a good idea what parts of the world he has visited since he joined. We, therefore, have the Australian Army, Air Force and Navy doing everything within their power to bring the war to a successful conclusion. Do honorable senators opposite overlook t]ie fact that Australian Imperial Force troops have been on active service in the Middle East, and elsewhere? Is it not a fact that the Australian Imperial Force divisions were reinforced from time to time? Members of the Opposition have always desired to get back to the old slogan of conscription, as is proved by the fact that more than one of them have made reference to the existence of two armies in Australia. There may be two armies, but if I understand the position correctly, those armies are under a single command, and in the defence of the islands to the. no nth of this country, it was found necessary to use our Citizen Military Forces because the Australian Imperial Force was overseas when it was required most urgently. So, when honorable senators claim that this agreement is ill-timed, they should remember that many of their remarks may be rather illtimed so far as the interests of the people of Australia are concerned. It is our desire to maintain between the people of this country and the peoples of New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, Russia, the United States of America and Great Britain complete unanimity of purpose in the conflict in which we are all engaged. </para>

                        <para>- That is just the trouble. Apparently the majority of the Opposition is prepared upon any pretext whatsoever to encourage the belief that the Labour Government is not capable of carrying on the Administration of this country. The Curtin Government was returned at the last general elections with probably the largest majority in the House of Representatives in our history, and I am convinced that the people of Australia are solidly behind this Administration. When they know the facts relating to this agreement, I am sure that they will be whole-heartedly in favour of it. When the Prime Minister, in the early months of 1942, had the courage to ask the  President  of the United States of America to send aid to this country, he was glibly termed a traitor to Great Britain. I dare say that that is the incident which led to the charge by the Leader of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Opposition, that the Prime Minister had turned his back upon Great Britain. As the Leader of the Senate has said, that is purely political propaganda aimed at creating in the minds of the people of this country doubt as to the ability of the Government to perform the task that is required of it. I answer that charge in this way: It was the Curtin Government which first put Australia on a full war footing. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that during the early part of the war, previous governments did set in motion certain manufacturing establishments to produce war materials, and that they did send our Australian Imperial Force overseas; but beyond that what did they accomplish? Members of those Governments could not agree amongst themselves, and when the Curtin Administration assumed office it had to straighten out a chaotic state of affairs. The Leader of the Opposition expressed the opinion that the most offensive provision of the agreement is the blunt declaration of the intention to resume the control of our island possessions in the regaining of which few, if any, of our men have taken any part. That the honorable gentleman should make such a statement is beyond my comprehension, because it is common knowledge that members of the Commonwealth </para>

                        <para>- I have been examining the remarks of honorable senators opposite in the hope that they would reveal the " nigger in the woodpile ". Are they fearful that the Labour governments of Australia and New Zealand will not be sufficiently active to protect monopolistic concerns and vested interests? That seems to be the reason for their fears. Reference has been made to air transport in the future. What is wrong with the governments of the two dominions agreeing on a policy for the control of air transport in this part of the world after the war? In what way have they exceeded their rights in dealing with this matter? I regard many of the remarks of honorable senators opposite as an insult to the people of New Zealand. Opposition senators say, in effect, that the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth and the Prime Minister of New Zealand are too immature to draw up an agreement: the inference is that an agreement drafted by men belonging to a different political party would be regarded as satisfactory. I remind the Senate that the agreement has been prepared by men in whom the people of Australia and New Zealand have confidence. That being so, how can it be so ill-advised, and so badly drawn, as the Opposition would have us believe? The case of the Opposition must be weak indeed for its members to resort to such poor arguments. Let us have a look at the agreement in order to see what justification honorable senators opposite have for their claim that it is obnoxious to the people of Great Britain and the United States of America. Under the heading " Definition of objectives of AustralianNew Zealand co-operation " the following appears : - </para>

                <para class="block">Surely there is nothing wrong with that. Some honorable senators opposite have already said that the agreement is illtimed, and is not worth .the paper on which it is written. By the amendment we are asked to defer a declaration on this matter in the hope that the agreement will not incommode the Prime Minister when he attends the Imperial Conference which is to be held a few weeks hence. There is not a word in the agreement to which, any honorable senator can reasonably take exception, and there is nothing in it which could give offence to the people of Great Britain and the United States of America. In fact, I am of the opinion that the people of those countries are more broadminded than honorable senators opposite. Paragraph 13 provides - </para>

                <para class="block">It will be noticed that the paragraph contains the words, "within the framework of a general system of world security". The inclusion of those words immediately indicates that the agreement has been drawn up, not with the intention to isolate Australia from the rest of the British race and from ils Allies, but for the purpose of pointing out to the United Kingdom and the rest of our Allies in this war the principles which the people of Australia and New Zealand are of opinion should be applied in a certain set of circumstances. Paragraph 14 reads - </para>

                    <para>The two Governments regard it as « matter of cardinal importance that they should both be associated, not only in the membership, but also in the planning and establishment, of the general international organization referred to in the Moscow Declaration of October, 1943, which organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States and open to membership by all such States, large or small, for the maintenance of international peace and security. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That paragraph has not been referred to by any honorable senator opposite. Is it because of that provision that honorable senators who have already spoken are opposed to this pact? That paragraph merely implies that the Moscow Declaration of October, 1943, expresses the opinion of the leaders of political thought in Australia and New Zealand that those two countries should bc associated with any other countries, large or small, an the maintenance of international peace and security. What is wrong with that? The League of Nations collapsed because the member nations would not honour its covenants. We have always hoped that a system will be evolved throughout the world whereby the holocaust of war can be averted and replaced by international arbitration. What is the Moscow declaration other than a further effort to determine international disputes on the basis of arbitration, instead of on the basis of brutal war? I again ask honorable senators what is wrong with that. I believe the agreement to be in the best interests of the people of Australia, and New Zealand. It will not jeopardize the friendly relations between those two countries and our Allies in this terrible conflict. </para>

                            slated that 850,000 had volunteered for service anywhere in the world, and, as I have just shown, that statement is not correct. The figure which I have taken from the Government's official bulletin is more likely to be correct. I also wish to correct the implication made" by the Leader of the Senate

                            that at present Australia is fulfilling its contracts with Great Britain for the supply of foodstuffs. That statement also is very far from the truth. In 1939-40, Australia sent 244,000,000 lb. of butter to Great Britain, and from that peak exports of butter to Great Britain declined to 110,000,000 lb. in 1942-48, the decline being more than half. The decline in our meat exports to Great Britain is equally alarming. In 1939-40 we sent 582,000,000 lb. to Great Britain whereas, in 1942-43, we sent only 246,000,000 lb. ' Cheese exports to Great Britain declined from 40,000,000 lb. in 1939-40 to 15,000,000 in 1942-43.

                        <para>- So far -as this agreement is concerned, I applaud the Government for negotiating with the Government of New Zealand in reference to matters of mutual concern to both countries ; but I deplore the fact that the Government should enter into an agreement which vitally concerns domestic problems in this country without reference to Parliament. I also deplore the fact that this agreement contains matters which vitally concern the interests of Allied countries, but has, nevertheless, been entered into without consultation with those countries. The press and the general public are becoming gravely concerned over the present drift from democratic government since this Government assumed office. We are the elected representatives of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> democratic people, and we should be responsible for  making  the laws of this land. Yet, to-day, we are told that certain agreements have been made which vitally affect the whole domestic life of this country and other countries, but in respect of which Parliament was not consulted. I also deplore the fact that the Government has attempted to stifle discussion of this agreement by the Senate even at this stage. This motion was kept at the bottom of the list of business on the notice-paper for several sitting days, and only because of the absence of a Government supporter was the Opposition able to defeat the Government's attempt to prevent this discussion. The Government gives this opportunity to us now simply because we were able to force it to do so. Otherwise, we should not have been given any opportunity at all to discuss the matter. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue><para>The agreement deals with many matters which concern rights which are intimately associated with the lives of our citizens. I refer, for example, to paragraph 35 of the agreement, which provides that the two governments agree thai: their co-operation for defence should be developed by the organization of the armed forces under a common doctrine. In respect of the present and future defence of this country, Australia and New Zealand undertake to organize their armed forces under a common doctrine. If that clause means what it says, and if Australia, insofar as the organization of its armed forces is concerned, is to adopt a common policy with New Zealand, and intends to adopt the New Zealand policy, every honorable  senator on this side of the chamber 'will agree that a great step forward has been taken by Australia in this matter. I propose to discuss briefly the organization of the armed forces of New Zealand and compare it with that of the armed forces of Australia in order to show the vital difference existing between the two systems. Since the outbreak of the war, New Zealand has had conscription. The whole of its man-power has been organized for service wherever required, and in pursuance of that policy New Zealand has maintained during the greater part of the war two divisions overseas. During the early years of the war, New Zealand had a division in the Middle East, and, later, one New Zealand division was in the Middle East and another in the Pacific area. The whole organization of the armed forces of New Zealand is based upon conscription for service wherever required, whereas the organization of the armed forces of Australia is based upon an entirely different system. It is on the basis of two armies, one of which can serve wherever required, whilst the operations of the other are restricted to certain very limited areas. Is this agreement merely window dressing, is it merely a scrap of paper to be ignored when the Government desires and observed at other times, or does it mean what it says, that Australia and New Zealand are to have only the one organization of the armed forces, under a common doctrine? If it means that, then either Australia must adopt the New Zealand method of organization or New Zealand must adopt the Australian method. If it is in the minds of the Government that, in bringing about this common doctrine of organization of the armed forces, Australia is to remove restrictions on the operations and services of its troops so as to enable them to serve, as the New Zealand forces can serve, wherever required, then I am sure that it will receive the support of honorable senators on this side. If, on the other hand, in order to bring about organization under a common doctrine, it is necessary for New Zealand to adopt our system of two armies, it will be d deplorable, state of affairs. If the paragraph is merely window-dressing, and means nothing, in spite of the fact that the two Prime Ministers have announced their agreement that the organization of the armed forces of the two countries shall be under a common doctrine, and they do not propose to bring them under such a doctrine, the whole agreement is simply a sham, and on a par with certain other international agreements which have been nothing but scraps of paper. I suggest that the agreement should have been brought before Parliament which should decide how our armed forces should be organized. </para><para>There are also differences between the organization of man-power in New Zealand and Australia. I again suggest to the Government, I hope helpfully, that it could learn many lessons from the methods of organization of the armed forces and man-power of New Zealand. When war was declared New Zealand conscripted its man-power. Australia did not. When Japan entered the war, the whole of the New Zealand forces were made available, in terms of the Allied strategy, for service wherever required. Australian forces were not. When, some time last year, the Prime Ministers of the two countries were able to announce that an immediate threat of invasion of Australia and New Zealand no longer existed, the latter dominion took immediate steps to adjust its  man-nower  so as to achieve the maximum war effort. The people of both countries, and the members of every party in them, agree that our aim is to win the war as quickly as possible, and that the whole of the man-power and resources of each country should be marshalled for the attainment of that end, hut we differ greatly as to the method of achieving it. When the threat of invasion was removed from Australia and New Zealand, the latter dominion took immediate steps to readjust its whole war economy on a new basis. Instead of retaining thousands of men in uniform in the home defence forces when the threat of invasion was removed, New Zealand took immediate steps to return its men to industry. When I say " its men " I mean the men of the home army. The Commonwealth Government, in spite of repeated requests from members of the Opposition in this Parliament that it should release man-power to provide Great Britain and other Allied countries with vital supplies, has adopted a very dilatory policy in relation to the release of man-power for essential industries. T have before me the report of the Commander-in-Chief of the New Zealand Forces, dated 20th August, 1943, and from it I quote 'the following passage: - </para><para>The hitter portion of the year has been marked by a continual decrease in the threat of Japanese action against New Zealand. Advantage has been taken of this gradual improvement to make corresponding reductions in the Home Defence Army, pursuant to the appreciations provided from time to time by the chiefs of staff. It should be emphasized that the administrative work involved in carrying out these reorganizations is enormous. In all re-organizations of the home defence forces care has been taken to ensure that the ability to  remobilize  has been retained. </para><para>The Army policy is to employ the minimum number of men on home defence and on the various services carried out for overseas forces so as to make available the maximum  number  for overseas and for industry. This policy has already resulted in the release of large, numbers from the Home Defence Army, and a steady reduction will continue for some time to come. </para><para class="block">Therefore, when the situation was altered, the Commander-in-Chief of the New Zealand Army released men of the Home Defence Army to industry. Australia, on the other hand, has not entrusted its Commander-in-Chief with similar powers. This Government desires to muddle along with dual control. Just as it has retained two armies, so to-day it has divided control so far. as the release of. man-power for essential production is concerned. The two authorities which are entrusted with the release of man-power, and which look at the subject from entirely different points of view, invariably clash when a particular individual is to be released. The reason is obvious. With divided control, each organization looks at the matter from its individual point of view. When an application for the release of an individual soldier goes to the man-power authorities and then to a local agricultural committee, that committee investigates it from the point of view of all the applications in its hands, in order to ascertain which are entitled to priority. The man-power authorities may select perhaps ten of the twenty applicants as having prior claim, and these applications are then forwarded to the Army; but the Army may rule that the men concerned are key men and cannot be released. So we find that complete chaos reigns to-day because a civil authority, and the Army are pulling one against the other. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I am discussing this matter under the paragraph which I have read to honorable senators, but perhaps the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> is unable to understand the agreement which his Government has entered into, and does not realize that it provides that co-operation for defence should be developed by the organization of armed forces under a common doctrine. Under the New Zealand system the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces makes a survey of the situation, and, in consultation with the Government, decides, first, how many men are required for service overseas. They have No. 1 priority. He then decides how many men are required on the industrial front and for food production, and they have second priority. Home defence, has No. 3 priority. So, one man is able to make decisions, whereas in Australia we have the Business Board, and the Army pulling against each other. Also, in respect of the release of men for primary production, we have the Man Power Directorate and the Army in conflict. If this agreement means that we are to take a leaf out of New Zealand's book and realize that it is not necessary to have two men doing a job which could be handled much more efficiently by one, then it will serve at least one useful purpose. I make these suggestions in the hope that they will be helpful to the Government. The more I see of the man-power situation in this country, the discontent, and the falling off of primary production which is being caused, the more I am convinced that the root of the trouble is divided control. Either the job must be done by the Army or it must be done by politicians because when they are pulling one against the other it is impossible to make progress. </para>

                    <para>The two Governments agree that, within the framework of a general system of world security, a regional zone of- defence comprising the South-west and South Pacific Areas shall be established and that this zone should be based on Australia and New Zealand, stretching  through  the arc of islands north and north-east of Australia, to Western Samoa and the Cook Islands. </para>
                </quote><para>Nations much more populous than Australia have interests in this area too, and should be given some consideration in the planning of its defence. Before making a hard and fast agreement such as this, other governments which have sovereignty over islands within the area, should have been consulted. I have no objection whatsoever to the Prime Minister of Australia and the Prime Minister of New Zealand discussing problems which are of mutual concern. I think it is desirable to do so; but I am afraid that a great deal of trouble will arise. The agreement was signed without reference to this Parliament, to the Advisory War Council, or to the several countries which have sovereignty over adjacent islands. I would like to make my attitude quite clear: So far as co-operation between New Zealand and Australia is concerned, I look forward to the day when we shall all be one big dominion, because our interests are so closely related that our legislative problems are almost identical. Men of both countries spilled their blood side by side at Anzac, El Alamein and elsewhere. The fighting men of this country have the greatest respect and admiration for their New Zealand comrades and vice versa. I believe that such conferences will be of advantage to the two countries; but it is foolish to make an agreement which ignores the rights and privileges of other countries which are concerned in matters covered by that agreement. There would not be any room for complaint if the Parliaments of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand were to enter into an agreement which purely concerned domestic matters; but when an agreement is concluded which goes far beyond domestic matters, and relates to matters of international concern, without consultation with the British Empire or the United States of America, the results may be quite undesirable. To-day American soldiers are giving their lives expelling the Japanese from some islands in this area; yet the governments of New Zealand and Australia, without consulting the United States of America, have solemnly agreed on what is to happen to those islands. </para><para class="block">Paragraph 22 states - </para><quote>

                        <para>- I do not desire to hide vn.y beliefs, nor do I shed tears about my conviction that private enterprise can do the job more efficiently. Australia's prosperity has been built by private enterprise, but the present Government, by attempting to introduce a policy of socialism, is wrecking that prosperity. Whether or not the Government, agrees that air routes should be controlled under a system of socialism does not get away from my contention that it has no right to tie up Australia in an agreement for government control of international air-lines without first consulting Parliament. The people of the two dominions may prefer that international air.-lines should be conducted by private enterprise, but what voice have they been given in this. matter? They send their representatives to their respective parliaments, and they have a right to expect that those representatives shall be consulted on those matters. Behind the back of' the Parliament the Government' has entered into ' an agreement affecting not only Australia's domestic policy but also its policy in international affairs. Paragraph 25: of the agreement provides - </para>

The only way to negotiate is fairly and openly with all the parties affected. When the Prime Minister entered into this agreement, I have no doubt that he acted with the best intentions, but unfortunately he has led Australia in dangerous ways. The agreement has already been the subject of adverse criticism in the United States of America and Great Britain. That, I suggest, is only natural when a government which professes to be democratic acts in an entirely undemocratic way, as is the case here. The dictatorial methods of the present Government are the subject of much adverse comment among the people of this country. Those who believe in democracy are alarmed at the Fascist and Nazi tendencies which are creeping in. </para>

At one time it was considered that he was the saviour of that country, and the one man who was prepared to stand up against Germany and Italy in protecting the freedom and independence of Yugoslavia ; but, as time has progressed., we find that Marshal Tito now represents the body of opinion in Yugoslavia that is fighting for the freedom and democracy of that country. When France fell, General De Gaulle came out as the leader of the Free French, and the one man who was prepared, despite the decisions of his own Government, to fight for a free France. As time went on, however, the French Committee of National Liberation was recognized as the body speaking for France. It would be dangerous to make binding agreements with other countries with regard to what is to happen when hostilities cease. </para><para>For that reason the action of the Commonwealth Government in having discussions with the Government of New Zealand, and informing its mind as to points on which the two Governments are in agreement, and on what matters they disagree, is all to the good; but to go so far as. to make an agreement as to the disposal of certain territories in the Pacific without consultation with Great Britain, the United States of America, and other countries, whose fighting men are now freeing those territories from the Japanese menace, can only do harm in respect of future negotiations. Therefore, I strongly support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays. This agreement was signed by the Government without reference to Parliament. Although it embodies the views of the Government and the Australian Labour party, it has not the endorsement of this Parliament, and therefore does not reflect the opinion of the Australian people. The Prime Minister should not have his hands tied by this agreement when he goes to Great Britain. As far as certain French possessions are concerned, it may be that Great Britain and the United States of America have different ideas from those set out in the agreement. South Africa and Canada may also have different views. Why should the hands of Australia's representative be tied? The amendment should be agreed to, and the Government should say, " "We are sending <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> overseas to discuss with Great Britain and the United States of America the problems of the Pacific, but he will go with a free hand and an open mind ". He should not go as a man who is tied hand and foot by an agreement entered into without consultation with the Commonwealth Parliament and the people of Australia. </para></speech>

                    <para>.- I am in duty bound to oppose the amendment. Australia and New Zealand have much, in common, and in many respects their interests are identical. Since the outbreak of war in the Pacific they have been drawn more closely together than ever previously. The war has shown the necessity for the utmost co-operation between the Governments and the peoples of the two dominions. The agreement does not bind this country to any specific undertakings. </para>

                        <para>- Nobody with common sense could, interpret it otherwise. It does not infringe the private rights of the people of either Australia or New Zealand. It does not involve any alteration of the laws of the land, or any charge upon the people. No secession of territory belonging to either dominion is contemplated. Hearing the speeches of honorable senators opposite, one would imagine that Australia was to give away the whole of its external territories. One would think that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> was tied hand and foot to whatever the Prime Minister of New Zealand, might say with regard to Australia's external policy, but the Prime Minister will have a perfectly free hand when he goes to Great Britain. As stated by the right honorable gentleman himself, the Governments of the two dominions have now entered into a firm and lasting agreement, and will consult one another in all of their important dealings with other powers. Is there anything wrong in two members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, which are isolated from the rest of the white populations of the world, consulting one another on important matters of external policy, when their interests are identical and their future well-being depends on their mutual development? If unity counts for anything it must give strength, and, if the two Governments concerned can come to a mutual arrangement on matters of foreign policy without jeopardizing their own positions, it must be far better for them to speak with one voice and to pull together than to hold divergent views. Honorable senators opposite have said nothing about agreements made with other countries in respect of the post-war period. An agreement has been reached between four big powers about which we have heard nothing from the Opposition. I recall the Moscow Declaration of October, 1943, article 4 of which sets out - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">Those four powers reached agreement on certain fundamental principles, and decided that after the war they could speak with one voice. No doubt, in the post-war era, those powers, if they adhere to their principles, will be able to speak with one voice with regard to certain important matters. Australia and New Zealand are part and parcel of one of those great powers, and will not be content to be dictated to as though they were little boys as to what they must do, without having a voice in the control of affairs in this part of the world. The point I emphasize is that in the past this Parliament has been merely the puppet of the British Government. Today, however, our Prime Minister, like the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> when he was </para>
                <para class="block">Prime Minister in 1914, 1915 and 1916, is determined that Australia shall make decisions for itself in matters which vitally concern this nation. Consequently, Australia and New Zealand set out clearly in the agreement their just claims in respect of the development of this part of the world after the war. Honorable senators opposite object to that because they do not believe that Australia should have any voice at all in deciding what place it shall occupy among the nations in the post-war world. They do not believe that Australian soldiers who have fought on all battle-fields in this war, and on practically all the islands in the South-West Pacific war zone, should have any voice through their leaders in securing the future defence of the Commonwealth and New Zealand. I have not the slightest doubt that, had this Government's predecessor remained in office, Australia's claim to have a voice in such matters after the war would not be advanced at all. However, the present Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand arc sufficiently courageous to stand up for the rights of British possessions in the Pacific even though, in doing so, they clash with financial interests who wish to regain complete control of the world's trade. It is not surprising, therefore, that honorable senators opposite condemn this agreement because primarily it reflects that change of attitude on the part of these two dominions to which I have just referred. As it is true that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, all who believe in the British Commonwealth of Nations will welcome this agreement which strengthens two of the links in the chain. In the post-war period, Great Britain will require the fullest possible assistance from all parts of the British Commonwealth, and this agreement will enable Australia and New Zealand to be better able to render that assistance when it is required to the Mother Country or to any other part of the Empire. No longer should any of the Dominions sit back and accept dictation from outside as to what policies it must pursue in its relation with other countries. Each of the Dominions has a right to determine its own policy in that respect, and it should exercise that right. </para>
                <para>Honorable senators opposite seem to overlook the fact that the agreement is consultative in character, and is designed primarily to enable Australia and New Zealand to co-operate in their approach to major problems, and to speak with one voice with respect to those problems. Here again it can be said that unity is strength. The same principle can be observed by all parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and not merely by Australia and New Zealand, when problems arise of vital concern to the .Empire as a whole. In such circumstances all of the Dominions should speak with one voice. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am of opinion that Australia and New Zealand would not welcome anything, more than an arrangement between all parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations for the organization and control of air services between all parts of the Empire. Honorable senators opposite fear that such a plan will not be allowed to be implemented by private interests which they represent in this chamber. </para>

                <para>I now propose to reply to certain points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> whodealt specifically with several paragraphs of the agreement. Whilst he read only those which suited his argument, he omitted to read others which more truly reflect the spirit and intention of the agreement as a whole. First, he referred to paragraph 13, which reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The two Governments agree that, within the  framework  of a general system of world security, a regional zone of defence comprising the South-West and South Pacific areas shall be established and that this zone should be based on Australia and Now Zealand, stretching through the arc of islands north and north-east of Australia, to Western Samoa and the Cook Islands. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Is there anything wrong in the action of the two government? in expressing that opinion? It is purely an expression of opinion, and does not bind either government to a specific course of action. Surely, what Australia and New Zealand have done is preferable to leaving matters of such vital concern to both countries to governments of European countries, who, in the past, have arrogated the right <inline font-style="italic">to&gt;</inline> themselves to tell Australia and New Zealand what policy they should follow in such matters. If that policy is applied after this war, it is possible that New Guinea and the Solomons, for instance, may be placed under the control of a foreign power, in which case we shall find ourselves unable to fortify islands which are of vital importance strategically to the defence of Australia and New Zealland. I again emphasize that under the agreement Australia and New Zealand do not attempt to dictate to other countries, but simply express their willingness to consult with other powers which have interests in the South-West Pacific Area. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> did not deal with paragraph 34' of the agreement which reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The two Governments agree that, as soon as practicable, there should be a frank exchange of views on the problems of security, post-war development and native welfare between properly accredited representatives of the Governments with existing territorial interests in the South-West Pacific area or in the South Pacific area, or in both, namely, in addition to the two Governments,  His  Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, the Government of the United States of America, the Government of the Netherlands, the French Committee of National Liberation and the Government of Portugal, and  His  Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth of Australia should take the necessary steps to call a conference of the Governments concerned. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>What is wrong with that provision? After all, Australia is the largest country in this part of the world, and, therefore, it is only proper that it should take the initiative in proposing a conference of all the governments interested in the control of islands in the South-West Pacific with a view to devising a plan that will guarantee security to all concerned, and, at the same time, protect its own interests in the future. Nothing contained in the agreement excludes either Great Britain or the United States of America from such conferences. </para>

                        <para>- Up to date, only Australia and New Zealand have conferred on these matters; and they have taken the initiative because they are more vitally concerned than any other govern ment in such matters. However, the agreement merely sets out that as soon as practicable all governments interested in the South-West Pacific Area should confer on problems likely to arise in this part of the world in the post-war period. Apparently, the basis of the objection raised by honorable senators opposite to this paragraph in the agreement is that Australia and New Zealand do not propose to allow themselves to be thrown to the wolves in the post-war period. There can be no doubt that so far as Europe is concerned Australia was thrown to the wolves until the Japanese came into the war. We were told that we would have to stand on our own feet, and we had to do so. At the same time, however, we sought aid wherever it was obtainable, and the fact remains that but for the assistance we received from the United States of America, this country would, to-day, be under the heel of the Japanese. Had it not been for the courageous stand taken by the Prime Minister tin that respect, I hesitate to imagine the plight we should find ourselves in to-day. Having overcome that crisis, Australia and New Zealand now contemplate taking another step in their own interests after the war, in order to ensure that these great countries will be preserved for people of the British race. We are determined to put an end to the policy whereby other countries dictate what we should do. The Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand have shown' outstanding courage in arriving at this agreement. They claim nothing to which either country is not entitled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> accused the Government of bungling in respect of Army organization and the control of man-power. He said that after the invasion crisis had passed the Government failed to take steps to transfer man-power from the armed forces to industries which were languishing through lack of manpower. Although he praised New Zealand's actions in many other respects he did not say what New Zealand had done in that regard. Neither did he tell us that thousands of men have already been released from our armed forces, and that, according to a plan now in operation, 20,000 will have been released by June next. In addition, tens of thousands of men and women have already . been released from the munitions industry in order to overcome the shortage of manpower in primary industries. </para>

Those of us who are doing our jobs know full well where the men who are being released are going. In view of the honorable senator's lack of knowledge of what is taking place in his own electorate, I should expect such an interjection from him. As regards Australia, adjusting itself after th; danger of invasion was over, honorable senators will find, if they take a commonsense view of the position, that its food production has been stepped up considerably, although we are at war, and tens of thousands fewer people are engaged in primary and other production than before the war. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator may quote figures, but he knows that portions of our contracts with Great Britain have been switched to the allied forces in the South-West Pacific Area to which Australia is sending supplies. He knows the immense quantity of food produce and other requirements, including munitions, that we are supplying to our Allies in the South- West Pacific Area. If we were not sending those things there, they could go to Great Britain, if Great Britain could supply ships to carry them. Nobody knows this better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> If he examines the statistics, he will find that what we are supplying now from our rural and secondary industries to the Australian forces, to Great Britain, and to the forces of our Allies in the South Pacific Area will create a record in Australian production, in spite of the fact that 800,000-odd Australians already in the forces have been taken away from the work of production. </para>

                        <para>- The figures aru there if the honorable senator is prepared to check them. If he does, he will find that they are creating a production record for Australia. He must take into consideration all the industrial concerns producing munitions, arms, aircraft, guns, and foods, including dehydrated products, and compare the present output with prewar figures. We are exceeding our prewar production. If we are not supply-  ing direct to Great Britain we are supplying our Allies in the South-West Pacific Area under agreement with Great Britain. Great Britain cannot have it both ways. We cannot supply our Allies in the South-West Pacific . Area on Great Britain's behalf, and supply Great Britain at the same time. Taking everything into consideration, Australia is doing a magnificent job. For the benefit of the posit-war effort we shall be able to continue, in co-operation with New Zealand, to make the weight of the two British communities in the South-West Pacific Area felt in relation to international problems. At the same time, the two countries can co-operate to solve their own common problems. The New Zealand Government, like the Commonwealth Government, is unanimously in favour of the agreement, as are the peoples of the two countries, because it will be of definite benefit to them. I congratulate the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the Prime Minister of Australia on the stand they have taken at this juncture. They have shown the world that they do hot intend to follow in the footsteps of previous governments which dominated the two countries for a quarter of a century before Labour took office, and were nothing but puppet governments of the British Government. </para>

                    <para>.-- Queer things can happen in Australia, and this is a queer agreement. The  only other queer thing comparable with it occurred in the last day or two, in the appointment of a semi-judicial body to investigate the abuses of censorship. Sitting as members of that body, to try themselves, are the three Ministers who are responsible for the censorship. I do not think that this agreement is all bad. There is a lot of boyish charm about it, much sweet innocence that greatly appeals ito me. It reminds me of a little incident that happened to me when I left my home to come to Canberra on this occasion. "Walking down the street to catch a tram, I saw about 50 yards ahead of me two small boys of eight to ten years of age, with handkerchiefs tied over their faces and toy pistols in their hands. They were playing bandits in the street, and they slipped behind a corner at my approach. I played up to them by crying "  Kamerad  " as they jumped out. This agreement is the work of two very small nations presuming to dictate to the rest of the world what is to happen. I have been looking for the cause of this sweet nonsense, and of the crude wording of the agreement. I find one reason on the first page, which discloses that nine members of the House of Representatives took part in the conference which drew up the agreement. The Senate was not considered sufficiently important to be represented at the conference table.  If  the conference had had the benefit of the common sense of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> the intelligence of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> or even the experience of the Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> - except that the agreement would never have been arrived at if he had been there to talk about it - some of the crudities which disfigure it might have been avoided. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> said that the agreement, was ' not an agreement at all, that we are still free, that our hands arc not tied, and that, although we have entered into it, the contents of the document do not have to be observed. I cannot read that into the document at all. The honorable senator says that under it we shall consult the great powers regarding all these matters upon which we have already made up our minds, and tell them that they must agree to our proposals. That i3 the essence of the argument put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett.</inline> I listened with a great deal of interest and concern to his rather boastful account of the accomplishments of the Government of which he is such a powerful supporter. I cannot help thinking that the United States of America will regard the agreement with a smile. I am afraid that Great Britain will look at it in the same way. When the honorable senator puts up such a bluff in this chamber, I can afford to smile and say little, because such boastfulness is unbecoming to an independent Australian. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the Leader of the Senate made that "point when he spoke on the motion. Does he think that the British Government would tell US if we had offended it? It would not do anything of the sort. It would smile and decide to bear with what we had done, which it would regard as being due to inexperience. I am not afraid that Great Britain will be offended by the agreement. I am more afraid that it will greet it with a smile of ridicule, which will be apparent to the rest of. the world. The Leader of the Senate said that the agreement expressed, the desires of the Australian and "New Zealand Governments. I shall read a few paragraphs to show what their desires really are. The Minister also said that they were looking forward. One cannot look very far forward with myopic eyes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> - if I may deal with one so recently recovered from the banks of the Swan - practically said that prior to 1942 the Australian Imperial Force, which had been fighting in other parts of the world, had not been defending Australia. That is something quite new. I have heard whispers of that kind before, but this is the first time that I have heard it said in plain language that the men who fought so magnificently at El Alamein and Tobruk, and achieved such a splendid victory in the Syrian campaign, were not defending Australia. Why, the very reason why they went overseas was to defend Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">That means, in effect, that Australia and New Zealand have agreed that Russia, Great Britain, and the United States of America, singly or collectively, may not conclude peace terms with Germany, Bulgaria, Rumania, or any other enemy country, until Australia and New Zealand are no longer at war with Japan, or that peace may not be achieved in the Pacific until all enemy countries in Europe have been subdued.

So far, Great Britain has smiled rather tolerantly at our antics, but that tolerance may not continue when other nations, which, perhaps, do not feel the same way towards Australia, ask Great Britain, "Why is this far-away portion of your Empire preventing us from reaching an agreement about the future peace of the world ?

Let us consider the proposal contained in paragraph 30. The Governments of the two dominions agree to promote the establishment of a South Seas Regional Commission on which, in addition !to the representatives of Australia and New Zealand, " There might be accredited representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and of the French Committee of National Liberation". The fact that other nations besides Australia and New Zealand are vitally concerned with the Pacific zone is ignored. </para>

The idea that Australia shall take the initiative in such an important matter as a conference to determine how the peace of the world shall be maintained reminds me of the story of the bull-frog which blew itself up so much that it burst. We are told that this document, to which are appended fourteen signatures, is not an agreement but merely the expression of a desire. According to paragraph 35 - </para>

                <para class="block">I should like to know something about that " common doctrine " - whether it is a Presbyterian, or some other kind of doctrine. If it means that the basic conception of the defence of the two countries is to be the same, it would appeal1 that the Commonwealth Government and its supporters are prepared to surrender that which they hold most sacred, namely, their objection to conscription for overseas service. What is the common doctrine that the two dominions are to follow? The doctrine of New Zealand is to the effect that the manhood of the country shall be required to fight wherever it is thought necessary for the defence of their country, whereas the doctrine of the Government of this country is that no man shall fight unless he volunteers to fight. There is such a big difference between the doctrines of the two dominions" that I am at a loss to know what this common doctrine means. I ca.n only think that it means that the Australian Labour party is prepared to sacrifice what is regarded as the most sacred plank of its platform. </para>

I come now to paragraph 37, which reminds me that most Labour organizations set out to do things in a bic way. First, there is an agreement containin g  a large number of words; then there is to be an organization to give effect to that agreement. Provision is made in sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> for at least two conferences a year. That would entail considerable expense. Then, under paragraph 3S, there is to be a permanent secretariat in Australia and another in New Zealand. These are to be permanent secretariats, and I suppose that the Australian </para>

I am confident that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> would agree to the release of credit for such a pui- nose. I could go farther, but I do not wish to be unkind. As I said earlier in my speech, the agreement would have been more satisfactory had it been confined to the first six paragraphs. It can be said of the agreement that it has a boyish charm - the charm of innocence and inexperience. Probably that was due to the fact that the Leader of the Senate was not considered sufficiently important to be invited to the conference. I should have thought that i» a matter of such importance the Leader of the Senate would have appended his name to the agreement. The omission of that name casts a slur on the Senate and. i ts Ministers. The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays would at least show the world, especially the Governments of Great Britain, Canada, South Africa and the United States of America, that there are still some people in Australia who are levelheaded, and have a proper conception of Australia's place in the world in that they realize that Australia and New Zealand are not as experienced or as powerful as are some other nations, fmd depend on outside help for their national existence. In matters affecting Australia's future there must be the fullest consultation with the peoples of other nations rather than that Australia and New Zealand should attempt to lay down the terms on which the future peace of the world shall be based, a.nd that no other nation is to have a voice in the discussions unless it concurs. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened to every Opposition senator who has spoken on this agreement, but I have not heard one good reason why it should not have been entered into. "We are told that without vision the people perish. "Want of vision on the part of the governments which were in office up to the outbreak of war placed this country in a state of great danger. In the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> those governments suffered from myopia. When the Lyons Government imposed a tariff barrier against Japanese goods resentment by that action was immediately caused, and justly so.. That action was taken to protect the Bradford manufacturers. When feeling became hot in Japan against the action of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham was despatched to Tokyo on a goodwill mission. When he returned to Australia he told the story of the difference between the treatment received by him on the occasion of his first visit and that meted out to him on the last occasion, when he acted as an ambassador for Australia. On the second visit, Tokyo had already signed the Axis pact, and;, instead of being received by a smiling and happy people, his movements were subject to police supervision, and foreign diplomats were not allowed to visit one another. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham said that Japan was determined to take Australia. The school children in that country had been taught for years that that was the destiny of the Japanese nation, and as soon as possible Japan would see that not one more white child was born on this continent. Yet for want of vision on the part of the governments that were in office in the Commonwealth for many years prior to the war, this terrible menace was not realized. </para>

                <para>It must be recognized that the problems of the Pacific have not been settled by the Australian-New Zealand agreement. Those two dominions are preparing their case for the " show-down " that will have to take place after the war. Judging by the speeches of honorable senators opposite, one would think that Australia has done nothing whatever to win back the islands of the Pacific occupied by Japan, although in that respect this country has clone an important job. I happened to be in Rabaul when war broke out in the Pacific. Our airmen in the Wirraway aeroplanes had to meet in combat the Japanese airmen who were equipped with the modern Zeros. Where was the vision of the Australian authorities? Better machines should have been provided for the brave men who were prepared to meet the Zeros. Want of vision has brought many a nation to its end ; yet, as far as I can see, members of the Opposition display no change of mentality or vision with regard to important matters before the world to-day. They seem to be oblivious of the flight of time, and the changes that time  brings, especially in war periods. I recall that Demosthenes told the people of decadent Greece that they required a new orientation. " Can a policy which has led us from success to failure ", he asked, " lead us back from failure to success ? " Of course, it cannot. No member of the Opposition seems to have altered his views since  the  war began. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> said that this agreement is final and no one darc find- fault with it, not even the United States of America which has done so much for the allied cause in the Pacific region. When I first spoke in this chamber I prophesied the present war, because I could see that it was inevitable. I ' said that the present monetary system had brought the world to chaos, and must inevitably lead to a war that would destroy our civilization. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite have nothing to laugh at. What would have been the position today but for the success of the Allies in the. battle of the Coral Sea ? I can see nothing to laugh at in the present world position. The chief interests to be served in this Parliament are the interests of the people who send us here and place their destiny in our hands. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogilvie,</inline> on his return from Europe, said that Australia's defence must be in the air. He added that the skies of Australia should be black with aeroplanes, but many people -asked, " Where is the necessary money to come from?" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> referred to the policy of the Commonwealth Bank, but the Treasurer of Tasmania, one of the ablest  men in Australia, provided the solution when he said that the Commonwealth Bank should be asked to advance £100,000,000 to put the necessary aeroplanes into the air. The policy of honorable senators opposite was to adhere to the present financial system which has brought us to our deplorable plight. What was advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogilvie</inline> was not done because previous governments did not know their job. What did the Menzies Government or the Fadden Government do, even after two years of war? I told them how the necessary funds could be obtained for the purpose of strengthening our defences in the air. Money was quickly provided when war was declared, but previously we could not get any financial assistance to eradicate slum conditions. The Governments of the Commonwealth and New Zealand have acted in a statesmanlike way in entering into the agreement. When the war is over every nation that has assisted in the ejection of Japan, from the territories which it now occupies will expect to have a voice- in the disposal of those islands. Australia, does not need any more territory than it now possesses. It does not wish to administer any of the South Sea islands, but it desires to ensure that they shall not fall again into the hands of the enemy. This country could absorb a population of 20,000,000. The agreement has everything to commend it, but according to the Opposition not one paragraph should be accepted. Do honorable senators opposite imagine that the Governments of the two dominions concerned have insufficient intelligence to grasp the present world situation? The Prime Minister of Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fraser,</inline> ought to know at least as much as honorable senators opposite, and they came to the conclusion that the sooner this agreement was entered into the better. Lord Randolph Churchill once said that the duty of the Opposition is to oppose everything, propose nothing, and turn the government out. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but it has been bitterly disappointed. I have seen democratic measures submitted to this chamber during the last two years which if placed on the statute-book, would have proved of benefit to everyone in Australia, but the Opposition has opposed them because it considers that its duty is to oppose all legislation. On one occasion wc had before us a bill providing for the appropriation of £200,000,000 to carry on the services of government te October last. Members of the Opposition talked for three days and three nights, but the subject-matter of the bill was never mentioned. It is well-known that a money bill cannot be amended by this chamber, but must be either accepted or rejected. The Opposition, in accordance with what it regarded as its duty, criticized the measure, but the bill was passed. Had the Opposition been in power at the present time the agreement under consideration would not have been reached. The Opposition has no vision, and that is why it has had many failures. One cannot hammer a new idea into the conservative mind. Fortunately the present Government has vision and realizes that action should be taken now to prepare for events in the post-war period. Australia does not expect to get half of the islands of the South Pacific. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> mentioned many islands and said that Australia had claimed them. No statement could be more absurd than that. 1 do not think that the honorable senator meant a word of what he said. Sometimes I am amazed at the pretence behind many of the statements made by members of the Opposition. In the House of Representatives, an ex-Minister stated that the Prime Minister and his colleagues were arrant curs, but what is the record of the Opposition when it held the reins of government? "What happened at the end of the ten-year period during which the Bruce-Page Government was in power? </para>

                    <para>. - After listening to the blackguarding of the Opposition by the previous  speaker,  and his dissertation on the duties of the Opposition, I hope to address myself to the agreement. Australia has a great bond with New' Zealand that nothing should ever be able to break. My association with New Zealanders, and probably that .of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> also, dates back to 1900, when we were marching in column with them in South Africa. I served again with them in the Great War. My brigade, the 4th Brigade, was in the same division with the New Zealand Brigade - men of the battalions from Wellington, Auckland, Canterbury and Otago. And we served together on the Gallipoli Peninsula, where our dead and wounded mingled on Pope's Hill and at Quinn's Post. Then was woven a bond which, I regret, was not strengthened as it might have been during the uneasy years which followed the last war. On two visits which I paid to New Zealand in the intervening period I noticed that in the New Zealand newspapers Australian news was as scarce as New Zealand news is in Australian newspapers. So far as the press is concerned, a bond between the two countries has been maintained only by the old Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which is a truly national Australian production and enjoys a big circulation in New Zealand. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Much fuss has been made over this agreement. The publicity given to its signing greatly overrated the importance of the agreement itself; and the showmanship and circus work at that ceremony was too ridiculous for words. Even the table on which Queen Victoria signed the Proclamation of the Australian Constitution Act and which usually reposes in King's Hall was used for the signing of this agreement; and the nonsensical posturing at that ceremony was just childish. I have never had much faith in pacts and agreements. We have seen what has happened to so many solemn pacts. I recall the day when I arrived at Cherbourg harbour in 192S and witnessed the arrival of an American cruiser which was conveying <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kellogg</inline> on his way to Geneva for the signing of the Kellogg </para>
                <para class="block">Pact. That pact was a solemn, agreement between 63 nations, in which they averred that they would not resort to war without first submitting disputes to arbitration. It was said that that pact outlawed war. It was a most solemn agreement. But what happened to it? It was not worth the paper on ,ville Ll it was written. Consequently, we are making a little too much fuss about this agreement and are inclined to stress its importance as if it were, in itself, of great importance, whereas it is a mass of words in which, no doubt, are expressed some very fine aspirations. New Zealand and Australia should be brought closer together and should work closer together in their common interests; but I have not much faith in the written word. In passing, f. suggest to any young Army officer never to write a letter unless he can avoid it. If one writes a letter in the Army a file is started which grows with surprising rapidity, with the result that the matter taken in hand is thereby delayed. If one wants to get anything done in the Army, the best thing is to have a word with one's opposite number. That is much preferable to putting anything to paper, because the wretched thing then starts to grow. I am not keen on hard-and-fast written agreements, which are merely masses of words. If the mutual understanding which should eXISt between Australia and New Zealand does, in fact, exist, there is no necessity for agreements of this kind. It is obvious that New Zealand and Australia will have to work together in future to a greater degree than they have done in the past. "We have not worked together so closely as we might have done to the mutual benefit of both countries. However, I do not think that a formal, legal document of this kind, which is mostly wishful thinking, will have any effect on the future intimacy between our countries. Although some of its contents may be welcome, much of it does not mean anything at all. When parties to an enterprise commit every point to writing, it is possible that later one, or both, of the parties may have cause to regret having done so. The glorious brotherhood m arms existing between New Zealand and Australia is a great blessing. Australians and New Zealanders went through the fire of battle together, and suffered and died together; and that bond, the bond of Anzac, has done a great deal to cement friendship between the two countries. When I have gone among servicemen in New Zealand, I have met old friends of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade with whom I served on Gallipoli and later in France. One of my old comrades in France was the late <inline font-weight="bold">Major Coates,</inline> who became Prime Minister of New Zealand. A great bond of friendship, blood, and of mutual effort in war, exists between the two countries, and I regret, as I said earlier, that that bond has not been developed to a greater degree. For that reason, I welcome any action on the part of the Government of either country which will bring our peoples closer together. A. document of this kind does not achieve anything, because we prefer to judge by deeds rather than words. Our brotherhood and friendship with New Zealanders is rooted in the earth, solid and historic, and nurtured by the blood of men of both countries; but such things should not be forced into hard and rigid confines as we attempt to do in this written agreement. Any agreement which we reach with that country should be more elastic in form. Our friendship requires air and sunlight, and room for growth. It may appear in one shape to-day, and in  another shape to-m'orrow, because we  cannot  tell what the future holds for either country. The agreement is rather an ambitious document.

                <para class="block">Those words do not mean very much, because until we finish fighting our enemies, there will be no peace. I do not believe that any purpose is served by imprisoning such sentiments behind legal bars as this agreement does. Our friendship will not be promoted in that way. Indeed, the existence of such meaningless agreements may cause our friendship to languish. I repeat that I am not keen on pacts and agreements, because nearly all of the great pacts and agreements made since the last war,  instead of helping to achieve what was desired, caused disharmony, strife and discord. </para>

"When I returned from South Africa in 1908, after living in that country for 7 or 8 years, I realized who our real enemy was, and got " ticked off " for speaking out of my turn when I said that some day this vast country with its sparse population would be forced to fight for its life against the enemy to our north. In season and out of season during the last 30 years, I have preached in this country, in which I was bom and of which I am inordinately proud, that it is the duty of every man who claims the right of citizenship and the protection of his country to defend it; and in order to be able to do that, he must be trained in the art of defence.

                    will see that time and time again since 1925 in this chamber I raised my voice on this matter which is of .paramount importance. I suggest that m an omnibus agreement of this kind we should lay down what we are prepared to do in the defence of this country. I recall the days when war clouds were gathering over Europe, and we knew that war was bound to come from 1933 onwards. And when war broke out our Motherland, Great Britain, had a poor little army of 218,000 of all ranks and arms, including the British army in India, whilst Australia had an army of approximately 3,000 permanent soldiers.

It ill becomes Ministers to reproach me regarding preparations for defence. What happened on the part of our people after the last war was the greatest possible piece of folly. From the year 1935 onwards the war clouds were there for any one to see, but we were satisfied to talk about collective security. I am afraid that history will repeat itself when this war is over, and that we may experience again what took place between the first world war and the present war. It was not peace, but a most uneasy truce. Trouble was being built up again, but nothing was done to prevent it. We cannot have peace without power. The two things go together. If the Anglo-Saxon peoples - Great Britain, its children and the United States of America - had been powerful, we should not have been faced with the awful menace that was growing and creeping over Europe and was bound to burst forth. If, when this war is over, we do not take the right steps, but bleat and blah about an international police force and collective security, cur grandchildren will have to go through the fire as our children are now doing. </para>

It was never thought possible in the years before the war that Russia, Great Britain and the United States of America would enter into an agreement, but the war situation as it developed brought about an alliance to which peace-time" conditions had been unfavorable.

Prom that point of view no legitimate objection can be taken to the agreement. Honorable senators opposite have stated that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> is likely to be embarrassed by it when he attends the Imperial Conference. I am sure that he is grateful for the solicitude for his welfare expressed by honorable senators opposite, but I can assure them that there will be no embarrassment so far as he is concerned, and that they need feel no alarm about what is likely to happen. We have been asked what the allied powers will think of the agreement. The Leader of the Senate indicated that the leading publications in Great Britain are quite favorable to it, although I believe that other publications have not expressed such favorable opinions. That, however, applies generally. No complete or unanimous approval can be expected of any agreement. Objections will always be raised, some of which may be quite justifiable and others not. I rather welcome the adverse criticism that we have heard, because it gives us the opportunity to devote further consideration to the agreement, and may be helpful in improving it later on. It has been implied that a dangerous position has been created by the agreement, and it has been unjustly stated that it bears the hallmark, of mere amateurs. I have no objection to the honorable senators of the Opposition posing and postulating as skilled diplomats and professionals, who represent the last word on the subject. They are welcome to entertain that opinion of themselves, but they cannot expect me to endorse it, particularly after their performances in years gone by. </para>

Statements such as those made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator MeLeay)</inline> do not contribute anything helpful to the debate. They are based on mere assumptions, and suggest to an unbiased mind that they originate in either political or personal prejudice. I am glad that the agreement has been entered into. If it has defects or shortcomings, they can be remedied or removed. The important point is that to have the two countries agreeing to coila borate and co-operate is a step forward. This has never previously been done. This step forward is necessary in view of the conflict of interests which is taking place now, and likely to be intensified after -the war. We have a great deal more to gain than we can possibly lose from English-speaking countries collaborating with one another. I fail to see how there can be any valid objection to the agreement. Had those who object to it taken the trouble to indicate just in what respect they consider it to be unworkable or unjust from Australia's point of view, then the various provisions of this document could have been argued on their merits ; but that has not been done. The whole argument against the agreement has been based more on superficial assumptions in which the wish is father to the thought. It has been said that this may happen, or that may happen, or that somebody may say something about the agreement which will not reflect to the credit of the Governments concerned. Argument of that kind might he interesting enough to some people, but it is not conducive to a reasoned discussion. ' It is difficult indeed to deal with the agreement as it should be dealt with when the bulk of the criticism has been of that nature. Paragraph 19 of the agreement states - </para>

It is merely an expression of opinion, and it is an opinion which should- be expressed by the two Governments concerned, particularly as we know that, if possible, private monopoly interests are preparing to take full control of civil aviation after the war. The people have a right to expect an expression of the Government's opinion on that matter. And so the various paragraphs of the agreement are worded to express the opinions of the Governments concerned. Honorable senators will find throughout the text of the agreement words such as " may " and " recommend ". These, I submit, are the proper words to be used in the circumstances, and suggest that a point of view is being expressed. In effect, the Australian and New Zealand Governments are saying to the Allied powers, " What is your point of view as compared with ours? Do you agree or disagree with what we have suggested? If you agree, well and good, but if you disagree, then we are prepared to discuss the question on its merits with the object of arriving at an agreement ". That is the whole spirit of this agreement - a spirit based on the principle of conference and consultation with all who have common interests. Surely there can bc no case against that. All our experience in the past has indicated that, where views or interests are in conflict, the best results are obtained when an endeavour is made by all parties concerned to reach a basis of understanding. The worst possible results occur usually when the representatives of nations adopt an arbitrary and aggressive attitude, such as that usually adopted by people like Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo and other leaders of fascist countries. </para>

                <para>I shall deal now with the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson,</inline> who expressed his lack of confidence in the agreement. The honorable senator explained this attitude by saying that many agreements were repudiated and treated like scraps of paper. In my view, agreements are lasting and binding only if they are backed by the goodwill of the signatories, although I am inclined to agree with the honorable senator in cases where there -is a lack of goodwill. However, nothing that has been said by the honorable senator or, for that matter, by any other honorable senator, has convinced me that behind this agreement there is a lack of goodwill or a desire to co-operate either on the part of the Government of New Zealand or of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                        <para>- That is typical of statements made by people whose prejudices are allowed to become obsessions. The agreement, in my opinion, does not state or imply a desire on the part of the signatories to break our association with Great Britain. We may at times question Great Britain's policy, just as Great Britain may question Australia's policy. I recall that when the first move for the adoption of what is now known as the White Australia policy was made, there was considerable opposition in Great Britain. The proposal was very severely criticized, and Australia was told by representative men in Great Britain that it had no right whatever to adopt such a policy. Some even went so far as to say that Australia should accept Great Britain's view on the matter, rather than express any desire or will of its own; but after the matter had been argued between representatives of Great Britain and Australia, an agreement was arrived at, and I venture to say that to-day Great Britain is very well satisfied with the White Australia policy. The mere fact that at times the Australian people disagree with certain schools of thought in Great Britain, does not indicate for one moment that we wish to sever our connexion with Great Britain, just as disagreement among honorable senators in this chamber does not indicate that members of one party wish to see members of another sent to concentration camps. We simply disagree as we should when we have views which are in conflict, with the object of arguing the matter and, if possible, reaching an agreement. That procedure has been followed right down through the ages, and, in fact, has been responsible for the existence of this Parliament to-day. Had that procedure not been followed we should probably still be fighting against one another as tribes as we did before Parliaments were thought of. So it is quite unworthy to suggest that this agreement has been concluded with the object of breaking our connexion with Great Britain. Any one who makes such a statement obviously is relying more upon innuendoes than argument to prove his case, and is influenced more by prejudices than reasoning. It is quite easy for an honorable senator to attribute all kinds of ulterior motives to his political opponents, but such tactics are not to be admired. Matters such as this should be argued fairly upon their merits, even although ultimate agreement may be unlikely. It is a good thing for this country, and for New Zealand, that this agreement has been concluded. It is one more step in the strengthening of the bonds of unity not only between the two Dominions concerned, but also between all members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and I am certain that representatives of Allied countries who are qualified to speak on this matter will be the last to condemn us. I believe that the agreement will be most helpful at the forthcoming Imperial Conference and will assist in making decisions which will be satisfactory to the British Empire as a whole. </para>

                            <para>The original provision  in  the Control of Liquor Order to cut production by one-third was found by experience to be impracticable if serious anomalies and cases of undue hardship were to be  avoided.  Reasonable quantities  of liquor  had to bc made available to meet requirement* of Australian service personnel returning from overseas as  well  its to meet the requirements of Allied forces which were arriving in increasing number  3  and also K&gt; provide beer for export ;to forces and civilian populations in overseas countries  which  had  been cut  off from normal supplies. Owing to the difficulties of controlling the consumption of beer in  the  Commonwealth by  a  fixed  cut  in production,  the  Government decided to restrict  the  quantity of beer available for civilian consumption in Australia to an average  of  7,200,000 gallons per month, and such decision is being' strictly adhered to. Supplies to the forces  are  controlled by the Defence Canteen .Services on a rationed basin.  2. The figure quoted by the honorable senator is the increase in the total customs and excise revenue for the eight  months  ended 29th February, 1044, us compared with the corresponding period nf last financial year. The actual increase in excise revenue is £2,480.001). I his increase is attributable to increased rates of excise duty imposed, not only on beer, but  also on  spirits,  tobacco,  cigarettes, playing curds and matches on  the  3rd September, 11)42 ; these increased rates were operative for only five months of  the  period under review for the financial year 1942-43 as compared with eight months for  the  current financial year. indicative of  the  general increase in revenue from the increased excise rates, it is mentioned  that  the revenue collected from Imer during Inly and August, 1942, when  the  rate of duty  was  3s. per gal 10,1 was £2,075,870 ( 13,839,172 gallons) nml  the  revenue collected in the corresponding period in 1043, when the  Tate  of duty  was  43. 7d. per pnilon, was £3,062,74,1 (13,304.099 gallons ). The increase  in  revenue  ian,  therefore, bc attributed mainly to  the  increased rates of duty rather  than  an increase in consumption  of  beer. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> has given some illuminating information in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson's</inline> question relating to the supply of beer. Recently  the Minister hnd occasion lo deplore the fact that, owing to a shortage of beer, deleterious liquors were being supplied to the public; he instanced h bottle of liquor which was found to contain a lizard. I should like to know whether the Minister is convinced that the 7,200,000 gallons of beer now made available each month is sufficient. I should prefer to see an increased production of beer rather than that a shortage of that beverage should encourage the consumption of illicit and deleterious liquors. Under present conditions, many men, including servicemen on leave, who aro entitled to consideration, who are unable to obtain beer purchase harmful liquors, and therefore, despite any criticism which may be levelled against me, I express my conviction, that in order to avoid those dangers it would be better to provide ample supplies of beer. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - It is impossible to increase the supply of beer to either civilians or servicemen in Australia at the present time. One reason is that there is a marked shortage of malt, following a reduced barley crop; another reason is a shortage of man-power. I agree with the honorable senator that some of the  regulations which have been made recently aro appalling. I assure him that drastic steps have been taken, especially in. New South Wales, to prevent the abuses to which reference has been made, and that similar action will be taken in other part" nf the Commonwealth as soon as possible. The position is constantly under review, but as the honorable senator realizes, this is a difficult matter to handle became ' one section of the community is trying to mako capital out of the war from <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> prohibition aspect; other sections of the community are acting in a more normal way. As a result of my experience, I agree that it is better that men should drink good beer rather than wine or spirits. At present, however, spirits are almost unprocurable. </para>
