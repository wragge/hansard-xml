          <para>. - by leave - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> earlier I referred to the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Spooner as Leader of the Government in the Senate. J am sure that all honorable senators would deem it appropriate if I were to take this first opportunity of marking the occasion of his retirement by setting down some short appreciation of his services to the Senate and lo the Parliament. He was Leader of the Government in this chamber for a period of five years and four months, from 16th February 1959 to I 0th June 1964. Prior to that he was  Deputy  Leader for three years. He had, of course, a long and distinguished ministerial career. He enjoyed the rare experience, the rare honour of having been sworn in as a Minister late in 1949 without having had any previous parliamentary experience. Indeed, he was sworn in as a Minister before he was actually declared to be elected as a senator. This rather unique experience was made more unique by the fact that his late brother enjoyed a somewhat similar experience in the Government of New South Wales. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>During the first eighteen months that he. was in the Ministry he was the Minister for Social Services. Early in 1.951 he was appointed as Minister in Charge of War Service Homes. He administered that portfolio for a few months until the Ministry was re-organised later in the year. In May 1951 he was appointed as Minister for National Development and he held that portfolio continuously for 13 years until just a few months ago. He was VicePresident of the Executive Council for four of the years during which he served as a Minister. In 1962 he enjoyed another rare experience, that of being appointed Acting Prime Minister, during the aBsence overseas of the Prime Minister. This is an experience that has been enjoyed by only two senators in the history of Federation. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline>Spooner will bc remembered here and througho.it the nation for many things, but I think that those of us who sat here with him during his long term of office will best remember him for his ministerial successes. The first of them to which 1 refer is in respect of the re-organisation of the coal industry, a particularly difficult task which he undertook from the time of his appointment as Minister for National Development in 1951. Later, he was associated with other mining activities such as, for example, the successful search for, and the development and production of uranium in this country. As a Western Australian, I have a particularly fond memory of his efforts in respect of the development of the iron ore industry in Australia.  His  association with the development of oil also will long be remembered. </para>
        <para>In the area of housing, which is controversial from time to time, another outstanding achievement can be marked up to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Spooner. In water conservation, his affectionate attachment to the Snowy scheme, to which we all became so used, was repeated in relation to other great projects such as the Chowilla Dam, the Blowering Dam in his own State, and the Ord River scheme in the north.  His  efforts in respect of the establishment of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> policy concerning beef roads in Australia will bc long remembered. During his ministry the Northern Division of the Department of National Development was created. </para>
        <para>All of these things, I believe, are facets of a ministerial career which we shall long remember, but I should think that all of us here, speaking as a single body of senators, would best remember him because of the fact that he .was such a Senate man, such a man for the Senate. He set the Senate star high and, I think, inspired all of us to seek for the Senate a standing and a reputation that were really worthwhile. He always gave strong leadership; and those of us on this side of the chamber remember that fact particularly. </para>
        <para>We thank him today, as we say goodbye to him as a Minister, remembering the type of leadership that he gave. He has retired from the Ministry and I think that he now has the good wishes of all of us here for the enjoyment of the kind of leisure which was so long- denied him and which will permit him to do the many things that he always wanted to do but which, because of the pressure of ministerial business, he has never got around to doing. I wish him good luck. </para>

          <para>.- -by leave - The Opposition found a great deal of interest in the announcement that was made by the new Leader of the Government in this chamber. I begin on behalf of the Opposition by offering congratulations to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> upon his promotion to the important office of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. J congratulate, too, the new  Deputy  Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty,</inline> on his appointment, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> I proffer the congratulations of the Opposition upon his appointment to the high and responsible post of a member of the Ministry. It is a signal honour, as I am sure the honorable senator appreciates, and we shall watch his progress with keen interest, even if we may from time to time be critical, needlessly or otherwise. lt was appropriate, indeed, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> should refer to the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Spooner. In common, I. think, wilh every other member of the Opposition, I. was completely taken by surprise when news of the retirement was published. I had anticipated that he would continue quite indefinitely decorating the Senate immediately in front of me at this table, but he had other thoughts, quite obviously. I recall that it was on 19th December 1949 that I handed over to him in this building the office of Minister for Social Services. I am sure that he remembers the occasion quite well and, with my soft heart, knowing that he had had no ministerial experience - not even any parliamentary experience - I saw fit to proffer certain advice to him. A little while later I saw his form on the political track and, having seen that, I felt that he had been over the course before. He showed such brilliant form that I felt that all the words that, in my kindness, I had proffered to him, were wasted, because he just drew upon his own natural ability, energy and application and was very soon captain of the ship. I think we would all, from this side of the House, accord that. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He has played a very major part in keeping up the Government&#39;s wicket, down fourteen long, weary years. We concede that to him. Whilst I express admiration of that performance, I must confess that I cannot find it in my heart to forgive him for it. We of the Opposition saw him as a very competent, hardworking and effective Minister and a very effective Leader of the Government in this chamber.  His  record has been put before the Senate by the new Leader of the Government in the Senate and I do not propose to traverse the ground he has covered. In <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Spooner I found a man such as was described by the poet as: &#34; The foe that comes with fearless eyes &#34;, and I respected him as such. </para>
        <para>In the hundreds of matters, important and unimportant, that had to be discussed and arranged between the Leader of the Government in this place and the Leader of the Opposition, all those arrangements, down all the years, were made by word of mouth. I do not recall an instance in which we found it necessary to commit them to writing. I want to say quite publicly, in this place, that throughout every day of the past fourteen years I found that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Spooner&#39;s word was his bond. We had no difficulty on that ground. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> now moves to the back bench, with honours thick upon him, and quite obviously sound in wind and limb. He has four delightful years ahead of him before he need again consult the will of the electors. We will watch his actions on the outer circle with great interest. In particular, we should like to see whether he is as good in putting questions as he has been in answering them down all the years. The Opposition concedes that he is well entitled to a respite from the arduous duties of a Minister down a period of fourteen years. A Minister&#39;s task is not an easy one at any time and I know it demands the whole of a man&#39;s time and the whole of his resources, both physical and mental. We concede to the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator that</inline> he merits a respite from the arduous work upon which he has been engaged for so long, and in every personal way and in every sense except a political one we wish him well. </para>

        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Senate, I take great pleasure in joining the Australian Country Party with the sentiments expressed by the newly appointed Leader of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> has set out, in correct perspective, the historical achievements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Spooner. He referred to the piloting of the Snowy Mountains scheme, to oil search and to a host of other monuments which provide tangible evidence of the skill, and energies applied by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner in the administration of his portfolio - a most important one in this young country. But no recital of the achievements of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Spooner would give a complete understanding of his services to Australia. There must also be some reference to his quite remarkable personal qualities. </para>
        <para>He has proved himself a great parliamentarian. He spared neither himself nor his followers in maintaining the prestige of the Parliament, with particular emphasis on the Senate. That is the highest tribute that I can pay him. Finally, may I say that down through the years while he led the joint Government parties in the Senate his completely fair and generous approach at all times earned .for him the great respect and confidence of his colleagues. We wish him much happiness as he sheds his great responsibilities. </para>
        <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. Sir Alister McMullin).</inline> - 1 wish to add a few personal words of appreciation to the words of other speakers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Spooner comes from New South Wales. He has been a colleague with whom 1 have been pleased to be associated over the years, lt is to his work as a Minister and as Leader of the Government in the Senate that I want to pay special attention. No-one could have had a more loyal Leader or one who was more approachable on matters of importance to the Senate. It is to the years when we were associated, he as Leader and myself as  President,  that 1 look back with great pleasure, knowing full well his great contributions as a parliamentarian. That is one of the factors that one in my position looks at. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Spooner has done all things well over the years. He has left many landmarks in Australia during his term of office by the work he carried out so well. </para>
        <para>I offer a word of congratulation to the new Leader of the Senate. It is interesting to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> coming forward to fill a place that is not easy to fill. I am sure he will fill it well, acting with a sense of justice and fairness and with a full appreciation of the worth of the Senate. Of course 1 could not let the occasion pass without being a little clannish and saying how pleased I am to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> in the position he is occupying. </para>

          <para>- by leave - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I would like to thank my Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge,</inline> and the Leader of (he Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna),</inline> the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wade)</inline> and yourself, Sir,&#39; for the very generous tributes that have been paid to me. 1 have a few things to say and I begin by expressing my thanks to those who sat behind me in the Senate over the years for their loyalty to me.&#39; In the past they sat behind me; today they sit in front of me and alongside me as a happy family, and I think it is the happiness, and co-operation we have shared that have produced the good work we have done. To that expression I want to add instantly my appreciation for the good personal relations that 1 have h?.d with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and those who sit behind him. We cannot do our work in Parliament in the seemly way in which it should bc done without co-operation between the Leaders of the respective parties and without the support of the members of the respective parties for the arrangements which the Leaders need to make from time to lime. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I support what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has said. We have made deals and arrangements over the years and 1 have no recollection of any one of them not being honoured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and myself and by those who have sat behind us. The honorable senator and I have made arrangements so often without the opportunity to refer them to all senators. </para>
        <para>I remember very well taking over from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> Little did he and I think that the transfer would be for so long a period of time. In coming to the end of such a long road I have a great feeling ofsatisfaction in knowing that 1 have gained your esteem. </para>
        <para>My decision to retire from the Government was not taken lightly. Life as a Minister of the Crown is very arduous and responsible. lt is a life that gives one a lot of satisfaction. There is the opportunity to exercise such talents as one has in such big matters; but it is an arduous life which can seem a never ending task. It can seem never ending not only for a Minister of the Crown but also for his wife. One does not realise that position fully until returning to normal life and becoming aware of the responsibilities that one&#39;s wife has carried. 1 came to the situation in which I felt that the responsibilities and interests I had outside Parliament were not being cared for to the extent they should be cared for and I felt that I should make a change. I felt that I was entitled to a less arduous life after the years I have had in Cabinet. I was fortified in my decision by the wealth of talent in the younger members of the Government parties. I was left with no doubt in my mind that there are others to carry on the good work. </para>
        <para>In some ways 1 am sorry that the announcement of my retirement came so abruptly. The decision was not lightly made. It was made months prior to the announcement. I made the decision and I discussed it with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Menzies)</inline> who, after expressing his regret that I wanted to leave the Cabinet, gave me his usual sympathetic advice and support over the rather difficult months between the time of the decision and the time that I made the announcement. I treasure greatly the knowledge that I go out of Cabinet not only with the goodwill that is expressed today in the Senate but also with the goodwill, I believe, of all my ministerial colleagues and of the Prime Minister himself. </para>
        <para>I felt when I made the decision that the right thing to do was to obtain the Prime Minister&#39;s concurrence. I did not like the idea of carrying on until the end of the parliamentary session with all my parliamentary colleagues knowing that I was stepping down at the end of the session. It was at my own request, therefore, that only the Prime Minister and myself knew of my decision over that period of about three months and I think it came as a bit of a surprise when the announcement was made. </para>
        <para>So now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I am going to lead a more leisurely life. I am not going to rust. I am remaining in the Senate and I would hope that whilst I cannot expect to bc as big a thorn in the side of the Leader of the Opposition and Opposition members as I have been, I might still be a thorn in their side in debates and discussions in the future. </para>
        <para>I step down, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in the very happy knowledge that I have complete confidence in the ability of my colleague and friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shane</inline> Paltridge, to carry on the good work. I extend my congratulations to him, the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Henty),</inline> the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson),</inline> and the other occupants of the front bench, all of whom have had promotion in some way in this reshuffle. I wish them good fortune in the future with the assurance - as they know - that whatever little I can do to help them I will gladly do. </para>

Is the Minister aware that the amount of beef coming into South Australia has been drastically reduced because of the sorry state of beef roads in the northern part of South Australia, resulting in a shortage of beef and high prices? Does the Minister know that the roads in the far north and north-east of South Australia have been damaged by floods and by the transportation of heavy oil drilling equipment; that the roads are not suitable for bringing good stock to the rail head at Marree; and that as a result, South Australia is losing its beef trade to Queensland? Has the Government received representations from the Government of South Australia for financial assistance in order to restore the beef roads, particularly the Birdsville and Strzelecki tracks? What is the Government&#39;s attitude on the matter? </para>

            <para>-  I have been aware of the floods in the northern part of South Australia and the damage they have caused to the roads because I was through that area only about a fortnight ago. The honorable senator has said that part of the roads have been damaged by oil drilling equipment. I can only say that I wish the oil drillers the best of luck. I hope they succeed in their mission because the discovery of oil in close proximity to Adelaide would make a tremendous difference to South Australia. The question <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> posed to me is one for the Treasurer and if the honorable senator will place his question on the noticepaper I will get an answer for him from my colleague. </para>

            <para>- My question is  directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Can he advise whether the Government has agreed to allow as a complete income lax deduction any donation to the flood relief fund recently launched by  His  Worship the Lord Mayor of Perth, Councillor Veryard, to aid those in distress? Has a request been received from the Western Australian Governmentfor direct financial assistance from the Commonwealth to help those people who have lost very heavily? Can the Minister assure me that, because of the urgent need to give relief to distressed victims of floods, all applications will receive immediate sympathetic attention? </para>

            <para>- South Australia is not the only State which has suffered from widespread floods. Western Australia has also suffered, particularly, I understand, in the south-western corner. I am not aware at the moment whether donations to flood relief funds are allowable taxation deductions. If the honorable senator puts that part of his question on the notice-paper I shall obtain the information for him. I have no knowledge at the moment of any precedent for such donations being regarded as taxation deductions. With regard to the rest of the question, if the honorable senator places that on the notice-paper as well I shall obtain the necessary information from the Treasurer as early as possible. </para>

            <para>- With your forbearance, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, before</inline> answering <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin&#39;s question I should like to express mythanks to you, to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, to Government members, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and to other members of the Opposition for their expressions of goodwill to me.Iknow that members of the Opposition will treat me. as a new Minister, very gently at the outset. On my part, I promise, within my capacity, to treat every question they present to me with respect and to endeavour to get the best answer for them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In relation to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin. I think we all recognise that her interest in the cause of geriatrics has been outstanding in the Senate for a long time. Itis understandable therefore that she should ask a question on this subject. From information supplied to me by the Department, I understand that a second post graduate course in geriatric nursing is to be commenced at repatriation hospitals and that some 25 nursing sisters are to be trained. Not all of them will come from the Repatriation Department. Fourteen sisters will come from the Department and eleven will come from other hospitals. It therefore follows that when they have completed their training not all of them will remain in the Repatriation Department. They will carry on their nursing functions in all manner of hospitals throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>While the subject of geriatrics does not come within my jurisdiction. I think we all agree it is most important. It is significant that the Repatriation Department, being aware of its responsibilities, is training nurses in this field. When the training is completed, it will be of benefit not only to the Department, but also to the nursing profession generally. </para>

By way of preface, 1 understand that arrangements have been made by the Minister for Territories to grant the Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd. a 21 year lease of the Groote Eylandt ferro.manganese deposits. The company will make supplies of manganese ore available to the Tasmanian Temco plant at Bell Bay until B.H.P. reports on the feasibility of establishing a special treatment plant in the Northern Territory. I ask the Minister: What arrangements have been made between the Federal Government and B.H.P. concerning the leases in the Northern Territory? To what extent have the possibile effects of supplies of ferro-manganese ore to the Temco plant at Bell Bay been examined? Will there be special provision to protect the Tasmanian industry in any arrangements that are made between the Federal Government and B.H.P.? </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">McKellar has asked me to state the section of the act which empowered my Department to intervene. The relevant Act is the Phosphate Fertilisers Bounty Act. It will be known here, of course, that the administration of that Act is the responsibility of the Minister for Customs and Excise. It is true that two firms in New South Wales, Australian Fertilisers Ltd. and Sulphide Corporation Pty. Ltd., increased the cost of superphosphate by some 17s. per ton. An inquiry was instituted under the provisions of the Act. I feel bound to say that the firms concerned put no bar in the way of my officers investigating the question. It will be appreciated, of course, by honorable senators that the investigation was of a confidential nature. It dealt with the whole of the financial structure of the companies concerned. Their justification, of course, for the increase was based partly on the increase of 1.3s. 6d. per ton in the price of phosphate rock. It was based also on the increase in the price of sulphur and the rise in the basic wage which recently took place. As a result of the inquiry that was instituted through my Department, the companies resolved to reduce the price by 3s. 6d., thus bringing it back to 13s. 6d. a ton. My officers believe that, in the light of the increases which I have already enumerated, that is a reasonable proposition. I should point out that the companies have said that they will ensure that rebates for the short period of the increase will be made to the persons concerned. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Believing that Australia&#39;s peace and security in the long term are in as much danger now as they have ever been, I ask the Minister whether it is a fact that the Government has made a firm decision to back up, as best as Australia can, those who oppose Communist aggression in South Vietnam. Can he tell the Senate, or at any rate supporters of the Government, what is the policy of the Australian Labour Party in relation to such matters? Is it as expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cairns,</inline> a member of the shadow Cabinet, when he opposes or condemns American policies which are aimed at checking Communist advances in South Vietnam, or is it a stop and go policy as expressed from day to day by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell,</inline> the leader of the Party? </para>

            <para>- The policy of the Government in relation to South Vietnam and other South-East Asian areas has been well stated on a number of occasions. Australia, as a member of the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation, has undertaken certain obligations in certain eventualities. It is a matter of fact that, particularly in relation to South Vietnam, the United States of America has undertaken to bear by far the greatest part of the burden. In July of this year the American Government requested other governments with democratic principles in South-East Asia to lend their support. Australia&#39;s contribution was to increase the number of instructors stationed in South Vietnam and to give them the full function which had been undertaken for some time prior thereto by the Americans. It was decided that Australian instructors should go into the field at battalion level and lower to instruct and direct South Vietnamese forces. In addi tion to that, of course, Australia announced her intention of supplying new Caribou transport aircraft. Three of them have already arrived in South Vietnam and three will arrive a little later. It is of interest to note that the Australian reply to the American request was the first reply received by the United States  President,  who at the time expressed warm appreciation of the action taken by the Australian Government. At a meeting which subsequently occurred between the Prime Minister and  President  Johnson, the  President  repeated his thanks and reaffirmed his appreciation of what the Australian Government had done in respect of South Vietnam. </para>

          <para>I have seen some reference to the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cairns.</inline> It seems at a number of points to be in conflict with what might be regarded as official Labour policy, as expressed from time to time by the leader of the Labour Party. Not only is it in conflict at some points in respect of South Vietnam but also, as reported, as a policy statement it is definitely in conflict with the statement of the Leader of the Opposition in respect of West New Guinea. </para>

            <para>- The Australian defence forces and their equipment are provided on the recommendations of Australia&#39;s defence advisers. It is of interest to note that the Australian Government has the benefit of advice not only from its own defence advisers but also from the military advisers of the United Kingdom and the United States. I did not see the article that appeared in &#34;Time&#34;.

By way of preface I congratulate the Minister on his recent visit to South Australia and his inspection of civil aviation facilities at Adelaide airport. I invite his attention to the current severe congestion at Adelaide airport, especially in the afternoons and particularly on Sunday afternoon, the congestion being most severe between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. Will the Minister make a statement in the Senate as to what plans he has to alleviate the present unsatisfactory position, first by means of airport reconstruction and, secondly, by encouragement to the larger operators to re-arrange their schedules? </para>

            <para>- One of the reasons why I recently went to South Australia was to investigate the report of over-congestion which has existed for some time at the Adelaide airport. I found that the problem was perhaps even greater than we had anticipated and that the plans then in embryo would have to be greatly extended to deal with the congestion at peak periods at Adelaide airport. J. therefore told the Press at that time the type of plan we envisaged to cover the position, and the completion of which may yet be two or three years off. At the same time certain measures are being taken immediately to relieve the position. First, 1 am consulting with the airlines in an endeavour to .arrange for them to stagger the times of aircraft arrival at the airport, because no government can be called upon economically to provide facilities for peak periods only, and this is the position which has developed in South Australia. Over a period of one and a half hours, from six to eight aircraft arrive and depart and the number of visitors, passengers and those seeing passengers off causes congestion. But within an hour and a half one could fire a cannon across the aerodrome without hitting anyone. This is a wrong use of modern facilities and if we can arrange some staggering of the times of arrival and departure of aircraft we will get better use of the facilities and less congestion. </para>

              <para>- Yes. At the moment, knowing what times are best suited to picking up and putting down passengers, both the airlines concerned are anxious to have their aircraft there at those times. I want to see whether we can stagger the hours of arrival and departure so that the people who keep the airlines going - the people who pay as passengers - will have a wider variety of times of arrival and departure at the airport, thus making better use of the facilities. I admit that this is a problem which requires urgent attention. </para>

Will he consider making the Government&#39;s consideration of the position in Western Australia a matter of urgency? Does he recollect that when flood conditions existed in New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir William</inline> Spooner, as Leader of the Government in this chamber, had no hesitation in giving the Senate an assurance that the matter would be treated as one of urgency and that the military and others would bc called upon to assist? He gave the Senate the fullest assurance that the matter would be dealt with by the Government expeditiously and sympathetically. I now ask the Leader of the Government will he deal with the position in Western Australia as a matter of urgency as the Senate will not sit after today, until Tuesday next. Will he make a statement - if he can so arrange it - in respect of the Federal Government&#39;s attitude to the suffering and loss of stock and homes and employment in flood devastated areas in Western Australia, so that the matter may be dealt with more quickly than if a question were placed on the notice-paper and not answered until we reassemble? I should like an assurance of an early statement by the Government that Western Australia will be afforded no less relief that was afforded New South Wales when that State suffered its flood calamity. </para>

            <para>- I think my colleague, the Minister for Civil Aviation who represents the Treasurer in the Senate, lias already given the assurance sought by Sena.tor Cooke. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> earlier today asked much the same question as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke</inline> has asked and the Minister representing the Treasurer said he would bring the matter to the notice of the Treasurer. The honorable senator will appreciate that there is a set pattern to be followed in respect of these applications. Application for flood relief is made by the Premier of the State concerned to the Prime Minister, and it is almost always made promptly. Indeed, the Premiers, as is proper, show no inclination to delay in matters of this sort. I would not be at all surprised if the Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brand,</inline> had not already been in touch with the Prime Minister. The honorable senator referred to the alacrity with which the Commonwealth Government moved in providing relief in connection with the New South Wales floods. I think it is fair to say that a pattern of prompt action has been built up over the years, and I remind the honorable senator from Western Australia that when requests for relief have been made by that State in the past they have been promptly met. I can certainly assure him that when a request is made on this occasion it will be promptly considered. </para>

I am now in a position to advise the Senate that colour television is at present confined virtually to the United States of America and Japan. Discussions are still proceeding amongst European countries concerning the particular system of colour television which will be adopted by these countries, including the United Kingdom. Three systems are under consideration. The matter will be considered by the Television Study Group of the International Consultative Committee on Radio Communications in 1965. It would be unwise for any steps to be taken towards the development of colour television in Australia until the position in Europe is clearer. The high costs of transmitting equipment and associated receiving equipment arising from the technical complexities of colour television are still major obstacles to this type of service. The question of technical standards is also one of great importance. </para>

            <para>- I direct a series of questions to the Minister for Health. First, is the average cost of a bed in a public ward of a public hospital in New South Wales &#163;5 17s. 2d. a day? Secondly, does the Commonwealth contribute only 36s. a day towards that cost in respect of a pensioner patient who is the holder of a medical entitlement card and only 8s. a day in respect of a pensioner patient who is not such a holder? Thirdly, is the difference between the Commonwealth contribution and the bed cost made good to the public hospitals by the State Government of New South Wales? Fourthly, is it not a fact that for the past twenty years the State Government of New South Wales has provided free treatment in public wards for pensioners regardless of whether or not they are holders of Commonwealth medical entitlement cards? Fifthly, do not most, if not all, other State Governments either provide free treatment in public wards or give substantial concessions for pensioner patients whether or not they are holders of Commonwealth medical entitlement cards? Sixthly, in the light of these circumstances will the Minister review the statements on pages 6 and 15 of the Commonwealth publication &#34; Your Guide to National Health Benefits &#34;, to the effect that such free treatment is available only to holders of medical entitlement cards and at least direct attention to the benefits provided by State Governments? Finally, is he aware that many pensioners, debarred from receiving Commonwealth medical entitlement cards, are misled by the statement in the publication on page 15, namely: &#34;To enjoy these services you must have and produce an entitlement card.&#34;? </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator has asked me a series of questions, some of which I cannot answer because they refer to State jurisdictions. However, as I understand it, most of his questions revolve around a statement in a departmental booklet on national health benefits. He asks me whether I will review a statement to the effect that free treatment in public hospitals is available to pensioners with medical entitlement cards. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, the</inline> answer is a plain and categorical: &#34; No.&#34; I will not review the statement, because it is perfectly true. You will remember that in 1963 this Parliament approved of an amendment to the national health scheme to authorise the payment of 36s. a day for the free hospitalisation of pen:sioners with entitlement cards. That arrangement was made directly with the hospitals and not with State Governments. 1 emphasise that the arrangement was made with State hospitals and if proof is required, I refer you to the users, because most of the public hospitals in Australia - with the exception of three or four which have chosen to remain outside the arrangement - provide free hospitalisation for pensioners. These hospitals subsequently receive from the Commonwealth Government 36s. a day towards the pensioners&#39; hospital charges. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If it is true, as the honorable senator suggests, that the New South Wales Government has provided free hospitalisation for pensioners for the last twenty years, I suggest that at least the Treasurer of the Slate Government would have some measure of appreciation of 36s. a day that has been made available to New South Wales hospitals since 1st January, 1963. The most that he ever received from any Commonwealth government prior to that date was 12s. a day, so that he has gained a clear 24s. a day. 1 now wish to&#39; refer to a point about which some people seem to be somewhat sensitive. The booklet was put out for the information of the Australian people in order to indicate to them the benefits which ave available from the Commonwealth Government. Of course it did not set out the benefits which are available from State Governments or from any statutory bodies. We set out merely to let the people know what is available to them from Commonwealth sources. The fact that no reference was made to other benefits does not mean that we claim the sole privilege of conferring benefits on the Australian people. </para>

            <para>- I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport a few pertinent questions. (1.) Is it not true that one of the main reasons for the lack of development in northern Australia has been the lack of adequate and economic transport &#39;to and from markets? (2.) Is it true that it can cost &#163;12 a ton to ship carbide from central Queensland to Sydney and only &#163;2 a ton to ship a similar product from South Africa to Sydney? (3.) Is it true that it is cheaper to ship some goods from southern Australia to central Queensland via London than to ship them directly? (4.) Is it true that it costs more to ship goods from northern Queensland to New Guinea than it does to ship them from overseas countries? What are the reasons for these peculiar facts? </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport. Has the Minister seen a press report that the &#34; Empress of Australia &#34;, the Australian National Line&#39;s new ferry to operate from Sydney to Tasmania, which is due to commence service on 5th December this year, is fully booked for the first 13 voyages? Does this statement mean the first 13 voyages from Sydney or from Tasmanian ports? Does the statement mean that complete bookings for passengers and vehicles have been made? Have passengers been asked to pay a deposit on their fares? If not, does the Minister agree that such publicity tends to dissuade intending passengers from seeking bookings, as has been the case with the &#34; Princess of Tasmania &#34; operating from Melbourne to Devonport, about which there has grown a belief that bookings must be made months ahead of the scheduled date of departure when in fact on most voyages throughout the year there are vacancies for both passengers and vehicles? </para>

I have heard, with some concern, that statements of this nature have led to the public thinking that there would be some difficulty in obtaining passage on these vessels. If there is any truth in this, then I am sure my colleague the Minister for Shipping and Transport would be only too pleased to take whatever action is necessary to rectify this impression. </para>

            <para>- I am aware that there has been a shortage of bore casing in Queensland, because this matter was one of those I dealt with when I was acting for the Minister for Primary Industry during his absence overseas. I learnt then that the short supply of casing was mainly due to the fact that the principal manufacturers, Stewarts &#38; Lloyds (Distributors) Pty. Ltd., lacked the equipment to meet the greatly expanded demand. I understand that this firm recently installed new equipment and new plant and is working some seven days a week in an effort to overtake the backlog of orders. I also understand it is confidently expected that this backlog will be overtaken in &#39;the very near future. </para>

Has the Minister seen a report in yesterday&#39;s Melbourne &#34; Age &#34; emanating from Sydney that the New South Wales branch of the Returned Servicemen&#39;s League may ask the Commonwealth Government to provide free transport to Gallipoli next year for all Anzac veterans? Has any approach been made to the Government in regard to this matter? As the 25th April 1965 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Anzac landing, has the Government given any consideration to rendering assistance of any description to enable Anzac veterans to participate in this outstanding event? Will the Minister undertake to place this matter before the Government for sympathetic consideration and to urge the Government not to haggle over the question of creating a precedent? There is no need to remind the Minister and the Government that the one-hundredth anniversary will not occur in the lifetime of any of the participants. </para>

The Returned Servicemen&#39;s League approached the Prime Minister some months ago in respect of a trip to be undertaken by Anzac veterans to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the landing. The Prime Minister publicly announced that the Government intended to support the project most generously. I regret very much I do not recall the exact amount that was mentioned. </para>

I know, from statements I have seen issued by the Minister, that some 10,000 Burgher Dutch have already entered Australia. If the honorable senator will place her question on the notice-paper 1 shall see that a full answer is obtained for her. </para>

            <para>- I preface a question to the Leader of the Government by slating that in the middle of last winter, when Canberra was at its coldest, I made an unsuccessful appeal to his predecessor to lighten the burden of a new Australian who had been given six months&#39; gaol because he was destitute, having no job and no visible means of support. </para>

              <para>- I think his offence was that he was caught sleeping in one of the parks in Canberra. About a week ago students from the Australian National University clashed with Royal Military College cadets, causing damage amounting to more than &#163;1,000, including the burning of a motorcar on the Duntroon parade ground - which in my opinion is an unpardonable offence - smashing into rooms at the university, and generally putting up a most reprehensible type of socalled entertainment, ls it true that the police have not laid any charges against the culprits? If so, who is going to meet the cost of the damage done at Duntroon and at the university? </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. Is the Minister aware that two separate groups from Western Australia have applied to the Austalian Broadcasting Control Board seeking a television licence to serve the Geraldton area? Is he further aware that two other groups are interested in providing television to this area, making four in all? Can the Minister tell me when the Australian Broadcasting Control Board will give a decision regarding these applications? As the applications are for commercial stations the provision of which will not involve the Commonwealth Government in any expenditure or interfere in any way with the fourth phase of the television programme, will he ask the Postmaster-General to give urgent and favorable consideration to the requests so that these very worthy country people may be provided with television? </para>

            <para>-  My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Territories, and it could concern also the Minister assisting the Prime Minister in educational matters. Does the Commonwealth Government subscribe to any part of the reciprocal policy operating between the State* in respect of the transfer of teachers? ls it a fact that the various State Directors of Education have without success requested the Department of Territories to discuss arrangements under which teachers from the States would be recruited for service in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, Nauru and Colombo Plan countries? Is the Minister aware that the absence of any such reciprocal policy between the States and the Commonwealth places in jeopardy the status, continuity of service and leave entitlements of teachers who offer their services in the wider national and international fields? Will the Minister investigate this matter with a view to establishing a policy to protect the rights of teachers transferring in the circumstances mentioned? </para>

            <para>- I do not know the specific answers to the questions that the honorable senator has asked, but it would be a matter for any State Education Department, in the first place, to decide whether it would permit a teacher under its jurisdiction to travel and teach somewhere else. The Commonwealth could not instruct a State that it had to do this if it did not want to do so. I am under the impression that teachers from State departments travel and teach in other countries. I think that some have gone to Canada and that some Canadians have come here. I have an idea that one of two teachers went to Germany and that one or two came here from Germany. These arrangements, as I understand it, are made by the State Education Departments. If the honorable senator is referring only to arrangements between the Department of Territories and State Education Departments, I shall try to get answers to his questions and let him have them. </para>

Does the AttorneyGeneral agree that many of the laws applying in the Australian Capital Territory are out of date and that there is an urgent need for reform? Finally, will the Minister consider the suggestion made by Professor Richardson that a law reform committee should be established immediately and that it should include representatives of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council, the Australian National University and other outside bodies, as well as government officials? </para>

As I understand it, the Government subsidises on a &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis moneys made available by the State Government in respect of flood relief. The Minister will be aware that the Lord Mayor of Perth has asked the public to subscribe &#163;200,000 for flood relief in the south-west of the State. I ask the Minister: Will any part of that &#163;200,000 subscribed by the public for relief of &#39; distress in Western Australia be subsidised on -a &#163;1 for &#163;l basis by the Commonwealth Government? </para>

It may be for a subsidy on a &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis, as on a number of occasions in the past, or the request may be that in addition to the subsidisation on a &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis the Commonwealth undertake extra relief because of the severity of the circumstances. </para>

            <para>-I wish to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Does the Minister recollect that in May last there were great confusion and dissatisfaction about the marketing of tobacco leaf at Mareeba, Queensland? Does the Minister know the real cause of the trouble relating to the sale of tobacco leaf in the Commonwealth? Is the problem solvable? How many pounds of tobacco leaf were produced in Australia during the year ended 30th June last? How many pounds of tobacco leaf were sold during that period? What quantity of tobacco was imported into the Commonwealth during the same year? </para>

            <para>- I do not know the real cause of the alleged trouble in the tobacco industry in Australia, nor do I think any single person could say what the actual cause might be. It could be that there are several contributing causes. I suggest to the honorable senator that the industry is not without hope - far from it. I think that tomorrow there is to be a conference between members of the Government, growers, brokers, manufacturers and parties which have a vital interest in keeping a buoyant tobacco industry in this country. I shall obtain the statistics sought by the honorable senator and let him have them as soon as possible. </para>

Library buildings and the grants provided for their construction, or alteration, are shown, along with other university building projects, in the second schedule to the Act. The Commission does not recommend specific recurrent grants  for  university  libraries; the amount devoted to various items in a university&#39;s budget is a matter for the university to determine. In making its recurrent recommendations for the 1964-66 triennium, however, the Commission gave full consideration to the likely expenditure necessary to provide adequate library facilities at each university.

              <para>It is considered that whenever practicable it is desirable to integrate or co-ordinate research throughout Australia. A very satisfactory degree of co-ordination has been possible in the case of research in the wool, wheat, tobacco, cattle and beef and dairy industries where a common source of funds, contributed by the Commonwealth and the industries concerned, has been used to finance research programmes which have been integrated with those supported by the State Departments of Agriculture and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation from their own resources. However, because of the wide range of production under irrigation and because many of the industries concerned are already contributing to one or more of the industry research schemes, there would appear to be substantial problems involved in developing a Commonwealth-wide irrigation research scheme. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has closely considered on a number of occasions the desirability of bringing the Organisation&#39;s irrigation research work together under one Division of Irrigation. The various centres where irrigation research is being undertaken by C.S.I.R.O. arc concerned with problems of differing environments and particular kinds of production. Although these centres may have much in common, there are, nevertheless, considerable differences in the fundamental research work required in each area. While it is recognised that some advantage would derive from grouping alt irrigation research activities under one Division, from a scientific point of view there are strong reasons in favour of the present arrangement of linking irrigation research with environmental studies being carried out in the different regions. It has been considered desirable, therefore, to retain at present the existing arrangements. C.S.I.R.O. is, however, keeping the position under continuous review. (Question No. 176.) </para>

          <para>- by leave- Honorable senators will recall that during the debate early in 1963 on the amendment of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, the then Minister for Customs and Excise undertook to report to the Senate annually on prohibited books released to individual persons and organisations for special purposes in terms of regulation 4a of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations which was introduced at that time. Regulation 4a prohibits, except with the consent of the Minister, the importation of blasphemous, indecent or obscene works or articles. The regulation further states that the Minister&#39;s approval of an application in writing to import such works shall be subject to a report from the  Chairman  of the Literature Censorship Board or the Director-General of Health. This first report will cover the period from March 1963 when the procedure commenced to 30th June 1964, a period of somewhat more than one year. Thereafter each annual report will cover one year to 30th June. In making the present report to the Senate, I propose to comment briefly on how the system has operated. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>For the period March 1963 to 30th June 1964, a total of 56 applications for permission to import prohibited publications was received. Of this number 20 were refused following investigations into the bona fides and needs of the applicants concerned. The balance was approved after consideration of reports required in terms of the regulation from cither the  Chairman  of the Literature Censorship Board or the Director-General of Health. The categories both of the applicants and the 36 released publications are as follows - </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="026232196408110_19_0.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para class="block">The applications which are the subject of this report were all considered by the former Minister. Since taking up my office I have had occasion to deal with a further number of such requests. Little difficulty has been experienced in dealing with applications for technical works especially since the assistance of the authorities mentioned in the regulation has been readily available. These technical works were in the main required by persons with relevant professional qualifications, both in universities and outside, and were for the general purpose of research. On the other hand, applications received from individuals and universities for prohibited works of fiction have not been quite so easy to deal with. Some important issues have been raised and close consideration of these has resulted in a conclusion that the release of fictional works deemed to be obscene, is unwarranted, except in very special circumstances. </para>
        <para>The custody and distribution of prohibited publications within universities to which such books have been released, follows a similar pattern in all instances. In the first place each application for release is signed by the vice-chancellor of the university concerned. On receipt, the approved books are placed in the personal custody of the university librarian who makes them available for post graduate study or research upon the recommendation, in writing, of the head of the faculty concerned. Such controls arc in accordance with the conditions imposed by the Minister in each instance mission to import a publication deemed to be a prohibited import in terms of regulation 4a of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. </para>

            <para>. - by leave - This is the statement being made by the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck)</inline> in the House of Representatives and the personal pronoun will refer to him. Honorable members will already be aware of the events in the Gulf of Tonkin on 2nd and 4th August but I am taking this early opportunity after the reassembling of Parliament to place these matters on record and to inform the House of the views of the Australian Government on the situation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On 2nd August the United States destroyer &#34; Maddox &#34;, which was on routine patrol in the Gulf of Tonkin, was attacked, some 30 miles off shore, by three North Vietnamese fast patrol boats using torpedoes and machine gun fire. The attack was deliberate and made in daylight on the high seas. The &#34; Maddox &#34; returned the fire and disabled one vessel. Subsequently the  President  of the United States issued a statement announcing that the Navy had been instructed to continue the patrols with two destroyers instead of one; that the destroyers would be provided with air cover; and that they had been ordered to attack any force which attacked them. North Vietnam was warned of the consequences of any further incidents. </para>
          <para>On the night of 4th August the &#34; Maddox &#34; and a second destroyer, &#34; C. Turner Joy &#34;, were attacked about 60 miles off the coast by a number of vessels under cover of darkness. This attack was planned and deliberate. It was beaten off, two of the attacking vessels being sunk and two damaged. In pursuance of the warning previously given, President Johnson announced that repeated acts of violence against the armed forces of the United States &#34; must be met not only with alert defence butwith positive reply &#34;. Yet, he said, the response for the present would be &#34; limited and fitting &#34;. It is well to place on record his words - </para>

          <para class="block">Aircraft of the United States ships &#34; Constellation &#34; and &#34; Ticonderoga &#34; attacked the bases from which the North Vietnamese craft operated. Some 25 motor torpedo boats were destroyed or damaged and an oil depot was in large part destroyed. Since that action on the night of 4th August there has been no further incidents. The United States has deployed greater strength into the area. At the same time as he announced these actions, President Johnson instructed that the matter be raised immediately and urgently before the Security Council of the United Nations. This has been done and the Security Council has commenced discussion of the question. </para>
          <para>On 6th August the United Slates Congress was put in possession of the facts and the Senate and the House passed a resolution, both parties supporting.it, approving the President&#39;s actions. This resolution is of such historic importance that I quote the operative paragraphs in full - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Congress approves and supports the determination of the  President,  as Commander-in-Chief, to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attacks against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression. </para>
            <para>The United States regards as vital to its national interest and to world peace the maintenance of international peace and security in South-East Asia. </para>
            <para>Consonant with the Constitution and the Charter of the United Nations and in accordance wilh its obligations under the South-East Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the United States is, therefore, prepared, as the  President  determines, to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the South-East Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom. </para>
            <para>This resolution shall expire when the  President  shall determine that the peace and security of the area is reasonably assured by international conditions created by action of the United Nations or otherwise except that it may be terminated earlier by concurrent resolution of the Congress. </para>

          <para class="block">That expression by a great power, through the voice of the representatives of its people, is a signal that will hearten those who resist aggression throughout the world. Most Australians clearly recognise that, in a world where there is aggression, peace can be established and the principles of the United Nations Charter applied only after aggression has been made to fail. The Government, the Congress and the people of the United States of America have gained our respect and honour for their acceptance of the great responsibilities that come with great power and for their sober, determined, but restrained use of their power for the peace and security of other peoples. Do not let us forget that the immediate gains in security out of these incidents have been greater for the people of the South-East Asian region than for the peoples of North America. </para>
          <para>Immediately on receiving news of the events recounted above I issued a statement on behalf of the Government, reading in part as follows - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Australian Government believes that the United States Government could do no less than take the necessary military measures to protect its naval vessels from attack in international waters. The action by the United States in defence of its forces and in defence of the principles of the freedom of the high seas - a matter of paramount importance to Australia - has obliged the United States, in the words of President Johnson, to take action against &#34; certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam which have been used in these hostile operations &#34;. The Government believes that this action was completely justified as North Vietnam could not be left undisturbed in its capacity to launch and renew such attacks. </para>
            <para>The Australian Government notes that the action being taken by the United States Forces against North Vietnam bases and supporting facilities was described by President Johnson as &#34; limited and fitting &#34; and that the United States was seeking a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation today. </para>

          <para class="block">In confirming that statement I should like to remind honorable members of the fact that the incidents in the Bay of Tonkin are part of a long sequence of aggression in South-East Asia. They should be viewed in the context of danger throughout this region and not as an isolated event. Although all of us hope fervently for peace and for good relations with our neighbours, let none of us be blind to the realities of power. North Vietnam, which possesses the largest army on the South-East Asian mainland and which has behind it the even greater power of mainland China, has been active in war, infiltration, terrorism and subversion in South Vietnam and Laos. This is the fact that shakes the stability of the region, threatens the political independence of nations and prevents its people from enjoying the social and economic progress that could otherwise be their lot. In the face of events, the Australian Government is convinced that, whatever possibilities the future may hold for a genuine settlement in. the region, there is no current alternative to the effort of assisting South Vietnam to preserve its independence and there is no current alternative to using force as necessary to check the southward thrust of militant Asian Communism. Our own defence measures and such aid as we have been able to give to neighbouring states are influenced by this realisation. lt is our hope that the restrained but determined actions of the United States will have a strong deterrent effect on the aggressor and lead to second thoughts by those who seek peace only by crushing free nations. In seeking peace, as the final objective of our policy, we recognise the need at the present time for the deterrent effect of power, and we ourselves within the limits of our capacity arc determined to stand with our allies in S.E.A.T.O. in the defence against Communist aggression in South-East Asia. Our own security in Australia is inseparable from the security of the region. We cannot profess to be concerned with the one without being ready to do something about the other. </para>
          <para>Although we continue to watch events closely and with deep concern there is at present no reason to assume that the conflict will extend. We will continue to use every diplomatic opportunity that presents itself to seek peace and we a.re confident that is also the purpose of our allies. The firmness and promptness shown in meeting hostile action has been matched in the past and will be matched in the future by our allies by firmness, patience and restraint in the face of more subtle threats to peace. </para>
          <para>Australia will make <inline font-style="italic">its own decisions</inline> from time to time in keeping with it&#39;s responsibility to the Australian people and its commitments to its allies and we will make our own judgments and offer, our own comments on the changing world scene. Our support in this case was considered and not automatic. At the present juncture and dealing with the incidents now under notice we do not qualify in any way our plain statement to the United States and to the world that we support the action of the United States and believe it to have been justified by the circumstances that provoked it and by its effect on the endeavours to bring peace to South-East Asia. </para>

          <para>. - by leave - Since we last met, India has lost a very distinguished Prime Minister and the world has lost a most famous and significant statesman. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru</inline> was the political founder of the Republic of India and was its Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs from the date of its independence in 1947 until his death in May of this year. He had been intimately associated with Mahatma Gandhi as a member of the non-violent noncooperation movement and with labour and nationalist movements. He had succeeded his father as  President  of the Indian National Congress in 1929 and had been a member of the non-violent non-co-operation movement under Mahatma Gandhi. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>international activities are well known and will be remembered. But one of his most remarkable achievements, somewhat less known, was in the domestic affairs of India. In this Senate we all know of the numerous problems that arise in the course of the government of Australia. Yet every one of us was born into a community long versed in parliamentary democracy, a community in which the general nature of democratic government and the organisation of parties and the spirit of the community had long been established. But India, when it came to ils sovereign independence, was a great group of principalities and communities and localities totalling something like 400 million people. It was a gigantic task to produce out of all these elements some political structure and coherence on a democratic basis. It is, I think, proper to believe that nobody but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru</inline> could have performed it. </para>
        <para>If democratic self-government persists in India, and we all hope and believe that it will, it will be primarily due to the life work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru.</inline> He had been through every conceivable political adversity, but he retained his standards. He achieved not only w ide fame in his own country, but immense moral authority. To hundreds of millions of people he was India. He may. properly and without any exaggeration, be described as one of the makers of modern history.  His  successor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shastri,</inline> to whom we would all wish to extend our warmest good wishes, has inherited an immense task. He will be strengthened in the performance of that- task, not only by his pride in his predecessor but by an understanding that the things for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru</inline> stood must bc carried on so that in duc course the nation of India will develop its resources, its standards and its strength. </para>
        <para>I am taking the unusual course of moving a motion because we believe :hat it should be made clear to the Government and people of India that there is an understanding in Australia of their problem, a profound sympathy for them in their tremendous loss and a resolution to cultivate a spirit of friendship and encouragement.

I begin by saying that not merely Australia but the whole world was saddened by the death of. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru</inline> on 27th May last. He was a remarkable man. He was a graduate of Cambridge University. He was a member of the Inner * Temple. He practised law in India. He met </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gandhi</inline>in 1916 and together they devoted themselves to two things - first, the winning of independence for India, their country, and secondly, to the welfare of the masses of their people. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru</inline> was imprisoned many times as an agitator, but he lived to have the great happiness of seeing his country win independence and of seeing it gain respect and stature amongst the nations of the world. He became the first Prime Minister of free India on 15th August 1947. He was a man who was respected, in the Commonwealth of Nations and in the United Nations Organisation as well. &#39; </para>
        <para>I know that one of our own Prime Ministers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> had the greatest admiration and affection for him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chifley</inline> regarded him as a world statesman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru</inline> glowed with pleasure when I told him that very thing two years ago in London. The late Prime Minister was not merely an Indian, he was also an internationalist. He visited very many countries of the earth and all the time his efforts were for peace. He was probably the first Indian leader to view Indian difficulties as part of a world problem. He saw clearly the need for the introduction of scientific methods, modern technology and industrialisation, not merely into his own country but into all the emerging UnderindUstrialised countries of the world. </para>
        <para>He was a great advocate of peace. He look up a neutral position for India in the councils of the world, but that did not prevent him from granting asylum to the Dalai Lama of Tibet when the Communist Chinese invaded that country in 1959, nor in the same year did it prevent him from warning Red China that India would resist interference on ils border by force if necessary. In recent years <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nehru.</inline> was, I know, greatly saddened by the fact that such a necessity did arise. During an interview that he accorded to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash</inline> of New Zealand and myself in London two years ago wc spent some one and half hours discussing problems connected with Britain&#39;s entry into the European Economic Community and the problems of his own country and those of the new and emerging nations. He indicated then that he had to find 14 million new jobs a year for his people, a task of a magnitude that is simply appalling. Of course, industry had to bc expanded to provide opportunities. When I asked him what Australia could best do to help India he replied: &#34; Give us technical assistance and know-how in the establishment of industry &#34;. That is a great problem not only for his own country, as he saw it, but also for the many new nations in a similar plight. Probably that is the message that the late Prime Minister, if he could determine the matter, would ask to be conveyed to this Parliament today. </para>
        <para>I hope that the Government will keep seriously in its mind, and very much to the forefront of its mind, the great need, of India in the respect I have indicated. That certainly would be the best and most fitting testimonial that we could give to this very great man. On 27th May last there ended a life of high endeavour and colossal achievement; it was a life devoted to humanity and to his country and a life that will continue to influence the world for a long time to come. </para>

In a lifetime of nearly 87 years, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> had given such service to his country in the varied roles of academic, diplomat, politician and jurist, that he won the warm-hearted affection of all Australians. He had been called to the Bar in Victoria in 1904 and lectured at the University of Melbourne in logic, philosophy and law. He served with the Royal Australian Navy in the Great War, and was an officer of the Australian delegation at the Peace Conference at Versailles. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>parliamentary career began in 1922 and he was in this Parliament for 12 years. In that period, he had served as  Deputy  Prime Minister, Attorney-General, Minister for Industry, Minister for External Affairs and Leader of the Opposition. He became a Privy Councillor in 1933, and was knighted in 1935, during which year he also became Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. He retired from the Bench in 1952. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> had also been Australian Senior Representative at the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1926 and represented Australia at the Imperial Conference in that year. He had represented Australia at the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations Special Assembly at Geneva and the Reparations Conference at Lausanne in 1932.

          <para>. - I second the motion which the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge)</inline> has proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham would be well known, if not personally, then certainly by repute, to each one in this Parliament, let alone in the Senate. He was the fifth Chief Justice of Australia. He succeeded great men who began with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith in 1903, followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Adrian</inline> Knox in 1919, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Gavan Duffy. As we have been told, he assumed office in 1935 and had a record term of nearly 17 years. He figured in the most distinguished company and he certainly will not be the least distinguished of the many great Chief Justices that Australia has had, and undoubtedly will have. Listening to the recital of the record of his 87 years of life. 23 of which were spent in the last century and 64 in this century, one is struck by the outstanding feature that here was a life of unceasing activity at the highest levels in many diverse fields. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As we have been told, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> was scholar, lawyer, parliamentarian, diplomat and leader of many worthwhile community causes. He was outstanding and distinguished in each of those activities. Those who knew anything at all of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> must have been impressed by the utmost integrity of his character and his mind. Those who have read his judgments will see therein evidence of enormous industry and clarity of mind. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> never hesitated to put down at length and most comprehensively his conclusions in relation to a cause or matter before him, and he also detailed all his reasons for them, leaving people free to determine whether they were right or wrong. From his viewpoint they were right. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>Latham never sought to evade issues, lt was characteristic of him that he should not do so. He lived up to that principle throughout the whole of his life and his retirement in 1952 gave him 1.2 more years of life, but it was only a comparative retirement. Obviously he had learned the secret of longevity which, it seems to mc, is to keep both body and mind in continuous and useful activity. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John&#39;s</inline> activities did not cease with his retirement from the Bench in 1952. He embarked on many kinds of community activity. He was outspoken and forward looking in all kinds of matters. In particular I am interested in his continuous advocacy of constitutional reform. </para>
        <para>I hope that this Parliament will lake note of the message that this great man has left to us. He spoke from the unique position of one highly qualified legally and technically; he spoke as one who experienced the operation of ou: Federal Constitution as a parliamentarian at the highest level, and as a judge he interpreted that Constitution at the highest possible level. Add to that his personal qualifications and his great Australianism, and allow for the forward looking nature of his mind and one must see that in presenting us with the problems connected with our Constitution, be indeed more than anybody was qualified to do so. I hope that the message that will live following his demise is the review of the Constitution for which he contended. He pictured its defects in the clearest language and, as usual, gave the clearest of reasons for his conclusions. This was a theme from which he did not depart and I know it was very dear to him. We who were members of the Constitution Review Committee hat! the privilege of very lengthy discussion with him on the subject of constitutional change. 1 think that the legacy he would have loved to leave would be the feeling that he had contributed to a better and greater Australia through the changes that he fell should be made. </para>
        <para>The extent to which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham was active showed in the fact that in his 87th year and only two weeks before his death, he presided over an enormous crowd in the Exhibition Building in Melbourne to celebrate American Independence Day. He was, I think, for many years the  President  of the Australian American Association. That is only one small example of the fields in which he was interested. He lived such a life that he was erect, both physically and mentally, right to his very last days. He was interested in everything that moved in the world and in life. </para>
        <para>The Opposition acknowledges that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> was a great Chief Justice and that he was a great Australian. We acknowledge, too, that he won an imperishable place in Australian history on many counts. On behalf of the Opposition I extend our deepest sympathy to his son and other surviving relatives in their loss of such a distinguished son of Australia. </para>

I had the privilege of serving with him in the Chifley Labour Government for a number of years and I regretted his defeat in 1946. Thereafter he accepted a diplomatic mission. One of his sons sought on a number of occasions, valiantly but unsuccessfully, to win back Franklin for the Australian Labour Party. Franklin has remained with the Government ever since 1946. </para>

His loyalty to the partY was unquestioned. In him we lose not only a staunch supporter of the party but also a personal friend of many of us on this side of the Senate.

He was born at Mathinna and spent much of his life at Ringarooma. He moved to Launceston when he was elected to the Senate in 1953 and remained in that city after his retirement from the Senate in 1962. During his Parliamentary service he was a member of the House Committee from 1959, a member of the Australian Delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference at London in 196J and a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 1961-62. </para>
        <para>In his early life he served with the Seventh Light Horse in World War 1. After the war he returned to Tasmania and established a general store in partnership with his brother at Ringarooma. The business was expanded to establish another store at Branxholm. He retired from this business in 1945 and took up farming. He ran two farms, a dairy and a piggery, and became one of Tasmania&#39;s leading pig producers. For some time he was  President  of the Returned Servicemen&#39;s League at Ringarooma and took a keen interest in all community activities. He was  also  interested in agricultural affairs and was associated with several agricultural associations. He was  an  original member of the Farmers&#39; and Graziers&#39; Co-operative Society,  and  was actively associated with the Royal Commonwealth Society.

      <para>On 5th May 1964, the then Leader of the Government in the Senate explained changes being made in the form of the annual appropriation measures to distinguish between appropriations which are, and those which are not, for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This distinction has been continued in the <inline font-style="italic">documents</inline> now presented to the Senate. The paper &#34; Particulars of Proposed Expenditure for other than the Ordinary Annual Services of the Government &#34; contains those appropriations for which, in the opinion of the Government and its legal advisers, a good case can not be made out for the view that they are for the ordinary annual services of the Government. During the intervening months since the Supply Bills were passed, further consideration has been given to this classification of appropriations. Discussions on this question are continuing and pending their completion, no alteration has been made to the form of the measures which was adopted in May. </para>
      <para>Tonight, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> is delivering in another place his Budget speech for 1964-65. It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government. </para>
      <para>Altogether, 1963-64 was a year of notable economic achievement for Australia. Admittedly we had a fair share of good fortune. At home, the seasons stood to us again. Abroad, the prices of a number of our main exports rose and some commodities, like wheat and sugar, found wider markets than we would normally have expected. Conceding that, however, it seems fair to say that the economy put up a good performance in terms of enterprise and effort and output. </para>
      <para>To take a few main points from the record - civilian employment increased in the twelve months to the end of May by 142,000 or 4.3 per cent, and unemployment fell by 33,000. At the end of June, the total of registered applicants for jobs was a little above 1 per cent, of the work force. Most of the very large number of young people coming forward for employment in the year were speedily and satisfactorily absorbed. </para>
      <para>Over the year there was a big increase in production as a whole and in all its main branches. Building and construction started the year high and kept on rising. Activity in transport, communications and the service occupations generally ran high. The volume of trade rose steadily and there was a further great rise in motor vehicle sales.  </para>
      <para>On preliminary figures put out by the Commonwealth Statistician, wages and salaries increased last year by 9 per cent., company income by 10 per cent., farm income by 26 per cent, and gross national product by 9 per cent. The big rise in exports had, of course, a lot to do with this. </para>
      <para>Externally, the results of the year were quite spectacular. Exports reached &#163;1,374,000,000 which was &#163;309,000,000 above the high total of the previous year. Even though imports rose strongly in the later part of the year, our receipts from abroad greatly exceeded outgoings and our overseas reserves increased by &#163;228,000,000 to a total of &#163;854,000,000. By a considerable margin, that is the largest amount of overseas reserves we have ever held at the end of a financial year. </para>
      <para>Yet, notwithstanding all this rise in incomes and activity and expenditure, and despite considerable increases in wage rates and earnings, consumer goods prices remained stable until the later part of the year, when they began &#39;.o show a rising trend. In the June quarter of this year the consumer price index was 1.7 per cent, higher than in the June quarter of 1963. It is noteworthy also that, while the exceptional rise in exports has added greatly to incomes, the disturbing effects, which in other times it would probably have had, have so far been fairly successfully contained. </para>
      <para>To state very broadly our expectations for 1964-65, we think that there can be, and will be, a further considerable rise in employment, production and general activity but that, for sheer physical reasons, this can hardly bc expected to equal the rather phenomenal results of 1963-64. Labour, if nothing else, is likely to be a limiting factor. There will be an increase in the work force this year - it may even be somewhat greater than that of last year. It will come partly from local sources - and there will be a considerable gain from migration, which is running strongly. But the difference is that, unemployment being now so low, there could scarcely be any great back flow of people to jobs from that source, such as occurred in 1963-64 when unemployment was reduced by 33,000. Besides, overtime working is already very high and it is probable that employers have already called quite heavily on the body of people in the community who normally take jobs, only in times of strong labour demand. There have, of course, been shortages of some types of skilled labour for a long time past and these are&#39; getting more serious. Now, in some industries and areas, there are shortages of unskilled labour as well. </para>
      <para>Plant capacity seems generally adequate as yet and it is being increased all the time; but it must by now be much mere extended than it was some time ago. Similarly as to materials - there are few signs of shortages but sources of supplies are being called upon more and more heavily. </para>
      <para>While the possibilities of increasing output are thus clearly limited, demand, in the shape of both current and capital expenditure, has been, and is, strongly on the rise. Last year, personal consumption expenditure increased by 6 per cent., public authority current expenditure by 13 per cent., private fixed capital expenditure by 11 per cent, and public authority capital expenditure by 1 1 per cent. All this adds up to a very formidable rate of growth in demand and there is every sign that it is continuing to increase. In particular, consumer spending, which is by far the largest element and which has shown the slowest increase so far, seems certain to rise as employment and earnings increase. The recent basic wage increases alone will add something like &#163;100,000,000 a year to wage and salary incomes. </para>
      <para>Concurrently, there has been a great growth in the volume of money. Through 1963-64 the total of bank deposits, notes and coins available to the public - already high when the year began - rose by no less than 12 per cent. Savings bank deposits alone rose by &#163;268,000,000. Besides this cash in hand, the business world and people at large are in a position to draw upon large overdraft limits established with the trading banks. In addition, of course, there is a great wealth of consumer credit facilities available. </para>
      <para>To put the position briefly, then, we have every reason to expect a further good increase in production this year. But there is also a strong likelihood that demand for goods and services will increase further and faster than supplies, at least in some quarters. Of course, we are in a position to afford more imports if we need them and there is no doubt that imports will in any case rise considerably. But we cannot readily get from overseas anything and everything we want and some of the things we do get are likely to be more costly than local products. </para>
      <para>Hence, our problem is very much one of keeping things in line. Employment and production, we can be sure, will continue to grow at a quite high rate. What we have to ensure is that demand does not rise excessively. Should it do so, there could soon be over-strong competition for goods and labour and materials. Costs and prices would be driven up. Speculation could break out again. Imports could rise excessively and lead to a greater run down of our overseas reserves than we would care to see. That would be the end of the stability which has meant so much to the Australian economy and its people over the past several years. </para>

      <para>Total estimated expenditures of the Commonwealth are expected to exceed actual expenditures last year by &#163;224,000,000. </para>
      <para>Such a large rise in expenditure raises, first of all, a question as to the effect it will have on the economy. The broad answer to this is simple and certain. It will have a strongly expansive effect since, directly or indirectly, an increase in government expenditures adds to demand for goods and services. The actual magnitude of this impact can be seen more clearly when an analysis is made on a national accounting basis of the Commonwealth expenditures and receipts for which provision is made in this Budget. These expenditures will be making a substantial addition to demand at a time when demand in general is rising strongly. </para>
      <para>To say this is not at all to concede that the rise in expenditures should or could be any less than it is. In fact, if the various main items which make up the total are taken one by one, it would have to be agreed that they are either inescapable as being the costs of services required by a fast growing economy or, so far as they flow from new policy decisions, are entirely justifiable. Within the total increase of &#163;224,400,000 we have made provision for- </para>
      <para>Defence Services - a total of &#163;296,800,000 which is an increase of &#163;36,300,000 over expenditure in 1963-64. </para>
      <para>An addition of &#163;21,000,000 to the amount to be raised for State borrowing programmes for works and housing. </para>
      <para>A net addition of &#163;31,700,000 for grants to the States. For obvious reasons there will be no repetition this year of the &#163;20,000,000 grant made last year for employment giving activities. On the other hand, financial assistance grants will increase under the formula which governs them by &#163;22,600,000, special grants to Western Australia and Tasmania by &#163;4,400,000, aid road grants by &#163;7,000,000 to a total of &#163;65,000,000, assistance for universities by &#163;2,100,000 to a total of &#163;19,000,000; and there will, besides, be increased payments amounting to &#163;4,300,000 for various development projects and approximately &#163;10,000,000 for science laboratories and technical training facilities. </para>
      <para>Increased expenditure to be made from the National Welfare Fund this year amounting to &#163;35,800,000 and bringing the total to &#163;452,200,000. Besides the cost of previously existing benefits, this includes provision for increased child endowment in accordance with our election undertakings and &#163;10,000,000 for home savings grants. </para>
      <para>An increase of &#163;24,200,000. for capital works and services, which covers <inline font-style="italic">most</inline> Commonwealth constructional activities in Australia and also includes an increase this year of &#163;6,000,000 for rail standardisation works in South Australia and Western Australia. </para>
      <para>An increase of &#163;32,800,000 for redemption of maturing debt. There is an exceptional total of &#163;347,800,000 of debt falling due within Australia this year and we have thought it advisable to allow for a substantial part of the debt being taken out in cash instead of being converted. </para>
      <para>Amounts of &#163;3,000,000 for petrol prices stabilisation, &#163;1,800,000 for increased cost of the superphosphate bounty and &#163;9,300,000 for wool promotion. Of the latter amount, &#163;4,700,000 will be raised from wool growers. </para>
      <para class="block">These major items add up to &#163;195,900,000, which is more than 87 per cent, of the total increase of &#163;224,400,000. The remaining &#163;28,500,000 represents the net increase in our various other budgetary commitments. There have been savings in some items such, for example, as a reduced liability, estimated at &#163;10,800,000 on account of the wheat industry stabilisation scheme, and a reduction of &#163;3,700,000 in the amount provided for the Mount Isa railway. On the other hand, costs of administration over the whole field, including the business undertakings, have been substantially increased by increases in the basic wage and in margins. </para>
      <para>The Government has naturally been much concerned at the size of this increase in expenditure and its budgetary and economic implications. We have made a point of giving prompt effect to our election undertakings and all but two of those with direct budgetary consequences are now in operation. Of these two, negotiations relating to the stabilisation of petrol prices in rural areas are in train and we hope to bring the scheme into effect by the end of this year. With that possibility in view, an amount of &#163;3,000,000 has been included in this Budget. The full year cost will, of course, be considerably greater than this. Legislation to establish the Housing Loan Insurance Corporation will be introduced during this session. </para>
      <para>Beyond this, however, our general line has been to avoid any further commitments of a major kind which would involve adding to expediture in this financial year. We have had very much in mind the state of the economy and the importance of keeping down the pressure of demand. We have also had to give serious consideration to the trend of defence expenditure and its significance for the Budget. I do not think anyone seriously questions what we are doing to step up defence preparations but the fact must be faced - defence preparations are costly - costly in terms not only of money but of resources. The &#163;297,000,000 provided for this year amounts to an increase of &#163;99,000,000 or 50 per cent, over expenditure in 1960-61, four years ago. That increase is strongly reflected in this Budget. But since much of the greater part of our defence spending takes place in Australia, this also represents a heavy additional call on manpower, materials and equipment. In other words, it is also having a significant influence on our economic situation. </para>

        <para>As to special developmental projects in the States, the general position is that we now have a large programme of them in hand, some still in the initial stages but others reaching the stage of rapid progress and heavy expenditure. For the projects to which we are already committed in various States, an amount of &#163;23,730,000 is provided in the current Budget, this being an increase of &#163;6,431,000 over expenditure last year. Beyond 1964-65, we have an estimated further commitment in respect of these projects exceeding &#163;70,000,000. Plainly, it would be a mistake at this stage, especially in view of the labour situation, to enlarge further the present big volume of works activity. Indeed, it could well be self defeating if competition for labour already scarce were to delay progress and force up costs not only for new projects but for those already under way. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, we do not want the programme to lose momentum. There is ample work in hand now but we want to ensure continuity of progress in the years ahead. A number of projects submitted to us by State Governments have been under consideration. Some of these require further investigation but we have now decided to offer financial assistance to an extension of the Comprehensive Water Supply Scheme in Western Australia under which water will be reticulated to farms and towns in regions to the north and east of Northam and east of Narrogin. Subject to the Government of Western Australia matching our contribution on a &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis, we will make advances to that Government up to a maximum of &#163;5,250,000. Our contributions, however, will not begin until the financial year 1965-66. </para>
        <para>As announced recently by the Minister for National Development and following a recommendation by the Australian Water Resources Council, the Government has decided to support an accelerated programme in the States for the measurement of surface water resources. In addition, we have decided to offer the States financial assistance towards an accelerated programme of investigation of underground water resources. It is expected that legislation for these purposes will be introduced during the current parliamentary session and meanwhile, provision has been included in the Budget for payments to the States of &#163;402,000 in 1964-65. </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>For a number of reasons this is likely to be a comparatively good revenue year. So far as income tax is levied this year on the incomes of individuals, companies and other businesses derived in 1963-64, it will reflect the generally buoyant conditions of that period. There is perhaps one offset to this worth mentioning. The amount of provisional tax debited last year to taxpayers subject to provisional tax was comparatively large and since, in this year, it becomes a credit in the assessment of those taxpayers, it will diminish revenues collected from them. </para>
      <para>As to the current year, there will certainly be a substantial rise in wage and salary earnings, partly because of increased employment and partly through increases in wage rates and other earnings. Pay as you earn collections should, therefore, increase considerably and there will also be some increase in pay-roll tax revenues. </para>
      <para>We can expect a substantial further increase in sales of goods subject to sales tax, although it seems hardly likely that sales of motor vehicles could increase again by as much as they did in 1963-64, when they rose by 16 per cent, to the 400,000 a year mark. Also, revenues this year will bear a full twelve months cost of the removal of sales tax from foodstuffs in the last Budget. </para>
      <para>With imports likely to increase considerably, there should be a fairly large increase in Customs revenue and, with consumer spending generally on the rise, there should also be an appreciable increase in Excise collections from the major items such as petrol, beer, spirits and cigarettes. </para>
      <para>Accordingly, in the light of this general prospect, we have not felt it necessary to take a conservative view of taxation revenue possibilities and have put our estimate of total collections, on the basis of tax rates as they stand, at &#163;1,759,200,000, this being an increase of approximately &#163;160,500,000 on the amount obtained in 1963-64. </para>
      <para>For much the same reasons, revenues from business undertakings are likely to rise and the estimates show an increase of about &#163;12,500,000. </para>
      <para>For various reasons, miscellaneous revenues are likely to be somewhat less than last year. On the other hand, the receipts of the National Debt Sinking Fund are&#39; expected to increase this year by about &#163;5,500,000 and various other trust fund balances are estimated to show a net increase of about &#163;6,400,000. </para>
      <para>All told, therefore, it is estimated that, with taxation and other charges on their present basis, the total of revenue and other receipts available in 1964-65 would be &#163;2,177,600,000, an increase of &#163;180,900,000 over that of 1963-64. </para>

      <para>Estimated total expenditures being &#163;2,511,100,000, this would mean that, to obtain the necessary cash to meet our expenditures in the year, our total call on borrowings would amount to &#163;333,500,000. Last year our total call on borrowings for budgetary purposes was &#163;290,000,000, so that, in this financial year, there would be an increase on that very high total to the extent of &#163;43,500,000. </para>

          <title>Estimated Loan Raisings</title>
          <page.no>35</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Last year, we succeeded in raising by way of public loans an amount of &#163;317,700,000, of which &#163;281,100,000 was raised in Australia. This was a peace time record for borrowings in Australia and it undoubtedly owed much to certain exceptional circumstances and especially to the great rise which occurred in monetary liquidity. </para>
        <para>At this stage it does not seem likely that we will be raising any new loans abroad this year for works and housing programmes on what we would regard as reasonable terms and conditions. We will make a further drawing, estimated at &#163;10,615,000, against the International Bank loan for the Snowy Mountains Scheme; but that is all. </para>
        <para>At home it seems probable that liquidity will remain high, but it is to be doubted whether there will be anything like the increase which occurred last year. For that, if for no other reason, it might be rather much to expect that we will be able to borrow as much on the home market as in 1963-64. On the other hand, there has now been a run of three years in which the average of local raisings has been above &#163;250,000,000 and there is no obvious reason why, in this year, our borrowings should not again be of that order. Obviously, there is a range of possibilities but we have settled on &#163;275,000,000 as perhaps a reasonable figure for the overall amount we can reckon on borrowing in this financial year. </para>
        <para>On this figuring, there would be a shortfall, in terms of revenue and loan raisings from the public, of &#163;58,500,000 which we would have to finance by temporary borrowings - mainly if not entirely by calling on the Reserve Bank. In 1963-64 we ended the year with a cash surplus of &#163;27,700,000. </para>

      <para>From a budgetary standpoint, then, the position is that we estimate an increase in total expenditure of &#163;224,000,000, an increase in revenues and other receipts of &#163;181,000,000, a borowing gap of &#163;333,500,000, loan raisings of &#163;275,000,000 and a deficiency of &#163;58,500,000 to be financed from temporary sources. In point of net cash outcome, this would represent a deterioration of &#163;86,200,000 on the results of last year. </para>
      <para>From a strictly economic standpoint the position is shown when the aggregates are set out in national accounts form. From this it can be seen that, at present levels of taxes and other charges, the net increase in government indebtedness over the year would amount to &#163;279,000,000 as compared with an increase of &#163;247,000,000 last year. In other words, the amount added, directly or indirectly, to demand through Commonwealth expenditure would exceed by this large sum the amount taken from incomes by way of taxation and other receipts. In a year when so many other expansive forces are at work in the economy, this could only be characterised as inflationary finance. Frankly, we are not disposed to contemplate a Budget of that character. </para>
      <para>After much deliberation, therefore, we have concluded that there is no alternative to an increase in taxation and certain other charges sufficient to reduce significantly our prospective call on borrowings and eliminate altogether any need to call on Reserve Bank finance. As a broad target, we have aimed at an overall result not substantially different from that of last vear, 1963-64. </para>
      <para>Apart from economic considerations such as those just discussed, there is a financial aspect of the matter which should be brought to notice. During the past three years in which expenditures have risen steeply, there has been a long sequence of major tax concessions. These were made for a reason which was entirely sound under the circumstances - that of stimulating the economy. But while the need for such stimulation is now well behind us, the cumulative effect of these concessions has been to reduce quite heavily the resources currently available to us. It is estimated that, in the present year, the various tax concessions given since 1960-61 would have a cost to revenue above &#163;100,000,000. </para>
      <para>Perhaps I could emphasise the point in this way: Along with the many other factors contributing to the increase in our expenditure, defence spending has risen quite spectacularly. The amount of &#163;297,000,000 provided for defence services in this Budget is &#163;99,000,000 or 50 per cent, greater than actual expenditure in 1960-61. Over the same period, however, sources of revenue have been reduced by tax concessions to the extent of more than &#163;100,000,000. The implication is plain enough. Our command of resources must be strengthened. Defence spending has  increased strongly and will increase further. We simply have to put ourselves into a better position to pay for it. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>As to income tax on individuals, for the last three income years a 5 per cent, rebate has been allowed against the tax payable by individuals. In the changed circumstances of this year the Government finds itself unable to continue this rebate in respect of 1964-65 incomes. Appropriate adjustments will accordingly be made to the instalment deductions from salaries and wages paid on or after 1st October next and to provisional tax for 1964-65. </para>
        <para>Discontinuance of the rebate is estimated to result in additional revenue of &#163;35,000,000 in a full year and &#163;30,800.000 in this financial year. </para>
        <para>Next, as to income tax on companies, it is proposed to increase by 6d. in the &#163;1 the rates of tax payable on incomes derived by companies during the income year 1963-64. The rate of 10s. in the &#163;1 payable where there is an insufficient distribution of income by a private company will not be changed. </para>
        <para>It may perhaps be contended that, as there has been no reduction of income tax rates on companies during the period when individuals have had the advantage of a 5 per cent, rebate, it is inappropriate to increase rates on companies at this juncture. We considered this point. On the other hand, we recalled that, over recent years, companies have had a major share in the benefit of a very wide range of concessions which are still in force. Amongst these have been such important measures as the investment allowance for plant used in manufacturing, increased retention allowances for private companies, the rebates of pay-roll tax to encourage export sales and a variety of concessions for mining enterprises. Some of these have been available to a broad range of companies, others to companies operating in particular fields of production. In all, however, the value of these concessions adds up to a considerable sum. It is estimated that, in the current year, companies as a whole would be paying a full &#163;30,000,000 less in taxation because of these concessions. </para>
        <para>The investment income of a superannuation fund that does not invest a sufficient proportion of its assets in public securities is taxed at the same rates as apply to the mutual income of a life assurance company. In consonance with the proposed increase in the rates of tax payable by life assurance companies, the rates for superannuation funds are to be increased by 6d. in the &#163;1. The increased rates will apply to investment incomes of funds derived during the income year 1964-65. </para>
        <para>The gain in revenue from the increased rates is estimated to be &#163;22,000,000 in a full year and &#163;20,000,000 in 1964-65. </para>

        <para>Since rates of sales tax on motor vehicles were reduced in February 1962 vehicle sales have, of course, increased greatly.

The additional revenue expected in 1964-65 from television viewers&#39; licences  is  &#163;1,725,000, an amount that will approximately equal the  loss  in excise revenue  on  cathode ray tubes. </para>

      <para>At the present time it is estimated that 62 per cent, of Australian homes have licenced television receivers. Nearly all of these homes also have broadcast receivers. It has been decided, therefore, that the time is opportune to introduce a combined licence to cover both broadcast and television receivers. A compulsory combined receiving licence will have many advantages from an administrative viewpoint. </para>
      <para>The fee for a combined licence will be 5s. less than the total fees payable for ordinary rate separate licences. Separate licences will be retained in those cases where persons possess only one type of receiver. An applicant for a television viewers&#39; licence only will be required to complete a statement to the effect that neither he, nor any member of his family, is in possession of a broadcast receiver in respect of which a licence is required. The combined licence is not intended to apply to hirers and lodging houses. </para>
      <para>Including the increase of &#163;1 in the television viewers&#39; licence fee, which I have already mentioned in conjunction with the abolition of duty on television cathode ray tubes, the new combined licence fee will be &#163;8 10s., and separate viewers&#39; and listeners&#39; licences will cost &#163;6 and &#163;2 15s. respectively. </para>
      <para class="block">AIR Navigation Charges. </para>
      <para>As a further step in its policy of seeking to recover from air transport operators the cost of maintaining and operating airport and airway facilities, the Government has decided to increases by 10 per cent, the rates of air navigation charges payable by all users. The increases will take effect from 1st January 1965 and are estimated to bring in &#163;64,000 additional income in 1964-65 and about &#163;192,000 in a full year. </para>

          <title>Post Office Charges</title>
          <page.no>39</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>A general review has been made of the finances of the Post Office in the light of certain important considerations. The Post, Office is Australia&#39;s largest business undertaking and its activities . have major budgetary and economic implications. The demand for its services, particularly for telephones, has been growing rapidly. The meeting of this demand necessitates very large capital expenditure, which in turn involves a heavy demand on resources. It is essential that its activities be conducted in accordance with sound business and commercial practice, that is, that it should be required to meet its normal operating costs from its own resources. </para>
        <para>Since the last major adjustment of Post Office charges in October 1959, the direct and indirect effects of higher wage rates have added something like &#163;17,000,000 to yearly operating costs, and for three successive years there have been operating losses on the telephone service, which faces increasingly heavy losses at current charge rates. Demand for new telephone services is at an all-time high due principally to the provision of services at less than operating costs and the buoyant state of the economy. Despite sharply increased capital expenditure on new facilities, the number of unsatisfied applications has been growing. At current charges every new connection adds to the losses being incurred. </para>
        <para>The Government has therefore decided that it is necessary for Post Office charges for telephone services to be adjusted to levels which reflect the cost of providing those services. This will ensure that future demand will not be artificially stimulated to the extent that it has been up to the present time. </para>
        <para>Details of the increased charges, which will operate from 1st October 1964, will be announced shortly. The increases will relate principally to telephone rentals, accompanied by a simplification of the charging and tariff structure. The service connection fee, which has remained at &#163;10 since its introduction in 1956, will be increased to &#163;15, and there will also be adjustments to charges for miscellaneous subscribers&#39; apparatus and private telephone and telegraph lines. </para>
        <para>There is an allocation for Post Office capital works for 1964-65 of &#163;77,000,000, representing an increase of over 12 per cent, on actual expenditure in 1963-64. The extra funds will be spent largely on connection of new telephone services, the development of the trunk line network, television relay link facilities - including the Brisbane-Cairns link, which will also improve communications to the north - and on buildings to provide postal and telephone service,  in  making this very substantial provision the Government recognises the many special projects to which the Post Office is committed in its efforts to provide better service, and the desirability of satisfying as far as possible the demand for new telephone connections. </para>
        <para>The additional revenue expected to accrue from the new charges is &#163;9,500,000 in a full year and &#163;8,500,000 in 1964-65. </para>

      <para>These increases in taxation and charges are estimated to produce, in all, &#163;77,000,000 more revenue in 1964-65 and &#163;87,000,000 in a full year. Estimated revenue and other receipts thus become &#163;2,254,600,000 and, if loan raisings reach our assumed figure of &#163;275,000,000, overall cash receipts will amount to &#163;2,529,600,000. Total expenditure being estimated at &#163;2,511,100,000, there would then be an excess of cash receipts over expenditure of &#163;18,500,000. </para>

      <para class="block">During recent times a good deal has been happening in Australia to suggest that we may be moving up to a phase of growth faster and more varied than anything we have seen hitherto. It would seem significant that the advance made in the past couple of years has not been confined to one or two sectors: it has been shared by farming, mining, manufacturing - in fact it has been more or less universal. </para>
      <para>Fairly clearly, the idea that bigger things lie ahead has taken hold and people are acting upon it. The question is - where will it lead? Conceivably, it could lead nowhere in particular but prove to have been a mere passing flurry occasioned by recent favorable events. I doubt this; there is too much of substance in the move for it to have that transient character. Possibly it could build up into yet another boom which in due time would peter out. That is undeniably a risk but it is something we do not want to happen and must do our utmost to prevent. </para>
      <para>On the other hand, in the context of an expanding world and with the momentum already evident here, we could move on from where we are now to an era of quite unprecedented expansion. </para>
      <para>Certainly the foundation for a strong, steady advance has been well laid in the past two years. Our external position has been greatly strengthened <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> that we do nol have to fear as much as we often did in the past that any major rise in domestic activity would bring on balance of payments troubles. We still have the basic conditions of stability within Australia and, with good national teamwork, they can be preserved. But if and when circumstances arise to threaten stability, such as the big rise in expenditure, including defence expenditure, of which I have spoken earlier, at a time when our resources are already fully committed, it will not do for us merely to sit idly by and hope for the best. We must take firm and positive action in these circumstances to preserve stability. In the Budget we propose action directed to this purpose. We are confident that the community will recognise the need and recognise also that, in what we propose, we are acting in their own best interests. We believe that in this Budget we have achieved a realistic and fitting balance between the claims on national resources arising from defence, development and social welfare. </para>
