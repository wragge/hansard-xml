            <para>- The Government announced early in 1976 that the headquarters of the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science would move to Hobart. I am sure that when that work is put in hand it will be to the advantage of that particularly important State. A number of honourable senators have taken a great deal of interest in this important matter. On 2 occasions I have looked at the sites for a new headquarters in Hobart and, indeed, with the Minister for Administrative Services I have looked at the IXL site. I noted in the Press yesterday that it is now to come up for auction. I should imagine that this is the important matter which prompted the honourable senator&#39;s question. I think it is best for me to reiterate that the Government&#39;s attitude is that the headquarters of the Antarctic Division will move to Hobart. I have been in touch constantly with the Department of Administrative Services attempting to evaluate sites in and around Hobart as well as the Kingston site which at present is held for the headquarters of the Antarctic Division. Prior to Christmas I announced that within the first 2 months of this year I would announce where the headquarters would be located. I expect to make the decision before the end of this month. </para>

            <para>-Questions have been asked of the Minister for Science so regularly that I do not know whether I have the full information for the honourable senator. I am sure that honourable senators will have noted that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has been assisting primary industries as well as consumers in this country in relation to developing a more acceptable meat product. Scientists from the Division of Food Research, which is the meat research laboratory, have been testing methods which use electrical stimulation to improve the tenderness of carcasses. I know that honourable senators opposite get quite excited when this type of information is given. The CSIRO has shown that the use of low voltage stimulation of meat carcasses prevents muscle shortening. That is the major cause of toughness in meat. The shock is directed into the carcass through electrodes a few minutes after slaughter. The voltage used in the CSIRO experiments is within the safety limits specified by the State electricity authorities. The electrical stimulation speeds up rigor mortis whilst the carcass is still warm. If those honourable senators who have no interest in primary industries laugh in the way they are laughing now the rural industries will recognise the difficulty it has in getting the Opposition to realise the problems concerning export. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This matter is important. This is a major breakthrough for the community, I think the work done by Australian scientists who come within the ambit of my portfolio is a wonderful achievement. Returning to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> the shock is applied while the carcass is still warm. It brings about a softness of the natural muscle and that is largely preserved. This is a very important step. The question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> relates to a most important issue. The meat tenderising process will establish Australia as a leader in the field of quality meat exports. </para>

I believe that the question would probably more properly be directed either to the responsible State department, or perhaps to the Minister for Primary Industry in this Parliament. If the question related to a research project- perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Heinsohn</inline> is suggesting that there should be more research on the matter- it might well be a matter that falls within the authority and responsibility of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. I take the honourable senator&#39;s question on board. I shall see whether the question as it relates to fisheries falls within the responsibility of my Department. </para>

Secondly, has the Minister noted the charge in the newspaper article that many thousands of New Zealanders are coming to Australia and receiving unemployment benefits?

            <para>- I have not seen the article to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> refers, in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> this morning. However, it does appear that the article makes reference to several matters which already have been the subject of a considerable amount of publicity and discussion, both inside and outside the Parliament, and also the subject of some questions raised in this Parliament. For instance, the claim that a number of people who are now seeking work voluntarily left their previous jobs was the subject of a question directed to me yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan.</inline> I endeavoured to answer the question as best I could. I do not think that I need to repeat what I said then. Certainly the experience of a great many employers is that they are finding difficulty in obtaining suitable employees for job vacancies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic</inline> drew to my attention this week an advertisement by the Public Transport Commission of New South Wales in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> publicised the vacancies- in many cases for inexperienced people- within that Commission. It does seem that the newspaper article to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> referred relates to matters which are of public concern and which are already matters of public discussion and debate. As to the specific question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson,</inline> the Government has set up an inquiry into the Commonwealth Employment Service, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Norgard. That inquiry has very wide terms of reference. The Government attaches great importance and priority to this inquiry. It is looking forward to an early report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norgard</inline> which, we believe, will deal with most of the matters that have been raised in this series of questions. </para>

The extract reads:   . . against the background of the obvious reluctance of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to recognise the need to award lower increases in wages, highlighted by the recent decision to pass on the whole of the September quarter consumer price increase, it had become increasingly clear that there was little or no chance of restoring competitiveness of Australian industries by purely domestic policies. </para>

              <para>- We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> always says the same thing whenever I answer questions. He always interjects in the same vein. He and I could get a record of this; it would always be the same. But what pleased me about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walker&#39;s</inline> comments on <inline font-style="italic">AM this</inline> morning was the fact that he is recognising the need for co-ordinated legislation by the national Government and State governments on this matter. I understood him to say that he would proceed with further State legislation only in the event that co-operation was not achieved. As I said the other day, it is the wish of this Government to achieve a co-operative arrangement with the States whereby this Parliament and the State parliaments will legislate to regulate the securities industry and the activities of companies which are operating on the national market. </para>

          <para>There is to be a meeting of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and the responsible State Ministers next month. They will be discussing what I think undoubtedly has been further progress in negotiations which have taken place. I hope and the Government certainly hopes that we will be able to achieve an agreement so that there will be uniformity in this matter and States will not continue to have different laws on the matter. Certainly it would be most undesirable for New South Wales or any other State to embark upon new and further laws of their own and thereby exacerbate the problem. </para>

            <para>- My Government and I are very much aware of what has been in relative terms the neglect by all governments- Federal and State- of technical and further education over the years and of the urgent need for improvement in that field. The guidelines laid down and executed for this year gave an earnest of our intentions in that regard. Our technical and further education funds were increased by <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent. We have indicated in setting up the co-ordinating commission in the post-secondary sphere that by bringing technical and further education in alongside colleges and universities we are developing an intended co-partnership to focus a more significant light on the technical and further education area. We will be giving that kind of focus, that kind of preference, to technical education in our policies for the future. </para>

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I refer the Minister to the platform of the Liberal Party of Australia, which says that the Liberal Party believes in full employment. I also refer him to the election promise of December 1975 that a Liberal government would reduce the level of unemployment by 200 000. In the light of those 2 matters, I ask: What is the Minister really trying to say regarding the current unemployment figures and the questions which have been asked of him about employees who leave their jobs voluntarily and who are unable to find other jobs? Is he saying that it is now a part of this Government &#39;s policy that people should not leave their jobs voluntarily? I want to be quite clear about this because very vague answers have been given by the Minister in replies to previous questions. </para>

            <para>-The Government is not saying that and I am not saying that. I am simply referring to matters which have been canvassed recently. One matter concerning those who have left their jobs voluntarily related to a statistic provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That is the authority for that statement. I do not think that the honourable senator is challenging that. I have been simply referring to certain statistics and to certain facts, and saying that these are matters for consideration. When one looks at the total figures concerning registered unemployed one sees that they have some important relevance to the conclusions which might be drawn and which are being drawn by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> and the Opposition about the total figures for registered unemployed. What I am saying is that all these matters are being investigated by the inquiry conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norgard.</inline> That is the substance of what I have been saying in relation to these matters. </para>

Has the Minister considered the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review which reported in 1959 unanimously in favour of legislation to give the Commonwealth power over corporations, untrammelled by the limitations in the present Commonwealth power, which would enable a uniform companies Act and Federal legislation effectively controlling the securities industry? What is the attitude of the Government to that proposal for constitutional reform? </para>

            <para>- The Joint Committee on Constitutional Review reported in 1958 and 1959. There has been a great change in the interpretation of the Constitution by the High Court during that period. There has been a fundamental change by the High Court in the interpretation of the provision of the Constitution in relation to the corporations power, which is the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> in a case known as the concrete pipes case with which I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is more familiar than I and certainly more familiar than most people would be. Now the attention of the Attorney-General and his advisers would be directed primarily at the ramifications of that case. Certainly it has considerable relevance to the question asked about controlling the securities industry and the conduct of corporations. The Attorney-General&#39;s consideration will be directed more to that, I feel, than the matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> raised. However, I will certainly pass on the question to the Attorney-General and endeavour to obtain a more detailed answer for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline></para>

              <para>-No, they have a Senate to protect them. The Government believes that Australia&#39;s long term interests would be best served by the achievement of a widely supported multi-lateral convention which included provision for a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. While the concept of the exclusive economic zone is widely supported in the Law of the Sea Conference there is still no agreement on the precise balance of rights and obligations of states in the exclusive economic zone. The Government believes that we should not at this stage seek to pre-empt the outcome of the negotiations by making a unilateral declaration. Nor does it believe that the circumstances which led to unilateral action by certain Northern Hemisphere countries to protect the depleted fisheries resources apply at the present stage in Australia&#39;s region. At a South Pacific forum meeting on the Law of the Sea in October last year, member states confirmed their intention to establish 200-mile exclusive economic zones at appropriate times and after consultation with one another. The Government recognises that developments could take place in our part of the world which might require it to re-examine the need for legislative action. The situation will be kept under review. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator suffers from observing the financial witchdoctors every morning. The facts are that the original draft of the White Paper was delivered by me in the middle of November. As the honourable senator would well know, devaluation intervened and is was necessary to recast a great part of that White Paper because of devaluation and because of the change in the exchange regime. If the honourable senator refers back I think he will find that I commented on that matter- at least I hope I would have done so. </para>

              <para>-I do not think I did. Equally, if I said that I was wrong, was I not? A lot of work has been done. By about the fourth week in January the White Paper had been recast and there had been a re-examination of the various aspects with a view to Cabinet considering the matter. When Cabinet looked at it the other day we all agreed that it would benefit by more input on some extra areas and that is what is happening now. There is no question of it being pulped and there is no question of it not being done properly. I think the honourable senator would acknowledge that in the construction of a matter such as this it is very important to be as accurate as possible in order to try to predict, as far as one can, what ought to be done. It is necessary to examine the problem very carefully. That has been done. It is an objective document prepared very thoroughly and precisely and it does paint a scene of difficulty and problem. One would expect it to do so. It represents an endeavour to examine possible solutions and, quite honestly and fairly to get an objective position which is as bipartisan as possible because we are concerned with an Australian and not a political problem. This problem has been accruing for a long, long time. If I just mention that the document is now the product of 3 1 1 submissions of detailed and careful examination honourable senators will be able to appreciate the problem. </para>

            <para>- The Government indicated that it desired to move the Northern Territory to statehood over a period of approximately 5 years. In consequence of that goal the Government has set up a series of co-ordinating programs to provide steadily for the transfer of various powers and for the ultimate assumption of powers. In respect of education, the first step of course has been to get greater liaison and coordination between the Northern Territory division of my Department and all other Departments within the Northern Territory, but notably the Departments of the Northern Territory, Aboriginal Affairs and Health. These Departments will work within a co-ordinating atmosphere of interdepartmental relationships to develop plans consistent with the transfer of powers in a time scale as indicated. </para>

          <para>In parallel with that, my Department is in close contact with the parliamentary members for the Northern Territory. As far as possible we will keep them informed and seek their views on matters relating to the Northern Territory. I remind the honourable senator that the Northern Territory, along with the Australian Capital Territory, will be observer members initially- ultimately when the Northern Territory becomes a State it will be a full participant- of the Advisory Commission on Inter-governmental Relations, the composition of which I hope may be announced in the immediate weeks ahead. Steps similar to this are being taken throughout the Northern Territory to provide total working liaison. </para>

I support that diagnosis. The Commonwealth Government has made it clear that in bringing together the 2 bodies- the Bureau of Roads and the Bureau of Transport Economicsthere will be no loss of any existing functions. That includes the ability of full and free liaison. Obviously there will be some gain because the second body is of very great significance. The Government has given that undertaking with regard to future functions and responsibilities. I am not aware of the legislative situation. I shall seek the information and let the honourable senator know. </para>

            <para>- I think this is the second question asked on this matter by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> in recent days. My recollection is that in my previous answer to him, acting upon advice given to me, I indicated that the previous Government had taken steps to acquire the land but that the New South Wales Government had intervened by High Court action. As I understood the situation, on the advice given to me, it remained inert, the New South Wales Government having taken that step. It may be true- I was not so advised- that there has been a withdrawal of that action. The advice I have is that the matter still lies with the New South Wales Government as to whether it intends to withdraw completely. I may be wrong in my interpretation; but I understand that the position is not quite as clear at this moment as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> is saying. Nevertheless, I shall take note of that matter and clarify it. As there is some delay in the process, the Commonwealth and New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Services are working closely together to collect information on which to base the management of the area. I think that is the essential thrust of the honourable senator&#39;s question. This information is obviously relevant in deciding how best to administer the area. On the technical side, for the purposes of information I shall find out and let the honourable senator know. </para>

            <para>-As to the first aspect of the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume,</inline> yes, I have had my attention drawn to considerable publicity directed to the suggestion that an inquiry conducted by a <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Wolanski</inline> had indicated a real threat to the Nepean and Hawkesbury river systems which are major river systems in the Sydney general development area, particularly if the trends of population continue over the next 2 decades as normally projected. The threat of course would be heavily underlined if there were developments in Camden, Campbelltown or areas of that nature. It is of major significance to all those interested and concerned in an environmental way that there should be monitoring, planning and above everything else the avoidance, the prophylaxis necessary. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have not seen <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Wolanski&#39;s</inline> report. I will draw the attention of my colleague, the Minister in the other place, to it and ask him to look at it. I will see whether copies can be made available to honourable senators. I will certainly try to get a copy for myself because we need it as a starting point. In general, all sewage treatment, effluent treatment and matters of that nature are State matters and therefore must be primarily the responsibility of the Wran Government. Nevertheless I do not abdicate responsibility in the area. The Commonwealth Government has accepted responsibility for supplementary funding for sewerage works and other matters. Last year it provided to the New South Wales Government for its Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board $ 19.7m. </para>
          <para>I think the importance of the honourable senator&#39;s question lies in its general thrust- the need for planning at both Commonwealth and State levels ahead of trends in order to preserve the vital ecology, the vital waterways and the vital river systems, because once they are polluted the way back has enormous difficulties. I will raise the matter with the Minister. I will seek the report itself and I will certainly ask that it be thoroughly examined. </para>

            <para>-According to my briefing note the New Hebrides National Party, now renamed the Vanuaaku Party, has called for certain changes in the structure of the Representative Assembly. These include the establishment of a ministerial system of government and a committee of parties to examine the electoral system. The British and French governments issued a statement on 17 February stating that they will spare no effort to ensure that the evolution of the New Hebrides takes place in an orderly and democratic way in accordance with the priciples of self-determination. They see no objection to this Party or any other political groups examining ideas for a more appropriate electoral system, and the 2 governments would welcome a delegation from the Representative Assembly at a meeting of Ministers in the near future to discuss the modalities of procedures towards self-government which could lead to independence. The Australian Government welcomes these statements as indications of orderly political developments in the New Hebrides. The question of Australian representation in Vila is being considered along with representation in the rest of the Pacific countries. </para>

As the Minister responsible for the operation of the Act, does he know which vote in the Parliament is taken by the Chief Electoral Officer as fulfilling opposition to a referendum Bill? In view of the spurious arguments of some of his coalition colleagues who intend to oppose the referenda in the electorate but who say that their votes in this place for the measures are simply to allow the people a chance to vote on them, will the Minister give an undertaking that their votes for the measures under these circumstances will not be used in support of the official Yes case to be delivered to each elector? </para>

            <para>-It is true that the Departments of Education in Australia are massive builders of schools, colleges and universities and, therefore, massive consumers of energy for various uses. It does behove us in the future in our building planning to think ahead to see whether we can use alternative energy sources. I am happy to refer to one significant development in the Australian Capital Territory- the Wanniassa <inline font-style="italic">College</inline> and the community centre associated with it. I think this is the first building construction plan which allows and caters for the use of solar energy as a supplementary source of energy. Whilst these are small beginnings I think they are significant. The Wanniassa College and community centre will cost the Australian taxpayer a little matter of $7.7m. It will be the first school building in the Australian Capital Territory to use solar energy as a supplementary energy source. It is scheduled to commence operation at the commencement of 1979 and the community activities facilities will be completed a month or so later. The design incorporates a central pedestrian mall of some 100 metres in length. It is proposed to utilise the large amounts of glass in the mall roof to house the solar energy collectors. The energy from this source will supplement the main oil-fired plant and, for the delight of residents of Canberra I say, will be used to heat the indoor swimming pool as well as being used in connection with the more usual facilities. During the last few days questions have been asked of me and in the Press relating to heating and cooling problems in schools. I have drawn attention to the fact that we are looking at heat exchange pumps in order to get a better heating and cooling system in schools. In the future planning of the Charnwood and Tuggeranong high schools it is envisaged that an attempt will be made to involve solar energy as a supplementary source of energy to the heat exchange pumps. </para>

            <para>- I have no knowledge of the matters which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> has raised in her question. I shall certainly pass on the question to the Minister whom I represent. However, I should point out that we have a federal system of government in Australia. There is a tendency for questions to be asked of me, representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, as though the Minister whom I represent and the Federal Government are the only agencies in Australia which can investigate consumer complaints and, indeed, enforce the general laws governing, in this case, alleged fraud. The fact of the matter is that State agencies under State laws are, and have been over the years, primarily responsible in these matters. I think that in many cases, and this sounds very much like one of them, the complaint should be taken to either the State police or the State consumer affairs organisations rather than to the Federal organisation. </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator referred to the Representation Act. I assume he means the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act. I thought the honourable senator would know of his own knowledge what happened some years ago. I am calling on my own knowledge of what happened 3 years ago when I helped prepare the No case. Whilst I have administrative oversight of this matter, I should remind the honourable senator that the Chief Australian Electoral Officer is an independent statutory officer. He is not subject to my direction and, even if he were, I would not subject him to it. </para>

              <para>-I will seek the information for the honourable senator. As I understand it, those who wish to vote one way or the other come to an arrangement amongst themselves as to who will prepare the case. As I recall the last occasion the then Leader of the Opposition, the Right Honourable Bill Snedden, and I, together with the Right Honourable Doug Anthony, got together and prepared the No case. It was then signed by a number of us. Before the Chief Australian Electoral Officer would accept it he had to be satisfied that, according to the division lists, the signatures on that No case were those of people who had voted No. I am not the whip for the honourable senator&#39;s No group. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> wishes to prepare one case, the honourable senator another, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> another and somebody else another, I shall not act as some sort of arbitrator on which ought to be the official No case. If those honourable senators cannot get together and act to put together a single case, they should not come to me to be the referee. </para>

            <para>- In the present Budget, the Government announced support for the Australian Assistance Plan as an interim stage so that State governments would be able to assume the Plan if they wished to do so. The Government has no intention to provide funds for the Australian Assistance Plan in future years as it was made clear when presenting the Budget for this year that States had been given additional finances to enable them to determine those programs which they wish to assist in the future. I am aware that there are regional councils which are in difficulties. I am aware also that some States are making decisions with regard to the future of those regional councils and the type of community development plan in general. I am aware that Victoria has advanced considerably its own planning with regard to this type of activity. I have been advised by the South Australian Government that about May of this year some decision will be made on this matter by it. I hope that other State governments will give assistance to community development through continuation of regional councils or in some other way that might be more appropriate in their own States. </para>

              <para>- Yes they are; they are threatening to do all sorts of things. But, they will not get away with that. The major point is that this is basically an industrial matter between the British Phosphate Commission and an industrial group. We are involved administratively with only a small number of people in the administration and police force. I think there are some 12 policemen there. I reiterate that the Government will determine policies on the island and not a trade union. We are prepared to seek the views of the trade union. We have no objection to that. </para>

          <para>- I remind the Committee that the title of this Bill is the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill and it purports to be a Bill to alter the Constitution so as to ensure that Senate elections are held at the same time as House of Representatives elections. It has been pointed out in debate by several honourable senators that that title misdescribes the Bill. With regard to clause 3, the only provision that the Bill makes concerning elections is to state that this Parliament may make laws for determining the times of elections of senators, whereas the Constitution, presently unamended, states that the State Parliaments may make laws for determining the times of elections of senators. I have offered the Committee an amendment to fulfil the title of the Bill. If the operation of the Bill is simply to ensure simultaneous elections for the 2 Houses, I suggest that it should be so expressed in the Bill. The suggested amendment simply takes up the title of the Bill and says that if that is the genuine purpose of the Bill, let it be expressed in this clause so that any laws that this Parliament may make under the new power to legislate for the times of the elections of senators shall ensure, as the title says is the object of the Bill, that the elections of the 2 Houses shall be held simultaneously. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I hope that if the Bill is genuinely for the purpose stated, and only that purpose, this amendment will be adopted. If that is the only object of the Bill, and if the amendment were adopted, there would be no need for any other provisions in the Bill which dissolved half the Senate every 3 years. Parliament would have power just to make laws for the times of Senate election, ensuring that those elections were held at the same time as House of Representatives elections. I submit the amendment to the Committee. </para>

          <para>- The Government is not prepared to accept this amendment. As I understand it, the effect of the amendment would be that when a Senate election was held for half the Senate, an election for the House of Representatives would be held at the same time. In other words, the House of Representatives elections would be tied to Senate elections, rather than Senate elections being tied to House of Representatives elections. I understand that that is the object of the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I am not sure whether that is the object of the amendment; that is certainly the effect of it. The terms of senators would remain fixed, as provided already in the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has already asked the Government to postpone clause 2 which deletes the fixed term for senators. Certainly if those fixed terms remain in the Constitution, the only way to give effect to this amendment would be for a House of Representatives election to be held every 3 years at the same time as an election for half the Senate. That amendment would be an absolutely fundamental change in the Constitution. Honourable senators have been talking about profound changes and so on being made to the Constitution by this Bill but if House of Representatives elections must be held at the same time as Senate elections, that is, virtually at fixed times, then we are facing a fundamental change in the Constitution. The whole system of responsible government is founded upon the ability to dissolve the House of Representatives on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day or in the event of some crisis occurring in that chamber. Therefore any tying of elections for the House of Representatives with fixed terms with Senate elections, which is the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment, would be a fundamental change in the Constitution and it is not one which this Government certainly is proposing or would propose. </para>

          <para>- I hesitate to enter into a debate which traditionally is the preserve of lawyers but I think a couple of comments have to be made on what the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> has just said. If this amendment were the only one being proposed his comment would be justified but there are before the Committee in respect of other clauses a number of amendments which are not consistent with the position that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> just put forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> as I understand it, is trying to make the point that the present Bill does not necessarily ensure simultaneous elections, and that is important. He is putting forward an amendment which would ensure simultaneous elections. As I said, if we consider only this clause and only this amendment then the amendment would indeed have the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> has just put forward on behalf of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott).</inline> But that is clearly not the intention of the amendment. There are a number of other amendments which are to be debated. There are some machinery difficulties in taking the Bill clause by clause but it would be quite wrong to suggest that this amendment ought to be rejected because it will have purely the effect suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack.</inline> I think it is important that it be made clear that that is not the intention of the people who will support this amendment. </para>

          <para>- If I may comment on this amendment, I understood that the intention of this amendment is to ensure that elections for both Houses be held at the same time and to write this provision into the Constitution. As I understand the proposal, which is in the original Bill, it is so highly unlikely that the elections would be held at different times in a situation where following the elections the members of the Senate would take their seats at the same time as the members of the House of Representatives. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I suppose one can conceive a crazy situation in which it was decided to have an election for the </para>
        <para class="block">House of Representatives one week and an election for the Senate a week or so later. I imagine that would be most unpopular with the Australian people if it did happen. I think it is so inconceivable that the amendment becomes unnecessary and that in fact the substance of the amendment put forward by the Government in this amending Bill is simultanous elections. Obviously the whole purpose of it is to bring elections for both Houses into line as was the practice years ago. Although this leaves with the Paliament the right to make laws in respect of the date and timing of the elections it is obvious that no Parliament in its right senses would contemplate having anything like a weeks difference or something like that in the holding of the elections. I therefore suggest that the amendment is unnecessary in any event. </para>

          <para>- I think this debate, which is already starting to open up in relation to the matter of amendment to this Bill, requires that we go back and look at the consideration which has been given to the Bill and to the provisions which we have been debating albeit in a somewhat curtailed way. I go back to the 1973 Australian Constitutional Convention and the speech at that Convention by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ivor</inline> Greenwood, the then shadow Attorney-General, the then Opposition or Liberal and Country Party spokesman on matters to do with the law. At that Convention <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> said: </para>

        <para class="block">His argument, and the then Opposition&#39;s argument, was that it should be considered by a committee. Eventually it was referred to a committee.

        <quote>
          <para>The Committee had before it a recommendation that the Constitution be amended to provide for the synchronisation of elections of members of the House of Representatives and Senators. Also before the Committee was a recommendation that the Parliament be empowered to decide whether such elections should be brought into permanent alignment. </para>
          <para>The committee had resolved to defer consideration of these recommendations in light of the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) 1974, which related directly to this matter and for which a referendum was held on 18 May 1974. The committee has subsequently been unable to report on this matter. </para>

            <para>- I should be grateful if my colleague and friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> would allow me to make my own argument, because the next matter to which I was coming was the 1976 Convention. I think that he might at least have given me the credit of recognising that I might deal with the matter sequentially. I had got to the 1975 Convention at which time, I pointed out, Convention Committee D did not consider this matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>In 1976 the most disgraceful performance, to the eternal disgrace of the concept of a Constitutional Convention, took place. What happened when this matter came on was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lionel</inline> Bowen, the Labor Party&#39;s spokesman on matters of law, made a speech in which he did not deal in any way with the effects or potential effects of this proposal on the Senate. He talked about only the aspects of the importance of saving cost or whatever it might be by holding elections for both Houses together. He spoke for some time. The seconder of the motion did not speak to it at all. Then there was some debate on an amendment related to whether State Governors or the Commonwealth should issue the writ. A few bits and pieces were discussed in this somewhat desultory debate on the matter. No consideration was given to the real question of the details of the Bill or to such questions as are raised by the amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> In looking at the Constitutional Convention, to be most generous, approximately 1600 words were spoken in relation to the whole of the matter, other than the question of casual vacancies and the question of who should issue the writs. I repeat: Only approximately 1600 words. In other words, the whole lot, every word spoken in the consideration of this matter by the Convention, could have been reported in 2 columns of a newspaper. That is claimed to be the real consideration and the basis upon which we should accept this Bill be put through the Senate without alteration. It is so full of holes, as will be demonstrated no doubt by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and others during the debate, that it does need proper consideration. It needed it in 1973 and that is why it was referred to a committee. It was never considered by a committee and quite clearly it was never considered by the Constitutional Convention in 1976, other than on the most superficial basis. The Convention considered only those matters which were unrelated to the real issues which we have had raised before this chamber. I just wish to make those points in support of the consideration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment. </para>

          <para>- I wish to intervene to deal with the very extravagant attack on the Constitutional Convention discussion which has just been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> He described it as a disgrace. Apparently it was a disgrace for this subject to be discussed by a Convention at which were present, as I said last night, not only the Prime Minister and other Ministers of the Commonwealth Government but also the Leader of the Opposition and other leading members of the Opposition, together with a number of State Premiers of both political parties and representatives of parties from State parliaments as well. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The motion on simultaneous elections had been circulated well before the Convention commenced. There must have been the fullest opportunity for all of those representative people to consider it. The motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lionel</inline> Bowen at the Convention included a reference to the writs being issued by the Governor-General rather than by the Governor of the State. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Eric</inline> Willis, on behalf of the then Liberal-National Country Party Government of New South Wales, moved an amendment to delete the words &#39;Governor-General &#39;. But that was the only criticism that was made of the substance of the motion during the debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maddison,</inline> who was also a member of the then Liberal-National Country Party Government of New South Wales, supported the amendment. As I have said, representatives of all political parties and all governments in Australia were in attendance at the Convention, and the only dispute that occurred was in relation to the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Eric</inline> Willis. That amendment was carried by 49 votes to 39 votes. If the matter had been exciting the attention of such a group of people to the extent to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> feels that it should have done, I would have thought, for instance, that some major federalist would have spoken against it. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Eric</inline> Willis, for example, must be particularly concerned about the future and the power of the Senate. The Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court, was at the Convention, as was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen.</inline></para>

            <para>-Mr Hamer was there. None of those people were moved to get up and express any criticism whatsoever of the motion. The only exception was the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Eric</inline> Willis, namely, that the motion provided for writs to be issued by the Governor-General. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Eric</inline> moved an amendment to the effect that the writs for a Senate election should be issued by the Governor of the State. That, of course, is preserved in this Bill. A remarkable consensus was revealed on this subject at the Convention. I think it is a grave reflection on a great number of political leaders in Australia to talk about those proceedings as a disgrace. </para>

It has been argued in support of it that the measure before the chamber has not been given adequate consideration over the years. I find it surprising that that allegation should be made by people who now apparently are going to support this amendment. They have given the Opposition no opportunity at all to consider adequately the amendment which they now propose. </para>

            <para>-Well, late last night. But the point remains the same. If one is to consider at this stage the sorts of proposals contained in all of these amendments, I still make the claim that we have not been given adequate notice of them. That could have been done some weeks ago by those people who are concerned about these proposals. The Opposition will not support them. I have indicated that the essential reason why we cannot do so is that we regard them as being unnecessary. I might say that I have some respect for the elegant drafting done by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and the intention behind some of the proposals but that is not sufficient to justify the Opposition in supporting them. </para>

I then waited to hear what he was going to say about the 1976 Constitutional Convention proposal.

        <para class="block">I merely point out that that resolution could not have been more specific.

          <para>- I wish to reply to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said. He said that these amendments had not been circulated until this morning. They were circulated among Opposition members last night and among Government party members as early as Tuesday morning. That is insufficient time, I agree, but that arises from the fact that the proponents of the Bill announced it for the first time last Tuesday is a week ago. Therefore, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said that there should have been a week&#39;s consideration of the amendments he proved our complaint that the Bill has been brought on precipitately, precluding proper consideration. I wish to say- I shall not repeat this in proposing the amendment- that the Bill claims to be a Bill to ensure simultaneous elections. The fact is that this is a Bill to ensure that half the Senate shall be dissolved every time there is a House of Representatives election. It has been made quite clear that the person who decides within the constitutional period of 3 years when a House of Representatives election shall occur is the Prime Minister. Both constitutional writers and practice indicate that there is no real limit upon that man&#39;s judgment to require a dissolution of the House. Therefore, if this Bill goes through he would have the same power to make a request for a dissolution of half the Senate. It is that undermining of the power of the Senate that we find so difficult to reconcile with a true description of this Bill, which is described as one merely to ensure simultaneous elections. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In fact, in operation this is not a Bill for simultaneous elections but a Bill to cause simultaneous dissolutions of the House of Representatives and half the Senate. This amendment will test the proponents of the Bill as to whether the true character is indicated by the caption &#39;simultaneous elections &#39;. The amendment adopts that caption as being true and asks that a provision be inserted in the Bill in terms of my amendment, that is, that elections of senators in all States and Territories shall be held on the same day and at the same time as the elections of the House of Representatives. If this amendment is rejected, I hope that nobody will complain of advocacy that the purpose of the Bill has been misleadingly mis-stated. </para>

If we redebate the second reading we have little chance of giving the amendments proper consideration. </para>

            <para>- The reason I am raising this matter is the very reason that the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs gave for his support for this clause. He said he supported the clause because the Constitutional Convention had endorsed it. That is the only excuse that has been bandied around this chamber for the last 3 days. I am about to bury that red herring because it is beginning to stink. If the reason for us to support this particular clause of the Bill is that the Constitutional Convention endorsed it- </para>

            <para>- All right! The first thing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> said in this debate was that all of these wise men sat down at the Constitutional Convention and carried this proposition. They also carried the proposition to break the nexus between the House of Representatives and the Senate. Why does the Government not come forward with that proposal? That is what the Constitutional Convention decided to do. Honourable senators know the effect that would have on the smaller States. They would be absolutely swamped. Honourable senators also know what such a move would do to this chamber. I support the proposition that was outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in his quite objective and unemotional manner. Although I am not legally qualified- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> is- I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> in commending <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> draftsmanship. It incorporates what I believe the majority of honourable senators want, that is, presumably, simultaneous elections. As I mentioned, from a political point of view I do not mind simultaneous elections because 1 was returned with 2 quotas at a simultaneous election. The point is- </para>

Honourable senators opposite proved that in 1975. All they have to do is refuse to pass Supply every time it comes into this chamber and then they can force the House of Representatives to an election while they sit pat in this place. Why should that be? This chamber should have to go to the people every time it forces the House of Representatives to an election. The people of Australia have to be made aware of the effect of the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> The whole purpose is to preserve the power of the Senate to force the House of Representatives to an election every time there is a Labor Government in that place and it docs not have the numbers in this chamber. </para>

          <para>Subject to this Constitution, the term of service of a senator expires upon the expiration or dissolution of the second House of Representatives to expire or be dissolved after he was chosen or, if there is an earlier dissolution of the Senate, upon that dissolution. </para>

        <para class="block">The present provision in the Constitution is that the term of a senator is for 6 years and that can be abbreviated only by the provisions of section 57, namely a double dissolution. I emphasise the essential safeguards in the double dissolution procedure inasmuch as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> the Minister in charge of the Bill, last night put it forward as enabling dissolution of the Senate almost with as much ease as this Bill does. That indicates a fundamental lack of appreciation of the constitutional safeguard of section 57 which provides that if the House of Representatives sends to the Senate a Bill which fails to pass and after an interval of 3 months the Bill comes again from the House of Representatives and we again fail to pass it, then, and then only, there may be a dissolution of the Senate, accompanied by a simultaneous dissolution of the House of Representatives. It is quite obvious there that the dissolution of the Senate depends upon action within the Senate, action which creates a difference or deadlock with the other place. If, after deliberating for 3 months the other place, the House of Representatives, considers the proposal important enough, it can submit it again to the Senate and if the Senate, by its own action, thinks that the rejection of the measure is so important and rejects it again, it knows full well that it is only just then to argue the issue before the country and have a simultaneous election upon the matter. </para>
        <para>But that is not the end of section 57. If, after the election, the Senate comes back upheld in its stand upon an equal vote in each State with equality of numbers in this chamber, but if Sydney and Melbourne, with their 79 votes out of 125, prevail in the House of Representatives, the Representatives view can be established only if there is a majority in a joint sitting. That is where the relative numbers of the Senate and the House of Representatives become vital. A statement of that position shows how glib and irresponsible it is for any Minister of the Crown to suggest that the facile provisions of this Bill can be equated in any form with section 57. This Bill says that the term of any senator expires not on a fixed time, not after 6 years, but after there have been 2 dissolutions of the House of Representatives. That shows that it is vital to consider the importance of the interval between the 2 dissolutions. </para>
        <para>There are those who say that the Governor-General would not grant a dissolution. In the years 1900 to 1960-1 have not been able to get the later figures- the House of Commons was dissolved on 3 occasions when it had gone more than 5 years, on 2 occasions when it had gone more than 4 years, on 4 occasions when it had lived more than 3 years, on one occasion when it had lived 2 years, on one occasion when it was only one year old and on 4 occasions it did not last for one year.

            <para>-The records for the Federal Parliament since 1900 show that 19 parliaments lasted over 2 years. On looking at the record I should think that they averaged 2 years and 8 months, or something like that. There were 6 occasions when they lasted only between one year and 2 years. On one occasion the Parliament lasted for 7 months. That shows how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin&#39;s</inline> argument yesterday and my argument yesterday apparently completely went over the head of the Minister and the chamber. We pointed out what would happen if the Senate were put in the position of being dissolved at the same time as the House of Representatives is dissolved. The present authority is to the effect that it is almost impossible for the Governor-General to get circumstances in which he can refuse a dissolution if he is advised by the Prime Minister that a dissolution is necessary. He can explore the House to see whether any alternative Prime Minister can get the confidence of the majority of the House. However the Prime Minister, supported by a majority of the House of Representatives, can get a dissolution upon request. That is the modern conclusion of most of the political commentators and that, on long political experiencenot merely the last 3 years- is obviously the danger in this. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Then we come to the great danger that has overtaken Parliament in the last 70 years where the predominance of the Prime Minister over the House of Representatives by reason of the Cabinet system can control the House. We had an example last week <inline font-style="italic">par excellence</inline> where the great majority of members of the Liberal and National Country Parties went with the Prime Minister simply because it was a proposal that had been presented to them by him within the last 12 hours. Few of them had independent judgments. The Prime Minister is enthroned with the Cabinet and is supported by the great bureaucracy with all its knowledge and all its power and all its control of public money. We do not know who that man will be. It was Whitlam a year ago when we feared the situation; it is Fraser today when we have confidence that he will not abuse the situation; but other Whitlams are on the horizon. To put this chamber at the beck and call of the Prime Minister going to Government House to dissolve us whenever he likes- it may be twice within a short interval- is a danger to this House and its structure and strength. Therefore I move amendment No. 5 in the following terms: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>At the end of proposed new sub-section 13(1), addProvided that this sub-section shall have effect only if an interval of not less than one year shall occur between the expiry or dissolution of the first and second House of Representatives referred to in this section. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This amendment will inject into the Bill a medium measure of safeguard to repeated dissolutions of the House of Representatives at the beck and call of the Prime Minister taking with it at the beck and call of the Prime Minister of the day this chamber. I ask that those people who are genuinely concerned for the strength of the Senate to give support to this proposal. </para>

We did not hear any such sentiments from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> or from anyone opposite during the events of October and November of 1 975. </para>

        <para>It is also interesting to find him quoting in support of his argument the practice in the British House of Commons. The contrast between the action of the British monarchy and her Viceroy in Australia is a very startling contrast. The monarch in Britain for more than a century and a half has never presumed to act except on the advice of her Prime Minister. But that unfortunately in recent history is a precedent and tradition that has been torn up by our own Viceroy. It is notorious that the Governor-General disregarded and swept aside the advice of his Prime Minister and ignored a majority decision of the House of Representatives on 11 November. These are events about which we heard no complaints from this sanctimonious <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> But he is not even right about - </para>

            <para>-We will not go into irrelevant details. Let us look at the situation in Australia which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> cited. He suggested that we look at the number of occasions on which the House of Representatives has sat for less than 3 years. He said that, therefore, the Senate periods may be reduced. The argument is very much on the other foot. Why were some of those sittings of the House of Representatives so short? Partly, they were short in order to keep within the provision which applies at the present moment so that there could be simultaneous elections in fact. Before we got .completely out of kilter in 1963, under the present provisions a number of elections were kept as simultaneous elections by dissolving the House of Representatives after a shorter period. In other words, the present provisions have reduced the House of Representatives period. </para>

        <para>One example was given by the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in 1959 in paragraph 238 of its report. The Committee referred to action taken in 1 929 and then to the fact that 2 years later the House of Representatives came to an end. The report stated: </para>

          <para>It was only because the twelfth Parliament was dissolved 2 years later that the next election for senators was able to be held simultaneously with the election for members of the House of Representatives. </para>

        <para class="block">The Joint Committee referred to the premature dissolutions of the House of Representatives just to keep elections simultaneous. Therefore, the figures <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has given are arguments not for his amendment but for the proposal of the Government to bring Senate elections into alignment with House of Representatives elections. So, the argument does not serve him; nor does it suggest that in the future we will have so many of these short terms for the House of Representatives. It is more likely that it will go for the full 3-year term. </para>

          <para>-The Committee is indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> for his remarks which have refuted the argument put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I am indebted to him because he has pointed out to the electorate at large that in order to keep the elections in kilter in years gone by people who had been elected to the House of Representatives on the understanding that they would have a 3-year term in most cases had their term of office cut short. Much was said here yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> and again today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to the effect that senators, having been elected to this place, should be assured that they can see out their term of office of 6 years.

        </talk.start>
        <para>I instance my own case and that of many other senators who are in this chamber now and who were elected at the 1970 elections. We went on the payroll on 1 July 1971, and our term of office should not have expired until 30 June this year. I will cite my own case. There are many others the same. I have had to face 2 elections since taking my place, and as yet I have not served 6 years in this Parliament. Why did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> in 1974 and 1975 not try to preserve the rights of those citizens elected to this Parliament at the 1970 elections? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> did not do so because of expediency.  His  sole purpose in not trying to preserve those rights at that time was to unload the Whitlam Government. That is what he wanted to do. He wanted to use this chamber as a bludgeon to get rid of the Labor Government. That is the whole purpose of his now trying to defeat the referendum proposal put forward by his Government. He is criticising his own Government. Over the years we have heard from his side of the chamber of divisions in the Australian Labor Party, but never have there been divisions in the Labor Party such as we are witnessing in this chamber this week between 1 1 honourable senators opposite and their elected leader. What I have said is the whole reason why honourable senators opposite are trying to build a case to oppose this referendum proposal. I am sure that if the electorate at large is properly informed of the real reasons behind their opposition to it it will pass the proposal with an overwhelming majority. </para>
        <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">CHAIRMAN (Senator Drake-Brockman)</inline> Order! I draw the Committee&#39;s attention to the point of order taken a little while ago about honourable senators making speeches more applicable to the second reading stage and not directing their remarks to the clause concerned. The Chair has great difficulty because the Committee is dealing with a clause that proposes to insert a new sub-section 13 (1) dealing with the term of service of senators. I have to allow a little latitude, but I ask all honourable senators to try to assist me so that we can get through the program this afternoon. </para>

At no stage did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> say that senators should all serve their 6-year term. The amendment specifically says that should the Senate reject or fail to pass a proposed law already passed by the House of Representatives it can be called on by the Prime Minister to face the people. At no stage did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> say senators must serve their 6 years. It is just ridiculous for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> to put words into <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> mouth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland also tried to put other words into <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> mouth. At no stage did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> say that a Governor-General would at all times take the advice of the Government. He just said that should the Prime Minister seek to go to the people the Governor-General would abide by that decision. In point of fact, in 1975 we had just that position. The Governor-General would have been pleased if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> at that stage had wanted to go to the people. Because he refused to go to the people, the Governor-General eventually insisted that he do so. </para>

        <para>The proposed amendment points out exactly what the main crux of my objection to the legislation is. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> figures prove that four times a government in the House of Commons has served for less than 12 months. As I said yesterday, it is highly unlikely that this would happen in our country, but it was highly unlikely also that any government would attempt to deceive the Loan Council and attempt to deceive the Governor-General. </para>

            <para>-Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman.</inline> This amendment does stop complete manipulation of the Senate by the Prime Minister of the day. It cannot be just for some disharmony in the lower House, the House of Representatives, that he calls the whole of the Senate out along with him. The Senate must first reject some proposed law- its rejection of that proposed law surely will show the colours of the government, the type of legislation it is prepared to have passed and the type of legislation that this chamber is prepared to knock back-before the Senate is taken to the people. I support the amendment. </para>

            <para>- We can argue about that. However, for reasons which could occur from time to time as a result of political crises sometimes the House of Representatives would be dissolved in less than a year and if in such cases half the Senate were not dissolved at that time the 2 Houses would be out of kilter and we would have for a long period ahead the sorts of problems which we had between 1963 and 1972. The basic political argument is why should the Senate be brought out if there is a crisis in the House of Representatives. The fact is that the Senate is part of the political system in the country and if there is a political crisis in the House of Representatives obviously the Senate will be effected by it. Honourable senators, as members of Parliament, as members of political parties and as members of the community will be part and parcel of that political crisis. Obviously such a crisis would be due to some political instability at the time, some major division not only in the Parliament but also in the general community, and the Government&#39;s view is that in those circumstances the Senate should not be immune from participating in the resolution of that crisis by the electors. </para>

          <para>- I support this amendment because I feel that it will improve the legislation proposed by the Government. I fully support the legislation and wish to make that clear. I am conscious of the fact that consideration is being given to this legislation today as a result of a determination by the Constitutional Convention at which representatives of the 3 tiers of government throughout Australia, irrespective of party affiliations, were present. At the same time I am aware that Australians are sick of too many elections. I felt a lot of concern about certain comments made in the debate yesterday and the day before. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said that he was very pleased that perhaps this legislation would erode some of the powers of the Senate. Last night, after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> had said that one of the great aspects of the Senate was that it was a States&#39; House with equal representation of the States irrespective of population, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland asked: &#39;Why should that be so&#39;. I am concerned that there is in the legislation a risk that we could be at the whim of an executive which took control. If there is this risk and when one hears the attitudes of the Opposition which is opposed to the Senate, one must express concern as I am doing. </para>

        <para>I feel that it is a good idea to have this provision for a 12 months period between elections because it puts a stay on the executive for those 12 months and gives some protection to the Senate. Whilst I support the concept of simultaneous elections I feel that this provision for a stay of 12 months is a good safety provision and I support the amendment. </para>

          <para>- The Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> has not answered the query that I raised in addressing myself to the previous clause. In attempting to amend the Constitution to provide for simultaneous elections, why has the Government, either deliberately or unwittingly, got out of kilter the writs for those elections? The Committee is dealing with clause 4, which seeks to alter section 12 of the Constitution to provide <inline font-style="italic">inter aiia</inline> that the writs shall be issued within 14 days from the date on which the places to be filled become vacant. In the current provisions of the Constitution the period is 10 days, and I do not know if the Minister has any explanation for that. To save the time of the Committee, I would be happy if the Minister could explain it now and then I will raise a couple of other points. </para>

          <para>- I have been waiting for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> to raise this matter. I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> was going to raise this matter at the conclusion of the debate on the amendment. The reason for the new provision is that the Constitution has always provided that the writs are to be issued by the Governors of the States rather than by the Governor-General. The Constitutional Convention debated this matter and, as I have said, took the view that the writs should be issued by the Governors of the States. The provision of additional time, extended from 10 days to 14 days, is simply to enable all the Governors to be advised of the need to issue the writs. There is no danger that that will not happen because the new sub-section (2) provides that the writs shall be issued. The Governors of the States cannot refuse to issue them. The arrangement has worked perfectly satisfactorily for 76 years, and the Government does not see any danger in leaving it as it is. </para>

          <para>- I want to comment on the matters raised in the recent debate by saying that, if one looks at some examples of what might possibly occur, bearing in mind what has happened in Australian politics in the past, and at the sorts of things which might precipitate a House of Representatives election, one would have to agree that to have this absolute provision in the Constitution is undesirable. There have been splits in political parties in Australia. For example, in the 1950s the Labor Party split into 2 parties and in the 1960s the Liberal Party in South Australia split into 2 parties. In that situation, for example, if a government fell because it had simply lost its majority in the House of Representatives and the Parliament had to be dissolved, it seems to be axiomatic that there ought also to be an election for the Senate so that the voters would have an opportunity to have the representation in this chamber reflect the new political alignments which had occurred. If that were not possible and if there were a long period where old political alignments which were no longer relevant in any sense to the political life of the country were persisted with in the Senate, I think this chamber would be a very odd animal indeed. It would simply not be workable in such circumstances. I believe that other circumstances could easily be predicted where the Senate would not be workable. I think that this amendment simply cannot be supported. It would tie us down to a quite intolerable situation in some circumstances. </para>

          <para>-The speciousness of the argument just put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> is seen in the fact that what he was talking about was this chamber reflecting the new political attitude as a result of a changed allegiance or structure in the political party system in Australia following a split. To achieve that there would need to be a double dissolution. We are talking about a half Senate election. I simply make that comment in relation to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said and leave it at that. The real question with which we are concerned is the power to dissolve this chamber. I want to bring the Committee back to that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has made it patently obvious that he has not got to first base in understanding that. Whilst I do not suggest for a moment that the Minister for Veterans &#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> does not understand, I am still waiting to hear what he has to say about this aspect of it, the real issue. The matter was debated in 1973, 1974 and 1975 so vigorously, so regularly and so convincingly by members of the Liberal and National Country Party- and we won a referendum- but still we cannot get a solitary word as to what it is that has made the 180 degrees about face either necessary or desirable. </para>

        <para>The Constitutional Convention did not discuss this proposal in any detail. It does not matter how many people were at the Convention nor who they were, the fact is that the matter was not discussed. Hundreds and hundreds of pages of debate have been recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on this matter in 3 years. Numerous people who were at that Constitutional Convention had participated in debates on this matter in both of the Houses during those years. Issues were raised and considered in those debates. Firm attitudes were taken by various Liberal and National Country Party members. Yet the only conclusion one can reach is that when the matter came on at the Constitutional Convention, by some strange form of osmosis there was a transmutation between the thoughts of the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal and National Country Party and there was no necessity for any debate whatever even to explain to anybody- for anybody even to raise a question- about all the things that had been put up in the preceding 3 years. I simply repeat, let us get back to the real issue, the one that concerned people previously and the one that still concerns us- the question of the transference to the executive of the day of the power to dissolve this chamber, without confrontation, without deadlock and without good reason, and what that would do to the strength and independence of this chamber. They are the questions. Those problems could be alleviated somewhat by the proposal put forward in the proposed amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I should like to hear some debate on that real issue instead of some statements saying that the Constitutional Convention said something ought to be done. The Constitutional Convention did not debate it, its committee did not consider it and- </para>

            <para>- I put up arguments other than that the Constitutional Convention had agreed to this proposal. We are not just promoting that reason. We have good reasons for the proposal. I summarise them again: They include the convenience and practicality of not having elections for half the Senate separate from the election for the House of Representatives so that a situation arises in which there is an election for the national Parliament roughly every 18 months. This is a situation which occurred between 1963 and 1972 when no less than 7 elections for the national Parliament or some part of it were held in a period of 9 years. That is the sort of situation that develops when elections for the House of Representatives and half the Senate get out of kilter as occurred in 1963. I think everybody agrees that is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. Speakers in the debate last night did not deny the desirability of having simultaneous elections and everybody&#39;s preference for them. Most of all, they did not deny the electors&#39; preference for them. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Of course, the other subsidiary reason why we should have simultaneous elections is the added cost of having additional elections which amount to an extra cost of approximately $5m every 3 years. Those are the basic reasons which I advance to support the Government&#39;s view and the reasons why it is bringing forward this measure. The only argument against it is the one that was put forward in the debate last night, namely, whether the legislation will weaken the Senate. I have my reasons for not believing that it <inline font-style="italic">will</inline> weaken the Senate. I have not heard reasons here today, as I have not heard them for the last 3 days of this week on which we have been debating the subject, as to why it will weaken the Senate. </para>

          <para>-We have been asked not to indulge in second reading speeches. The Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> has replied to a thoughtful contribution to the debate by saying that he has not understood the opposition to the Bill and by repeating, I think in a misleading fashion, some of the figures that were cited by him last night. This idea that there must be 7 elections in the next 9 years is completely false. All members of the Liberal Party of Australia, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> said to a man 2 years ago that this alteration to the Constitution was unnecessary to achieve simultaneous elections. It only requires the House of Representatives to have a premature dissolution to synchronise its elections with the Senate at a time stipulated by the Constitution. But it is completely misleading to put that forward as necessitating an undue number of elections in the next 9 years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland injected into the debate a discussion about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr&#39;s attitude to the dissolution in 1975. 1 beg to point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr was concerned with a Prime Minister who was refusing to recommend a dissolution. It was a question as to whether the Governor-General had power to ask for a new Prime Minister who would recommend a dissolution so as to enable an election to take place to avoid mal-administration and to ensure that the Government could get parliamentary funds to carry on. </para>

            <para>-That is quite right. That shows that the Minister has not yet understood the position that under this legislation it is within the decision of the Prime Minister, who is the creature mainly of the majority from Sydney and Melbourne, in practical politics, to go through the form of asking the Governor-General for the dissolution. It is for the Prime Minister, who is the elected nominee of the majority from Sydney and Melbourne, to advise the Governor-General that an election is required and to send half this Senate to the people. That is entirely inconsistent with the previous Constitution and should not be altered without a deliberate understanding. The Minister professes that he has not accepted the understanding himself; whether he agrees with it is another thing. But the danger to this Senate is that the Prime Minister, who will be elected substantially by votes from Sydney and Melbourne, will have power to dissolve half the Senate. All those arguments to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> cling for the purpose of supporting this Bill, saying that our security is in equal numbers go by the board. It does not matter whether there are equal numbers for each State if Sydney and Melbourne can dissolve half the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I wish to gain clarification on a minor matter in relation to the issue of the writs. I pointed out that the provision seeks to change the period within which the writs can be issued. At the present time section 32 of the Constitution provides that the writs for the House of Representatives must be issued within 10 days from the expiry of the House of Representatives or from the proclamation of a dissolution thereof. Currently under the Constitution also, the writs for the Senate must be issued within 10 days. The position now, if I understand it correctly, is that in the proposed legislation the date of expiry will be the same. In other words, so far as the Senate is concerned, the expiry date will be the expiry date of the House of Representatives. Currently, it will be on the third anniversary of the first sitting which, in normal circumstances, would be a Tuesday. Currently, of course, the writs for the House of Representatives can be issued within 10 days and the polling day, as well as the return of the writs, depends on the date of the issue of the writs. Theoretically, the writs can be issued on the Saturday following the Tuesday expiry date for the House of Representatives and the writs for the Senate can be issued on the following Saturday. Can the Minister give an undertaking to the Committee whether, under this legislation, it is entirely impossible for the elections to be held at separate times, on one Saturday following the other. </para>

            <para>- It has happened under the electoral laws. What is important is not so much the date on which the writs are issued but what is contained in the writs- what the writs say about the polling date, the date for the return of the writs and so on. An election is not something that just happens on a particular day. It is a process which involves nominations, the issue of writs/the polls, the return of the writs and so on. It is something that takes place over a period of months. All these tilings do not necessarily have to take place at the same time but obviously from a practical point of view everybody tries to achieve concurrence particularly on the polling day itself. I see- and the Government sees- no reason why we would not be able to achieve concurrence on the polling day for both the Senate and the House of Representatives including such things as the return of the writs and so on as has been achieved in earlier years. There could be an exception when, as I have said, for a particular reason a poll could not take place on the particular day in a particular place and it may have to be postponed. But broadly speaking and as a practical matter this Bill together with the supplementary legislation that is contemplated will achieve simultaneous elections. </para>

Despite what has been said by my colleagues in attempting to rebut those of us who have objections to this measure, I still hold firmly to the view that the dangers inherent in it are as real today as they were m 1975 when members of the Liberal and National Country parties in this chamber displayed their total opposition to it. Together with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and other honourable senators who have supported him, I do not oppose the principle of simultaneous elections as such. However, we do object to and see grave consequences in the adoption of that principle providing any Prime Minister or Executive with unbridled power indiscriminately to dissolve the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> sees no threat at all in this measure and he has indicated his confidence that a future government is not likely to use that power. I do not share his confidence that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> would not take the Senate to the people at frequent intervals if he could see that by doing so it would enhance his chances of abolishing the Senate and of socialising Australia. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I would not be confident also that a Prime Minister of the character of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe,</inline> who is  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, would not use that power to achieve his goal of abolishing this House. He has admitted that he is in this place only to witness the abolition of this chamber. If I were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> I would not be confident either if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> by some horrific turn of fate, became Prime Minister, because he has the same objective. Only last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> revealed by way of interjection his view that the sooner we are rid of this place the better, or words to that effect. </para>
        <para>The amendment I propose is based on the Constitution Act of South Australia, although modified in the hope that the Government would be prepared to compromise and accept my amendment as a reasonable proposition. The amendment seeks to provide for a minimum interval of 18 months between simultaneous elections. I would really like to see a longer period provided for because I feel that it is quite wrong, in the concept of the Senate, that if the House of Representatives should go to the people purely for the purpose of gaining a political advantage it could force half the Senate out at the same time. For the benefit of the Committee I shall read parts of the proposed new section which I wish to amend. </para>
        <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">CHAIRMAN (Senator Drake-Brockman)</inline> Order! The Committee is about to suspend its sitting for the lunch break. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> you have circulated an amendment which is not in the recognised form and I suggest that during the lunch period you might re-word your amendment so that it meets the requirements of the Committee. I understand that it has been agreed on both sides of the House that the Committee should resume at 2 p.m. instead of 2. 1 5 p.m. </para>

          <para>- I rise to support the amendment of my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> because I believe that we who are now opposing these measures are being consistent in our stand. We took a similar stand when the former Government proposed the same type of measure. The people of Australia who supported us when we voted against the proposal at that time can see that we are being consistent. Therefore, it is appropriate that I stand firm on this matter and support my colleague. We have opposed these measures in a number of ways. I and my colleagues are saddened that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendments were not accepted by the Government. I hope that the Government will now see fit to accept what we are now proposing. It was a lesson to all of us here today when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> brought to our attention some of the facts concerning what has happened in the past. My concern with what is happening now is that power will be put into the hands of a Prime Minister so that he will be able to take this chamber to the people whenever he sees fit to do so. This has been proved conclusively. On 5 occasions since 1914a Prime Minister was able to take the House of Representatives to the people in under 2 years of the life of the parliament of the day. </para>

        <para>I do not think that anyone in this chamber or in Australia would be naive enough to believe that the only reason why that was done was that the Prime Minister of the time wanted to bring the elections for the 2 Houses together. I certainly am not naive enough to believe that I am not naive enough to believe that that would be the reason in the future. I have strong feelings about this measure and I am standing in my place to support the amendment proposed by my colleage <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop.</inline></para>

          <para>-The Opposition will oppose this amendment. In speaking in the second reading debate on this Bill we expressed the view that one of the advantages of the simultaneous elections provision would be that this chamber would more adequately reflect at a more recent date the views of the electors. There was some discussion in the course of the debate about situations which arose in which honourable senators elected anything up to 5 years previously acted to effectively obstruct or dismiss the House of Representatives. We regard the amendment as unnecessary and unreal. It reflects a chronic anxiety state in the mover, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> rather than any real need for amendment to the Bill before the Committee. </para>

          <para>-The Government opposes the amendment for the same reasons as I gave when opposing the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> This amendment has the same effect except that it provides a guaranteed term of 18 months after a conjoint election between the House of Representatives and the Senate, whether it be a half Senate election or a double dissolution, whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment guaranteed 12 months. I gave the reasons for our opposition to the guarantee of 12 months. Naturally, we would be opposed to a guarantee of a longer period which, in this case, would be 18 months. Briefly, the objection is that the acceptance of this amendment, as with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment, would mean that in some circumstances the 2 Houses would get out of kilter and simultaneous elections would not be able to be ensured. In that respect, the amendment seems to the Government to be quite contrary to the purpose of the Bill. </para>

          <para>-Whilst I can see and have at all times accepted the argument in favour of the convenience and the reduction in cost of holding simultaneous elections, that makes simultaneous elections desirable but not essential. I, therefore, ask again that people reconsider the instances where they are prepared to say that elections must be held simultaneously or the instances where they are prepared to take a stand and make simultaneous elections as practicable as they can without making simultaneous elections absolutely essential. One must go back to the real issue. That is: Should a Prime Ministerany Prime Minister, of whatever party- the chief of the executive government, be able to take half of the Senate to an election at his whim and at any time that he choses, as opposed to at any time that the actions of that chamber have lead to a deadlock or confrontation? </para>

        <para>To take a totally cynical view, as I think was mentioned during the second reading debate on this Bill, in 1973 it would have been perfectly possible for the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> with a relatively high state of euphoria after opening the Treasury doors and spending the money that had been accumulated for quite some time by careful and good economic management, to have obtained a majority in the Senate had this proposed legislation been in force. At that time he had a good deal of community support. He did not have a majority in the Senate, but if this proposal had existed in the legislation he very easily could have obtained a majority by the arbitrary exercise of the power which this Bill proposes to give a Prime Minister. </para>

            <para>- May I finish without interruption? Then, if the honourable senator wishes to interrupt, by all means let him. I am saying that this decision should not be made at the whim of the Executive without there having been some basis of confrontation or deadlock between the Houses. The situation of confrontation or deadlock is provided for already in section 57 of the Constitution, relating to double dissolution. My short answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland s point is that the Senate cannot in any way nominate the day on which the House of Representatives will go to an election. Not in any way can it do that. What it can do is to get into a deadlock situation which has to be resolved in compliance with certain procedures set out in the Constitution. This Bill proposes to give an entirely different power to the House of Representatives or to the chief of the executive in that House. Entirely at their whim- as early as they like or after a matter of months- they can nominate a day for an election. It may be, as has been indicated by other speakers, that there are other reasons that will cause that power to be exercised which are nothing to do with the Senate. They can be related to internal disputes in the House of Representatives or in the government party there. They can be related to things which are nothing to do with the position or actions of the Senate within the Parliament. </para>

        <para>I am asking for consistency. I am saying that until such time as we have had a fully reasoned debate about the proper role of the Senate and have come up with some reasoned decisions as to what that role should be, let us not destroy the Senate by stealth. I believe that the action being taken does effectively destroy the Senate by stealth by giving to the executive government of the day the power to be able to make threats to a Senate, however innocent that Senate may be in its actions. This proposal gives power to the Executive Government to change the balance of power in the Senate by its own whim. There are a number of other things which in the Committee stage I cannot debate in detail. I get back to the essential reason why I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop&#39;s</inline> amendment. There should be some limit of time to prevent arbitrary action of the Executive. As a matter of fact I do not particularly like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop&#39;s</inline> amendment. I just think it is better than what is proposed in the Bill. I do not think the Executive at its whim ought to be able to take out half the Senate between 18 months and 3 years of its term. </para>
        <para>I do not know what the answer is. I would have liked the Constitutional Convention to have a proper debate about these matters, these real issues, that are raised here. Had a committee of the Constitutional Convention discussed this matter, considered it properly and come up with a reasoned view we may have had some basis upon which we could consider it. At the moment all we are given is this totally superficial reason of cost and convenience and the fact that the Constitutional Convention discussed it. We know that the Constitutional Convention did not discuss it all. Anyone who looks at the transcript of the Constitutional Convention will see perfectly clearly that the matter was never given any consideration by that body. </para>

          <para>- The main inconsistencies rest in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> arguments. He has said and reiterated a number of times during his speech that one of the greatest evils is that this House may be a reflection of the public opinion exhibited in the lower House. Yet within 18 months he voted twice for double dissolutions which, of course, are the extreme example of getting the same thought in this House as in the lower House. The honourable senator&#39;s practical vote in this House is just the opposite of the argument he has just now put to the Senate. Nothing will give a better result of the Senate being a rubber stamp of the lower House than a double dissolution. The honourable senator has avidly supported that concept. I go not into the merits of doing so; at the moment I just say that he has. He has ensured on 2 occasions that this House is a rubber stamp of the lower House, and that was the exact result of the elections. </para>

A further point is that the amendment would give the Senate the right without any penalty to do what it liked for 18 months.

            <para>- We will rest on that. The thought uppermost in the minds of those who are supporting the amendments in opposition to these referenda is that all the base political motives exist in the lower House and all the noble motives exist here. That may be a view of ourselves at this moment. I will not argue with that point. It is quite easy to visualise a future Senate being composed of people who will deliberately interrupt the good government of Australia. No one can say that cannot happen. </para>

            <para>- I am not going into the past nor will I comment on present individuals. We know that in future at some important occasion in this nation&#39;s life that will happen. Apparently we will deny by this amendment and our general attitude the right of a leader of an executive government to get the Senate to face the people on the issue on which it is obstructive. Why should not an executive government ask for an endorsement of its policies? If it is wrong, the Senate will be proved right by the vote. The only thing that I can see that will satisfy the opponents of this sensible measure is lifetime appointment to the Senate, and that I would oppose. That is the tenor of what they want. They say that the Senate is right and always will be right and that executive government is the enemy of Australia. That is about the only major aspect of the argument they are putting. I contend that is the opposite of the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> twice voted for a procedure which makes this House a rubber stamp. Yet he argues that it is the worst vice of the referendum. I believe his argument fails on that point. </para>

Then he said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> &#39;s amendment would enable the Senate to do just what it liked for 1 8 months. That is demonstrably false. Only a person infantile in the constitutional interpretation of this Federation could put it forward. Section 57 has always provided that if a proposal is rejected by the Senate and, after an interval of 3 months, it rejected again, the executive government can advise a double dissolution and can go to the country. It would be absurd- it amazes me that the proposition can be put forward- that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> &#39;s amendment should remove from the Constitution that provision. </para>
        <para>Compressing myself to the utmost brevity, the last thing is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall sits down with the false misrepresentation of the motives, purposes and arguments of us who oppose these constitutional alterations, saying that we are seeking lifetime appointments.

          <para>-I am surprised that senators from the small States, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall comes into that category, are opposing this amendment. It has been pointed out today that by what is proposed a Prime Minister will be able to take the States House to the people along with himself. He already has great power in the House of Representatives through the large vote available from New South Wales and Victoria. Let us remember that the combined vote of the representatives of New South Wales and Victoria is 79 while that of the small States is 45. What would happen if a Bill is put forward which is detrimental to one of the small States? Take Tasmania, where we have only 5 voices in the House of Representatives. If that State&#39;s vote were defeated a Bill could be passed which would be detrimental to our small State. What happens if the Senate is taken to the people a short time after election? The Prime Minister primarily is elected by the 2 largest States and he would have power over this States&#39; House. He could determine when this House should face the people and I believe that this is one of the points that should be considered in this amendment. </para>

            <para>-Well, to my mind last night is short notice and it is short notice to the mind of any other sensible person. We know that at the Constitutional Convention considerable time was available to consider this matter and a definite recommendation was put. That recommendation is before the Senate. The amendment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> moved has been criticised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall and I rose to support that view. If one looks at this amendment one cannot be absolutely certain what its effect will be. It is quite specific in its terms, however. It says that in the case of a senator holding office at the commencement of this section, whose term of office expires in 1978, the term of office shall expire upon the expiration or dissolution of the House after he has held office under that term for 18 months. If he has to hold office until 1 98 1 it shall expire after 3 years. I think it is a very reasonable conclusion to say that that probably is an infringement and a restriction which would be imposed upon the opportunity to have double dissolutions under section 57 which bring senators to an election before their time. If that means what it says a senator shall have an assured office for 18 months if he is a short term senator and 3 years if he is a long term senator. Therefore, as a recent amendment of the Constitution, surely it will cut across the ability to have a double dissolution. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>That is my interpretation of this amendment. I believe it to be correct. The amendment has not been examined thoroughly enough to enable one to say whether or not that interpretation is correct. But that is my honest belief. I would not for one moment support an amendment like that when we have before us a specific recommendation that has been known and discussed for some years and which makes sense. This amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> &#39;s is highly dangerous and possibly interferes with the existing provisions of the Constitution. </para>

          <para>- I do not want to lengthen the debate; I want only to say a few words. It would seem to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is under some misapprehension as to just what I said earlier. To make my position clear to him I say that in general terms I would view his position on this and his advocacy of the supremacy of the Senate in the form in which he wants it, as such that his priorities are ordered. The number one priority for him is the retention of the present powers of the Senate; and the number 2 priority is what is good for the public and for the good of government in Australia. I have seen this position held adamantly by other people in another upper house in another place. It is something that is ingrained after a number of years in some people and is honourably held. But I believe it is a very mistaken view. It is one which greatly harms the evolution of a parliamentary system to suit the population which itself changes over the decades. But I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that that is as I view his position, shorn of details:  His  number one priority is the Senate; his number 2 is the people of Australia. </para>

          <para>-The whole thrust of the argument being put forward by the senators who instigated and supported this amendment is that they object to the Prime Minister in the other place having the right to bring this House to the people. They then retain for themselves the right to send the House of Representatives to the people at anytime they wish. As I said earlier today when I was talking to this clause, if this Senate so desired the House of Representatives could be sent to the people every 6 months. Every time a Supply Bill was introduced the Senate could send the House of Representatives to the people. But the Senate itself would not have to go to the people. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline>in reply to my remarks said that I had not got to first base and tried to confuse my statement with the argument relating to a double dissolution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> would well know that if Bills to lay the foundation for a double dissolution had not existed, when the Senate refused Supply in 1975 the only House that would have gone to the people would have been the House of Representatives and there would have been no grounds for a double dissolution. That is the very right that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae, Senator Wright, Senator Jessop</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> are now trying to preserve for themselves. They are attempting to place this place in a position of very high importance in the eyes of the people. </para>
        <para>I think it is clear from the number of people who have been in the public gallery today that the public of Australia does not place much importance on this House. We have been debating this measure for 3 days and we have been on the air for 2 days out of the three. How many people have been in the gallery to take an interest in what is going on? The majority of people in this country do not even know that the </para>

        <para class="block">It will be remembered that the present safeguard of the Senate against premature dissolution in section 57 is a time factor of 3 months with which we dealt on the 2 previous amendments that were negatived by this Committee; but the other factor is that we seek to ensure that the dissolution follows only from a difference with the House of Representatives. In other words, we seek to make it clear that the Senate shall not be dissolved because of some internal squabble in the House of Representatives. </para>
        <para>Therefore, my proposal is that the new provision contained in the Bill should apply provided that it &#39;shall have effect only if the Senate has rejected or failed to pass a proposed law already passed by the House of Representatives&#39;. </para>
        <para>That would make the concession to the Government that one refusal to pass a proposed law already passed by the House of Representatives would give the House of Representatives the right to call a half Senate election. At present such a proposed law has to be rejected twice, with an interval of 3 months. Surely anyone who does not agree with that proposition is out to destroy the Senate utterly. I remind the Committee that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> in the course of the second reading debate, said:  . . and we - that is the Australian Labor Party- do have a very strong view that the powers of the Senate should be delimited at every opportunity. These are the basic reasons why we will be supporting the legislation. </para>
        <para class="block">The next amendment provides that the new provision &#39;shall have effect only if the Senate has within the preceding period of one month rejected or failed to pass a proposed law already passed by the House of Representatives imposing taxation or appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government&#39;. I need not recall it to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> but for the sake of clarity it should be understood that that is an endeavour to bring to attention of the Government the significance of the Bills that this Senate may reject but may not amend. If the Senate rejects a Bill that it may not amendnamely, one imposing taxation or one appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government- this amendment would give the Government the immediate right to dissolve the House of Representatives and half the Senate. </para>
        <para>The final amendment is a variant of that and states that the new sub-section proposed by the Government &#39;shall have effect only if the Senate has within the preceding period of one month rejected or failed to pass a proposed law already passed by the House of Representatives imposing taxation or appropriating revenue or moneys&#39;. It will be seen that we have endeavoured to accommodate ourselves to the legislation being steamrollered through the Parliament by taking up the significance of money Bills, so called. Realising that the Constitution gives the Senate the power to reject them as well as any other Bill but to amend only such money Bills as impose taxation or appropriate moneys for ordinary annual services as distinct from Apopropriation Bills that appropriate money for capital works, that brings to the attention of the Senate the significance of these money Bills. One amendment proposes a half dissolution of the Senate if the Senate rejects a non-amendable Bill. Another proposes a half Senate election if the Senate rejects any money Bill in the sense that I have indicated. </para>
        <para>Unless the Government is intent upon adopting the strong view of the Australian Labor Party, as put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> that the powers of the Senate should be delimited at every opportunity, which is the basic reason the Opposition is supporting the legislation, there is no intelligible reason why any one of these amendments should be refused. </para>

          <para>- It is quite obvious that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> deliberately tried to confuse the issue and to misrepresent me when she quoted section 57 of the Constitution. She talked about the Senate refusing to pass legislation or not having the right to amend certain legislation and that if it does a double dissolution can be held. What I was saying was that the Senate has the power in regard to Supply, and that the coalition parties exercised that power in 1975 when they would not even vote on the Bill. For that reason they were able to force the properly elected Government to the people, and they will still have the right to do that if this amendment is carried. That is the whole purpose in what honourable senators who are supporting this amendment are trying to do. It is no good quoting the Constitution in part and trying to fool the people outside. The more they talk about it the more those honourable senators confuse themselves. They will never extricate themselves from the argument they are trying to put forward to fool the people. As I have said, the whole purpose of their exercise in moving this amendment is to retain in this place the right to sack a Prime Minister, yet they do not want to give him the right to bring out the Senate at the same time. That is the whole purpose of this exercise. </para>

            <para>- Will the honourable senator listen to me? The situation could arise, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has pointed out, that the Senate should choose to refuse Supply. It gets that opportunity every 6 months. That situation could arise where there was no stockpiling of Bills to satisfy the provisions of section 57. As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick, in a decision which he gave a month before he told the Governor-General that he could do what he did, said precisely that it was not possible to stockpile Bills for the purpose of having a double dissolution when it suited a government. A situation could easily arise where there was no section 57 situation, but if what the Governor-General did in November 1975 is good law then the Senate does get the opportunity twice a year to dictate to the House of Representatives that it shall go to the electors, and not necessarily go itself. If the honourable senator asks some authorities she will be told that that is the case. </para>

          <para>-I would not have risen but for the fact that 2 Labor speakers have purported to answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters.</inline> I draw the attention of the Committee to the actual proposal before it, which is to the effect that this automatic half Senate dissolution incorporated by the Government&#39;s proposed new clause should take effect only if the Senate has rejected or failed to pass a proposed lawany proposed law- already passed by the House of Representatives. That completely gives the go-by to all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland have said. The effect of this amendment is to enable the government of the day, if it has had a measure rejected in the Senate which has been passed by the House of Representatives, to operate this Bill and have a half Senate election and a House of Representatives election at the same time. It can do that at any time that the Senate rejects any measure that has already been passed by the House of Representatives. </para>

          <para>-I was going to point out what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has already pointed out, namely, that apparently some of the people who commented before were not precisely certain what amendment was being discussed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> obviously was not certain because she was talking about the double dissolution provisions of section 57 of the Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has correctly pointed out that these amendments deal with something additional to that. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In effect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> said that it is perfectly reasonable that the Senate at any time of its choosing should be able to force an election in the House of Representatives and have half the Senate go to the polls. If it is perfectly reasonable that the Senate should be able to precipitate an election, surely it is perfectly reasonable that the entire Senate face the electors and be judged on its actions. Apart from that important objection to the amendments that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has moved, it is apparent, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has said, that the amendments have a number of technical defects, not the least of which would be that if they were to be accepted- of course they will not be; they will be thrown out as they deserve to be- conceivably there would be no provision determining the term of a senator or when the term of a senator would expire. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> obfuscation of a couple of hours ago drew attention to the fact that he does not know the answer to this aspect. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline>touched on the fact that many people, almost all of them on the conservative side I think, who are elected to this Senate appear to acquire delusions of grandeur about the Senate&#39;s importance and their importance as senators. I think there is an underlying reason for this. It is a well known fact that a position in the Senate, as I mentioned yesterday, is a compensation or a consolation prize awarded by parties to people who cannot win seats in the House of Representatives or a sinecure for superannuated party hacks of which several examples can normally be found on the other side of the chamber. </para>

          <para>- I have not spoken on these amendments on behalf of the Government. Unfortunately most of the debate on them has been irrelevant. The specific amendment being considered certainly goes a long way to meeting the problems and would provide for the situation where the Senate, by its action, precipitates a political conflict or crisis between the Houses. However the amendment does not ensure simultaneous elections occur at all times. If there is a situation where it is necessary for half the Senate to go to an election and there is not a rejection or failure to pass any proposed law submitted to the Senate by the House of Representatives of course according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment there would not be a situation in which simultaneous elections would be possible. This situation is particularly likely to arise under our Constitution, as we discovered with the provisions relating to a double dissolution. After a double dissolution, because of the peculiarities of the Constitution as to when the terms of senators start, the 2 Houses get out of kilter. This amendment would not get over that problem. I come back to the point I have been making over and over again: This Bill is designed to ensure that there will be simultaneous elections to avoid the excessive number of elections that have been occurring over the last 10 years or so in the national Parliament. That is the purpose of the Bill. This amendment will qualify seriously the purpose of the Bill. For that reason the Government must oppose it. </para>

        <para class="block">I have circulated the amendment to honourable senators. The title of the Bill, which was branded as a fraud and was stated in 1975 to be an exercise in deception by the party to which I belong is reprinted in this Bill. It states that the title is to alter the Constitution so as to ensure that Senate elections are held at the same time as elections for the House of Representatives. I wish that to be deleted. I abstain from further argument and to assist the Government with its steamroller tactics in order to pass the Bill within the time constraints, I do not wish to have a division on this matter. If the Minister indicates that the Government does not accept the amendment and every honourable senator who has voted yes remains silent, so as to indicate concurrence with the Minister, then it will be on record that this had been denied by the Committee. This is a statement of fact as to the true nature of the Bill. </para>

          <para>- I just cannot let go the last comment about the Government steamrollering this legislation through the chamber. This legislation has been before us for the whole of this week. It was introduced into the Senate last week. We spent all day yesterday on it. We are having a special sitting today solely devoted to it and the other Constitution alteration Bills. We had a debate on matters related to them on Tuesday evening. We commenced this debate on Wednesday evening. I completely reject on behalf of the Government any suggestion that it has been steamrollered through this chamber. It is manifestly not correct. </para>

        <para>As far as the amendment to the title of the Bill is concerned, the Government does not accept the amendment because it believes that the title it has given to the Bill-&#39; ... an Act ... to ensure that Senate Elections are held at the same time as House of Representatives Elections&#39;- is an accurate description of the purpose of the Bill and what the Bill actually seeks to achieve. </para>
        <para>The change proposed in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> amendment is not in fact accurate because it says one half of the Senate shall be dissolved&#39;.

Although I have demonstrated my personal opposition to it and tried to persuade the Government and the Senate that there are dangers in it, it is obvious that the weight of numbers is such that the majority of honourable senators seem to be in favour of it. I have decided now to leave it to the good judgment of the Australian people to make a final decision on this issue.

I think that is an indication that there is a certain amount of jealousy on their part because we on this side of the chamber have the right and the privilege- indeed the duty on occasions- to disagree with the Government.

That is a duty we have fulfilled and I commend the people on this side of the chamber, both those who have spoken against the Bill and those who have spoken in favour of it, on the constructive way in which they have tried to help the people of Australia. </para>

I do not accept that it is sufficient reason to say that there are too many elections. I do not accept as sufficient the reason that elections are costly. What does concern me and what has not been explained is that limiting elections by legislation is the first step on the road to having no elections at all. There are now only 24 democratic countries left in the United Nations and I would not want to see that number come down to twenty-three through Australia being the next one to drop off the list.

          <para>This Bill is not all about whether the 2 Houses ought to come together for election on polling day; it is much deeper than that. I believe that the Senate would not be doing justice to itself if it voted at this stage either for or against the Bill. The Bill has very long term implications for the Senate and for the Constitution as such because it does not deal with something which will be temporary; it deals with something which will be written into the Constitution. </para>

The people of Australia have not had the opportunity to participate in the formulation of any proposals that are likely to be put to them. It should not be forgotten that the purpose of the proposals that are to go to the people is to change the ground rules upon which members of this Senate are elected and upon which their terms of office are established. In other words, the purpose of the proposals is to extend the term of office of every member of this Senate. What would the people say about that? Why should they not have the opportunity to say: Perhaps there is some merit in the proposal, but why should not the referendum be held simultaneously with the next half Senate election and thus save a great deal of money?&#39;? </para>

          <para>-The Government will not accept the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> which seeks to refer the Bill to a select committee. The Bill in its present form is being put forward in accordance with the decision that was taken after consideration and debate by the Constitutional Convention. So, it has been considered very thoroughly by a body outside this Senate. I have not noticed that, in fact, participation in the debate has been confined by any means to lawyers in this chamber. Plenty of other honourable senators have taken part in the debate, and they have taken part in it very effectively. In fact, I think that the lawyers have not been as prominent in this debate as people sometimes think they are in debates on constitutional matters. </para>

        <para>The major reason why the Government will oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> &#39;s amendment is that the decision on this matter will be made by the people. It cannot be put to the people until 2 1 May. Three months will be adequate time for the people and these so-called experts outside the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> is talking about to have their say about this measure.

It seems to me that the Minister has now gone full circle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> objected to the Senate being tied to a decision of the Constitutional Convention about which we have heard much detail from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and others today and its validity has been challenged in a real way. As I understood it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> &#39;s objection was on the grounds that the Convention was a preserve of lawyers in which neither we in the Senate nor the people participated. Now we are told by the Minister that since we have debated the matter here today it has been considered by people other than lawyers. The reason he gives us for accepting the proposal is that the lawyers decided on it at the Constitutional Convention. </para>

There are other alternatives. The Government has refused to consider them seriously.

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr President,</inline>may I call your attention to the fact that I believe that some misunderstanding has occurred in the calling of this division? At least one member of the Senate believed that the division was on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> &#39;s amendment. He did not understand that it was on the third reading of the Bill. I draw your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> to standing orders 242, 283 and 286. Standing order 286 enables a variation of the call of the Senate. Having regard to the requirements of the call and the particular safeguards that it is supposed to provide, I ask for your consideration of the propriety of this division proceeding to a conclusion without giving members the opportunity at least of some time, other than the usual 3 minutes for which the bells are rung to enable any misapprehension with regard to the division on the third reading to be resolved. I draw your attention to Chapter XXI of the Standing Orders which makes provisions with regard to the call of the Senate. Conscious as I am of the resolution that was passed on Tuesday night, nevertheless it does not relieve the Senate of the requirement to see that all honourable senators have quite a clear opportunity to be present at the division on the third reading. This matter is of the utmost importance to the honourable senator to whose misunderstanding I am sure I refer, he having left the chamber thinking the division was on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> &#39;s motion. He said that he wished to abstain on that vote. As far as I am concerned he was not specifically appraised the division was on the third reading. The rights of a senator voting against the passage of a referendum are tied up with the right to participate in the No case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack regarded that right as of very great value. Therefore, I trust that there is some way which will enable the division expressly to indicate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack had an opportunity to vote. </para>

            <para>- It has been a rule in this chamber ever since I have been here that divisions ought not to be won or lost by misadventure. It appears that misadventure has occurred. If the honourable senator who is not here at the moment is not entitled to vote he will not be able to take part in the preparation of the No case. For those reasons, I think the simplest procedure would be that I seek leave, as the division has not been concluded, to suggest that the question be put again and that another division be called. </para>

            <para>-The Senate is debating the Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) Bill. This is an important proposal which the Opposition does not oppose. It has become important only since 1975. The procedure for filling vacancies in the Senate is laid down in section 15 of the Constitution which provides that the Parliaments of the various States shall fill vacancies as they arise. There is no provision in the Constitution for an honourable senator who had died or retired, or in some other way left this place to be replaced by a person from the same political party. From 1949 to 1975 that convention applied. The Senate will be aware that in those years <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Spicer was replaced in this place by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan; Sir William</inline> Spooner by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton; Mr Gorton</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood;</inline> Dame Annabelle Rankin by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner; Senator Prowse</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid;</inline> and then, of course, in 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was replaced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunting</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Field.</inline> It is only in respect of the last two replacements that the convention which operated from 1949 was broken. If one reads the second reading speech of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> one sees that there is- if I might use the expression- a low key description of what happened in 1975. The Minister stated: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Nevertheless from the introduction of proportional representation in 1949 until the vacancy caused by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> appointment to the High Court in 1975 the practice was observed of filling casual vacancies by the appointment of a person belonging to the same political party as the former senator. </para>
            <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> had to be replaced this practice was questioned. Questions arose as to whether it was incumbent on the New South Wales Parliament to replace him with a member of the Australian Labor Party. There were some who felt that there was a convention which required the vacancy to be filled on that basis. But others took the contrary view. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Premier of New South Wales at that time was the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis-</inline> I speak in political terms. The Minister continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the result, as honourable members will well remember, the person chosen to replace <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was not a member of the Labor Party. In choosing the person to replace <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> the New South Wales Parliament quite clearly acted within the strict terms of the Constitution. Whether it breached a convention is a matter on which opinions have, and no doubt will continue, to differ. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Similar questions arose in relation to the replacement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Field.</inline> The Minister went on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>More recently, however, following the death of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> the filling of his place followed the convention. He was replaced by a person who was a member of the political party to which the late senator belonged. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As I say, that is a very low key description by the Attorney-General of the history of replacements of retired and deceased senators in the last few years. It is a view which is seen through somewhat tinted glasses, looked upon by the Minister through the charitable mists of retrospect of 2 years. Of course, there is a less charitable view of what happened in 1975. There is a view which sees what happened as being an example in this place of pious people having their country cousins rob a bank and saying: &#39;Tut, tut&#39;, to them when they do so, but sharing the proceeds with them and then saying: &#39;Look, it cannot happen again. We will have a constitutional referendum to make sure you behave yourself in future&#39;. In wider terms one could say: &#39;We should have a constitutional referendum to make sure that we behave ourselves in future&#39;. This proposal is of particular relevance to the Government. It would never have been necessary to introduce this measure as a result of the conduct of Labor governments. But it is necessary to introduce this proposal because of the conduct of past governments. For us, it might be described as the &#39;lest we forget &#39; constitutional referendum. </para>

              <para>-The honourable senator can tell me the relevance of that later but not now. There are a number of details in this proposal on which we might offer some criticism. The fact of the matter is that it is in substance the provision which was approved of by the Constitutional Convention. There is a slight difference. It is in substance the proposal which was approved of by the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review of 1959, although that Committee did not see the way in which it could be carried out. It is a necessary amendment to the Constitution and one which we believe will receive the approval of the Australian people, having regard to the conduct of State governments in recent years. I commend the proposal to the Senate. It will have the full support of the Opposition. It is designed to ensure that the heirs and successors of members of this Government do not behave in the way in which their colleagues did in the past. </para>

            <para>- I support very warmly this constitutional proposal. It is essential and long overdue. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said, it has become much more urgent by reason of the happenings of 1975 in respect of the vacanciesin New South Wales and Queensland, which were not filled by persons belonging to the same party as the deceased and retiring senators. </para>

              <para>- Field was not a member of the Labor Party. Immediately hestood against his party&#39;s wishes he was no longer a member and that was known to the Premier of Queensland. Time will not permit me to deal with irrelevant interruptions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> referred to a meeting of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in 1959. This Committee did not find the solution to the problem. It did not feel that this would be an important issue. It felt that people would observe the convention. The importance of this convention now, if the people approve, to be turned into law is that the proportional representation system of election must be maintained. It is important that there should be certainty about that. It is important that we know that those who vote for a certain party at a certain time can see a replacement coming from the same party as the senator he is replacing. This can be done now only by a constitutional referendum. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It is true that this matter was discussed by the Constitutional Convention last year. Fortunately the Government&#39;s proposal goes a little further than what the Convention proposed. The Convention wanted to limit it to serious illness or incapacity, which it would be impossible to define. The important thing is not how a vacancy comes about; the important thing is that vacancies shall be filled in accordance with proportional representation and the balance of the Senate shall be maintained. Otherwise, in the future the fortunes of death or other sudden happenings may remove a couple of senators from one party and they may be replaced by people from another party, thus changing the whole balance of power in the Senate without any vote of the people. </para>
          <para>It has been said in the Press that some areas are not covered entirely by this referendum proposal. Independents are not covered by it, but of course they are not covered at the moment. A State at the moment makes the decision that it wants to make and it is not changed. Of course the Bill refers to political parties. There is no reason in the world why political parties should not be referred to in our Constitution. The important thing is that in 98 per cent of cases we will now provide for certainty in the maintenance of representation. If the referendum is passed, we will know that a successor will come from the same party as the senator he is replacing. </para>
          <para>The second part of the amendment, which is likewise most valuable and originates from the Constitutional Convention last year, is the provision that the person appointed to fill a vacancy shall not just fill it until the next election, when he may be thrown out and proportional representation would no longer apply in the State he represented, he will in fact now serve the balance of the term of the person who was elected originally. So a party will have the same representation, in accordance with its entitlement, for the whole of the term of the senator being replaced. </para>
          <para>I believe this proposal has absolute merit. It is one for which I have striven and one which has been considered by Liberal Party committees over the last year. The Senate expressed itself when the Lewis appointment to fill a casual vacancy in New South Wales was made. Unanimously we said that the convention should be complied with. We in the Liberal Party have worked on and developed this constitutional amendment. Because of what it does for the people, because of the certainty it gives to government and because it is an essential and important amendment that will ensure that this Senate does not lose its significance and does not become unbalanced and outside the will of the people, I support it. </para>

          <para class="block">In the debate on simultaneous elections we heard constant references to the Constitutional Convention. We were told how important it was that we accept the view of the Constitutional Convention and that any argument advanced against anything recommended by the Constitutional Convention would be invalid. The subject of this Bill has been before Committee D of the Constitutional Convention for a long time. Committee D examined it for as long and as penetratingly as it could. It came to the conclusion that the original Joint Committee on Constitutional Review on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> sat was perfectly correct in saying that there was no possibility of getting a form of words which would meet this situation and put it beyond the risk of prejudice. </para>
          <para>It so reported to the Constitutional Convention. The Constitutional Convention discussed it briefly to see whether it was possible to put into the Constitution something which would enshrine the concept that it should be the function of those people responsible for filling casual vacancies to be obedient to the principle; but it confessed that it was totally beyond legal expression in any form. This was agreed to by all the Government representatives who were at that Constitutional Convention and on Committee D. In Committee D it had the support of that eminent legal luminary who now sits in the High Court and once sat in the Senate; it was not possible to find an appropriate form of words. </para>

              <para>-I am not quoting him as aft authority; I was just saying that it was an expression of opinion. An interesting observation was made by one of the representatives of the Government at the Constitutional Convention, namely, that the resources in Canberra were of such an order in terms of legal quality and capacity that it should not be beyond the wit of the Solicitor-General s office in Canberra to provide a method by which a legal constitutional sanction could be provided in respect of the filling of casual vacancies. What came out of that discussion is this Bill, which provides that so far as practicable a casual vacancy in the Senate shall be filled by a person of the same political party as the senator chosen by the people. We are now being recommended to pass a Bill at this late hour-some of the fault for that lies perhaps with me-although it was the opinion of every person on Committee D of the Constitutional Convention and of the full Convention itself that it was not possible to frame constitutional words to do what this Bill sets out to do. On that basis I inform honourable senators that I totally reject it. </para>

            <para>-I also oppose the Bill, because it is not necessary. The situation clearly is that the Government cannot look to the Constitutional Convention and say that it recommended that there be a referendum on this matter. The Constitutional Convention simply stated a principle and expected that those people present, including those in State governments, would take that principle back and implement it. However, nothing has been said correctly in respect of this matter as it relates to Independents. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> says that the situation of Independents will not be affected. I submit that the situation of Independents will be affected vastly. This is an attempt to take away from Independents a right which the Government is now trying to enshrine in the Constitution for a group of people on an executive of a party. That is precisely what the Government is saying. It is saying that casual vacancies ought to be filled by that party, in effect, and that is what the wording of the proposal means. </para>

              <para>- No. Let us deal with the death or retirement of an Independent and also with the question of those people who change parties in mid-stream during the term of a Senate. We have heard arguments from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> in support of the previous proposition relating to simultaneous elections that there are switches and changes and splits in parties. If he could use that as an argument in respect of the previous proposition, why can he not use it as an argument on this occasion? Let us consider what would have happened to certain people if this proposition had been enforced earlier in the Federation. For example, let us take the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Simon</inline> Fraser. He was a member of this Senate and the grandfather of the present Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, who is a sponsor of this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Simon</inline> Fraser was a senator between 1 90 1 and 1 9 1 3. He was elected in 1 90 1 as a protectionist. He was reelected in 1906 as an anti-socialist and, as far as can be ascertained from the records, he was later a part of Deakin &#39;s fusion group. Presumably the anti-socialists fused into the Deakin fusion group. What would have happened on that occasion? Under the proposed alteration, who would have replaced <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Simon</inline> Fraser? I have a long list of similar examples but because the gag has been drawn down I cannot give them to the Senate. However, there are quite a number of examples which are as ludicrous as that one when this proposition is applied. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Again, what is the definition of &#39;party*? Can anybody say? Committee D, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack referred, could not say; nor has anybody suggested a definition of &#39;party&#39; for the purpose of this amendment to the Constitution. After all, it is the first time that an attempt has been made to incorporate the word &#39;party&#39; into the Constitution. For example, I ran on a group at the last election in order to get into the groupings under the provisions of the Electoral Act. If I die, is one of that group to replace me, or am I supposed to make some sort of political last will and testament? None of those matters have ever been explained. No one has been given the opportunity in relation to this Bill. It cannot be said that we should have known about it because the Constitutional Convention recommended that there should be an amendment to the Constitution. It did not, and I remind the members of the National Country Party that not only did it not do that but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> firmly opposed an amendment to the Constitution thereby. </para>

              <para>- No, I approve the principle, and I leave it to the good sense of the State Houses of Parliament, having regard to what has taken place over the last few years, to recognise the problems that have emerged because this principle has not been adopted. It is important to ensure that it is a principle and is taken forward, but it cannot be imported into the Constitution for reasons too long to go into during this truncated debate, which is only for 35 minutes. I believe that the Government and the Opposition are doing an injustice to people&#39;s intelligence, insulting people&#39;s intelligence, in thrusting the Bill through in this way. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry that the time allowed for this debate is shorter than I had hoped it would be. Nevertheless I am happy to be able to speak on this Bill. In politics I suppose we see a number of ironies at times. I think that perhaps it is the ultimate irony that I am able to stand here today in this chamber to support this Bill. I say that it is ironic because I was a victim of the lack of the provisions that this legislation contains. With the will of the people the Constitution may be altered so that persons of the same political party as those who have left can be appointed to the Senate in their place. Most honourable senators and I suppose many people who are listening to the broadcast of these proceedings would recall that in 1975, because of the lack of the provisions that this legislation contains, I was one of the victims of the events that happened then. More importantly, if we leave the personal aspects aside, the Australian Labor Party was the victim. But ultimately parliamentary democracy in Australia in 1975 was a victim of the lack of this legislation. I am well aware of the events that happened because I was a pawn in the big game that was carried on then. It was a game with a series of serious aspects. I was involved in it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the short time that is left in this debate I should like to outline some of those events of 1975. Much has been said about the filling of casual vacancies since 1949, and with much reason. Proportional representation was introduced in 1949 in the election for representatives of this chamber. But little has been said about the filling of casual vacancies before 1949. Recently Professor Joan Rydon wrote an excellent article entitled <inline font-style="italic">Casual Vacancies in the Australian Senate.</inline> In this article Joan Rydon outlined the history of the filling of casual vacancies, mainly before 1949. 1 shall mention a few of the things that she wrote. She outlined that the principle of appointing successors from the same political party was frequently asserted prior to 1949, but not necessarily followed. In fact if one reads the article cue sees that the majority of vacancies before 1949 were filled by people of the same political party as the holders of the seats they took. But this was almost by accident, not by design. I commend Professor Rydon &#39;s article to those people who are interested in this aspect of Australia&#39;s political history. </para>
          <para>Of course with proportional representation it has been important that the person who replaces a deceased or retired senator should come from the same political party as the person whom he replaces. There have been 2 instances in Queensland where that principle was not followed. One of the instances resulted in a person of the same political party being appointed. Some people remember what happened in the early 1960s. Max Poulter was elected to the Senate as a senator from Queensland but before he could take his place in the Senate he died. Alf Arnell was the next candidate on the Labor Senate ticket at that election and he was nominated by the Australian Labor Party. The Premier of Queensland at the time would not accept his nomination and the Australian Labor Party finally put forward a second name, that of George Whiteside, who became a senator in this place. I will refer to the other situation in Queensland shortly. </para>
          <para>Before I do that, let me remind honourable senators of what happened in New South Wales. The former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> resigned. Peter Westerway was nominated by the Australian Labor Party to take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> &#39;s-place, But the New South Wales Parliament elected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunton.</inline> On 4 May last year I clearly outlined in the Senate what had occurred in Queensland. Let me just recap some of the events. There was a deliberate conspiracy in Queensland in 1975 to make sure that Bert Milliner, a former senator, was not replaced by a Labor nominee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bert</inline> Milliner died on 30 June 1975. </para>
          <para>Few people expected that the Premier of Queensland would move in the way that he did. The filling of this vacancy involved the death of a sitting senator. It is important to remember what the Premier said at that time. He said only 2 days after the death:  in the case of a death, it is logical to appoint a man from the same Party. </para>
          <para class="block">Yet he went on to trail his coat by saying that the Labor Party: </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen,</inline>the Premier of Queensland, well knew at that time that I had been endorsed already as the candidate of the ALP for the next Senate election. He knew that, if he asked for a panel of candidates, the Labor Party would not accede to his request because I was the next candidate who had been endorsed by the Party. </para>
          <para>The Party called nominations. After those nominations were called, I was nominated to the 2 sittings of the Queensland Parliament on 27 August 1975 and 3 September 1975. The person who was selected washy no means a Labor supporter. As soon as he nominated to fill the vacancy he lost membership of the Australian Labor Party. The Premier of Queensland was well aware of that. Because of this action, the Senate was stacked in 1975. When I spoke in May, I suggested that there should be a referendum to cover the situation that had arisen in this instance. I said in May last year: </para>

            <para>Those who do care about the 1 975 incident should support any moves to have the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in relation to casual vacancies investigated further. Perhaps it may be possible to frame a suitable amendment to frustrate the will of a future maverick Premier. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Because of what I have experienced, because of what I have seen happen and because casual vacancies have not been filled in the way I think they should be, I wholeheartedly support this legislation. </para>
          <para>Incidentally, the legislation will not allow a pseudo appointment to be made as was the case in 1975 because, as soon as the person nominated loses his party membership before coming into the Senate, the vacancy is deemed not to have been made. I suppose that a State parliament still might not fill a vacancy. There does not seem to be anything in the legislation to say that it must fill a vacancy. This legislation goes a long way towards ensuring that the Senate retains the proportional representation that was given to it by the electors at the time of the election. It has my wholehearted support. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry that, once again, we are dealing with legislation- in this case the Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) Bill- brought in by this Government. In my opinion, it is even more dishonest than the previous legislation, the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill. I say that quite strongly. Also, it amazes me that this Government, which has squealed so often when in Opposition about the shortage of dme for debate, has squeezed down to practically nothing the debating time on these tremendously important Bills. This Bill deals with something which it has been pointed out by committees and others is very difficult to put into proper legal terms, yet the Government goes ahead with it. There are various difficulties about filling vacancies, including vacancies in seats which had been occupied by Independents. But the very important change is in the fact that for the first time the Government recognises the question of party in its legislation. This, I think, is a complete change. The most serious aspect of all is that this legislation is giving political parties the right to over-ride State authorities. The States are a very important part of the composition of this Constitution of Australia. It has been said before that it was only because the States agreed to have a Senate chamber that we have an Australian Parliament. Yet we are now giving power to political parties to over-ride the authority of the States. Who ever would have thought that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would do this. Having seen the amalgamations and the voting on the other side of the chamber today, I think it probably will be interpreted that a new party, the Labor-Liberal-National Country Party has arisen in Australia. The way that these parties have coalesced and the friendliness which has been shown has made me realise how people can corns together unexpectedly. There are only two or three minutes left for this debate so there is nothing much that one can say because of the way this Government is steamrollering through important legislation. I oppose the legislation and I hope that the people of Australia will be alerted sufficiently not to fall for the dishonesty and the hypocrisy of this Government on these questions. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Deputy President,</inline>I rise to speak a few brief sentences. I want to point out some things in relation to the stand I am about to take. At the beginning of the Autumn session in 1975 I voted on a resolution in the Senate which re-affirmed the principle of appointment from political parties where that was relevant. In Queensland, after the death of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner,</inline> I stated publicly in a number of parts of the State that I supported the right of the Labor Party to nominate the then <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Colston</inline> and that I thought it was deplorable that a political party should seek to profit from the death of a member of parliament. I want to put on record, because there has been general reference to Queensland, the facts that m the State Parliament, in the actual vote on the matter of who should be nominated to this House by the State Parliament a majority of the Liberal parliamentary party voted for the then <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Colston</inline> and, in a subsequent ballot of the State Liberal Party, a majority voted against the nomination of former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Field.</inline> I give no more reason than that for rising to speak, except to say that to find an outline of my view honourable senators might consult the speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine.</inline></para>

            <para>- I wish to speak upon this subject but I regret that, due to the closure that has been imposed on honourable senators without notice, I will be interrupted in one and a half minutes. I was a member of the Constitutional Review Committee which considered this subject in 1959 and reported unanimously that no formulation of words could be devised by draftsmen in the 3 years of the Committee&#39;s consulations to give effect to this principle without invading fundamental principles which we have always held. The first is that proportional representation is not part of the Constitution. It is an Act of Parliament and its permanency depends upon this Parliament and may be altered at any time. The proper way to give representation to a successor of a vacant seat under proportional representation is to recount the votes because the votes at a single election must be represented in the proportion in which the people then voted. An empirical decision subsequent to an election for the fulfilment of a vacancy, unless guided by the recount of votes of a candidate who has already been before the people, will be invading the very fundamental principles of proportional representation. </para>

          <para>- In view of the fact that all the planes are delayed, and the sudden urgency being exhibited by a number of people to get away will be allayed, I take the opportunity to say that I would have liked to have had a chance to explain why I wished to vote in a particular way. It is unfortunate that events precluded me from doing so. I am sure the Government and the Opposition will be only too happy when the Senate resumes to afford opportunities to those who were caught in a similar situation to explain their actions. </para>

              <para>No. I draw the honourable senator&#39;s attention to the provisions of the Currency Regulations, as amended by Statutory Rule No. 139 of 1975. The Regulations prescribe three measurements for each coin denomination: Standard weight (and remedy- that is, tolerance), maximum diameter and maximum thickness. For coins made in 1 974 or earlier these are specified in precise (but not, in most cases, whole) imperial units- grains and inches. </para>

          <para>The decision was taken that the 50c commemorative Silver Jubilee coin be produced in the same alloy and with the same weight and size as the standard 50c coin; one consideration was the avoidance of confusion that could arise in the public mind as a result of a different coin size. </para>

              <para>Several suggestions have been made that Australia should introduce a dollar coin. These suggestions are being studied. Should the Government decide to introduce any new coin, its weight and size would be prescribed in precise metric terms and the desirability of having one or more of the characteristics expressed in a whole metric unit will be considered along with other relevant factors. </para>

            <para>On 13 October 1976 Taxation Board of Review No. 3 gave a decision in a case involving commutation of a bank officer&#39;s pension into a lump sum payment. </para>
            <para>The taxpayer had retired from the service of a bank and become entitled to a pension from the staff superannuation fund. Three days after his retirement, acting in accordance with a rule of the fund, he elected to commute half of his pension entitlement into a lump sum. This sum was paid to him by the fund two days later. </para>
            <para>The Commissioner of Taxation took the view that the lump sum was paid in consequence of the taxpayer&#39;s retirement and that5 per cent of it was therefore assessable income in accordance with section 26 (d) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. </para>
            <para>The Board of Review, however, took the view that the lump sum was not paid in consequence of the taxpayer&#39;s retirement but in exchange for giving up part of his pension rights. In the Board&#39;s view no part of the lump sum was assessable income. </para>
            <para>The Commissioner of Taxation has appealed to the Supreme Court of Queensland against the Board&#39;s decision. </para>

            <para>-On 9 December 1976 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> asked me a question without notice concerning Australian Government loan borrowings for 1976. The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The currencies in which the Commonwealth Government borrowed on international capital markets in 1976 were Deutschemarks, Swiss francs, Netherlands guilders and United States dollars. </para>
            <para>The aggregate Australian dollar equivalent of the overseas loans undertaken by the Commonwealth in 1976, based on the relevant rates of exchange for the Australian dollar prevailing when the individual loans were concluded, was $A691.4m. Following the devaluation of the Australian dollar on 28 November the equivalent figure was $A808.3m. Following the subsequent revaluations the equivalent figure on 1 6 February was $A752.4m. </para>
            <para>It should be noted, however, that a meaningful assessment of the &#39;net financial situation&#39; in regard to the loans from the viewpoint of their Australian currency equivalents would need to take into account not only the changes which have occurred in the exchange rates to this point but also to those points in time when interest and capital repayments on the borrowings are effected. </para>
            <para>In considering the overall financial effect of overseas borrowings flowing from variations in exchange rates, account also needs to be taken of the fact that the foreign currencies received in such borrowings by the Commonwealth are sold to the Reserve Bank and thereafter constitute part of Australia &#39;s international reserves. As such, those foreign currencies are invested by the Reserve Bank in the capital markets abroad and as such their value is not, of course, affected by the variations in the exchange rate for the Australian dollar. </para>
            <para>For these and other reasons it is not very meaningful to attempt to quantify the position of these particular loan operations along the lines implied by the honourable senator&#39;s question. </para>

It commented that it has been possible to show that mesothelioma can be produced by slight exposures, and on present (1968) knowledge, it must be assumed that no amount of exposure is completely free from this risk. The 1 97 1 revision did not comment further on these aspects but stated &#39;There is increasing evidence that exposure to asbestos may be associated with some cases of gastrointestinal carcinoma and the position should be kept under review&#39;. </para>

              <para>1 ) No. All developed countries which participated in the Fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held in Nairobi last year, including the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany, joined in the adoption by consensus of a resolution on an Integrated Programme for Commodities which, among other things, set out steps to be taken towards the negotiation of a common fund. The Resolution makes it clear that the Integrated Programme is a program of global action to improve market structures in international trade in commodities of interest to developing countries. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>No. A realistic calculation of the possible benefits to Australia could only be attempted when the relevant negotiations have been completed and the detailed provisions are known. It should be noted that Australia is an exporter of only three of the ten so-called &#39;core&#39; commodities, namely, sugar, copper and tin. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>At the November Common Fund preparatory talks, participating countries considered a number of aspects of the proposal for a negotiation on a common fund including the elaboration of objectives of such a fund, its financing needs and structure, sources of finance and mode of operations. All the major members of UNCTAD are participating fully in the preparatory meetings which, given the complexity of the subject and the range of issues involved, can be said to be progressing satisfactorily. The third such meeting is currently being held and a negotiating conference will begin on 7 March. It must be stressed, however, that no international decision has been taken to establish a common fund and agreement remains to be reached on the detailed provisions of such a fund. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>As a major exporter of agricultural and mineral commodities, Australia has worked actively over the years in international discussions and negotiations aimed at improving the conditions of international commodity trade. Accordingly, Australia has supported the proposal for an integrated program on commodities. However, in the terms currently proposed, the Government remains to be convinced of the need for a common fund as an element of that program or that an early decision on its establishment is necessary to ensure the success of the program. The main purpose of a common fund would be to finance buffer stocks or other stocking arrangements which are only one of a number of measures that could be included in individual commodity agreements or arrangements. Moreover, the extent to which stocking arrangements might be used has still to be determined. Nevertheless, the Government firmly recognises that participants in an individual commodity agreement have the responsibility jointly of ensuring that finance is available for stocking arrangements where these have been agreed as an appropriate measure in that agreement. </para>

            <para>The position is that the 1976-77 Budget contains an amount of $1,350,000 which is required for National Estate projects where there are firm legal commitments arising from agreements made in previous years. There are no funds available this year for new projects. </para>
            <para>As a consequence of the Government &#39;s review of spending programs, undertaken in preparation for the framing of the 1976-77 Budget, the National Estate program along with a number of others was restricted to existing commitments. This is part of the Government&#39;s economic strategy for reducing inflation. </para>
            <para>As regards the availability of funds for the National Estate in future years, the Government has stated that as soon as the Register of the National Estate is well advanced it will be in a position to again consider the appropriation of funds, in the light of the evidence of urgent need disclosed through the preparation of the Register. I am advised that the Australian Heritage Commission is making good progress in the preparation of the Register and hopes to have work well advanced within the next few months. </para>
            <para>It should therefore be possible for the Government to consider an appropriation for the National Estate in 1977-78, within the context of the Budget strategy for that year. </para>
