            <para>-My question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce relates to the Minister's statement last week concerning small businesses. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that many small businesses entering into contracts with Government departments do not know that their tenders are for firm and fixed price contracts which do not allow for price escalation brought about by wage rises and increases in the cost of materials? Is the upshot of this situation that some small businesses have failed as a result of entering into Government contracts, particularly in the defence area? Will the Minister ensure that steps are taken by Government departments specifically to point out this aspect of government contracts to tenderers who operate small businesses? </para>

            <para>- Nobody has come to me from a small business individually, from an association of small businesses or from an association of industry in any area with a complaint like that. Nonetheless, this is a useful question. If the problem exists it ought to be examined in the way the honourable senator has suggested. I shall ask my Department to write to other departments which deal with people in the business world totally, to make sure that that condition of contract is understood by the people concerned. I do not think what the honourable senator has suggested is true in all cases, but it is a useful suggestion. </para>

            <para>- I have had made known to me the quantity of rumours circulating in universities and colleges. I have seen at least one circular that has been distributed. I am bound to say that tertiary campuses are marvellous places for the generation of rumours- and, what is more, based on their score over the past two years, thoroughly incorrect rumours. All the rumours that have emerged in recent times have been proved wrong. The facts about study leave are: The Federal Government set up, firstly through the Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education and subsequently through the Tertiary Education Commission, which is their successor, an independent study of study leave by people who are independent and expert in the field of tertiary education. Nobody in the academic sphere should have anything to fear from such an independent study. The whole basis of a statutory body such as the Tertiary Education Commission is that it shall seek objective evidence. My understanding is that the Commission will not complete its investigations until at least the end of this year or early next year. I have no knowledge at all of the contents of its possible report. Certainly, there is no prior judgment or prejudice on the part of the Commonwealth Government or any of its Ministers in this matter. In due course we will receive the report and give it the study it will deserve. I ask people to put aside all rumours until the report emerges and the judgment of the Commonwealth is made upon it factually. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Is it correct that trading banks and other institutions have been unprepared to lend to small firms, not because of lending limits placed upon them but because most small firms have been unable to offer the security required by the trading banks? Will the Government be prepared to arrange for guarantees or inducements to the trading banks to ensure that loan requests made by small businesses to the banks will now be approved? </para>

            <para>-That comment has been made often by people in the community and sometimes by people in the Parliament. The trading banks say quite specifically that that is not the case. The figures on their lending activities demonstrate that that is not the case. There are often problems of security for all people involved in small businesses. They have not had the chance to build up a big asset structure as other people have had either because of their size or because of time. I think it has been demonstrated fairly clearly that the Government understands the problem and is doing something specific about it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Guarantee situations are highly simple propositions, but it has seemed to the Government from the investigations of its task force, the work of its own departments, the work of the small business committee that has been referred to and from very broad discussions that there may be better ways of approaching this matter. Hence the opportunity has been given to the Development Bank and, equally, the Australian Industry Development Corporation to engage in some joint ventures with either the States or private enterprise and to set up devices that might make it possible to expand lending and to make a kind of bridging finance arrangement available to small businesses. I think that is the best approach to the matter. The simple one-off proposition that the Commonwealth should guarantee everybody and do everything does not really stand up. What one has to try to do is get an involvement between the banking institutions, the State governments and the overall market place itself, where there is some ability to help, and try to put it all together. But in the finality of that, whatever happens, those people who lend money must be making commercial judgments about those to whom they lend it. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I refer to the decision announced recently to reduce by some 20 per cent the cost of STD telephone calls of a Sunday and note that this decision is to take effect from January. I cannot recall the exact date, but can recall that the reason given for the reduction was that the telecommunications equipment was not heavily loaded of a Sunday and the reduction was an attempt to have the equipment used on that day. I ask: Firstly, will the Minister advise the Senate whether there are any plans to attempt to get better utilisation of the telecommunications equipment on days of the week other than Sunday, as I am informed that the utilisation is low at night and is particularly low very late at night and early in the morning? Secondly, will the Minister attempt to play Santa Claus by asking Telecom Australia to bring forward the date of the reduction to 18 December? I have noted that Christmas Day happens to fall on a Sunday this year. Perhaps the Minister could play Santa Claus by getting Telecom to reduce the cost of STD calls from 1 8 December so that those people who wish to contact their relatives and friends during the Christmas period can speak for longer periods at the same cost. </para>

            <para>- I represent a considerable number of disciplines and portfolios, but not Father Christmas, except in expansive Budget periods. I am aware that Telecom has been seeking to make better utilisation of its STD equipment by attracting people to use that equipment at times other than when there is peak or average loading. I think all honourable senators would welcome such an innovation. The honourable senator also would be aware that Telecom, through the proposed acquisition of a considerable quantity of very modern telecommunications equipment, is aiming to maintain the cost of the services that it delivers and to prevent an upsurge in that cost. So in many ways it is seeking to provide an effective and economic service. I am not aware specifically of the final part of the honourable senator's question, that is, whether some kind of preferred rate or arrangement is being considered for other days of the week. I will seek that information from the Minister in another place and also draw his attention to the suggestion, if it has not been responded to. As to Father Christmas, since the honourable senator is dreaming of a cheaper Christmas- I think that is his theme- I will ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications whether such is within his power and discipline. </para>

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It relates to the heavy burden placed on small business in this time of business recession and financial stringency by the inordinate delay that has been placed on small business by government administrative procedures. Following the Minister's statement of last week on small business what steps will be taken to short-cut existing administrative procedures to reduce the time between when a department takes receipt of goods and services and when the supplier actually receives payment for them? Is the Minister aware that existing administrative procedures, from receipt of delivery document, to receipt of an invoice, to preparation of a claim, to authorisation of that claim and the issuance of a cheque by the SubTreasury, invariably take longer than a month? Does the Minister agree that this delay creates cash flow problems for small businesses and will he see what can be done to overcome this documentary nightmare? </para>

            <para>- It was for precisely those reasons that the Government stated it was moving to have this whole process simplified, made more clearly understandable and more uncomplicated, in order to endeavour to reduce the volume of work for small business, or indeed any business, get the cash payments made more speedily and generally help in any way possible. The honourable senator has asked a useful question because it demonstrates what the problem was and how the Government is moving to solve it. One might observe that the problem has been with us for a very long time, yet little was done about it during Labor's regime. </para>

To the horror of listeners to FM broadcasts, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button's</inline> laughter would be recorded with absolute fidelity. However, FM has also many virtues which could be demonstrated. The Government has been looking, with some sense of its significance, at this whole question of developing conditions and guidelines under which FM radio broadcasting may proceed. I am not sure of the precise timetable, but will ascertain this from the Minister in another place and let the honourable senator know. </para>

            <para>-I have not read what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mosley</inline> has said, or is asserted to have said, but if he has indeed said those things the facts are against him. As the Senate will know, the Government has adopted, with regard to the Kakadu National Park, all the essential principles of the Fox report, and more. Indeed, it has taken in an area which includes virtually the whole of the traditional Aboriginal sites. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> will share my view that it is an important situation. Equally, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> and honourable senators generally will know that the Government itself is determined that Kakadu National Park shall achieve its great potential as one of the world's great national parks, particularly one of the world's great wetlands, bird sanctuaries and wildlife sanctuaries. Specifically, action is proceeding as a matter of urgency to amend the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act to allow for the early declaration of the Kakadu National Park. The Government has made clear that in the park area to be declared initially no further mineral exploration is to take place for the time being. In future, any such activity will be permitted in the national park only after very careful consideration, and then under careful control in accordance with the formally developed plan of management as recommended by the Ranger Inquiry. The Government will proceed to establish the rest of the park as quickly as possible. In the meantime there will be no exploration, development or mining within this area except with the express approval of the Commonwealth authorities involved. </para>

I am not aware of the full staff available but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill's</inline> attention should be drawn to the various pieces of information contained within the uranium kit that was issued to all honourable senators. He will be aware that the Commonwealth has a comprehensive plan to ensure that the chief scientist, his abilities and his responsibilities are used to the full. </para>

I have discussed this matter with my colleague, the State Minister in Victoria and the Governments concerned have agreed to provide $50,000 each, making a total of $100,000, which will be sent immediately to Victoria to assist voluntary agencies in the work that they have been doing in the past weeks. My Department and the Department of the Honourable Brian Dixon are consulting with regard to the dispersal of these funds and the way in which the voluntary agencies can best be assisted. We are seeking advice from the Victorian Council of Social Service. We hope that the release of $100,000 into Victoria will enable the organisations to continue to provide funds for those who are suffering distress at this time. </para>

            <para>- Those people who are presently eligible are being paid on the present system, that is, in advance; but it should be understood that we do not pay unemployment benefit in advance of the period for which unemployment is expected. For instance, if it is suggested that all strikers will return to work and all those who have been stood down will return to work in less than a fortnight, unemployment benefit would not be paid a fortnight in advance. Under those circumstances the payment would be for the period when it was expected that unemployment would be experienced. The new system of payment in arrears will be introduced from 1 November. At present all people who are eligible for unemployment benefit under the existing system are being paid in accordance with the practice that has been established. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, refers again to the question of the small business assistance allegedly being provided by the Government. Does the Minister remember that in his statement on small business he referred to the fact that there are 350,000 enterprises in Australia which he defined as small businesses, or more than 90 per cent of the total of all businesses? I ask whether the Minister recalls saying in his statement: </para>

          </quote>
          <para>Would the Minister not agree that to fulfil the undertakings contained in that statement the funds of the Commonwealth Development Bank would need to be augmented by very large sums of money? Has the Government determined the source of those funds? Does the Government intend to provide additional appropriations for the Development Bank or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> asked earlier, has it decided that the Development Bank itself will go on the market to raise those moneys? </para>

            <para>-The statement is quite clear. What the honourable senator has asked for is an expression of Government policy on how it will determine its objectives as set out in the statement. It is not the policy of the Government to back down on its promises. It is the policy of the Government to establish the facts clearly and to keep its promises. What it has said to the Reserve Bank it intends to make sure happens. The way in which the Government does that is at this stage the business of the Government, the Reserve Bank, the Treasury, and indeed the Commonwealth Development Bank. The honourable senator may be sure that it will be done properly and carefully, as it was never done during his time in office in relation to small business. </para>

              <para>- It is a most unreasonable conclusion. The Government has made a statement. The Government has determined a policy. The Government is the Government; the Opposition is not the Government. We are doing our job properly and carefully, and when we have concluded the way in which we should do this it will become clear in the proper way, not by innuendo and statements which are basically quite incorrect. </para>

            <para>-I will, some time today with leave of the Senate, be making a statement on education which incorporates information on this whole matter. So I think the honourable senator will find the specifics contained in that statement. If they are not, she might let me know and I will seek more information. As to the specific question, yes, an amount of $2m is being set aside to raise over some years funding for level 1 and level 2 non-government schools to 20 per cent, which was the percentage determined in 1972, and then dismantled by the Whitlam Government. That was the level of funding which the Whitlam Government recognised should be provided in the Australian Capital Territory and. the Northern Territory, and so disposed its policies to do. Funding was to be raised to 20 per cent without means test by five of the six States and to 20 per cent with some means test applied by the sixth State. What in fact is happening is that the Commonwealth Government is restoring over a period of years the basic policy on which the principle of non-government school funding is funded in all States and the two Territories and which, as a Commonwealth principle, is the linchpin for all those things. I have not heard anyone suggest that the principle of a 20 per cent funding without means test in the Territories and under State governments is a wrong principle. I think the people of Australia would be very interested indeed to know whether the Labor Party itself opposes the principle of 20 per cent as a basic rate in the States and in the Territories. It is a profoundly important piece of information. All I can say is that I take it by implication from the honourable senator's question that she opposes such a principle. </para>

I refer to concern- quite proper concern- that has been expressed recently about a possible site for a national museum in Canberra. This concern is related especially to the Pigott Committee's recommendation that a 90 hectare site be provided at the foot of Black Mountain. Can the Minister say whether a site has been set aside for possible use for a national museum and whether roadworks such as the Glenloch Interchange and William Hovell Drive will affect the possible site?

            <para>- I understand that the Pigott Committee of Inquiry on Museums and National Collections was shown the road proposals for the area south and west of Black Mountain by the National Capital Development Commission in 1975. It is in that general area that the Pigott Committee apparently recommended that the museum of Australia be sited and, as the honourable senator said, approximately 90 hectares have been set aside for a museum. I understand that the proposed Glenloch Interchange and William Hovell Drive which appeared to be the cause of some concern do not constrain in any way the location of the museum on this site. I am unable to say other than from a plan that I have seen that the proposed site is not interfered with by those roads. I understand also that my colleague, the Minister for Administrative Services, has been asked to prepare a paper on the timing of the construction of a museum for consideration by the Government. </para>

I ask the Leader of the Government: Is it not necessary that an urgent answer to this question be sought because of the fact that the people of Australia, particularly the women, remember the disgusting address which this woman gave to university students at Canberra when she told them to go in for selfmasturbation - . </para>

The longer that it is in the public mind that this Government has recommended the appointment of this woman, the more damaging it could be to the Government. Furthermore, is she not the person who helped to organise a women's convention in this city about which many women in Australia are still talking with great disgust because of the obscenity of the occasion? Will the Leader of the Government in the Senate take up this matter urgently with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to get a clarification of it? </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Minister, of course, will be aware, either from his own readings or from reports from his Department, of the very significant proposals which have been developed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> now supported by the Victorian Premier and agreed to finally by the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Moore. These proposals will allow a speedy hearing of a claim which could produce a settlement in the State Electricity Commission dispute. I ask the Minister: How is it that since that statement became public and his departmental officers knew about it there has been no support from any of the Government Ministers for those proposals which have been developed only by the Australian Council of Trade Unions? How is it that his own Department has not been active, having declared support for the Victorian Premier in moves such as this? In view of the lack of declaration by the Government, why is it that the Government now is producing certainly more repressive laws against the union movement when it might well wait for a settlement based on the proposals which are now declared by the Victorian Premier and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to be very constructive? </para>

I know from my own knowledge that my colleague was discussing these matters with the Victorian Government last night and again this morning. No doubt some announcement will be made by him or by counsel representing the Commonwealth I am not sure which- during today of the attitude of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to these matters which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> has mentioned. The legislation to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> referred consists of general reforms in the conciliation and arbitration area. The reforms have been matters of Government policy on which we were elected. The legislation was foreshadowed earlier this year. It has been discussed with the National Labour Consultative Council. The legislation is, as I have said, in the nature of general reform of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Its passage through the Parliament certainly does not hinge on a resolution or otherwise of the State Electricity Commission dispute. </para>

I think I answered a question quite recently and informed the Senate of the fact that we had had a large number of applications for the position. There have been applications within Australia and from overseas. A panel has been appointed to select the Director. It consists of the Chief Judge of the Family Court, Justice Elizabeth Evatt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lloyd</inline> Phillips of the National Marriage Guidance Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Jean</inline> Martin, Senior Fellow in Sociology in the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian.

            <para>- My colleague the honourable Michael MacKellar recently announced a program of advertising of Government programs and assistance to Australians through the ethnic Press. Several departments will be involved in preparing advertisements which will give information with regard to programs and access to assistance. I would not class this as a misconception about Government, policy but rather a means of giving information to those who may not be aware of it. There is in my own department a considerable degree of advertising and other means of communication of our programs but we will participate in this new program announced by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. All Australians would agree that there is a language disadvantage for those who may read only ethnic Press and publications. This is an effort by the Government to clear in the minds of those who read ethnic papers the programs and opportunities for assistance that the Government provides. I hope that a program of this kind has the support of the Opposition in believing that migrants who do not nave at their disposal the same information as other Australians from pamphlets and other publications will now have extra assistance under this new program. </para>

            <para>-Senator Kilgariff's question is distinctly different from that asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> although it relates to the speedy establishment of the Kakadu National Park. My advice is that the plan of management for the Kakadu National Park will be prepared as soon as practicable after the park has been proclaimed. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act sets out the procedures that must be followed both for proclamation and the preparation of the plan of" management. They provide for extensive public participation. The Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is at present gathering all the preliminary and basic information which will be needed to begin preparation of the plan of management. A critical factor will be the availability of survey information to fix boundaries of the park and those areas that are to be excised as recommended in the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry and subsequently agreed on by the Government. Preliminary discussions have been held with most of the relevant Northern Territory and Commonwealth authorities and more discussions are proposed in the near future. It should be emphasised that the process of preparation of the management plan is a highly skilled one. That is particularly the case with Kakadu because of the great variety of interests involved and the unique nature of the terrain and biological features. </para>

          <para>I can inform the Senate that the recent events of which we are all aware have drawn attention again to the real dangers posed by the activities of terrorist groups. I inform the Senate that the Commonwealth and State governments are and have been for a number of years actively engaged in developing contingency plans to deal with any international terrorist incident which might occur either in Australia or in another country affecting Australian lives and interests. The Commonwealth places proper importance on anti-terrorist precautions. Contingency plans have existed for some time and are regularly updated. Commonwealth departments and authorities work in close consultation with the relevant authorities in the States and Territories. The States also have their contingency plans but, naturally, they are not matters to be canvassed publicly. </para>
          <para>There is special machinery which provides advice to the Commonwealth Government on counter-terrorist matters, precautionary arrangements and intelligence co-ordination. Precautionary measures are maintained and procedures and arrangements to respond to and deal with such incidents, should they occur in Australia, have been established and are under constant review. Joint Commonwealth-State exercises are held to test and develop the effectiveness of the system and the close co-operation which exists between the Commonwealth and the States at all levels. It will be evident from what I have said that, together with the States, we are taking very seriously the whole problem of terrorist threats. Finally, I am glad to say that whenever the matter has been raised with the States they have given us marvellous and very close co-operation. </para>

          <para>-I have followed with keen interest the discussions in the media on this matter, which is of considerable importance. The Government is considering how it can, in conjunction with the States, expand facilities for migrants generally. So that honourable senators will understand the present position, I should indicate that this Government has greatly expanded the facilities. For example, in 1972-73 national enrolments totalled 60,000. In the following year, 1973-74, they totalled 66,000 and in 1974-75, 75,000. In the following year the then Government froze the enrolments at 75,000. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In the first year of the Fraser Government, 1976-77, there were 88,000, or a 17.3 per cent increase. Honourable senators may be interested to know that in 1973 a survey was done entitled A Decade of Migrant Settlement' and that this showed some quite alarming situations. It showed that, of heads of households, 54.4 per cent of Italians, 6 1 . 1 per cent of Greeks and 70.6 per cent of Yugoslavs had not undertaken English language courses, and that the percentage was likely to be worse for other family members, particularly women. When this Government came to office it inherited a backlog and, as I have said, we have produced an expansion. As I stated to honourable senators in recent days, new factors, relating particularly to refugees and unemployment, have made the problem more complex. We are looking at ways to use facilities to widen services. We have already made significant increases in the provision of finance, where possible, and I hope that we will be able to do more. The problem is highly complex and has existed for a long time, but expansion is now taking place in a very real way. </para>

Has she noted the remarks last week of the honourable member for Dawson, in which he deplored the fact that primary producers with no means, and suffering hardship, were having their unemployment benefits withdrawn as a result of new procedures in the Department of Social Security? Has she investigated the circumstances, and are they the result of new work-testing procedures of the Commonwealth Employment Service which forbid the Department to pay the applicant even when it is aware that extreme hardship exists? Have these persons, whose unemployment benefits have been withdrawn, been told of their right of appeal and right to apply for special benefit?

The Army Office processed it and sent it to the Government Printer on 8 June. Printing of two proofs and proof reading took until 26 August, when the final copy was sent for printing.

I sound a note of warning about the problems that could face the poultry industry. I am referring to the introduction of Newcastle disease into this country. If it took hold, it could wipe out all the commercial flocks in this country. We have seen evidence in recent times- because of the illegal importation of birds from overseas- that the poultry industry in Australia is under severe threat. It was under threat to such an extent that the Government- I commend it for the action it took- had to take action to destroy birds in aviaries which contained illegally imported birds. I hope that the Government continues to keep a very close watch on people who are importing into this country birds which are infected with Newcastle disease.

          <para>That the Senate take note of the report. </para>
        </motion>
        <para class="block">This is the fourth special report presented to the Parliament by the Joint Committee on Publications since its investigatory powers were conferred upon it by amendments to the Standing Orders in 1970. The inquiry was initiated by the </para>
        <para class="block">Committee in June 1976 to ascertain whether, in the opinion of the Committee, the Parliamentary Papers Series of the Commonwealth Parliament was fulfilling adequately its intended purpose and, if so, whether this was being achieved in the most economic and efficient manner. The Committee noted that no thorough investigation of the content and effectiveness of the Series had taken place since the presentation of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary and Government Publications in 1964- often referred to as the Erwin report after its  Chairman,  the Honourable Dudley Erwin. </para>
        <para class="block">Content of the Parliamentary Papers Series </para>
        <para class="block">Since 1967 the content of the Parliamentary Papers Series has been determined, in the main, by the Joint Committee on Publications, following the recommendations of the 1964 Erwin Committee report. In that report certain guidelines were laid down to encourage future Publications Committees to establish and maintain a comprehensive and consistent Series. The main advantage of a consistent Series remains unchanged from 1964, namely, that researchers, librarians and other users of the Series can anticipate, with relative confidence, the likely content of the Series from year to year. More recently, the establishment of a consistent Series has enabled the Australian Government Publishing Service, on advice from the Parliament, to arrange the simultaneous printing of the departmental and Parliamentary Paper versions of a report. The resulting cost savings from undertaking only one production run for two separate jobs are considerable. The Committee reaffirms the general conclusions of the Erwin Committee with regard to the consistency of the Series and has made a recommendation designed to reinforce this aspect of the Series. The Committee has added only slightly to the Erwin Committee content guidelines by including documents which comprise the Australian Treaty Series and Reports of Parliamentary Committees of Inquiry. </para>
		<para>Distribution</para>
        <para class="block">In 1971, in its report on distribution and pricing of parliamentary publications, the Committee recommended that the free distribution list for the principal parliamentary publications be rationalised and up-dated. It recommended that each addressee be limited to the receipt of one copy only of each of the principal parliamentary publications, e.g. Parliamentary Papers, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Notice Papers, upon request.  ,ne  Committee examined its 1971 recommendation and found that, in the main, its previous recommendations on this matter were still sound and only minor variations to up-date the recommendation were considered necessary. The Committee did not make any recommendations concerning the free distribution of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in this report. It took the view that any examination of the extent of free distribution of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> should be the subject of a separate investigation by the Committee at a later date. </para>
		<para>Duplication of Distribution and Wastage</para>
        <para class="block">The Committee was informed that the cost of producing the Parliamentary Papers Series in the financial year 1977-78 is likely to reach Sim. With this in mind the Committee was most concerned to remove any duplication of distribution or any wastage which might occur under the present distribution arrangements. The Committee was pleased to discover that in the main such wastage was minimal. In only one area did the Committee determine that it was necessary to amend the distribution arrangements of the Series to avoid wastage, namely, where Members of Parliament receive a copy of a report on tabling, duplication should be avoided by excluding members from receipt of the Parliamentary Paper version. </para>
		<para>Cost of Producing Series</para>
        <para class="block">One of the prime concerns of the Committee relates to the increasing cost involved in producing the Series. For example, it was informed that in 1970-71 the cost of producing the Series was $107,580; in 1975-76 that cost had increased to $729,716. As previously mentioned, the cost in 1977-78 will approach $lm. The Committee was keen to determine the principal factors involved with the increasing cost of producing the Series and whether any action taken by the Committee could reduce that cost or at least slow down the rate of increase. It narrowed the increasing cost to four main factors, namely, (a) the increased size of the individual publications included in the Series; (b) escalating costs involved with printing, binding et cetera and the supply of labour; (c) a tendency for more reports to be prepared by certain more expedient but relatively expensive processes; and (d) a failure by author bodies to observe production guidelines and procedures laid down by the Australian Government Publishing Service when producing simultaneously the departmental and Parliamentary Paper versions of reports. </para>
        <para>The Committee determined that the first two factors, namely, the size of individual publications and increasing costs of production, were outside the terms of its inquiry and that it would be in a position to comment on these matters in the course of future inquiries. It has, however, made recommendations which are designed to encourage departments to make greater use of less expensive production processes. The Committee also recommended enforcing AGPS production procedures laid down by AGPS circulars. It recommends that, in the event of an author body failing to follow AGPS procedures and, as a result, additional costs flow on to the production of the Parliamentary Paper version, those additional costs be met by the originating department rather than by the Parliamentary House Departments as is the present situation. The Committee hopes that the implementation of this recommendation will provide an incentive for author bodies to avoid the use of unnecessarily costly methods and material during the production process. </para>
        <para class="block">Delay in Publication of the Series </para>
        <para class="block">The other main concern of the Committee was the delay in the publication of the Parliamentary Papers Series. The Committee found that the present procedures which apply following the tabling of a report in Parliament and leading to the eventual printing of that document as a parliamentary paper are cumbersome and require streamlining. Under present arrangements the parliamentary paper version of a report normally does not become available for some eight to nine months after the original tabling. The Committee feels that such a situation is intolerable. Such delays reduce the practical use of the Series to that of an archival research tool rather than offering a Series which provides the community with current and up-to-date information on the affairs of Parliament and government. </para>
        <para>Ordinarily, the completion of the parliamentary paper version of a tabled report is undertaken by the printer who produced the original departmental tabling version. In most cases, these are contract printers employed by the Australian Government Publishing Service. The Committee has recommended that the Government Printer undertake the completion of the Series from the beginning of" 1978. The implementation of this recommendation would co-ordinate and simplify the procedures involved in completing the Series. Its implementation would shorten delays caused by the preparation of design specifications and setting type because of the familiarity of the Government Printer with this type of work. It would certainly reduce considerably the delays associated with the movement of proofs between the AGPS, the contract printer and the Parliament, and would enable direct contact to take place between the Government Printer and parliamentary officers. The implementation of these recommendations would bring the production of the Series into line with the production of the other principal parliamentary publications. </para>
        <para>In past years, the Committee consistently has expressed concern over the late tabling of many of the reports presented to Parliament. Members of both Houses, particularly in recent times, have complained of this growing trend. Because of the Committee's concern in this area and the fact that late tabling necessarily means that the currency of the Parliamentary Papers Series is adversely affected, the Committee has recommended the establishment of parliamentary machinery which is designed to encourage the more timely tabling of reports in Parliament. If the recommendations are implemented, members of parliament will be advised of those reports of government which have not been tabled within a reasonable period of time following the completion of the period to which each report refers. It would also ensure a continuing involvement by the Committee in this most important area of executive accountability to Parliament. </para>
        <para>The Committee feels that greater use should be made of the photo-typesetting equipment recently installed at the Government Printing Office. It feels that the time taken to produce most publications could be reduced by employing this equipment. At this stage the Committee suggests that the extension of the use of this equipment be limited to the production of parliamentary committee reports which make up part of the Parliamentary Papers Series and the transcripts of committee evidence. </para>
		<para>Other Matters</para>
        <para class="block">Evidence was given to the Committee that a reduction in the costs involved in the storage, distribution, ease of retrieval of information, etcetera, of the Parliamentary Papers Series could be achieved if the series was reproduced in a microform. The Committee accepts the evidence given on this subject and recommends that when production and financial considerations permit, the Parliamentary Papers Series be produced in a microform version as well as in hard copy. </para>
        <para>One factor which was brought out in evidence revealed, in the Committee's opinion, an inconsistency with the distribution of government publications through the AGPS deposit. Currently there are 25 recipients of the AGPS deposit, namely, national, university, and Commonwealth parliamentary librarians. The </para>
        <para class="block">Committee feels that the category of State parliamentary librarian should be added to the AGPS deposit and has recommended accordingly. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, as  Deputy Chairman  of the Committee, I would like to join the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Mr John</inline> Hodges, M.P., in thanking the other members of the Committee for the work which they have undertaken to complete this inquiry. I add that the great work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wharton</inline> and the other staff to the Committee has been most invaluable to the members of the Committee. We are very grateful to the staff for the work they have done. The report is the first of its type for a number of years carried out by the Joint Committee on Publications and I feel sure that all members of the Committee enjoyed the experience. I commend the report to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- I commend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> and the members of the Joint Committee on Publications for the report that has now been presented by them to the Parliament. From a very quick perusal of the report, I believe that they have done an excellent job and got to the nub of the problems that confronted the Parliament and the parliamentary process in dealing with the multifarious and numerous publications that come through the parliamentary sphere from time to time. It is interesting to observe that in a period of eight years the cost of the printing and publication of parliamentary papers has increased from about $100,000 in 1970 to about $lm in 1977-78. One wonders, having regard to that type of expenditure involved and the type of distribution that has occurred to date, whether the public and the community at large have been getting value for the money that has been involved. Certainly, this has been a desire on the part of the Committee. It has given consideration to a reduction in costs and also the better distribution of such papers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I sincerely hope that time will be made available at some time either in the life of this Parliament or of some future Parliament for adequate debate on this very detailed and important report. I particularly want to refer to that section of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> 's statement dealing with the delay in publication of the Series and the recommendations that appear on page 6 of the Committee's report under the heading 'Content of the Parliamentary Papers Series'. This matter has been the subject of comment in the Parliament on a number of occasions. I have raised it from time to time. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> the Opposition Whip, has raised the matter from time to time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> only a couple of weeks ago, moved a motion seeking the referral of the question of the lateness of the annual report of the National Gallery being presented to the Parliament to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. Only yesterday, mention was made of the report of the Royal Military College for 1976 being tabled in the Parliament in October 1977. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> made a detailed report in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> comment on that aspect this morning. </para>
          <para>I am delighted that the Committee has given a great deal of consideration to that and has proposed that in the new guidelines to be set up the Clerks of the Parliament will advise the  chairman  of the Committee on any occasion when an author body has failed to meet a statutory requirement to table its annual report, return or other document within the stated statutory period, or within a reasonable period of time following the completion of the period to which the report refers. Also, at the conclusion of each year's sitting, or as often as may be deemed necessary, the Committee will table a return in Parliament recording the titles of those reports of author bodies which have not been tabled during the stated statutory period or within a reasonable period of time following the completion of the period to which the report refers. I am pleased the Committee has made those two recommendations along with a number of other recommendations which I will not weary the Senate with at this time. </para>
          <para>In the time I have been in this Parliament it has appeared to me that there has been a tendency on the part of statutory authorities which are charged with the responsibility of reporting annually to Parliament to come to the belief that the report they must tender to the Parliament does not really matter because probably few people read it. No matter how many people do read the report, whether it be only a few or whether the number be quite large, that report is of great importance to the people who read it. It is only when the report is received, tabled in Parliament and given adequate debate that it will become effective. I think that the Committee has done a very good job. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> and all the other members on the job they have done. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para>

              <para>-It is manifestly impossible for more than very cursory observations to be made on the tabling of the report on the Royal Military College by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen.</inline> It seems to me even from the lengthy presentation of the report by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> to which I offer no objections, that there seems to be obscured in the report a problem which is not dealt with. I wish, to mention just for five minutes, with the permission of honourable senators what I see to be the omission in the report. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>First of all, the report does not deal with the subject of what I described as bureaucratic inertia. The report on the Royal Military Collegethe Duntroon report- is a perfect illustration of bureaucratic inertia. This does not seem to be confined, I might add, to the report on the Royal Military College or the Department of the Army in the Department of Defence. It is a characteristic of the bureaucratic system, anyway. Therefore, the report does not address itself, it seems to me, to that context. That is where a large element of the delay in the presentation of papers occurs. This is not confined only to the area of the great departments of state. This problem of inertia is inherent in the bureaucratic structure whether it relates to Parliament or to great departments of state. How on earth we can overcome this problem of inertia, I do not know. </para><para>The second matter that does not seem to me to be clear is that, although there has been an improvement in the technology of printing, which any visitor to the Government Printing Office can see- and I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> would arrange for a visit at any time any honourable senator wishes to do so- the inertia itself still creates a problem and there seems to be no priority in the context of the production of reports. However, I will absolve the Government Printing Office from blame because, from my experience of the printing of parliamentary papers, I think the Parliament should be extraordinarily grateful to the Office. I mention the printing of committee reports, in respect of which there is urgency from time to time. The Government Printer is able to expedite the production of these reports with great speed and, I think, with great professional skill. So I exclude the Government Printer from blame. I think the Government Printer is all right. I think the Parliament should be grateful to the Government Printer for the technology that has been evolved by his Office. But in itself this is useless unless some drive comes from the area of ministerial responsibility to overcome the inertia that exists inside the bureaucratic structure. I am afraid that that is the nature of the beast and there is no scientific evidence available to me at the present moment how speed can be inserted into the system. </para><para>I come to the third matter to which I wish to address myself. Some years ago, enthusiasts in the Australian private sector began to give prizes for the best production of annual reports. It became a competition amongst the corporate structure in Australia for producing reports and prizes were given for the best presentations. What has happened, oddly enough, is that by this sort of mirror system that we find ourselves in it has now become the habit of Government departments themselves to follow the corporate structure method of producing reports with expensive covers of one sort or another and very complicated methods of reproduction. I suggest that it is time that we went back to a sensible system involving a standardised form of presentation of reports. I put that proposal forward as emphatically as I can. The Government itself should turn its attention to this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has been called out of the Senate for the moment. He does not read the newspapers but no doubt his secretaries read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> As the Minister responsible in this area, perhaps he may lay down or examine the need for an instruction for a standardised form for the production of reports. If we can get even that simple administrative addition to the bureaucratic structure we may be able to speed up the production of reports and Government publications. I commend those views to the interest of honourable senators. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick)</inline> adjourned. </para></speech>

            <para>- by leave-In September I tabled in the Senate, the reports prepared by the Schools Commission and the Tertiary Education Commission in response to the Government's guidelines for the 1978-80 rolling triennium. At that time I drew attention to the fact that both commissions had confined themselves essentially to making firm recommendations for 1978 only. Both commissions have proposed comprehensive reports early in 1978 on the needs and priorities of their respective areas covering the period 1979-81 which will also include financial allocations within the existing planning guidelines for 1979 and 1980- The Government has accepted this plan of action by the commissions and looks to the reports to provide valuable advice for the framing of the guidelines for the 1979-81 rolling triennium- </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The guidelines provided by the Government enabled the commissions to recommend programs for 1978 totalling $1,740. 7m, at December 1976 cost levels. The wages and salaries components of recurrent grants which, of course, comprise the major part of education expenditure, will be fully supplemented for cost increases in 1978. The effect of the guidelines has been to establish base levels of expenditure for 1978 at the same real level as for 1977 in the case of universities, colleges of advanced education and schools. For technical and further education the 1978 base level of expenditure will be 10 per cent higher in real terms than for 1 977. </para>
          <para class="block">I turn now to the programs in each sector. </para>
		  <para>Tertiary Education</para>
        <para class="block">The Government has accepted the financial recommendations of the Tertiary Education Commission for the expenditure of recurrent and capital funds in respect of universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education. Accordingly the following base level of funds will be provided for 1978:  $m (December 1976 Cost Levels) </para>
        <para class="block">In accepting the Commission's financial recommendations, the Government has agreed to the proposed small adjustments to capital expenditure for each sector. This transfer arose from the Commission's review of capital projects required by the guidelines and reflects its estimate of likely cash flow for the building program in the advanced education sector in 1 978. However, all projects contained in the Advanced Education Council's program for 1978 have been retained and will proceed. The Government has also accepted the proposals for an increase in expenditure of $3m for technical college buildings in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland and for an additional $2m to be made available for university capital projects to provide a building for student and staff facilities and administration at Deakin University. </para>
        <para>The Commission had also proposed that the Minister be empowered under States grants legislation to effect transfers of funds as recommended by the Commission. The Government believes it is essential to the co-ordination and rationalisation roles of the Commission that it have as much flexibility as possible. The Government has decided therefore that, as an extension to existing arrangements, the Minister should be empowered to effect transfers of capital funds between sectors and between States after advice from the Commission. The States grants legislation will provide that any transfers will be subject to prior consultation by the Commission with the appropriate State authorities and that the details of any such transfers will be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament as soon as practicable. </para>
		<para>Schools</para>
        <para class="block">The Government's expenditure program for schools in 1978 amounts to $57 lm in December 1976 cost levels. Government schools will receive $337.3m, and non-government schools $2 10.2m; while $23.4m is to be shared jointly between the government and non-government sectors. Details of proposed expenditure on individual programs in each State are shown in the table that follows. As indicated in my statement of 8 September when I tabled the Commission's report, the Government has taken its decisions having regard to those allocations of the Commission which are consistent with the guidelines. It has accepted all of the proposals made by the Commission on this basis. The recommendations accepted provide for the continuation of all existing programs for government and non-government schools. These are: General resources programs- general recurrent grants, including funds for child migrant and multi-cultural education, emergency aid for non-government schools, and capital grants; specific purpose programs- disadvantaged schools and schools in disadvantaged country areas, special education for handicapped children including children living in institutions, development and services including education centres, and special projects including funds for school based innovations. </para>
        <para>I deal first with government schools. The recommendations of the Commission which the Government has accepted provide for programs for government schools of $209.4m for recurrent expenditure and $ 127.9m for capital; the break-up of general resources grants being in accordance with the wishes of the States. This compares with programs of $2 13.5m for recurrent and $ 134.1m for capital in 1977. The slightly lower level of Schools Commission grants to government schools in the States in 1978 needs to be considered against the broader context of total funds available to the State governments. Schools Commission grants represent about 15 per cent of the total cost of government schools in the States and are provided as a topping up of State government resources. Thus the Commonwealth's revenue sharing grants to the States are highly significant in considering funding for government schools. In assessing the financial resources available to government schools, both the general revenue and capital funds allocated to them by the States and by Schools Commission funding must be taken together. With an increase in Commonwealth payments to the States this financial year of more than $600m or 17 per cent under the tax sharing arrangements, the States have ample capacity to further increase their spending on education if they wish. </para>
        <para>Although the resource levels in non-government schools have increased the Commission's report reveals that the gap between the average levels of resource usage in government and non-government schools has widened since 1972. It is to help reduce further deterioration in the relative position of non-government schools, that the Government has accepted the recommendation made by the Commission in its 1977-79 report, and reaffirmed in its report for 1978, that per capita grants for non-government schools should be linked to per pupil running costs in government schools. This link, together with enrolment increases and changes in levels of support is expected to cost an additional $8. 8m in 1978. The Commission in its 1977-79 report expressed itself sympathetic to the difficulties facing those who seek to start new non-government schools and noted that stationary funds in non- government schools effectively placed limits on future enrolments. The Government has decided to provide in 1978 an additional $3m in capital grants to non-government schools specifically to assist building programs in newly expanding areas of population, to be allocated on a needs basis on the recommendations of planning and finance committees. The Government has also decided, in line with its long-standing policy, to allocate $2m as a first step in raising per capita grants to non-government schools in levels one and two to a basic 20 per cent of government school running costs. The per pupil amounts for 1978 compared with those in 1977, in March 1977 price levels and expressed as percentages of standard government school costs, are set out below. These amounts will, of course, be paid in terms of the relevant price levels which obtain in 1978. </para>

        </para>
        <para class="block">Non-government general recurrent grants for 1978 will continue to be distributed in the same manner as in 1977. Block grants will be paid to central authorities for systemic schools, while individual non-systemic schools will receive direct payments. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that funding for the emergency assistance scheme of $500,000 would be appropriate next year within the total funds available. This scheme provides emergency grants to non-government schools suffering severe financial difficulties as a result of an unexpected drop in enrolments of country students. </para>
        <para>I turn now to specific purpose programs. The Government will be continuing programs for disadvantaged schools and country areas, and for special education including provision for children in institutions, at the same base level as in 1977. As recommended by the Commission, the base program for migrant and multi-cultural education, while the same in total, has been adjusted between States and systems to bring the payments more into line with the actual distribution of migrant children. </para>
        <para>An amount of $ 14.8m will be provided for the services and development program for 1978. The Government has accepted the Commission's  recommendation that the allocations for development activities and associated staff replacement should be combined to give more flexibility to the States. For the special projects program, the Government has accepted the proposed allocation of $3.6m to be comprised of $3m for school level innovations and S0.6m for national level activities.

Last year it was extended to the country areas. It relates to the disadvantaged country area programs. It is in its initial stages. The amount of money is relatively inflexible. I do not think it can be compared with the amount for emergency services. The amount of money for emergency services is a figure set aside each year to keep viable schools which get into some disability and need instant support. There is no co-relation between the two. The amount of money is relatively small. It has to be drawn upon each year. In itself, it is a modest sum compared with the demands which might be placed upon it. </para>

Might I say that it was only at about 10.30 this morning- it may have been about 10.15 this morning- that we learned officially that we would be asked to sit in this chamber tomorrow to consider some legislation that is now before the House of Representatives. This is the second time this year that the Government has introduced in hasty manner legislation that the Opposition collectively as a party has not been able to consider at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labor Party, and the second time this year that the Government has expected members of the Opposition to sit idly by and allow a motion of this nature to pass without comment. </para>

        <para>I think it was toward the end of last session, although it may have been earlier this session, the Senate was asked to sit on a Friday, again in connection with industrial legislation. That legislation, which was ill conceived legislation, was presented to the Parliament in a very hasty manner, so much so that one of the Government senators- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight</inline> from the Australian Capital Territory- said at the time that he had some doubts as to whether he should support it but when a vote was taken on it he supported it. That legislation was introduced in that vein. I am told by my colleague in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Willis,</inline> that the legislation that it is contemplated will be dealt with by the Senate tomorrow- that the Government has asked the Senate to deal with tomorrow- is legislation of a very complex nature. It relates to the deregistration of unions and to the deregistration of one section of a union against another section of a union. It is legislation that could have serious industrial consequences, legislation that could well be the subject of a contest in the Federal Court of Australia and legislation that could well be contested in the High Court of Australia. </para>
        <para>The Senate is being asked to sit tomorrow for the purpose of approving legislation which at this very moment has not been seen by honourable senators in this chamber. I said earlier this year that the Government was making the Parliament and the parliamentary process an utter farce. The Government espouses full and open discussion on all matters except those that, for electoral purposes and for cheap political purposes, it wishes to hush up until the last moment in the hope that it will get some political capital out of doing so. A difficult industrial situation certainly exists in the Latrobe Valley of Victoria. </para>
        <para class="block">We understand that; we know that. It exists principally because of the Government's economic policies. I understand that another sitting of the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has been convened to try to achieve a settlement of that dispute. Inflammatory legislation of the type which the Senate is expected to debate tomorrow and which has not been introduced in this chamber must have the effect of inflaming the parties to what we hope are conciliatory moves that are going on at present. </para>
        <para>We suggest that the action of the Government in asking the Senate to sit tomorrow to consider the legislation is not for the purpose of curing industrial unrest. The Government's actions are designed to cause industrial chaos. The employers of this nation- the manufacturers of this nation- are as concerned about this type of legislation as are the employees in the work force. We were told this morning that the Senate would sit until about 5 p.m. tomorrow. If satisfactory progress is not being made the legislation probably will be guillotined or gagged by the Government at about 4.30 p.m. This has happened in a week in which not one Bill has been introduced into the Senate. This has been the pattern of the sittings of the Senate since the Parliament was reconvened in August. We know that, but for urgency motions being moved by the Opposition and but for our proceeding with General Business debates, the Government would have been hard put to keep this chamber in session. </para>

            <para>-The Government does not believe in the Parliament and it does not believe in the right of the Opposition to debate certain issues in the Parliament. It is a farce, it is a sham and it is a smokescreen for the creation of an election issue. The Government knows that it cannot handle the economy, that the economy is getting completely out of hand. The government knows that things are going to be so bad next year because of its policies this year. In typical fashion it is looking for someone else to blame. This is the Government's excuse for holding an election. For a long time the Government has been saying that it needed a full three-year term of office to overcome the economic problems. We now find the Government introducing this type of legislation which it expects the Senate to debate tomorrow and which has not been seen in this chamber to this very minute. All I can say is that this is just a farce. As I have said, the Opposition opposes the motion put forward by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </para>

It is a protest that I repeat every session when industrial legislation is brought in during the last days of a session and accompanied by a gag motion designed to prevent the Opposition debating that legislation fully. On the last day of the sitting in June we had amendments to the trade practices legislation for the purpose of encompassing industrial organisations. We had amendments to the industrial code legislation for the purpose of establishing the Industrial Relations Bureau, and gag motions were applied on the ground that it was a matter of urgency that the legislation be passed on that last day. The Industrial Relations Bureau legislation has not yet been proclaimed, but we had to sit on a Friday to pass it as a matter of urgency because we were told the country needed it! It was clearly not urgent at all. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In regard to the legislation now under discussion, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> has stated on the radio that it has been under consideration and preparation for weeks. It is not connected with the Latrobe Valley problem. It is an improvement, he tells us, to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Therefore it is not urgent. There is not some crisis, in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street's</inline> own words, that demands that we get the legislation through this week. The object is really to stop proper debate on the legislation. </para>
        <para>Having obtained a copy of the Bill, which covers some 28 pages of very intricate matter, which it would take greater capabilities than my own to understand, I went down to the Records Office to obtain a copy of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I find that they have a composite copy made up to 1 976, and that there are seven groups of amendments, covering many pages, that one has to consolidate before one knows what the Act is all about. There is no one in this chamber unless he be an adviser to the Minister, who could tell us what section 132 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is about. One would have to study possibly six or seven documents to know what it is, and what we seek to change in the legislation under discussion. I do not think it is fair to the large section of the working class community involved that legislation governing their whole lives and operations should be pushed through this chamber, on every occasion, on the last day of sitting, on the basis that some urgency has arisen. </para>
        <para>I endorse the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland to the effect that the Government wants to introduce the legislation as an election ploy because it believes that it cannot win at the polls next year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> himself has said that there is justification for it, 'because what can we do in the six months of government remaining'? The suggestion is not that it will mean six months plus another three years of office for this governmentbut that the Government will be in office for six months only if it does not get an election now. So, for the purposes of an election, we are having legislation rushed through this House, without honourable senators knowing what it is all about and suffering from an inability to study it in the time available. </para>
        <para>It is said that it is greatly urgent. We see that sections 5, 11, 15, 17, 18, 19 and 21, paragraphs 23 (a) and (b), and sections 24, 25, 28 and 31 shall come into operation on such respective dates as are fixed by proclamation. It will not come into operation with the Government's consent if consideration extends beyond tomorrow. All of the vital clauses come into play at such time as the Government decides; therefore it is not urgent. If there were some urgency, the settling of some dispute - </para>

            <para>-In discussing that the question is: Why should we sit at 10 o'clock- an unusual time to meet- on a Friday. The Minister has told us that the passage of the Bill is essential but I am pointing out that it is not, other than for the Government's political purposes; that it is not essential for industrial relations, nor for the good of Australia, and that in the process the Government is making a farce of the Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I am trying to demonstrate this by showing what is in the Bill and that, although we are talking about urgency, we are asked to leave it to the Government at some future date to proclaim the legislation. On previous occasions when, after sitting for four or five months, we were compelled to stay back to pass certain legislation, which we were unable properly to discuss and consider because of the way it was rushed through this chamber, that legislation was not proclaimed and it has not yet been proclaimed. Therefore, the Government's excuses are farcical and simply not borne out by the evidence; its action cannot be justified. </para>
        <para>I have in mind the enormity of the legislation, for whether or not we believe in trade unions or the worker's right to strike, such actions have grown up over the years in this country and if we were to desire to end them every aspect should first have the fullest and most detailed consideration as to how best this could be done and not dealt with in such a way that the Senate cannot properly take into consideration whether the legislation contains the appropriate clauses. </para>
        <para>We have not the time necessary to study the 28 pages of the legislation, nor the earlier complicated amendments that we would first have to consolidate for the purpose of knowing what the present Act is and what we are trying to alter. That is the problem facing senators, and no one in this chamber can claim that he is capable of giving the legislation proper consideration in the time allotted. We are asked to pass it on the assurance of the Minister that the nation needs it. We know from history that it does not. I would ask the Senate not to pass the motion. </para>

          <para>- The last two speeches have been very interesting, because they have indicated how greatly out of touch is the Opposition with the Australian people who, I have no doubt, regard any legislation in this field as extremely urgent and probably overdue.

                <inline font-weight="bold">-Would Senator Georges</inline>mind not instructing me? I have other people doing that, who pay me. The purpose of this Bill is to provide the machinery necessary for the collection of the levy imposed by the Oilseeds Levy Bill 1977 and to establish an Oilseeds Research Trust Account to fund an oilseeds research scheme. This Bill should be read as one with the Oilseeds Levy Bill 1977. The Bill provides for the Act to become operative on the same date on which the Oilseeds Levy Act 1977 comes into operation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The levy is imposed on the production of oilseeds and growers are liable to pay the levy. However, for practical and administrative reasons the levy will be collected by the Commonwealth from the crusher, or other person, to whom the grower delivers his oilseeds. There is, of course, provision for the crusher, or other person, who pays the levy on behalf of the grower to deduct the amount of the levy from the purchase price of the oilseeds or otherwise recover from the grower an amount of levy paid on his behalf to the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides for the establishment and operation of a joint Commonwealth-industry research scheme for the oilseeds industry. The funds raised by means of the levy will be paid into the Oilseeds Research Trust Account and the Government will provide a matching contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis to meet expenditure from the Trust Account on approved research projects. </para>
          <para>It is the established policy of the Government to foster schemes of this nature to undertake research into the problems that exist in our rural industries. The oilseeds industry will become one of the many primary industries where this joint approach to research between the industry and Government is undertaken. Similar schemes are already operating successfully in respect of the wool, meat, wheat, dairy, pig and chicken meat and other rural industries. </para>
          <para>The oilseeds industry in Australia is in a relatively early stage of development. Small quantities of linseed and safflower have been grown for many years but over the past decade an expansion of output particularly in sunflowerseed, rapeseed and soybeans has occurred. Even though the industry is relatively new its value of production is already over $40m annually. About half of Australia's vegetable oil requirements are imported and it therefore has significant import saving potential. </para>

          <para>Moreover oilseed growing represents an important alternative to the more traditional grain crops. The industry is thus one of great potential. There is scope for an expansion in oilseeds production but if this potential is to be realised the industry must develop on a sound basis with an increased research effort to improve yields, combat pests and diseases and develop varieties that are suitable to the Australian environment. </para>
          <para>This scheme will contribute to a proper ordering of priorities in oilseeds research. At the same time it will ensure that the funds from the Trust Account are expended on research projects that are additional to and do not merely replace the existing research effort. The proposal for an oilseeds research scheme was initiated by the oil.seeds committee of the Australian Wheatgrowers' Federation. The Government has expressed its willingness to participate with the oilseeds industry in a jointly financed research scheme. The Australian Agricultural Council has also endorsed the proposed scheme. </para>
          <para>The Bill establishes an Oilseeds Research Committee which will make recommendations concerning expenditure from the Trust Account. The research committee will comprise five members, one from each producing State, representing the oilseeds growing industry and one member each representing the Australian Agricultural Council, the Commonwealth Scientific and industrial Research Organisation, Australian universities and the Department of Primary Industry. The main function of the committee will be to consider research proposals and formulate recommendations on a program of research and on expenditure for the oilseeds industry for approval by the Minister for Primary Industry. Purposes for which moneys from the Account may be expended broadly follow the precedent established for other joint Commonwealth-industry research schemes and will be used for scientific, economic or technical research into the oilseeds industry. </para>
          <para>With the expected commencement of the legislation on 1 November and given the seasonal pattern of production involving peak deliveries in summer and autumn, the bulk of the first season's levy money will become available late in the current financial year. Accordingly, the program of research will not become fully operational until the 1978-79 financial year. The proposed research scheme is a logical extension of the schemes already operating successfully for other rural industries. In the oilseeds industry there are important problems to be overcome. The industry is fully aware of the problems that exist and recognises that a planned research program would assist in determining solutions to these problems. </para>
          <para>I consider that the industry has shown a responsible attitude in taking the initiative to bring forward the proposals that are now incorporated in the legislation before the Senate. The Government has conferred with all sections of the oilseeds industry concerning these proposals. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>- I wish to speak to this motion because I believe we have come to a point where co-operation in the Senate is breaking down. For that reason I want to make it perfectly clear that if the Government intends to behave as it has today it will find that we will endeavour to place our point of view clearly and perhaps at length on every possible occasion. This morning a proposition was put to the Senate that it should sit tomorrow. The Opposition wished to debate that proposition and to explain that we thought it was unnecessary to sit tomorrow. This is not the end of the session. We will have a sitting of the Senate next week and it would be possible, because of our light program, to debate next week the legislation that it is proposed we should debate tomorrow. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>What seems to have happened is that the House of Representatives has taken it for granted that it can put through legislation on a Thursday and demand that the Senate sit on Friday to deal with that legislation. As a person who has to make arrangements on behalf of senators on this side of the House, I resent that strongly. Arrangements have been made by many senators to keep commitments as far away as Port Hedland in Western Australia. Some senators have already undertaken commitments and have left this place. The Government now proposes that we should suddenly change those arrangements and bring the senators back to this place in order to carry out a program that is thrust upon us by the House of Representatives. We should have been permitted to have a reasonable debate on the proposition because it concerns the position of the Senate in relation to the House of Representatives. We ought not to accede easily to the demands of the House of Representatives. If we accede on this occasion, as we did on a previous occasion, we will find that we will be sitting at the behest of the House of Representatives and not in order to carry out our own program. </para>
        <para>What happened this morning when we were putting that proposition was that we were gagged. If the gag is going to be applied in a situation such as that, the Government can expect that on every possible occasion we will endeavour not to assist in the passage of legislation but will resist that passage. The Government will then have to carry out its desires and use the gag and the guillotine, misuse the procedures that have been established in this place over a long period. It is all very well to talk about guillotining a Bill on the last day of sitting after a particularly long session. Perhaps even on the last occasion those of us who were party to that may have objected personally to the procedure but we went along with it. Nevertheless, it should not become an established procedure in this place, and that is what is happening today. The Government has applied the gag and prevented the Opposition from putting a case. What is to prevent us from proceeding next Tuesday with the debate on the legislation that is coming from the House of Representatives? If I recall correctly, on the previous occasion the legislation was put through the Senate hurriedly on the Friday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has indicated already that that legislation has not been proclaimed. </para>

        <para>SenatorGEORGES-The honourable senator has been here for sufficient time to realise that it is the responsibility of the Government to maintain the chamber. It is not our responsibility. The Opposition has been quite easy with the Government over a period of time. I recall that when we were in government we were subjected to the continual calling of quorums. We were subject to continual irritation. Our Ministers were placed under considerable pressure. It seems to me that what the Government is looking for is a return to that situation. In other words, the Government wants to make of us an Opposition that will irritate, frustrate and delay. That was not our intention. We have even gone along with the Government to assist it to maintain a program in this place. I have before me the program for the next three weeks. It is very light on. If we sought not to co-operate, the Government would have been fully engaged in maintaining its own program. Next week it hardly has a program. The proposed program for the three weeks which I h ave in my hand does not include any Bill of substance. There is the Loan Bill that has been the subject of some gentle and quite tolerant query on our part. It was not the aggressive approach that Government senators undertook when the Loan Bill was before the Senate during the period of the Labor Government. Honourable senators opposite deferred and delayed the Bill and sought an excuse to throw out the elected government. We are merely querying certain parts of that Loan Bill. Honourable senators will remember that last night the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> allowed the Loan Bill to pass through the Senate on the understanding that certain questions would be answered. That is a quite different approach from the approach adopted by honourable senators opposite when they were in Opposition. </para>
        <para>The debate on the Budget Papers has been going on in a leisurely fashion. There has been no substantial legislation before the Senate. Suddenly the House of Representatives decides that it needs some urgent legislation which is similar to previous legislation which the Government did not proclaim. It suddenly needs the legislation, and demands that the Senate should sit on Friday and that honourable senators should alter all their arrangements and commitments to pass the legislation in a hurry which, the Government says, it possibly will not proclaim anyhow. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I am saying to you that the Senate over which you preside is being made to look ludicrous. It is a mockery that we should be treated in this way and I am hoping that the Government will accept this as the case. However, I do not think so. The Government is in difficulty at the present time. Honourable senators opposite would like to gag what I am saying but until I sit down they will not be in a position to do so. An honourable senator opposite will endeavour to get the call and I do not doubt that he will gag this debate. If that is the way the Government wants to behave, by all means we will give it the opportunity. I might give that opportunity to the Government in a minute or I might endeavour to bring in some more honourable senators to support my case. </para>

            <para>-We at least have accepted our position since the Australian Labor Party was formed. We make no excuses. We make no explanations. When we join our Party and work with our Party we accept that we shall abide by the decisions made, and support those decisions. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> I was saying that we have certain Party disciplines which we declare and which we have always declared. We do not say one thing and do another. The Liberals are proud of the fact that they sometimes say one thing and do another. They regard that as freedom of conscience. They claim that they have a right to a so-called conscience vote. It all depends on whether they can do it without the weight of party discipline coming down upon them. They will do it if they can get away with it. But at all other times they do exactly what we on this side do; that is, they adhere to the party requirement and to the program of the party. It would be a very sad Parliament if that were not the position. </para>

        <para>I am a strong believer in the two-party system. I believe in party disciplines because they are in effect the watch dog which safeguards the people and the electorate against log-rolling and wheeler-dealing on the part of groups of members or individual members. So, make no mistake, I believe in party disciplines. I am one who hesitates to encourage a senator on the other side to cross the floor. I might do it for a short term political advantage, but I do not really believe in what I am doing. I certainly would not like anyone on the other side of the chamber to endeavour to encourage me to cross the floor just for a momentary advantage. There is only one exception to that, and that is on a matter of strict conscience. In this place we have had only one such matter that I can recall, and that was the capital punishment legislation. There may have been one or two occasions on which the parties freed their members from the disciplines of the party; but on all other occasions, make no mistake about it, when we on this side see honourable senators cross the floor, even though we might have encouraged them to come across our respect for them does not increase in any shape or form. </para>
        <para>The motion before the Senate is that the Bill may be taken through all its stages without delay. In normal circumstances we would agree to that motion being carried and we would have the debate on the Bill at a later stage. Let us test what the Government intends to do for the rest of the day and let us test the Government's attitude to the special sitting tomorrow. Is it to be the last time that such a sitting will be thrust upon the Senate? Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> accepted that in future this shall be the procedure? Is the Senate to sit for three days a week without substantial legislation for debate, and then suddenly to have to sit an extra day while the members of the House of Representatives go about their electoral commitments? Tomorrow there will be no pairs because the Government has called off the pairs arrangement. It will have to do that for tomorrow's sitting. It has a statutory requirement that it has to meet, so I do not blame the Government. It has called off the pairs arrangement. </para>

            <para>-That is right; we have two senators overseas. I can understand the Government's reason. Tomorrow, because of what has been done in the other place, the Minister is forced to inconvenience all senators on the Government side. He is forcing the Opposition to inconvenience its senators, to break their appointments and commitments tomorrow; but a member of the House of Representatives is going to participate at Port Hedland in a debate on a very important question, namely, the exploitation and export of uranium. It was supposed to be- and rightly so-part of the national debate that we are undertaking so that the electorate can be enlightened on the export of uranium. I hope that the people will oppose the export of uranium. I believe that, given sufficient time, they will. Nevertheless, there is to be an all-party debate in Western Australia tomorrow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> was to take part in that, but of course he cannot go tomorrow because of the special sitting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> also was to take part in that debate, and he will go because a member of the House of Representatives will take part in that debate and that member is the only one who can keep that appointment, free of the limitations of the parliamentary program. </para>

        <para>Let us get it clear: If we accept without any question what the Government is proposing for tomorrow, then it will be done again and again. All we wanted to do earlier in the piece was to express an opinion. I intended to say at that stage what I am saying now. That is what I intended to say. I intended to say: 'We are being misused. </para>
        <para class="block">We are being pushed around. We ought not to be pushed around in this fashion'. What happened? The Government applied the gag. It is useless to apply the gag to me when the procedures of the Senate will allow me to speak at a later stage. They not only allow me to speak later but also encourage me to speak at greater length. The application of the gag is a foolish practice to follow. </para>
        <para>We have come to an understanding in this Parliament, especially in the Senate, that we can make a speech in 10 minutes much better than we can make the same speech in 30 minutes. There has been general agreement on both sides of this chamber that we should not take up all the time that is available to us; that we should say what we have to say, sit down and give somebody else an opportunity to speak. But, if the Government follows this practice of applying the gag, then we will stand up and speak for the whole hour that is available to us or for the half an hour that is available to us on days when the proceedings are broadcast. That is just wasting the valuable time of the Senate. </para>

        <para>In view of the serious situations which exist in industry and in the community generally, it is a sad reflection on the Senate that it is not given sufficient opportunity to discuss at length very serious legislation which will affect dramatically the relationships between employers and employees in private industry and in government. Had we had the opportunity this afternoon to express at some length our differences about the procedures, we might well have cleared up some of the misunderstandings about the need for the Senate to sit tomorrow. Obviously for that reason honourable senators such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges-</inline> I hope other honourable senators will do the same- are entitled to discuss the procedures of the Senate as they relate to legislation enacting Government policy. </para>
        <para>I remind honourable senators that only a few hours ago when I asked the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack),</inline> a question about the very legislation which will cause us to meet tomorrow, he made the very clear statement that the legislation had nothing to do with the State Electricity Commission in Victoria. He said that the legislation merely reformed a series of legislative procedures covering industrial relations which the Government had had under consideration for many months and which for some time had been before the National Labour Advisory Council. It is a sad reflection on the Senate that this legislation has been considered by outside bodies such as the National Labour Advisory Council- I understand that it has been before that body for well over a month- but we will be given so little time to consider it. Outside organisations, such as the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the unions have had an opportunity to discuss and to think about the Government's proposals contained in this legislation. They know what is contained in the legislation. </para>

For that very reason, I am raising related matters of procedure which have been dealt with this afternoon and which certainly impel me to protest. More than once, I have risen in the Parliament and pointed out that the Parliament has again to come into its own. I think that, generally speaking, people have agreed with that. </para>

I put it to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and to the Senate that today no honourable senators on this side of the chamber will agree to the speedy passage of this Bill, as the motion of the Leader of the Government requires, for the very reason I have stated, namely, that we are dissatisfied with the procedures of the Senate as they are now being organised by the Leader of the Government. For that reason, this debate is related to the debate which took place earlier. The matters are inter-connected and honourable senators ought to have regard to that fact. </para>

        <para>We are advising the Senate about these matters. I am quite sure that not only on this occasion but also later this day- I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> you will facilitate this- we will seek to bring these matters before the Senate. Every honourable senator should be entitled to complain about unnecessary frustration. What is more, the actions of the Leader of the Government now are very similar to his actions when we were in government. Those actions were then very strongly contested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall.</inline> Of course, later today, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall-</inline><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> Perhaps I should take the opportunity to summarise what I was putting forward. However, I do not think I shall do that in the terms that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> did because it seemed to me that by the time he concluded his remarks he had made the wicket very unfavourable for my entry. But, for the benefit of the Senate, I do hope that, on reflection, the Leader of the Government might see the need to allow the Senate during the day to consider not only the sorts of issues I have raised in respect of the Bill which is before us, but also the wider issue of the conduct of the business of the Senate. I think it would be a good thing to have those feelings made clear before we go any further with other debates. I hope that the Leader of the Government in the Senate will take notice of the resentment which has been shown by Opposition speakers in relation to the matter raised. </para>

            <para>- I am doing nothing more than taking the words of the Opposition. It has said that it will not have time to study an important Bill which is coming into the Senate. There is no misconstruction put on the words of honourable senators opposite. It is a claim which the Opposition has clearly made. It became ap- parent early this afternoon that the Opposition ad one thing in mind. It is deliberately working against the people of Australia- all of themwho are dependent on urgent legislation which is coming into the Parliament. I believe, of course, that a factor in this matter relates to the thinking of the Opposition which is unable to face up to a number of questions, especially when they relate to industrial matters. </para>

        <para>One wonders why the Opposition, if it disclaims any interest in something else which is to come before the Senate, wishes to hold up the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Amendment Bill which affects growers in Queensland and New South Wales. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. Either it is deliberately working against the assistance which this subsidy will provide or it is doing the former thing which I mentioned. It is one or the other. There are no two ways. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> whilst he was rambling, repetitive and irrelevant was somewhat honest in his attitude. He made no pretence about what he was trying to do. He is simply using this situation as a device to hold up the passage of further legislation. I suppose there is little one can say and still keep to the Standing Orders. Very few honourable senators who have spoken so far have kept to the Standing Orders. It is difficult, therefore, to answer their irrelevancies except to say that the people of Australia will be interested to know that the people who are to get the subsidy will have the subsidy delayed in some way or that further legislation in which people are interested is causing such acute embarrassment to the Australian Labor Party in some way that it would like to put off even thinking of making a decision on that legislation. </para>
        <para>I believe that honourable senators opposite should rethink their course at this time. It illbecomes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> 'Byrne to jump into the breach and join his colleagues in a delaying action which does no credit to the Labor Party. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0</inline> 'Byrne would do much better to consider the essentials which are facing Australia at the moment. He would do much better to consider his electors and constituents and their concern in the community. He should facilitate discussion in the Senate and not hold it up by irrelevancies. </para>

            <para>- Thank you. I must say that I was provoked into referring to that matter because of the invitation that was so kindly extended to me by the honourable senator who has just resumed his seat. I intended to describe him as a Jacob, or a man with a coat of many colours, or a political chameleon. The reason I got to my feet was that this motion to pass this measure through all its stages without delay is part of the Government's program which is changing the character of this House of review, this Parliament, this Senate. It is virtually being changed into a chamber of horrors. When I talk about horrors, there are certainly some reactionary horrors on the other side of the Senate. They are all prone to talk about the importance of this chamber and about it not having time to deliberate over important legislation. Now they have the temerity to charge the Opposition with filibustering when we talk about the history of legislation of this kind which has been before the Parliament. In 1947 this measure was debated for a month. </para>

            <para>-No, the measure the Government wants to get on to by hurrying this Bill through the House. I am speaking about undue haste. I am talking about the program of the Government. It wants to have this measure brought on and passed or adjourned without the deliberation and review which we claim we could give to it in the Parliament. I make the point that the Senate is being turned into a charade and a farce by political hit and run men. I describe Government people as hit and run men because they are doing to the Parliament and to the institution of the Senate what ruthless and reckless power crazed road hogs do to the pedestrians of this country. They run over people regardless of the conventions and customs of the country. Members of the Government are doing their evil worst to divert the Parliament from its traditional role into an authoritarian role which is to be equalled only by the pre-war days of Hitler's Germany when trade unions and the Parliament in Germany faced farcical things like the burning of the Reichstag and all the other ploys which were used to fool the people. This is exactly what this Government is doing. I take the opportunity in relation to this motion to voice my strong disapproval of the Government's proposed program, including its proposal in relation to this measure. I feel certain that this Bill needs a lot more discussion and that we should not put it through all its stages without delay. I hope the Government will adjourn debate on this Bill in order to give us full discussion on it in the future. It is a matter of importance to the farmers of this country. </para>

            <para>- Nitrogenous fertilisers. As a matter of fact, the spreading of fertilisers by people on the Government side is equal to that which comes out of the farmyard in great quantities. There is no great hurry for this Bill to be passed. It is almost an annual event and therefore I object to the passage of the Bill without full consideration. I also put on record my very strong objection to the way in which legislation is being treated in this Parliament. The Government is gagging and not allowing the proper forms of the House to be applied or for review to take place in the proper way. </para>

          <para>- I bring to the attention of the Senate and, indeed, to the attention of the people of Queensland the filibuster which has been instituted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> over this most important Bill. The Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Amendment Bill is important to sugar farmers. The sugar industry is one of the most important industries in Queensland. It is an export industry of immense value to Australia. It has helped in the decentralisation of Queensland. Many people in our ancillary industries are reliant on it. Yet here this afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> a senator from Queensland who is supposedly here to represent that State, is trying to hold up this BUI. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I point out what the previous Administration did not do for the sugar industry when it was in power. It was unable to conclude an international sugar agreement. When the previous agreement ran out the Labor Government was not able to conclude a new sugar agreement. Instability has hung over the sugar industry from that time until the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> was able to conclude an agreement two or three weeks ago. The Labor Government's record in looking after the sugar industry is abysmal. It would have been headed for disaster next year except for the fact that the  Deputy  Prime Minister was able to do what the previous Government could not do, namely, conclude a suitable agreement with set quotas which will bring stability and a reasonable price back into the industry. Now, this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> is holding up a Bill which will be of great assistance to the sugar producers in Queensland. </para>

            <para>- The Government accepted the adjournment and did not see fit to bring on the Bill again until some days ago. It then came over to this place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> has deliberately misled the Senate and people outside by saying that we are deliberately trying to withhold the subsidy payment to the farmers who use nitrogenous fertilisers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> repeated the remarks which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall.</inline> He said that the Opposition is delaying the passage of the Bill by speaking to the motion. Of course, that is not so. As I pointed out, when we look at the Notice Paper we see that the Bill came into the other place exactly 14 days ago. Therefore, there is no urgency. If we followed the usual procedures with this Bill what would happen? Immediately <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> moved for the Bill to be taken through all its stages without delay, we would have the first reading. Then we would have the second reading and the debate would be adjourned. It would be placed on the Senate Notice Paper for debate at some later stage. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> might be able to indicate to me by nodding that he intended this Bill to go through this place today. If he did not intend that to happen, what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> said is a complete untruth, that the Government had no intention that this Bill should go through this place today. If it had, I would have said that it defeated the very purpose of this place. We are so often reminded by honourable senators opposite that this is a House of review. The tactics being adopted here today give complete and absolute proof to every person interested in the procedures of this Senate that it is not a House of review when a Liberal Government is in office. The Government will railroad legislation through this place to suit its own purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> let the cat out of the bag in his opening remarks on the reason the Senate has to sit tomorrow. He told us- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> will not be too happy with him on this score- that the purpose of the Senate sitting tomorrow is to railroad legislation through because of the present problem in the Latrobe Valley of Victoria. That is the very purpose of the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> has already told us that. </para>

          <para>-I do not enter this debate for the purpose of delaying the passage of the Bill. It is an annual event. The House of Representatives and the Senate debate a similar Bill each year concerning the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy. On every occasion such a Bill has come before the Parliament it has enjoyed the support of the Opposition. We are not concerned with the infamous remarks about why we wish to speak in respect to this ploy- that is all we are dealing with- that the Government is putting before the Senate. It is using this Bill as a means to achieve an end. That end has been well and truly exposed by those who have spoken before me. It is to hurry up the legislation for the purpose of discussing the more contentious and controversial amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Bill we are asked to expedite was passed by the House of Representatives on 6 October. If it is an important Bill, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> suggest, why was it not debated in this House last Thursday night when, at the instigation of the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> we adjourned at 5 p.m. to go home? If it is important we could have dealt with it then and not have left it on the table until today and then use it as a means and an excuse to expedite the business of this Senate so that we can deal with matters of great moment which affect about 4 million trade unionists in this country. Of course, the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Amendment Bill is an important one from Queensland's point of view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> said that the Opposition wants to use the forms of the House. What is wrong with that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President?</inline> In the seven years I have been in this place I have seen honourable senators opposite use the forms of the House in a very notorious way to bring about their desired ends and to bring about the downfall of governments which had the majority support of the electorate in the other place. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. The Government objects when we want to use the forms of the House in order to point out the tactics being employed on this particular occasion. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline>had the audacity and temerity to suggest that we are trying to deny the sugar cane growers of Queensland the use of fertilisers. Everybody knows that this is a machinery Bill. This measure is placed before the Parliament every year. In no way will it affect the payment of a subsidy or bounty to those who want to use a nitrogenous fertiliser because it operates from 1 January 1978. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> then showed his lamentable lack of knowledge when he suggested that we failed the sugar cane growers of Queensland and elsewhere in Australia when we did not negotiate a decent price for sugar.

            <para>- I am replying to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> said, with respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> In fact, a very good price was negotiated for the sugar cane industry. Be that as it may, we are being asked to expedite the business of this place in order that we can sit for an extra day and repeat the charade that went on on 19 August when we had to stay behind for the purpose of passing an important Bill- a Bill of great urgency, to use the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> The Government guillotined the debate and denied the Opposition a chance to discuss the Bill. If it was so important, why have we not had an opportunity tor debate within the normal forms of the Parliament? Why was the Bill not brought in on Tuesday or Wednesday? </para>

        <para>Why is it that the Bill that will be introduced at 8 o'clock this evening will be brought on for debate before the members of the party that I represent have an opportunity to discuss it among themselves, let alone with the broad sections of the trade union movement that wish to discuss the matter with my party and to convey their point of view to my party so that the Bill may be debated adequately in this place and in the community generally? We are being denied the opportunity to do that on the specious ground that the Senate has to pass the Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Amendment Bill and that if it does not do that some people who are experiencing some form of hardship because of the attitude that has been taken by the Japanese Government in particular in respect of the price of Queensland sugar will be adversely affected. Of course, nothing is being said by the Government about the insulting way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> of Queensland has referred to our major trading partner- Japan- in the last 24 hours. </para>
        <para>We believe that we are entitled to have adequate time to discuss this piece of legislation and to discuss the more contentious Bill. We feel very strongly that what is required to get the economy of this country going and to get an upturn in the economy is for the Government to bring about co-operation and consensus- not confrontation. Constantly we see leading figures in the Government trying to manoeuvre us into a position where there is absolute confrontation and no dialogue. That is the tactic to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> drew attention in speaking during the previous debate. On the previous occasion on which we were forced to sit for an extra day we had to expedite the business of the Senate on the Thursday of that week in order to enable us to deal with certain legislation in the same way as we are being asked to deal with legislation tomorrow.

I learned a lot when I first became a member of this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was then leader of my party in opposition and honourable senators opposite were in government.

            <para>- Honourable senators opposite can laugh if they like, but I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson, who was the Leader of the Government in the Senate at that time, and other Government leaders pay tribute to the co-operation that was extended by the Opposition in the passage of Bills. It seems to me that, if the parliamentary process is to operate at all and to work in a sense of goodwill and some give and take, that is the way in which we ought to be dealing with this motion and that is the way in which we ought to be dealing with the Bill that is to be introduced in this chamber at 8 o'clock this evening. </para>

        <para>One can use numbers to achieve anything. God only knows, I have seen plenty of that in the Australian Labor Party. That is obviously what is happening in this chamber and what has happened in this chamber consistently. I find it somewhat difficult to appreciate the very ingrained logic of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> when a matter of this nature was dealt with on 19 August and he spoke about a program that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> put down in 1973. He went on about it at great length.  His  researchers obviously had done their job well. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> presented the time scale. </para>

            <para>- That is right. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> presented the time scale; but the interesting thing is that the Liberal and Country parties had the numbers to enable them to defeat the objective of the Government of that time. They have had the numbers in the Senate since the early 1950s. Even on that occasion a degree of goodwill was expressed that enabled the Government's program to be achieved. Is it wrong for the Opposition to suggest that that sort of philosophy ought to exist even today? If the House of Representatives wants to pass a Bill at midnight tonight it is fair enough for it to do so. It has been freely acknowledged that in 1974, immediately after the Labor Party was returned to government, honourable senators opposite set about bringing down that Government by using their numbers in this place. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>I want to see a return to the situation where there is some goodwill in respect of these matters and not the blatant use of numbers that has become characteristic of the Senate. In other words, adequate time ought to be set aside to enable the Senate to carry out its review role. In practically every case adequate time has been set aside for debates on Bills. We members of the Opposition have been chided and derided for daring to stand on our feet and use the forms of the Senate, which I did not invent and which the Labor Party did not invent but which are part of the Standing Orders upon which the tradition of the Senate has been built. In using those forms we are severely criticised. The suggestion that we are not playing the game has been made by the people who have never played the game while they have had the numbers in this chamber. Honourable senators opposite have never played the game; yet they have had the audacity to suggest that during the three brief years in which the Labor Party was in government they did not use the forms of the House to achieve their objectives not only within the parliamentary sphere but also outside-perhaps even in the vice-regal arena. </para>
        <para>Be that as it may, the fact of the matter is that we are being asked to expedite the business of this chamber for a special purpose, and we object to that special purpose. That special purpose has no relationship to urgency, particularly if it is related to what the Government did on 19 August. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> posed a very reasonable question when he asked: What is wrong with the Senate dealing next Tuesday with the contentious Bill about the trade union movement? </para>

I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> has made no case to support his contention that there is some exception here in that the two Bills are linked. There is no relationship between this Bill and the other Bill that has been referred to, except that the Labor Party wants to delay the discussion on the other Bill. </para>

I have found it very interesting, seeing that the matter has been elevated to one of great urgency, that while we have been debating it the Minister who is in charge of the Bill, according to the Notice Paper, has not even been within the precincts of the Senate. He certainly has not been ready to take over the handling of the Bill in the event of the Government succeeding in gagging the debate on the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> So, I find it difficult to appreciate the point of order that was taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall, who, when he was playing the maverick role in this chamber in 1973 and 1974, adopted an entirely different approach. </para>

            <para>-I am developing- I say respectfully, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President-</inline> the fact that the whole issue involves the right to compress the timetable of the Senate, and whether it destroys the spirit and role of this chamber as a house of review. I was simply making that point and, on the precedent of some three or four years ago mentioned by the Leader of the Government, stating that the history of the Australian Parliament abounds with instances of governments that have been extremely lenient, even in times of acute stress, in allowing points of view to be expounded, sometimes with endless repetition. </para>

        <para>Each of the speakers on this side has endeavoured to inject a different point of view in questioning the haste that is being engendered. I use the word 'haste', not in regard to the issues that people are talking about, involving future legislation, or to advocate that a leisurely tempo be adopted, but rather to emphasise the need to adopt a sane, analytical approach to the questions of the day. Often, after the seventh or eighth  speaker  has participated, some new development occurs that merits the attention of the Minister. That is the whole point I am trying <inline font-style="italic">to make.</inline> If you are going to adopt the contrary attitude, even on the Opposition side, people outside can say, 'You are rather supine; you are lazy.' </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President</inline>(Quorum formed), I suppose the most than can be said about this afternoon's debate is that when the Remuneration Tribunal next sits I ought to make a special submission to the effect that before honourable senators receive any payment at all for their services they should have to pass an examination in the procedures of the Senate. I would like to set the paper, because as surely as I stand here not one of those who have spoken would pass it. I have never heard so much nonsense about a simple motion such as was put down this afternoon. If honourable senators who have spoken so volubly in opposition had taken the slightest interest in how this Senate was run they would know why I had made that motion. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As I recall it, in the 1 1 years that I have been here that motion, or one similar to it, has been made on every Bill that has come into this place from the House of Representatives. The reasonand I will explain it to honourable senators opposite- is that, according to the Standing Orders, without the passage of such a motion one must have the first reading on one day, the second reading on another day, the committee stage on another day, and the third reading on yet another day. If the Opposition feels that that is how it would like to deal with Bills, and will let me know, I will do my best to accommodate it. For some reason or other, not one honourable senator opposite who spoke this afternoon knew that the sole purpose of moving that this Bill may pass through all its stages without delay was to prevent that sequence of events from happening. For some reason, and I realise that they live with a conspiratorial syndrome, they think that there is some deep, dark conspiracy, whereby this Bill is to be rushed through the Parliament today. </para>

            <para>-I heard a number of senators say that something else could happen tomorrow. They should indeed have an examination on the Standing Orders of this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> thought he was speaking on the first reading of the Oilseeds Levy Collection and Research Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> thought he was speaking on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which is still in the other place. For goodness' sake, if honourable senators are going to stand here and spend a lot of the taxpayers' money making great protests- I have no objection to their doing it; indeed they are entitled to do it- I ask them to speak from knowledge and not turn this chamber into a farce. That is what I object to. I do not mind the forms of this chamber being used. I have used them myself and will use them again. The forms of the Senate are to be used for proper debate on a proper motion with people knowing what the substance of the debate is all about. If ever the Senate is going to be brought into disrespect it will be by the Opposition engaging in the corny tactics they have used this afternoon, which make them the laughing stock of the gallery and the nation. I do not mind that. What I object to is that it casts a reflection on the whole of the Senate. That is what honourable senators on this side of the chamber object to. We do have some regard for the Senate. We do have some regard for the practices and procedures. That is why we did not break the arrangements for pairs. But let us not talk about pairs. We did not break the arrangements for pairs. If we are to talk about the practices and procedures of this place, the current practice- the one I adopted today- was to assist the expedition of the legislation through the Senate. I thought it would have been to the advantage of honourable senators to have a real understanding of the legislation before them. If honourable senators opposite feel that they have not yet learnt to read, let us go back to the medieval concept of first, second and third readings of a Bill. On the first day when I move that the Bill be read a first time and that motion is carried, we will ask the  Clerk  to read it, because that was the origin of this procedure. Then we will have a debate on the first reading. After the motion that the Bill be read a second time the  Clerk  will read it again and we will debate that motion. This mechanism was built into current procedures. As a result of doubtful benefits of compulsory education introduced in the last centurynone of which I have seen evident in honourable senators opposite in the 1 1 years I have been here-we have abandoned those medieval procedures. From what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> was saying today, I gather that he wants to go back to those medieval procedures. </para>

            <para>- I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> for his comments on this matter. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill that is before the chamber, the purpose of which is to implement the recommendations of the Remunerations Tribunal with respect to the salaries and allowances of judges and persons of judicial status. In response to the matter that has been raised by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> has indicated that the subject of the legislation arises as a result of a report to the Government by the Remuneration Tribunal, as distinct from a determination that is made in the case of First Division officers of the Commonwealth Public Service and as distinct from a determination made in respect of salaries and allowances of members of Parliament. So far as the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal in respect of judges are concerned, they are, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has said, in the nature of recommendations in the form of a report and are necessarily the subject of further legislative enactment. The purpose of this Bill is merely to enact the recommendations made to the Government last June by the Remuneration Tribunal in respect of salaries and allowances of judges and persons of judicial status. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Whitlam Government established the Remuneration Tribunal in 1973. The establishment of the Tribunal meant that, for the first time, an independent quasi-judicial body was established in order to review such areas as salaries and allowances of judges, to report to the Government its findings and to recommend changes to the existing system of remuneration. That is a responsibility of that Tribunal at least once a year. As I have said, the Bill gives effect to the recommendations of the Tribunal contained in its report No. 1977/2 of June 1977. The report suggests that the remuneration payable to justices and judges of Federal courts and of the Supreme Courts of the Territories and persons who have the same status as a justice or judge of those courts, should be altered in accordance with the recommendations of the Tribunal. In short, the recommendations brought in by the Tribunal are in line with the changes that have taken place in the wages and salaries of other people in the wage and salary structure of the community according to wage determinations based on indexation made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the period involved. </para>
          <para>The Remuneration Tribunal reported that alterations were desirable in the remuneration and travelling allowances payable to judges, including those members of the judiciary who occupy quasi-judicial positions, such as the  Chairman  of the Prices Justification Tribunal, at that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Williams, the  President  and  Deputy  Presidents of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal, the  President  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Director-General of Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, the  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kirby, and the  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Else-Mitchell. The Bill also provides that the appointment of a judge as a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or as a member of the Prices Justification Tribunal will not affect that judge's tenure, rank, title, status, precedence, salary, annual or other allowances or privileges as a judge and he will be taken to have had continuous tenure. </para>
          <para>The remuneration of the Director-General of Security, who is a judge, and judges of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy, the  President  of the Trade Practices Tribunal and the  Chairman  of the Grants Commission, who were judges of a court created by the Parliament or of a State supreme Court, will also be fixed and determined by Parliament. The  President  and  Deputy  Presidents of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission are to be remunerated at the same rates as the Chief Judge and Judges of the Federal Court of Australia. The Bill also extends the existing provisions in the Law Reform Commission Act, that protect the status of a judge appointed to the Commission, to a presidential member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Bill does not provide for additional remuneration for persons occupying more than one office, with the exception of the chief judges of the Supreme Courts of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>I have looked at the debate that occurred in another place, and there are one or two aspects of that debate to which I should refer now. If one peruses the report of the 1977 review of the Remuneration Tribunal it is interesting to observe that at the time the report was brought in the remuneration of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland was greater than the salary payable to the Chief Justices of the High Court of Australia. At the time of that report the salary of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland was $55,090 whereas the salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia was $52,500. Under this legislation the salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court, as recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal, is to be extended to $55,000, which is still less by some $90 than the figure appearing in the Tribunal's report as at 31 May 1977. As I understand it, since that time there has been an adjustment in the salaries of members of the judiciary in Queensland as from 1 July 1977. So notwithstanding this legislation, we have a situation where the salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia is in fact less than that payable to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland. Indeed, the same situation applies on a lesser scale to salaries payable to justices of the High Court compared with those payable to justices of the Supreme Court of Queensland, and they are about the same as those payable to justices of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. </para>
          <para>We are in a bit of a bind in that the salaries of judges of the High Court-a Federal jurisdictionare subject to determination by the Remuneration Tribunal. The Remuneration Tribunal, in trying to assess a fair salary and allowances for a judge of a Federal court, naturally must look at comparable rates being paid to judges in State judiciaries who are not subject to its determinations, and there is a criss-crossing going on over a period of time. I think the stage has been reached where we will have to consider entering into some agreement between the Commonwealth and the States to see whether we can get the one remuneration tribunal for all the judicial officers throughout Australia. Much the same situation applies in regard to salaries of members of parliament. Members of this Parliament are paid at a lesser rate, or were at the time of presentation of the 1977 review, than are members of the Queensland Parliament. Queensland parliamentarians' salaries rise automatically once a year on the basis of the quarterly cost of living adjustments that have taken place in the preceding 12 months. That provision does not apply to the salaries of members of the Federal Parliament, although I notice in the recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal in respect of First Division office holders of the Commonwealth Public Service that it recommends that there be adjustments in accordance with the changes that have taken place having regard to the quarterly determinations made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
          <para>As I have said, the provisions in the Bill are in accordance with the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal which were presented to the Government in June. The determinations made in respect of members of parliament, office holders of the Parliament, and First Division officers of the Commonwealth Public Service have now been approved by Parliament because the period of time for disapproval has now elapsed. Because Parliament approved of those other determinations, the Opposition sees no reason why this Bill should not be agreed to and therefore does not offer any opposition to it. </para>

            <para>- I intrude on this debate to make a few remarks, and I will not detain the Senate for long. Although the Remuneration Tribunal has recommended various amounts and accordingly the Parliament alters the Act and the Schedule to the Act, it is my observation of this Bill that we have recognised the different value of judges and the onerous nature of their duties and therefore have fixed different rates. For those doing comparable work in different jurisdictions we have stuck strictly to a system of comparable reward. The salary of judges in five different tribunals is to be fixed at $44,000, and that is an acceptance of the principle of comparative wage justice which has been set by wage-fixing tribunals for many years as a fair system for wages and salaries. A person considers that he is well done by or ill done by according to what is paid to someone doing like duties in some other occupation. The system has worked well. Cases do arise in which there is a variation in salary because one employee is working under a State award and another employee is working under a Federal award. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland advanced arguments on this question just a minute ago. Of course, where no such comparison can be made on the principle of comparable wage justice, there should be an uplifting of salaries or a rearrangement of positions so that people doing like work receive like rewards. I think everyone would agree with that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I mention that point today because it will be of vital interest in the debate that we will have tomorrow. We accept for the judiciary the principle of comparable wage justice which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland has argued and which I think the Government accepts. That is the only thing that the Latrobe Valley workers are seeking today. They are seeking only a reward comparable to that paid to other workers who are involved in an operation similar to that in which they are involved. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline>placed a question on the Notice Paper yesterday seeking a comparison of the pay rates of the workers in the Latrobe Valley and workers in South Australia and New South Wales. He asked whether the Latrobe Valley workers are underpaid. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland says, some people may be underpaid when their salaries are compared to those paid to other people. That is the yardstick. It is the yardstick that is denied to workers under wage indexation. If we apply the principle in this case, it should be applied in all cases. If we were prepared to extend the method of wage fixing for judges to the Latrobe Valley workers in Victoria, there would be no dispute and there would be no inconvenience to industry generally. If we have any spirit of justice we should not blame the strikers for trying to get what the Government accepts as suitable; we should be blaming governments and the arbitration machinery for not giving them what we accept as fair. </para>
          <para>I think it is only proper to note that the Chief Judge of the Australian Industrial Court, who will be deciding whether $140 a week is enough for the Latrobe Valley workers, receives a salary of $42,500 a year. The other judges of the Australian Industrial Court receive a salary of $41,500 a year, together with a $2,500 tax free annual allowance and a $5 1 a day travelling allowance when they are away from home. Honourable senators can see the lack of justice in that comparison. I make a plea that we should have sympathy for these workers. We should not put all the blame on those people who are forced to take some industrial action to obtain what is accepted by other tribunals as a fair reward for services, as is acknowledged in providing a fair reward ibr the judiciary. </para>

            <para>-I do not want to speak at any great length. I wish merely to join with other members of the Opposition in supporting the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill. However, the debate affords me the opportunity to say a few words about some of the principles which are contained in the Bill as they relate and as I believe they should relate to members of Parliament. Since the establishment of the Remuneration Tribunal we have seen a much more ready acceptance of the principle that those who hold public office are entitled to an adequate remuneration, travelling allowance and conditions. In fact in recent times we have seen some improvement in that direction. I think it has to be said that the Remuneration Tribunal has been rather tolerant and generous in its attitude to the office holders who are covered by this legislation, as indeed it has been in regard to members of the Australian Parliament. My purpose in entering the debate is to draw attention to the fact that the staff of the office holders covered by this Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill enjoy facilities much greater than those enjoyed by the staff of members of the Parliament. This is a matter to which I ask the Government to give some consideration. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Over the last couple of years I have made submissions to the Tribunal on behalf of the staff of members of Parliament, as I have direct to the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> and to the Public Service Board. Not a great deal of progress has been made, in the sense that there has not been a complete recognition of what I believe should be achieved. In other words, I am saying that the staff of the office holders who are covered by this Bill enjoy facilities better and more generous than those enjoyed by the staff of members of the Parliament. That is a deficiency in the system. When one looks at the areas of responsibility, I do not think it can be said that the staff working for members of the judiciary who are covered by this Bill should enjoy better privileges, pay and conditions than the people we employ. To that extent I have been waging a letter war with the Tribunal and with the Public Service Board. </para>
          <para>I indicate to the Minister that I was somewhat critical of the Public Service Board for not dealing with the submission that I made very early this year. I had cause to write to the Board, suggesting that it was somewhat recreant to its responsibilities in not replying to my correspondence other than by acknowledging it. I am pleased to say that this week I received a letter which I think ought to receive the consideration of Government senators. I say this because I am aware of the statement that was made in this place some time ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume.(</inline><inline font-style="italic">Quorum formed).</inline> I think the letter from the Public Service Board is of some interest and because it is related to the matters which we are debating in this Bill, which deals with the Remuneration Tribunal, I believe that I ought to make some reference to it. The letter states: </para>

              <para>- The argument that has been put forward against the claim that we are entitled to more staff to enable us to perform our duties better in the Parliament and in the public arena is that there are accommodation constraints here in Parliament House. Approximately 21,000 square feet is allocated for members of the Senate and members of the House of Representatives. Parliamentary office holdersobviously no issue is taken on this- are allocated 9,000 square feet. Ministerial suites are allocated 27,000 square feet. I am talking in round figures. House and Senate staff are allocated 17,000 square feet. The Library is allocated 16,000 square feet. The Press Gallery is allocated 6,000 square feet. In excess of 10,000 square feet is allocated to Party rooms and other sections. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>It seems to me that there is a case to be made out for an examination of this matter by those persons referred to in the letter from the Public Service Board. The Government, the Parliament, the Remuneration Tribunal, the Department of Administrative Services and the Public Service Board all have some interest in the matter of accommodation in Canberra for our staff. If there is a prima facie case that we are entitled to receive consideration for extra staff facilities in Canberra- and this has been suggested by the Public Service Board and the Remuneration Tribunal- I submit it ought to be considered by the various authorities that I have referred to including the Minister and in particular the Presiding Officers because it seems to me to be rather strange that the Senate and the members, who after all should be primary consideration of the Parliament, should be denied what I consider to be elementary rights in respect of facilities to enable them to work from this place. </para><para>I, therefore, urge the Minister when he has a chance to examine the debate and, when he looks at the emoluments that are paid to the judicial office holders under this Bill, to look also at the rights of the staff of those office holders who have full travelling rights, proper accommodation and receive all the other benefits that go to public servants. I believe that it is time that we, as members of the Parliament, should stand up and say that our staff members should have the same rights and that statutory office holders should not have staff entitlements greater than staff facilities which are available to members of the Parliament. I am sure that Government supporters would agree with me. I am not suggesting that there should be a contraction of the rights of the staff of office holders dealt with in this Bill. I am suggesting that the consideration given to the staff of office holders under this legislation should be extended to the staff of members of the National Parliament. If the National Parliament cannot establish this fundamental principle, there is something wrong with our approach to our areas of responsibility. </para></speech>

He has now heard what was said and no doubt will give consideration to the matters raised. As to the matters dealt with in this Bill, of course the legislation gives effect to the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal.

As it is mildly relevant, let me put it and then you can decide for me. I ask that the Government give consideration to amending the provisions relating to disallowance of determinations made by the Remuneration and Allowances Tribunal to enable the Senate to move to disallow part of a determination, not the whole of the determination. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is debating the Oilseeds Levy Bill 1977, the first reading of which has been moved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton).</inline> When the debate was adjourned last night, I had commenced to speak on this Bill. Before I continue my remarks, I wish to make some remarks about the happenings that have taken place here today and the situation in which honourable senators find themselves, particularly tomorrow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has already made some comments this afternoon about the' inconvenience that has been caused to many senators. I place on record the great inconvenience which has been caused to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. It had a program set down for tomorrow. It was to hear witnesses and carry out its duties in relation to the reference which is before it, that is, the Commonwealth's role in the assessment, planning, development and management of Australia's water resources. Of course, everything had been organised for this Committee to meet tomorrow. Now, out of the blue this afternoon, we find that all the proceedings of that Committee for tomorrow have had to be cancelled because the Government is bringing in a measure tonight and it will be debated tomorrow. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I said earlier today, we now find that the Senate is no longer treated as a House of Review. We will not be given an opportunity to study the legislation which is coming forward. Our party room committees will not be able to study the Bill. We just have to pass it through like the ingredients go through a sausage machine to make a sausage. No doubt that is the way the Bill will end up. </para>

              <para>-I am sorry, but I was diverted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer.</inline> As I say, through you <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer,</inline> I shall refer to some of those matters which have a great similarity and which were referred to by a man who is now back within the folds of the Liberal Party. He referred to these matters when he was outside the fold, when he had left the Liberal Party. But it has now welcomed him back. I shall refer to those matters later on during my remarks on the first reading of the Oilseeds Levy Bill. Before doing so I express my concern at the chaos which has come about because of the Government's decision. I do not blame the people in the Senate. I do not think even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> was aware of the procedures which were to be adopted. He said he was not and I believe him. He could not give us any information when he was asked earlier in the day. Now we find that the whole program which honourable senatorsno doubt on the Government side toohave laid down has had to be thrown out the window because the Senate is to meet tomorrow to pass legislation. I now get back to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> was saying. I was very disturbed last night when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> castigated the Labor Party. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I know he is. Now he fires salvos at the Labor Party. He talks about it being discredited by its record and inhibited by its origins. Every member of the parliamentary Labor Party and every member of every branch of the Labor Party is very proud of the origins of the Labor Party. The Labor Party, as we all know, grew up through the trade union movement. We make no apologies for working hand in glove with the trade union movement to better the lot of the work force in this country which persons like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> do their utmost to discredit. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> came in here and quoted from the latest census of all the categories of people engaged in different avenues of employment in the seat which he will endeavour to win. One would think that he had great concern for the people because he lists the categories in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> He made great play of this. I wonder why he has suddenly taken such an interest in the work force in the suburbs of Adelaide. He never had any interest before. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall,</inline>along with his South Australian Liberal colleagues, is on record on many occasions as having castigated the Dunstan Labor Government for bringing about a state of affairs in that State which has uplifted the living standards of the work force. Now the honourable senator says that because of the actions of the Dunstan Labor Government over the last 10 years South Australia is no longer classed as a low cost State. Why was it a low cost State when it was under the premiership of both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Playford</inline> and, for two years, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hall?</inline> They did everything possible to keep the wage structure lower than that of the counterparts of the South Australian workers in the other States. In effect, they were using tactics so that the cost of production in South Australia would be a great deal lower than what it was in other States, to the detriment of the work force in South Australia. I, as a Labor Party senator and as a great supporter of the State Labor Government under Dunstan, make no apologies. I am proud of what Dunstan has done to uplift the standard of living of people in South Australia. </para>
          <para>Last night we found when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> came in here that he had changed his view. He is going to show some concern for the residents of Hawker who are trade union members and who are in the work force. He went to great pains, he told us, to get information. At page 15 17 of yesterday's Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> we find a great list of the categories of work in which these people are engaged. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> will not fool those people by taking out those figures and implying that he has a sudden interest in their welfare. They know that he has no interest. He then went on to talk about the origin of some of the ethnic groups which live in the electorate. He plucked out the figure of 11,290 which is the number of people who were born in the United Kingdom and Ireland. </para>
          <para>He is a member of the coalition Government. I have not heard him refute the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> who talked about these British migrants. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is on record on more than one occasion as castigating those people and blaming them for bringing into this country- a term he coined and used- the British disease. Of course those migrants, particularly those 1 1,290 people who reside in that electorate and who <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> said were born in the United Kingdom and Ireland, will not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> has any interest in their welfare until such time as he comes out in public and denies his support for the statements <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> has made everywhere. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> has made these statements about people in the work force in this country who have had stop work meetings and strikes, trying to better their conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> does not consider the reasons why these people have stop work meetings or go on strike. All he can say is that we have imported the British disease. I am sure that the people who live in the electorate of Hawker are waiting anxiously and eagerly to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> denounce <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair's</inline> statements. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hall</inline>then went on to say in his speech that large industrial enterprises have spread. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed.)</inline></para>

That is the very reason my colleague and friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> drew your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> to the state of the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> was not here. He knew that I would not want to make any remarks about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> behind his back. I have never been that kind of person. I am very pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> is here. I am going to say what I have to say about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> to get it on the public record. I was leading up to saying that last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> said: </para>

            <para>Large industrial enterprises have spread here - </para>
          </quote>
          <para>He was talking about the electorate he is so interested in now-  from the rest of Australia and there are small commercial services there which are so important in providing employment in our society. </para>
          <para class="block">The Government he now supports is showing very little interest in providing employment for members of our society. The unemployment figures have grown rapidly since it took office and since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> came back into the fold of the Liberal Party which he so often castigated and criticised in this chamber when he was sitting in so-called opposition to it. Now he admits that large industrial enterprises are coming to South Australia. He has been on record so often criticising <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> the Premier, for chasing enterprises away but in the Parliament last night he admitted that large industrial enterprises are, in fact, being attracted to South Australia. Once again he contradicts himself. Some of his colleagues on the other side- I shall quote them later- had very great pleasure in reminding him that he was a political acrobat. That is on record. </para>
          <para>Another thing I am concerned about was a statement he made criticising the South Australian Labor Government and the Commonwealth Labor Government because of the money we made available for the construction of the growth centre at Monarto. He misled the Senate on that occasion as he did earlier today when he said that we were depriving the people who are depending on the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy because of the way we were handling that Bill. Last night he was up to similar tactics. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I think the greatest fault of those Labor governments was that they had in prospect the building of a very large city on the banks of Adelaide's water supply. No expert has ever been able to answer what effect that would have had but it would have utterly destroyed the quality of Adelaide 's basic water resource. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That goes to show how much <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> knows about where water is drawn from the River Murray to supply Adelaide. The first pumping station is at Mannum which is 20 to 30 miles up river from the site. The next pumping station is at north Murray Bridge which is again up river from where any drainage from Monarto would come into the river. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> said that we were going to jeopardise Adelaide's water supply. If he only took the time to get out into the country areas and look around , he would not make stupid statements that Monarto would affect Adelaide's water supply. Of course it would not. There is no pump site on the river below the projected Monarto area. Many times he and his Party and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> have been great critics of the establishment of the Monarto growth centre. In years to come they will have to admit that it has to go ahead. It will have to go ahead. </para>
          <para>I take great pride in the fact that the Whitlam Labor Government made the money available to purchase the land which is now in the land bank. When we get additional money to develop it, we will be able to go ahead and do it without all the trauma of acquiring the land to build a city. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> did not tell the people that when the acquisition legislation for Monarto went through the Parliament, the Liberal Party of which he is now so proud to be a member supported the legislation. It did not object to it. I well remember the State member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wardle</inline> as he was then, coming out on the first inspection we had when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> announced the project, lauding what we had done. Of course, when his colleagues got to him and thought they could get some political mileage he criticised it. The people of Murray Bridge have now seen the light. What happened to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wardle</inline> on 17 September? He lost his seat to an endorsed Liberal. I hope that the present incumbent of that seat will not take the same action as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wardle</inline> took in criticising the development of the Monarto complex. It is something which is desperately required in that area. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline>today let the cat out of the bag on the Nitrogenous Fertilisers Subsidy Amendment Bill in trying to gain a political point about the desperate need of the legislation for which the Senate is being held back. He said that the sole purpose of it was to put the knife into the workers in the Latrobe Valley. This is the very thing for which the trade union movement in South Australia has been critical of him in the past. I shall quote from Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 9 July 1 975 when I read an extract of some material that was put out awakening the trade union members of South Australia as to what type of person <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> was. That document was headed 'Liberal Movement-Liberal Myth?' It stated: </para>

          <para>His political career and beliefs are based on a deep-seated hatred of trade unions and he is longing to throw into reverse all that the ALP and the union movement have fought for over decades to achieve wage justice and decent job conditions. </para>
          <para class="block">That is what I was referring to a while ago when I talked about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> and his South Australian colleagues criticising the State Labor Government because it brought about a set of circumstances in which South Australia is no longer classed as a low cost State.

It went on to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hall,</inline> as he was then, said that South Australian industries were moving to other States because of industrial disruption. As I said earlier in my speech, he is on record as saying that on many occasions. That is what I was referring to earlier in my speech when I quoted what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> said last night when he said that large industrial enterprises have spread to the seat of Hawker from interstate. He is on record as saying previously that they were leaving the State. He now has to admit that they are coming back to the State and they are doing so under a Labor government. There has been a Labor government in South Australia for nearly 10 years now. </para>

He severely criticised the senator for actually asking the question about the redistribution having been withdrawn. As we understand it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland 's question was: Why did the Liberal Party in New South Wales not call nominations for a pre-selection ballot for four certain seats, the very four that have now been altered altogether from the first proposal.

            <para>This division is not made in a very pleasant fashion, because every time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> walks across this floor he takes a dead man's vote with him in his pocket. Today this Opposition, which aspires to lead this country with the great principles about which it prates, won a vote in the Senate and was able to have its will to move an amendment to a loan Bill which is the lifeblood of many Australians. The Bill was' defeated in that fashion only by the vote of a dead man which the Opposition has, contrary to the convention of this country. The Premier of Queensland would not replace the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> by a member from his own Party. The fact that that replacement, in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Field,</inline> is not here does not remove the fact that the absence of that vote to the Party which should have it means that it cannot prevent the Opposition from doing what it did today.

          <para class="block">That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> is trying to do now. Two years after that statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> in this place in which he accused <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> of trying to cancel Christmas, we now find that this legislation which is to be introduced will do the very thing for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> was criticising <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser.</inline> Of course it will cancel Christmas for a great many wage earners in this country because it is nothing more than a provocative action to take on the trade union movement. I have pointed this out in this Parliament on more than one occasion. I made a speech on, I think, 30 October, which was about 1 1 months after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> had said what he was going to do to get rid of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden.

Firstly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> said that I sat here in opposition to the parties with which I now sit. The facts of the matter are that I have sat always on the side on which those parties have sat. I have not sat on any other side in this House, and in proof of the direction of politics I then followed I draw to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren's</inline> attention the fact that the Liberal Movement, now out of existence, on every occasion on which an election was held, State or Federal, directed its first preferences to the Liberal Party. For <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren's</inline> benefit, I believe that that explanation will prove entirely false his claim that I sat here in opposition to the parties now on this side of the chamber. </para>

              <para>- I suggest that I am putting the facts correctly. In 1967 the River Murray ceased to flow. At Murray Bridge, in that area of the river from which the two sources of water are drawn for Adelaide, the river level fell. In fact there was an intermingling of the water upstream so that any effect anywhere in the lock containment affected the totality of the water quality in that part of the river. I will not develop that further. I believe that it fully explains my claim that water drainage from the proposed city of Monarto, either from the surface or underneath the surface, would contaminate in some conditions of the river the significant supplies of water that supply Adelaide. </para>

He made a derogatory remark about the attention I gave last night in this debate to British migrants. The facts are that I quoted the very large number of people in the electorate of Hawker who were born in Britain on the basis of concern for their welfare, and in no way was I criticising them. My concern was based on the fact that their standard of living has been seriously depressed by the previous Whitlam </para>

It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Millhouse</inline> and I are now on opposite sides of the political spectrum, if one can consider that to be in the non-Labor sense.

Senator McLaren</inline> said that I made serious and defamatory charges against that gentleman through my criticism of his firm. The facts of that matter are that the firm was the auditor of a union in South Australia whose accounts were subject to very serious embezzlement of funds. That embezzlement was not found by the auditors, and that was the subject of my criticism at the time. </para>

          <para>-This policy reflects a fundamental review of the rights and responsibilities of the parties engaged in industrial relations and the demands of the contemporary community. An important feature of this legislation is the manner in which the Government has sought to expose the subject matter of the Bill to intensive public scrutiny. Much of the substance of this Bill was introduced into the House in March of this year. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In the second reading speech on that Bill, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> said that, because of the fundamental importance of the legislation, the Government intended members of this Parliament, the principal parties to industrial relations and the community at large to be given time to consider objectively the contents of the Bill and to make their views known to the Government. The Bill lay on the table of the House until midMay. Subsequently, the Minister entered into negotiations, on behalf of the Government, with the peak union and employer councils. </para>

Does the ruling also cover a second reading speech which he makes on behalf of a Minister whom he represents in this place? There is a substantial difference. The speech that the Minister is reading at the present time is the second reading speech of a Minister in another place. I would say that the Attorney-General would have to keep to the words in that speech. If he makes a speech in his own right on a matter that comes within his own responsibility he can add to it whatever he likes, but he cannot do that when he is reading a speech on behalf of another Minister. </para>

        <para class="block">On 27 May, and in accordance with this statement, the Minister introduced into this House legislation for the establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau and the National Labour Consultative Council. As honourable senators will be aware, the Act establishing the Industrial Relations Bureau was given royal assent on 12 June. The provisions of that Act providing for the appointment of a Director of the Bureau and enabling him to undertake the organisation of the Bureau were proclaimed to operate from 3 October. On that date, the first Director of the Bureau, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> L. Linehan, took up his appointment. The provisions enabling the Bureau to commence its function of securing the observance of the Act, regulations and awards will be proclaimed as soon as the Director has completed the necessary organisational arrangements. Similarly, honourable senators will be aware that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, whom I represent in this place, took immediate steps to convene the National Labour Consultative Council following its creation by legislation. The Council has now met on three occasions and, in accordance with the Minister's statement of 17 May referred to earlier, considered the legislative proposals contained in the Bill of last March. </para>
        <para>I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to both the national employers and the peak trade union councils for the frank views put to the Minister during those consultations. The weight the Government has given those views is borne out by an examination of the amendments proposed by the current Bill. Though similar in substance, it is not the same Bill as was introduced in March of this year. A number of modifications have been made and some matters are not pursued. Furthermore, the process of consultation has permitted the airing of other issues and their presentation in legislative form. For example, the current Bill makes provision concerning accounting practises and financial reporting in organisations registered under the Act. These provisions are based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney- into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions conducted during the office of the previous Government. I believe this Bill is evidence of the earnest and careful consideration which the Government has given to the views put to it. However, at the end of the day it is for the Government to act, having regard not only to the views put to it, but to the demands of the public interest, the interests of the community as a whole. </para>
        <para>One of the fundamental tenets of the Government's industrial relations policy is that each member of the community has both rights and obligations: Those rights must be protected and the obligations must be met. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act is perhaps the paramount Australian industrial statute. It is the principal means of giving legal expression to industrial rights and obligations. While it is not, and cannot be, a complete statement of those rights and obligations it certainly is the vehicle which establishes the framework of those rights and obligations by defining the roles and responsibilities of the parties to industrial relations and providing for an expression of the public interest. </para>
        <para>Industrial relations is a dynamic process, everchanging in response to the interplay of economic and. social forces. Consequently, no industrial statute of the significance of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act can hope to express or define those industrial relationships for all time. The law must be responsive to new demands and changing circumstances. Government has a duty to reshape the law to ensure its relevance to contemporary industrial relations. </para>

            <para>-Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> Perhaps I should thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> as well. This Bill represents an important step in that continuing process of reshaping and redefining the rights and obligations under industrial law. It is a response to emergent trends in the social role of trade unions, or in the roles which they seek to assume, which has led to changes in the behaviour of trade unions as institutions. It is obvious that unions have moved a long way from being small craft organisations with limited aspirations concerned mainly with ensuring fair wages and working conditions for their members. By contrast, the union movement today is a powerful economic and social pressure group. Unions have grown greatly in size and are in a position to influence powerfully, by concerted action, the economic well-being of the community. No responsible Government can ignore this, or refuse to take steps to prevent such power being exercised contrary to the best interests of the community. A very real danger arises where a union, in pursuit of some limited or selfinterested goal, is able to impose economic hardship and dislocation on the entire community. Over the past year we have experienced the crippling effect of strikes by fuel tanker drivers, aircraft refuellers and by air traffic controllers. We have been, and are, witnessing, the frightening capacity of a relatively small group of unionists in the Victorian power industry to wreak havoc on an entire community, such situation demand tat action be taken. It is paramount that unions recognise their obligations and the legitimate interests of the Australian community. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>In the face of irresponsible and protracted disputes in essential industries it is fruitless, and blatantly deceptive, for anyone to attempt to suggest that the trend towards a reduction in man-days lost in industrial disputes argues against the type of measures which the Government now seeks to implement. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> The real issues are the soaring economic and social costs to the entire community, and the capacity of certain unions and groups of unionists to inflict this harm. A second trend is that, in pursuing economic and social objectives- in seeking to give effect to their broader aspirations- trade unions have sought to extend their strength and influence by intensive recruitment activity and have endeavoured to impose greater restrictions on the freedom of individual employees and, indeed, non-employees. This is evidenced in part by the conduct of some unions designed to compel certain self-employed persons, such as owner-drivers, or employers m a small way of business who 'work on the tools' to join the union concerned. These unions have sought to impose bans or boycotts which directly or indirectly harm that person's legitimate commercial interests in an endeavour to compel his membership of the union. </para>
        <para>Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this trend is the change in the relationship between the member and his union. A certain common purpose must be shared by the members of a union, but as the objectives of unions broaden, this becomes less and less likely. Clearly, in any large group of individuals such as a trade union, while there might be agreement about traditional union goals, the scope for disagreement about other issues- political, social, cultural, environmental- may be as great as the diversity amongst individuals in an organisation. Regrettably, some organisations have lost sight of the needs of members in their pursuit of organisational goals. Legitimate disagreement with some aspect of the broadened aims of the organisation, or with specific action in pursuit of such aims, may be labelled as disloyalty which must be subject to discipline. This becomes all the more oppressive for individual members where the union leadership is ideologically oriented, bent upon serving some narrow political interest rather than the interests of the members. The Medibank strike of last year, a political not an industrial issue, will long live in the memories of many whose unions tried to discipline them for non-participation or who, under duress, took industrial action against their personal convictions. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the Bill itself. First there is a series of amendments designed to strengthen the protection of individual employees and persons against unfair practices by employers and organisations. Second, there are measures designed to promote further the democratic control of industrial organisations. Third, the Bill proposes to enhance the means by which the rights of members of organisations, and the interests of the community, can be better protected through the functioning of the Commission, the Industrial Relations Bureau and the Federal Court. </para>
        <para class="block">Individual Rights </para>
        <para>I have already made general reference to the manner in which unions can erode the industrial rights of individuals. The Government recognises that strong and effective organisations of employees and employers are fundamental to the effective conduct of industrial relations; indeed the formation of such organisations is one of the principal objects of the Act. However, organisations are meant to protect and enlarge the rights of individuals, and not to undermine their liberties. A number of cases in which infringements of the rights of individuals by trade unions have occurred have received attention in recent months. Two most notable cases are those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Latham</inline> and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Krutulis.</inline> But such cases represent only the tip of the iceberg. There are many people whose problems do not hit the headlines and who suffer in silence in the face of injustices which they feel powerless to challenge as individuals. </para>
        <para>The Government proposes action in relation to two groups of persons. First, protection will be given to those who conscientiously object to joining an organisation. As proposed in the March Bill the right to a certificate of conscientious objection will no longer be dependent upon the existence of a preference clause in the relevant award. However, in response to views put to me during consultations with the national employers and the peak union councils, the Government has decided to require the payment of a fee by an applicant for a certificate. A series of associated measures is proposed to protect the holders of certificates from various intimidatory tactics by fellow employees, employers or organisations. I have also referred to certain abuses by organisations in relation to the recruitment of self employed persons. To this end, the Bill proposes limitations on the right of organisations to recruit self-employed persons. Non-employees will be able to join a State branch of an organisation of employees only where, and to the extent that, State industrial arbitration legislation authorises non-employees to be members of State unions. In addition, to combat unfair recruitment tactics designed to coerce a non-employee to join a union, a series of offences is proposed by the Bill. </para>
        <para>The right of a union member to refuse to participate in industrial action is to be reinforced. The Bill proposes that it be an offence for an employer to dismiss or disadvantage an employee because he has refused or failed to join in industrial action, or to threaten dismissal or disadvantage to coerce him to join in industrial action. It will also be an offence for an organisation to impose a penalty, forfeiture or disability on a member to coerce him to join in industrial action or because he has refused or failed to join in an industrial action. Of course it is up to an individual to exercise his free choice on whether or not he engages in industrial action. Nothing in this legislation changes that. </para>
        <para class="block">Democratic Control of Organisations </para>
        <para>The second group of proposals to which I referred concerned the fostering of democratically run organisations. It is important that elections in organisations be conducted in a manner which will achieve the fullest possible participation by members and be free of practices likely to lead to irregularities. Under the existing requirements for secret postal ballots, an organisation which does not have rules providing for a 'secret postal ballot' as defined must conduct the election in accordance with the Conciliation and Arbitration regulations unless an exemption is granted by the Industrial Registrar. These regulations provide a comprehensive code of practice for the conduct of elections to office. However, at the present time, organisations which have rules providing for a 'secret postal ballot' may take themselves outside the regulations. There can of course be deficiencies in some procedures. </para>
        <para>The amendments I am proposing will deem the regulations to be the rules of organisations in relation to the elections required to be conducted by 'secret postal ballot'. The regulations will not, however, apply to elections which the Industrial Registrar has exempted from the secret postal ballot requirement as already provided for in existing legislation. To reinforce these provisions, it will be open to the Federal Court, in proceedings under section 141 of 171c of the Act, to declare void an election not conducted in accordance with the secret postal ballots regulations, and direct that a fresh election be conducted. It will be an offence for a person to hold office knowing that he was not elected to that office by secret postal ballot where required by the Act. A penalty may also be imposed upon the organisation concerned. </para>
        <para>I have already briefly referred to amendments to give effect to the Report of the Royal Commission into Alleged Payments to Maritime Unions insofar as it related to accounting practices and financial reporting in organisations. In his report, the Royal Commissioner reflected upon the adequacy of the existing measures contained in the Act and regulations, and the low level of compliance with them by organisations. The Bill proposes amendments to the Act which, with only slight modification, implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission. These amendments provide for the records to be kept by organisations, for audit and the duties of auditors, for the submission of reports and audited accounts to members, for the filing of financial returns with the Industrial Registrar, and for the investigation of irregularities by the Industrial Relations Bureau and the initiation of actions in the Federal Court. These provisions will require supporting regulations. The Minister agreed, when he met with the National Labour Consulative Council on 12 October last, to the establishment of a sub-committee of the Council to work with officers of his Department on the preparation of the necessary regulations. </para>
        <para>Protection of the Public Interest </para>
        <para>The final broad area with which this Bill is concerned is the series of measures which go to facilitate the expression of the public interest in the industrial relations process. In part, the vehicle which the Government has chosen for this role is the Industrial Relations Bureau. During <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street's</inline> meeting with the unions on 1 1 May, the ACTU handed him a document setting out their position in relation to the agreement subsequently reached. That document noted that consultation in a National Labour Consultative Council may well produce positive, creative functions for a Bureau concerned with improving industrial relations. The Government is proposing amendments which give the Bureau precisely that role. The Industrial Relations Bureau will have, in the public interest, two broad functions. One of these involves securing the observance of the Act, the regulations and awards. The Arbitration Inspectorate has always had this function; the powers of the Bureau in relation to these matters will, however, be spelled out quite specifically. If the Bureau cannot bring about voluntary compliance with the law, it will have the necessary power to initiate appropriate proceedings in the Commission and in the Industrial Division of the Federal Court. These powers will include the power to notify the Commission of a breach or likely breach of a bans clause in an award and to make application for a certificate under section 33 of the Act to enable proceedings to be taken for breach of the award in the Court. In response to the views put to the Minister by the national employers and the peak trade union councils, the relevant provision has been redrawn to make clear that the Bureau cannot take part in the dispute settling process under this section. </para>
        <para>The Bureau will also have the right to apply for cancellation of an award, for an injunction restraining contraventions of the Act and regulations, and for deregistration in appropriate cases. The Bureau's second major area of responsibility concerns the role it will play in providing assistance to the members of organisations. Apart from its normal award inspection and advisory functions, it will assist persons to ensure that the rules of their organisation conform with the requirements of the Act and that they are observed by those under a duty to observe them. The Bureau will be empowered to investigate complaints by members that the rules of their organisations are oppressive, unreasonable or unjust, or otherwise contravene the Act; and will also be empowered to investigate complaints by members that the rules of their organisations are not being observed. If the Bureau fails to persuade the organisation either to take steps to amend its rules, or to observe its rules, as the case may be, the Bureau will be able to take the matter to the Court. The amendments now proposed in this regard retain the right of a person to go directly to the Court, rather than to have the Bureau act on his behalf, and this change again reflects views put to me by the national employers and the peak union councils. </para>
        <para>There are other related matters. As the Bureau will be properly staffed and equipped to undertake investigations, including the type just referred to, it has been decided to empower the Bureau to undertake investigations on behalf of the Industrial Registrar in connection with applications for inquiries by the Court into alleged irregularities in elections. Similarly, responsibility for the detailed investigations relating to the administration of the finances of an organisation under the proposed requirements will be given to the Bureau. </para>
        <para>I now come to further very significant provisions of this legislation. The Government proposes to amend section 143 of the Act to extend the grounds on which deregistration proceedings can be based. The new grounds will include power for the Court to deregister an organisation which prevents, hinders or interferes with interstate and overseas trade and commerce, or the provision of a public service of the Commonwealth or of a State. Honourable senators are only too well aware that disputes affecting trade and commerce or essential services have imposed profound economic dislocation on the community. </para>
        <para>The Government also proposes to extend the range of consequences available to the Court in deregistration proceedings. The 'all or none' principle which presently applies limits the flexibility of the Court in dealing with breaches which may not warrant total deregistration. Thus, the Bill proposes to empower the Court to: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman">
          <item label="(i)">
            <para>partially deregister an organisation if it finds that the industrial action leading to the proceedings has resulted wholly or mainly from a particular section or class of members of the organisation; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(ii)">
            <para>suspend all or any of the capacities, rights and privileges of an organisation or any of its members. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">Honourable senators will be aware that, in the March Bill, this power of suspension was to be available in proceedings for offences under a number of sections of the Act. The intention now is that this power will be restricted to deregistration proceedings. This decision by Government is a further indication of the seriousness with which the views of national employers and the peak union councils have been considered. </para>
        <para>Finally, the Bill will insert a new provision in relation to demarcation disputes. For too long the powers of the Commission in this area have been inadequate to deal with demarcation disputesdisputes which may well bring an entire industry to a standstill. It is proposed that the Commission may order that an organisation cannot represent a specified class or group of employees and direct the organisation to amend its rules to exclude these employees from its membership. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, I reiterate that the measures in this Bill result from a comprehensive review of the operation of the Act, a review which has involved tripartite consultation at the highest levels. It represents a necessary reshaping of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to meet changed industrial circumstances and to reassert the rule of the law in expressing or defining industrial rights and obligations Events of recent months and, most particularly, the events of the last few days, have emphasised this is essential in the interests of our community. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>That the Senate is of the opinion that urgent action should be taken by the Government to establish a royal commission to inquire into the relationships between Aboriginal communities throughout Australia and members of police forces. </para>
        </motion>
        <para class="block">I gave notice of that motion on 9 March this year. I am not particularly tied to a royal commission; but, because of the continuing bad relationships between the Aborigines and many sections of the police force, it is obvious that some inquiry has to be conducted. Whether this takes the form of a Senate select committee, a standing committee, a royal commission or some other type of inquiry, it is perfectly obvious that the terms of reference have to be wide enough to cover all aspects of the problem that faces this country today. We have seen internal inquiries into the problems faced not only by Aborigines but also by other sections of the community. The most recent of these included the Cedar Bay inquiry which has come in for a lot of criticism, particularly for the way in which it was carried out. It came in for a lot of criticism also because when the rather brief sentences were imposed the police concerned were protected by their own people. </para>
        <para>The Lucas Committee in Queensland, which sat for a lengthy period of time and investigated a whole number of aspects of relations between the public and the police, also can be described as an abject failure- not because of the findings but because of the way the Queensland Government has treated the findings which were brought down. I put in approximately 100 submissions and was never asked to elaborate on any of them. A member of my staff also put in an extensive number of submissions and was never called as a witness. The inquiry itself can be described only as a very superficial inquiry. We are familiar also with what happened in Queensland when there was alleged corruption in the police force. The Premier of the day, who probably will remain in that position until 12 November this year, decided that he would call in Scotland Yard. Apparently, the two people who came from Scotland Yard to look at various aspects of alleged police corruption were fairly thorough in their investigating processes. The end result was that when the area became too sensitive they went back to London and were not recalled. We also had the Beach inquiry in Victoria. Most of the people indicted in the evidence given before that inquiry have been able to escape any penalties. </para>
        <para>The inquiry I envisage would have a wide-ranging effect. First of all, it would give Aboriginal and Islander people in the community who have been disadvantaged because of the application of the law the right to tell their own story without fear of any repercussions. Believe me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> if one is black in this community the repercussions that can follow if one - </para>

            <para>- It is part of the system, but the repercussions that can follow to disadvantaged people in the community are almost unbelievable. I shall cite some instances later in this debate. One of the things that have been highlighted is the fact that most of the respective police forces in Australia are totally untrained to deal with the problems of either our own indigenous ethnic group or our imported ethnic group. This is where half the trouble starts. I can recall one situation in my own home city. Two Ghanaian students were arrested in a New Year's Eve raid by police. The were classified as local Aborigines and were arrested, allegedly for drinking. One was a teetotaller and the other touched very little alcoholic liquid. That led to my apologising personally to the Ghanaian High Commission for the insult that these lads had suffered. It had little effect on the local police. I also recall the instance of a policeman in one of the remoter areas of the Gulf country who said: I was trained in the Brisbane metropolitan area. I had problems with Aboriginal people. Quite frankly, I did not understand them. Now that I have been transferred to this area, closer to the tribal people, I have discovered a whole new outlook on life. Never again will I be brutal to Aboriginal people'. </para>

        <para>Some years ago there was the case of a Commonwealth policeman who was on duty here at Parliament House. He did not want to be involved in the bashing that went on in the days of the Aboriginal Embassy. He resigned from the police force rather than take the orders that he had to take from his superiors. </para>

            <para>- If the honourable senator is so impatient, I suggest that he go outside until the Opposition calls him back for the next quorum. When we got down to investigating the facts of this matter and suggested to the publican that he was running a very grave risk of being sued for defamation by banning people from his hotel like that, he said: 'But twenty-four of them are boongs Why should I be worried about it? Only two of them are whites'. We said: 'We are not worried about the two whites. They can handle themselves. But we want to know about the 24 Aborigines you have banned'. There was a very good local organisation there that was quite capable of working in liaison with any section of the community which felt that it had some problem. Ultimately the publican was persuaded to remove the list. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> It is interesting to note that numerous back bench supporters of the Government are having great difficulty in getting into the chamber, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> who has not been able to turn up at all.

            <para>- I do, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> I want to make a quick summary of what I believe is the importance of the Laverton report to many people in this country, particularly the Aboriginal people. I point out the report accentuates the Aboriginal- police problem and the lack of understanding by Australian people generally of the problems and needs of the Aboriginal people of this country. There is a great lack of knowledge of the culture of the Aborigine and the importance of his activities in the community generally. In areas where the Aboriginal population is extensive- this covers most of the area north of the tropic of Capricorn- little provision has been made by the white population to accommodate their cultural activities. If this trend continues, the so-called racial problems being experienced will only increase. That was one of the reasons why I emphasised a while ago that the respective police forces ought to have some training in how to handle ethnic minorities. The Laverton report recommended both short term and long term measures in the areas of housing, transport facilities, communication between the whites and the Aborigines, police training schemes in which there would be considerable Aboriginal participation, the appointment of Aboriginal justices of the peace and the continuation of the Aboriginal Legal Service. </para>

        </continue><para>I have quarrelled with the Government on several occasions in the past 12 months about the scaling down of the influence of the Aboriginal Legal Service.

        </continue><quote>
          <para>It was reported that until 2 1 December there was complete harmony between police and Aborigines at Laverton. Their behaviour was ideal up until the time the publican made representations to Inspector Hilton to send reinforcements. The constable in the town made no representations for reinforcements but the publican did. Inspector Hilton, on the evidence of Sergeant Holmwood, said to him: 'You are too soft with the Aborigines. You have been in the area for too long. You are thinking like an Aboriginal'. Whilst there had been complete co-operation and harmony between the Aborigines and the police, the attitude of the senior Inspector of the western desert district of Western Australia was that police had to take a definite attitude. Rather than the Royal Commission saying that the actions of the police were reasonable in difficult conditions he said that in specific incidents which they were considering in every case the Commission investigated there were complaints against the police. On one occasion there were five policemen in a car and there was no room left for anybody who was arrested so the police, having arrested two people, put handcuffs on them and conveyed them to the police station in the boot of the car contrary to the traffic regulations in Western Australia. </para>
        </quote><para>I am told that after those two Aborigines had been handcuffed and locked in the boot of a car on a very hot day it was left standing in the main street of the township while the police went off looking for a further arrest- with those two people suffocating in the boot. </para><para>We hear of instances like this. We also hear of instances such as the tourist bus travelling in central Australia which ran out of seating accommodation. Some Aborigines wanted to travel from point A to point B and were put in the luggage compartment until the space was filled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> as reported on the next page of that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, said: </para><quote>
          <para>These police officers falsified charge sheets. They falsified those charge sheets which went to their commissioners. Those were the actions of some members of the Police Force Association in Western Australia. I am not condemning the police force in Western Australia. I do not have any desire to condemn or find any pleasure in condemning policemen. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">I want to reiterate that: I have no particular desire to charge a whole police force. On many occasions when brutality is exercised, it is not the fault of the policeman, who has been brought up in an atmosphere of 'If you are black you are sub-standard anyway'. That is the sort of attitude that this society perpetuates so far as Australia is concerned and so far as South Africa and many other countries are concerned. Their training, probably from infancy, is not designed to enable people of different colours to live together. We can overcome that provided we have the capacity to train our police force and other sections of the community properly. </para><para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline>added: </para><quote>
          <para>The first aspect on which we must make up our minds is: What is the right attitude to be adopted between police and Aborigines? Do we adopt the line followed by Sergeant Holmwood who mixes with Aborigines and has no trouble with them? Or do we take the line adopted by Brown who arrests everyone he sees because they are black and then sorts out the charges afterwards? I think we must come down on the side of more lenient treatment of Aborigines. But what do we do in respect of ordinary policemen acting under instructions of their sergeant who have gone into Laverton, made mistakes, and lied their way through all the processes, lied even to the Royal Commission, for the purpose of covering up their defaults? Are these men who should properly be in the police force? Are these men who should have powers of arrest? I point out that nothing can be done because the Western Australian Government is trying to protect its police force. Therefore, the only appeal I can make is to the Federal Government which has the right to intercede on behalf of people. </para>
        </quote><para>That appeal to the Federal Government was made on 6 May 1976. It is now well into October 1 977 and this Government has failed to take up any of the suggestions that were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> and others who spoke on the Laverton Royal Commission Report or any of the recommendations of the Laverton Report. To make it even worse, the direct responsibility for implementation of these recommendations must surely rest first with the Minister for Police and the Commissioner for Police in Western Australia, with the State Government of that State, but we saw those aggravations continue right into the recent State election campaign when five Perth lawyers went into the electorate of Kimberley with the direct responsibility of blocking an Aboriginal candidate from becoming a member of the House of Assembly in Western Australia. So not only has the State Government not learnt the lesson but also it is perpetuating the situation by acting illegally, though apparently on the surface legally, to prevent a very responsible and highly-respected man from entering the State House of Parliament. </para><para>I want to make reference to some other central Australian areas. This happens not only in Western Australia. I suppose the very worst areas are in the remoter parts of Western Australia, of the Northern Territory, of Queensland and perhaps part of the north-west of New South Wales, where policemen can be totally brutal to an Aborigine and are able to get away with it. Sometimes death is the end result but no policeman, as far as I know, has ever been charged with murdering an Aborigine. </para><interjection>

          <para>One of the most dramatic changes and increases in the work load of our members over the past 14 months has been in the relations between police and some members of the Aboriginal community. </para>
          <para>Federal Government policies have in our opinion directly contributed to the breakdown in the relations between our members and the Aborigines. There has been a marked increase in the number of Aboriginal offenders, particularly those associated with excessive drinking and crimes of violence. Militant Aboriginal leaders have travelled around the States stirring local Aborigines into direct confrontation with our members who are endeavouring to enforce standards which are acceptable to the white community. </para>
          <para>Assaults on our members of a serious nature by groups of Aborigines have increased and only in recent months in the Moree and Cowra areas members have had to engage in running battles with these people. </para>
          <para>Particular examples of problems indicate the extent of the problems encountered by police with certain elements in the Aboriginal community. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">So the trash goes on. But this does not reflect any credit on the police or the people who are responsible for writing that story in the police journal. Can one blame the police? It is possible that some of those people when they were transferred to these communities saw an Aboriginal for the first time, and because of their racist upbringing they knew no better. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> who, during his term as Minister, sorted out probably one of the worst problems. I am referring to that squad which operated around the Big E in the Redfern area. I should like to refer to a couple of other reports that I have which highlight the points that I am trying to make in this motion. I should like to quote now from the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of 5 March 1977. It has a Melbourne by-line and states: </para><quote>
          <para>A dossier on allegations of police assault and victimisation of aborigines in Melbourne is being compiled by the Aboriginal Health and Legal Services. </para>
          <para>The Aboriginal Health Service doctor said yesterday that after two recent allegations of assault in the Fitzroy area, the services would take direct action to investigate and consider charges against police. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Grigg</inline>said he had witnessed police taking aborigines with their arms handcuffed behind them from the Builders' Arms Hotel in Gertrude Street, Fitzroy, and throwing them bodily into a divisional van. </para>

        </quote><para class="block">I should like to give an example of something that happened some years ago in the Townsville area when a member of the Aboriginal community rang me at my office and said: <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr so</inline> and so is in gaol at Stuart Creek'. That is the local gaol. I checked around the police stations to see whether in fact he was a guest of  Her  Majesty at Stuart Creek. I was told that he was but nobody could give me any details. I then checked with the gaol and I was told that he was there but that I would not be able to get any information unless I went to the Criminal Investigation Bureau. Incidentally, he was undefended in this case. I have no doubt whatsoever about the manner in which the charges were laid. </para><para>It appears that this young fellow at the age of 12 or 13 had nicked a watermelon, a couple of apples or something and had been put on probation by the Children's Court. When he left school he went out into the western areas as a ringer, station roustabout, what have you. He had his annual holidays. He was not, incidentally, subject to the Act. He came back to the provincial city to spend a few days of his holidays. One Sunday morning when he was walking in the direction of a coffee shop that used to be situated in the old Queen's Hotel on The Strand he was accosted by two policemen in a prowl car. They told him that they knew that he had assaulted someone the previous night. Incidentally, he was a non-drinker. The policemen  roughed him up and put him in the police car. He said: 'What am I being charged with?' He was told: 'You are being charged with assault'. He said: 'But I do not even know the person I am supposed to have assaulted because I have not assaulted anyone'. The policeman said: 'Well, shut up'. They took him to the lockup and roughed him up some more and said: 'Well, look, tomorrow morning if you appear in the magistrate 's court you will get off perhaps with a small fine, but if you want to make it rough, we will make sure you get 12 months'. The lad appeared without any legal representation and was given a sentence of six months gaol. </para><para>When we found out about it, so corrupt were the actions of the police that before we could get a solicitor to the gaol he had been discharged and his file had been destroyed. He went back to the bush whence he came before he started his holiday. When we asked him whether he would come back to lay charges, he said: 'No way. Those coppers told me that if I come back there they will not just rough me up; next time they will murder me', and he said 'I believe them'. That is the sort of brutality that is exercised by some sections of the police force of this country. I should like to refer to statements which were made in front of witnesses by people in the Townsville area. I will refer to the case of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S</inline> of Palm Island. I will not cite the names of the people. They can be supplied for confidential purposes such as a royal commission of something like that. If these names are published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the people will be subjected to further police brutality in many instances. The statement concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S</inline> states: </para><quote>
          <para class="block">In this particular incident, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S</inline> was involved in a family quarrel with two other persons. The matter was eventually d ealt with and the three people concerned had settled it between themselves. The incident arose purely out of a domestic matter. Usually in matters such as this, the police are reluctant to intervene and often just caution any person who may cause further trouble. So it was unnecessary and unwarranted for the sergeant on the island to physically assault <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S. Mr S</inline> is a very sick man with a bad heart condition and it is little wonder that he did not die as a result of the vicious attack on him personally, and especially whilst he was hospitalised. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S</inline> told me that he intended to take the matter further as he wanted to press charges against the officer concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S</inline> is not very hopeful though, as he knows too well that if and when the matter does come before the court, it will be his word against the police. </para>
          <para>Three Aboriginal men who were patients in the same ward as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S</inline> were witnesses to this incident but when questioned by a field officer from the Townsville Legal Service, they refused to say anything. They admitted that they were afraid to for fear of being put off the Island. They also know that if the sergeant wins the court case (which is more than likely) they will probably cop the backlash. Rather than be subject to any further intimidation or harassment they prefer to remain silent. To say that the police are unpopular amongst the Aboriginal community would be a gross understatement. </para>

          <para>The foregoing incident illustrates just one example of many such incidents of police intimidation and harassment of Black people in this State. It also illustrates the feeling that when an Aboriginal person has been the victim of some racist police officer, they will not report the matter. </para>
          <para class="block">I have asked many Aboriginal people who I know have been assaulted or harassed in some way by police why they do not press charges or report the matter to some higher authority, and they will reply 'who's going to believe a blackfella?' </para>
        </quote><para class="block">In that incident the policeman assaulted the man in his hospital bed, and there were three witnesses to it. The next case dealt with is the 'green door' episode. The green door is a type of aerial fig, which was looked upon as a place of shelter at night time for Aborigines in a Townsville suburb. The report states: </para><quote>
          <para>These statements were taken from a group of homeless Aboriginal alcoholics. It is well known that there would be approximately 30-40 Aboriginal men and women in Townsville who are forced to live in the parks in and around the city area. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">I was told the other day that, because of the practices of this Government, there are probably that many Aboriginal people and almost as many white people who are forced to live under similar circumstances. I was with a group of deprived people only a couple of weeks ago, and amongst that group was a young widow of about 22 or 23 years of age. She was three or four months pregnant and had lost her possessions because when her husband was killed she had nowhere to go. So she started wandering- a destitute and lonely little lady. Because of the activities of the Government, particularly through its Department of Social Security, these people are hounded and hounded from place to place. They go out to look for a job and travel from town to town, whether they are black or white. Their applications are refused immediately by the local office of the Department of Social Security because it says that they have come to an area where there is little local employment. The reply they get- the Minister backs this up all the way- is this: 'You can starve for all I care. Just keep on moving'. </para><para>I had an incident reported to me today of a young Island lad who has gone back to live in his home on Stradbroke Island. The Minister's Department has said to him: 'You are not entitled to unemployment benefit because you live in an area where there is little prospect for employment'. That lad went back to live with his parents. If he is not entitled to do that and still collect unemployment benefit, then I do not know what this country is coming to. The  morality of this Government is almost nonexistent. I continue with the story of the 'Green Door'. </para><para>The place they refer to as the 'green door' was one of their regular sheltering places until the police swooped on them in the early hours of the morning and moved them on and then later the area was burnt out- whilst people were still sleeping there. </para><para>That is very similar to Cedar Bay. The story continues: </para><quote>
          <para>These people are regularly moved on by police. They may congregate in one area, the police cruise around in their vehicles and move them from that area. They then come along a day or so later and move them from that spot. As one of the men said to me recently, 'We don't know where we are, the cops move us here, then they move us over there. We are like a bunch ot yo-yo's. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">The group of deprived people, black and white, who spoke to me two weeks ago now move together in their own little groups. All night somebody stands on guard, and when the police cars are seen anywhere in the vicinity they get up and move on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> would know of the thousands of people who live without a home in the fringe areas of Alice Springs. That story is repeated time and time again. People are homeless and harassed, mostly by police but also by a lot of other white people. </para><interjection>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Richards</inline>goes on to state the hassling he had to go through. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> in the last few minutes available to me I want to mention some very recent incidents which I believe ought to be investigated. In the areas concerned where I have asked for investigations they have not been carried out. I think this highlights the fact that there has to be some sort of national inquiry established to ascertain why these sorts of bad relationships should exist between black and white people. On the occasion of the last Cairns agricultural show a few weeks ago, I received a call from the local representative of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee who complained that one of his companions had been arrested bv a policeman, allegedly for drunkenness. He had been handcuffed to a high wire fence with his hands above his head and left standing there for an hour with his arms hanging to the fence. If that man had been in poor health, if he had a weak heart or some other ailment, that exercise could have killed him. I have asked the Police Commissioner in Queensland and the Queensland Minister for Police to carry out an investigation. Allegedly, he was left there because there was no paddy wagon to put him in. The police had to wait until a paddy wagon returned. That is a very feeble excuse. I understand that on the following morning in the Cairns court this man was charged with drunkenness. That occurred quite a number of weeks ago but I have not even received one acknowledgement from the people concerned. </para><para>I attended the celebrations of the National Aboriginal Day of Observance Committee this year at Maclean. They were very orderly celebrations and they were very well conducted. They were attended by a large number of Aboriginal and Island people. The local police have a good relationship with the local Aborigines. On that occasion I was accompanied by the local Catholic chaplain to the official festivities in the evening. However, quite a large number of policemen had been sent in from another district. They adopted a very harassing attitude. I think that probably the Catholic chaplain and I had some effect on the situation. When the police were seen to approach one or more of the Aborigines we stood behind them muttering about how the chaplain would make a very good sermon next Sunday morning and I would make an excellent Press statement. The local white and black people were totally intimidated by this large number of policemen who came into the district, apparently without any instructions from their senior officers. </para><para>We have heard about the recent incidents in Brisbane concerning Pastor Don Brady, or Uncle Don as he is known to many of his more intimate black and white friends. He was assaulted at his home by police on the day when he buried his younger son who had been killed in an accident. His wife was assaulted by police who broke into the house on the same night. The following night a large number of Aborigines who were addicted to alcohol were raided in a riverbank camp and physically thrown into the Brisbane River by police. Inquiries have been sought in regard to these matters but nothing happens. It is not likely that anything will happen in Queensland when the Premier of the State is totally anti-black and has made no secret of it. When Neville Bonner was the first black candidate the National Pam in the north-western area combined on the basis that its members would not vote for him. When Eric Deeral was elected in Cook, the Country Party pea for the area was a local policeman named Mahoney. He was to receive the No. 1 Country Party vote. But because independent candidates and others gave their preferences elsewhere, in a very close contest Deeral was the bloke who won the seat. But he will not hold the seat because no blacks will vote for him. He has come out and said that no Aborigine or Islander in the State needs or requires tribal land. </para><interjection>

            <para>-I am not talking rubbish all the time. That is documented. I am surprised to hear that remark coming from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman.</inline> The honourable senator has been asleep in his seat all night. He has just woken up and started to make his stupid interjections. I am unimpressed by them. The honourable senator is not capable of absorbing what was said, anyway. I am sorry that the honourable senator was so deeply in slumber earlier in the night. If he had not been he might have heard some of the other remarks I have made. I want to conclude my remarks by making this final request: I ask that support be given for some type of independent judicial inquiry. I hope that this Government, even though it has repudiated the promise made by the Labor Government, will have second thoughts and that some attempts will be made to rectify the situation. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> looks at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the then Northern Territory Legislative Council- I refer the honourable senator to 1965, 1966 or whichever year it was- he will see that there was a motion before the Northern Territory Legislative Council, which was probably the first motion of its kind in a parliament in Australia, in which I moved that there be a standing committee on assimilation. As far as I understand, that was the first move in Australia to bring about land rights for Aboriginal people. Naturally it was proposed to help the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory who are my friends. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>From that situation, many things happened with the result that in the Legislative Council, in 1968 or 1969 I think it was, legislation providing for the first time in Australia, the granting of land to Aboriginal people was passed. I will say no more than that. I think it is rather futile for anybody, let alone <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe,</inline> to stand up in this place and say that I have supported land rights in public and have then gone and locked myself in the bathroom to write an article to the contrary. I must say that that is the most ridiculous statement and one that is completely wrong. I invite anybody in this place or any other place to look at the history. </para>
        <para>I feel sorry for the honourable senator. I feel sorry for him because he has come into this chamber tonight and he has delivered this tirade of hate against authority. Why would a senator from Queensland who has been a member of this chamber for many years deliver such a tirade against police and authority. I listened very closely but I could not hear one constructive remark. There was this tirade of hate. With all due respect to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has said, as I have indicated before I have respect for what that honourable senator has done in the past. We heard this tirade from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> quoting what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has done, what he had said and what other people had said. There was one point that I noted most. Perhaps I am a little sensitive about this matter because I live amongst Aboriginal people. It would be true to say that this year I suppose I have spent most weekends away from this place up in the Northern Territory with the Aboriginal people as I have done for the last three weekends in various parts of the Territory and the isolated parts. </para>

            <para>- As I was saying, the Aboriginal people are my friends. If we rise at 5 o'clock tomorrow, I will arrive in Darwin at 2.30 in the morning. At 7 o'clock that morning I will be some 1 50 to 200 miles out of Darwin attending a meeting to which I have been invited by the Aboriginal people. So I think my qualifications are such that the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory trust me. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>I suppose that if ever there should be an inquiry there should be one after the speech that we have just heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> to clear up completely, if nothing else, that smear, the dreadful dirt that has been shovelled, upon the police and people in authority in Australia. I rufute this claim completely- well, not completely because I acknowledge that even in a barrel of apples one may strike a bad apple. But this is life, is it not? No matter where we are we will strike a bad apple amongst many good apples. I would say that the same situation is to be found in the various police forces today. But I am not speaking of that one bad apple. I am speaking about the Police Force in the Northern Territory to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> referred. There goes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> He has left the Senate. There you are. Perhaps we will meet him another time. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> We were talking about one bad apple and a lot of good apples. I know the Northern Territory because I move around it continuously, especially through the outback. I assure honourable senators and the people of Australia that the Northern Territory police force, and I am sure the police forces in many other places, take a very sympathetic viewpoint to the Aboriginal people. </para>
        <para>Let me tell you of something that happened to me some two weeks ago in the Northern Territory. At that time I was some 200 miles south of Alice Springs, having been invited by the Aboriginal people- the Appatula people- to come and see them, which I did. We were looking at a situation which I have mentioned before. A hotel had been taken over by these people and run by them. It had brought about such a tremendous social development in this isolated town that the situation is a credit to them. During the afternoon when they were reviewing the effect on their community after having taken over the hotel some two years ago- these were the words which came straight from the Aboriginal people- they said to the community adviser at this meeting: 'Will you please write a letter to the </para>
        <para class="block">Commissioner of Police in the Northern Territory? We want to tell the Commissioner of Police what a good job the young constable who is living with us in this area in the Finke is doing and what a good friend he is to us'. Because I am interested when I hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> talk of black and doom and of the oppression which has happened, I looked at this matter a bit further. Here were the traditional leaders of the tribe. They said: 'Write a letter and tell the Commissioner what a good job this young constable has done'. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> do you know what had happened? Three years ago on this settlement there had been murder, manslaughter, maiming of people, drunkenness, broken families, children neglected and the Appatula housing association was in pieces. Out of this came reform and almost a miracle which the people brought about themselves. This one constable who has lived among these people has arrested one person in something like the last year. He arrested this one person for drunkenness or some such charge because the elders of the tribe said: 'You come and do it'. Why do we have the stirring up of a situation with honourable senators opposite calling for a commission when there are many things happening within the community today which are bringing about a development of better relations. We can go back decades and see what has happened in blackwhite relations. I suppose this has happened in every country where a majority has taken to the minority. That is part of life, I suppose. But the fact now is that the Aboriginal people are part of our way of life. I assure honourable senators that the Aboriginal people are coming up. </para>
        <para>I make another point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> did not make tonight. He quoted many authorities for this and that but I did not hear him quote the name of one Aboriginal person. As I have said in very many places, and I say it here tonight, the voice of Aboriginal people is not coming through such people as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> He is the type of person- there are many around Australiawho attempts to speak on behalf of the Aboriginal people, but the Aboriginal people will not have a bar of him. The Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory have said to me: 'Why does that man come to us from Queensland? He comes to us and he asks what do we want. He is always asking us what do we want but before we can say anything he keeps talking'. If that is the case, how can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and his like speak on behalf of the Aboriginal people? </para>
        <para>I would not stand and endeavour to hide any malpractice as far as the police and Aboriginal  people are concerned. We have had many difficulties in the past and we will have difficulties in the future. But if we earnestly and sincerely want to bring about better relations between the European community and the Aboriginal community, the last thing we want is a royal commission. What we should do is go into their communities and show some sympathy for them. I assure honourable senators that by showing sympathy to the Aboriginal people - </para>

            <para>- There have been faults on many sides. I am saying that with proper education, sympathy and interest much more can be gained these days without creating a permanent whirlpool of emotion. We have to overcome this problem. As I have said before, the only way to do this is by going into their community with some understanding. If there is to be an inquiry, perhaps such a move was taken some little time ago. One looks at the Law Reform Commission. My understanding of the situation at the moment is that in August 1975 the Law Reform Commission proposed significant changes to the process for handling and determining complaints. This was directed to the Australian police force. We well know that the Australian police force was not proceeded with; it was not formed. One could say: 'Thank goodness for that'. However, that is another argument. On 7 January this year came the reconsideration of the first report, in the light of the Australian police force not being formed. My understanding is that the matter of relations between the police and Aboriginals went before the Law Reform Commission in March this year. Tentative points have been put forward, but there has not yet been a final report to the Government. When the Government receives this final report it will be open for the Australian community to look at it, to criticise it, to advise on it and to make recommendations on it. We should not forge ahead with one of these emotional commissions of inquiry about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has been speaking. The criminal investigations legislation has picked up many of the recommendations that have been made in the past. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline>said some harsh things. In his usual style, he made some harsh statements about me. That does not worry me. It would worry me if the people of the Northern Territory believed them. But the people of the Northern Territory do not believe the statements he makes. The statements he makes regarding my name and activities mean nothing to me because the people of the Northern Territory know otherwise. A little while ago there were complaints in the Northern Territory regarding the police. These complaints continue. The police have investigated very many complaints. I suppose it is natural that there are many complaints throughout the whole community. I think two policemen were discharged from the service in the last year. I do not think they were discharged for acts against Aboriginal people. I hope not. I think one discharge resulted from a car accident after which a constable helped himself to some equipment in the car. He was removed from the service. I am not too sure what the other offence was, but the policeman was found guilty. Inquiries are carried out within the police force. If a person oversteps the mark he is reprimanded or removed from the service. </para>
        <para>It has been said that it is insufficient for a complaint to be made to the Commissioner of Police. The situation could well be coloured and the facts of the case would not come out; the case would not be investigated. Perhaps it has not been noted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and others that in the Northern Territory, to which he referred to some degree, anyone who has a complaint against the police now directs his complaint to the Crown Law Officer who will then take it up. It is investigated by a person who is divorced from the police force and who can judge the situation without fear or favour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> as this is a matter of some importance I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

			<para> by leave- I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make a few comments on this most important matter. In doing so I support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> Myinterest is with the total scene throughout Australia, but I shall draw my examples from the Northern Territory not only because it is different from the States in some ways, although it has some similarity with Queensland and Western Australia, but also because that is the area where I have had some experience. I have been an observer of the scene for 30-odd years. I have been involved with the Aboriginal situation for well in excess of 10 years. In fact, I have been involved long enough not to claim to be an expert in the area. </para>
		  </talk.start>
      <para>I support the suggestion that some sort of inquiry be held, for a number of reasons. The first is that the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders made this recommendation. Honourable Senators will recall that the Senate Select Committee was made up of people from both sides of the Senate, although according to the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> unfortunately seemed to have a commendable change of affiliations in his association with it. The Committee recommended that the Senate establish, as a matter of urgency, a select committee with terms of reference sufficiently wide to enable it to examine all aspects of relations between Aboriginals and the police. </para>
      <para>I support the proposition for another reason; that is, the comments made by the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. I shall read a comment which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Forster, who had the support of both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Muirhead and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Ward. He put out some guidelines for the investigation and interviewing of Aboriginal people. Towards the end of the statement he made this comment: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>It may be thought by some that these guidelines are unduly paternal and therefore offensive to Aboriginal people. It may be thought by others that they are unduly favourable to Aboriginal people. The truth of the matter is that they are designed simply to remove or obviate some of the disadvantages from which Aboriginal people suffer in their dealings with police. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">I think that is a very important comment, coming from three judges of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. I emphasise the words 'to remove or obviate some of the disadvantages from which Aboriginal people suffer in their dealings with police'. Later in the same report <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Forster had this to say: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>What I say is also not exclusive. I do not deal with the offering and application of violence nor with the offering of threats or inducements. These are, I think, sufficiently well known to require no further repetition by me. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">That means threats or inducements by the police to Aboriginal people. The <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News,</inline> commenting on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, had this to say: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>No one in his right mind would claim that all has been well between police and Aboriginals. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">If we look at the number of cases which have involved Aboriginal people we get some further indication of the need for an investigation. A question was asked of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> as Minister representing the Minister for the Northern Territory, on 10 March. The first part of the question asked: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>How many arrests of persons of Aboriginal descent have been made in the Northern Territory each year 1 970-76. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">The answer reads: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>Separate statistics are not kept in relation to persons of Aboriginal descent. Certain figures have been compiled in respect of full blood Aborigines. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">So I am speaking here only of full blood Aborigines, that is, roughly 25,000 men, women and children in the Northern Territory. I shall run through the statistics, commencing with the figure for 1970. In that year there were 4,920 arrests; in 1971, 6,770; in 1972, 5,787; in 1973, 6,426; and in 1974, 4,349. Of course, as we all recall, in October 1974 alcoholism was decriminalised, so the numbers dropped. In 1975 there were 2,462 arrests and in 1976 there were 2,550. Nevertheless, with a population of 25,000 that represents one in every ten. The next question asked of the Minister was: How many convictions for each year have been made? I think it is important to read through those statistics. In 1970 there were 8,557 convictions; in 1971, 13,737; in 1972, 12,162; in 1973, 15,203; and in 1 974, 1 7, 1 79. Again in 1 975 there was a drop because of the decriminalisation of alcoholism. There were 8,536 convictions in that year and 10,936 in 1976. That is again for a population of 25,000. 1 think the last set of figures provided is also relevant to the relationship between the Aboriginal people and the police. The following question was asked: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>What is the percentage of total arrests constituted by full blood Aborigines for each of the years 1970 to 1976? </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">The answer was that in 1970 it was 67 per cent; 1971, 63 per cent; 1972, 54 per cent; 1973, 53 per cent; 1974, 27 per cent; 1975, 32 per cent; and 1976, 29 per cent. That is the percentage of all cases. It should be recalled that that is for one quarter of the population- 25,000 people. </para>
      <para>My own observations over the years in the Northern Territory have added to my strong feeling that something needs to be done, that some inquiry needs to be held to establish the relationship between the Aboriginal people and the police. I have noticed over the years- others who have lived in the Territory would have seen the same thing- that when drunkenness was a crime it was the Aboriginal people who were picked up and the white people who were left behind. The reason behind that may have been commendable. Nevertheless the situation was that the white person would be left alone or helped home and the Aboriginal person would be picked up and taken to the police station. I have noticed particularly the problems faced by Aboriginal youths on settlements, particularly those who are unemployed, who have had no money and who have broken into stores to get grog. That constitutes a terrific percentage- I will give the figures later- of the people on Groote Eylandt and Gove. </para>
      <para>I have had discussions with Aboriginal people both while they were in Fannie Bay gaol in Darwin and outside. Those people have exhibited a strange attitude towards the law. In many cases they have not known why they have been picked up. In many cases they have seen the policeman as an authority figure. In many cases in their search for an identity and in their frustrations they have expressed themselves in anti-social behaviour against this authority figure. That is a very understandable situation but one which needs to be clarified. The reasons why these people do these things are not understood by many of the police. That is the reason why I think we need to have an inquiry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> mentioned the situation at Papunya, where 28 people incurred 300 charges because, being hungry, they broke into a store to get food. </para>
      <para>I am reminded of one of the authors who have worked with the people of the Northern Territory for many years- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cecil</inline> Holmes- who went to Yirrkala and Nhulunbuy to see what changes had been made since he made his films there. He wrote of observing what happened to two Aboriginal teachers. They are both fine young people. I know them both well. I refer to Miss Helen Marika and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tom</inline> Bakanawi <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holmes</inline> spoke of the disgusting names that Miss Marika had been called. She had been accused of soliciting because she was in the street- certainly having a drink. She was accused of all sorts of things and Tom himself was bashed by the police. I am not attacking the police; I am giving simple examples of things that have happened and have been documented. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holmes</inline> mentioned in his article that 98 per cent of all the arrests on Groote Eylandt were of Aboriginal people. A good many of those were of young men who had broken into the stores to get alcohol. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holmes</inline> mentioned that at Gove, which is the other mining town, 80 per cent of all the arrests were of Aboriginal people. </para>
      <para>I found it very disturbing when I went to the office of Aboriginal Legal Aid to ask it for some comments on the relationship between the Aborigines and police to find the lawyer present call out to his secretary: 'Bring me my brutality file'. What an indictment it is of our system that a man should file in his filing system the comments on and attitudes between the police and Aborigines under the heading of 'brutality'. The Police Department has admitted- there is no secret about this-that there are some 'bad' policemen. They have asked Aboriginal Legal Aid and others to provide details. It has already been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> that some people have lost their positions. That is to be commended. If the senior officers in the force are prepared to say that a man did wrong, that man should be sacked. Unfortunately Aborigines, because of the authority idea that they have towards the police, are not always prepared to go to them with their complaints. They have always feared that if such a person is not sacked there will be reprisals. </para>
      <para>I mention at this stage the need for the police in the Northern Territory to wear identifying numbers or identifying names of some sort. I have raised this matter in the Senate before. The Northern Territory is the only place in Australia where the police do not wear some identifying number. It is completely impossible for the Aboriginal people or, for that matter, any other people to identify the police unless they carry some sort of insignia on them. I call once again on the police to see the justice of wearing some sort of identification so that whenever any trouble occurs they can be identified. Another matter that has been of great concern to me is the matter of the police on patrols wearing sidearms That is contrary to the regulations and certainly incites all sorts of unfortunate reactions from the Aboriginal people. It is not good enough for the police to go out wearing six-shooters or whatever they happen to want when they go on their bush patrols. </para>
      <para>It is not enough simply to say these things. I would be failing in my duty as a senator from the Northern Territory if I did not try to pinpoint some areas and make some suggestions. The comment was made in a previous speech tonight that nothing constructive has been done. I do not agree with that. However, I certainly intend during the rest of my comments to be constructive. I feel that, as with Senate select committee reports, both sides should make recommendations when matters of this sort are being discussed. I am reminded of the old time policemen- the people who were called mounted police or troopers. I pay tribute to them. Many of them understood the situation of the Aboriginal people. Many of them had a real appreciation of the Aboriginal people. Some of them did not, of course. There are many Aboriginals alive today who still bear scars of reprisal raids when they were shot by policemen and others. These are many who bear the scars of the hobble chain from being belted by policemen and others. There are many who will tell tales of brutality. But that is a thing of the past. There were many who understood the situation and who attempted to apply real justice because they had an appreciation of the position of the Aboriginal people growing up in what was an alien situation. </para>
      <para>It is fair to say that many of the present day policemen do not have understanding. That is not surprising because they are not given any training in this work. I understand that those policemen who are recruited to work with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are not given any psychological tests to find out whether they are suited for that work. Honourable senators will recall that when patrol officers were recruited to go to Papua New Guinea they were given personality tests and psychological teststhe sorts of things that would weed out those people who were not likely to make good officers. More disturbing than the fact that these people are getting no training is the fact that they are given no encouragement to go ahead and study and to go ahead and read and by reading gain themselves some promotion. Many of these people need guidance. An inquiry would be of terrific assistance to them. Of course, the shortage of police in the Northern Territory does not help the situation. In that regard I refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory News</inline> under the heading 'Many police quit- Not enough men now, says McLaren', which reads: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>Commissioner <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bill</inline> McLaren confirmed there was a high rate of resignation from the force </para>
        <para>He said that this and the reduced staff ceiling -  . . were seriously affecting the service. The force were so short of men that if there were a couple of accidents and a break-in reported this would have to wait. 'It's madness. We haven't got sufficient men to cover the needs o.f the Territory, ' Mr McLaren said. ' Recruiting has also been cut. ' </para>

      <para class="block">Let us now move on to the situation of the Aboriginal tracker, the Aboriginal policeman. Some would say that this is the answer to the situation; "that if we could have Aboriginal policemen our problems would be solved. I commend the attempt by the Northern Territory police to recruit and train Aboriginal police, but we must make sure that they are Aboriginal police and not simply trackers. There is a hangover from the old days when the tracker swept the floors, cleaned out the Landrover, did the wife's washing, looked after the garden, did the odd jobs and looked pitiful in a cast-off uniform, riding in the back of the Landrover because he was not good enough to ride in the front, and eating away from the policeman when they were out on patrol. Nothing to be commended! If we are to have Aboriginal policemen, they must be fully supported and trained, with promotional opportunities, very much like the teachers who are being trained and are working in the Northern Territory; but they must be fully accepted and given status and provided, obviously, with the same quality of uniform and replacements as the other policemen. </para>
      <para>There are problems, of course. Many of the people who will go into these positions will not arrest or caution their own extended family. They are not prepared to do this. If there are four or five clans in the one area they will look after four and leave their own alone. This has become apparent not only here but overseas, where indigenous forces have been developed. Many will use the position to pay off another clan, use the opportunity of being the one with the big stick, as it were, to get back at a clan which has affected them. Many, because of their training, will not arrest all the people; they will concentrate perhaps on their own peer group or on younger people and many of them will not move out of their own region to work. But for all this they are still worth preserving. If they are given good training this will overcome many of the problems that their cultural background gives them, and the proper status that they will be given will establish their role. </para>
      <para>I would like to mention also the Aboriginal special magistrates or justices of the peace, and pay tribute to those who are working in this field at the moment- people like Silas Roberts and others- but I must again express caution. The same degree of care in selecting these officials -or perhaps more- should be exercised as is necessary in the case of the Aboriginal policeman, because they suffer from the same sort of problems. I am suggesting at this stage that if we do select people we should take the advice of the anthropologists working in the field, who are able to guide us and point out those who, shall we say, are able to 'overcome' their background sufficiently to render impartial justice. There must be discussion with the local community to make sure that the person being selected will be the one who is most appropriate. Again, we must make sure we canvass widely to make certain that we are not simply supporting one clan only as has happened in some negotiations that the Government has carried out with the Aboriginal people. </para>
      <para>It would be wrong if we did not mention the discussion on Aboriginal law versus Australian law which has been going on. Any investigation or inquiry that is held will have to look at this. Mention has been made already of the Law Reform Commission and the excellent work that it is doing, so I shall not comment beyond saying again that care needs to be exercised; it is not a simple solution. Many aspects of Aboriginal law are such that we would not be prepared to support them. We must have built within our society, within our law, the rights of every individual member. If we support it without offering some caution we would be supporting killing, child brides, polygamy and so on. I am not making a judgment on this situation and it would be impertinent for me to do so, but I am trying to stress the point that it is not a simple situation, that it is not enough simply to say: 'We would be right if we allowed them to have their own law'. </para>
      <para>If we are talking about the police and the law we must talk about prisons and the attitude that Aboriginal people have to going to prison. There is no doubt that in the past in some areas young men saw going to prison as a part of attaining manhood, a part of growing up, a part almost of the initiation, if I may say so without being sacrilegious. This aspect must be looked at. Some people in the community suggest that, for the Aboriginal, going to Fannie Bay is a good holiday, though how they could say that once having been inside, I do not know. We would have to determine whether the Aboriginal people do see any problem about going to gaol, or whether there is no sanction at all against it. We must look also at the problem raised in this place earlier about the number of boys being expelled to places like Bremer Island, people from the Centre being sent up to what is almost foreign or alien country. It was originally agreed to by some of the older people but when they saw the effects it was having on the younger people they withdrew their support. It is interesting that this could happen to young people. I have recollections of seeing on many occasions a fully grown and what I would have called sophisticated Aboriginal being completely ill at ease outside his country, a man from the north walking through the central area, in one of the settlements, being almost afraid- yet we call that man sophisticated. </para>
      <para>I would like to refer to the report produced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Forster with the concurrences of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Ward and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Muirhead. Honourable senators will remember that the report was issued because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Forster had rejected evidence taken by police in two major cases in the Alice Springs area. He began his report by saying that many Aboriginal people do not understand English, although they may appear to do so. He gave an example in the report of a questioner asking: 'Did you go into his house?' This would be understood by most English-speaking people as, 'Did you go into that man's building?', whereas even if this were translated for the Aboriginal people it could mean, 'Did you go within the fence surrounding the house?'. The implications are obvious in the case of a breaking and entry, or some similar crime. He made the point that we know that Aboriginal people are polite and will try to give the answer that they think the questioner wants. If the person asking the question is a man of authority it is so much more difficult for the Aboriginal. He wants to please. One would almost say that he is frightened. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>Forster made the point that Aboriginal people do not understand the caution. It seems silly to Aboriginal people to say, 'You need not answer this question', and then proceed to ask it. Aboriginal people do not understand such situations. If you do not want an answer, there is no point in putting a question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Forster put forward some very sane ideas which I commend to the Government, particularly the one concerning the Prisoner's Friend, which would mean that no Aboriginal person would be interviewed unless he had a friend with him. This could be an English-speaking Aboriginal man whom he trusts, or a woman whom he trustssomeone from the area who could make sure that he understood the questions and also his rights. </para>
      <para>I was particularly pleased to see the emphasis placed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Forster on the dignity of the individual, making sure that the Aboriginal prisoner had a meal, that he was given facilities to go to the toilet, that if he needed to be stripped for any sort of reason he be given alternative clothing. He concluded by saying: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>The Judges of this Court do not consider the effectiveness of police investigation will be set back by compliance with these recommendations. It is basic that persons in custody should be treated with courtesy and patience. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">I would commend to honourable senators the motion that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> There is obviously a need for some sort of inquiry and I would put forward the proposition that that ought to be not a royal commission but a bipartisan inquiry along the lines of a Senate committee 's investigation. I am aware that many people will say that if we have yet another Senate committee inquiring into yet another aspect of Aboriginal life nothing will be done. I am afraid that that is one of the risks we must take, but it seems to me that this vitally important area can be studied only by way of a bipartisan approach. If the Government is dinkum, to use a colloquialism, in its approach to Aboriginals, as I believe the Minister in fact is, I am sure it will look very carefully at the possibility of conducting such an inquiry; that it will look at this running sore that is in our society and seek some remedy for it. </para>

            <para>- I do not propose to speak at length tonight. I have already commenced my remarks on the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and I do not want to take up time which might otherwise be available to other members of the Committee and to other honourable senators who wish to speak on this matter. The Committee in its report dealt with a number of matters concerning the present problems in the Middle East. The reference to the SubCommittee arose originally from the conflict which was at that time taking place in the Lebanon- a conflict which fortunately now seems to have lessened in its intensity. It was the view of the Committeeit is certainly my view- that the most important problems of the Middle East do not relate to the internal conflict within the Lebanon, however important and tragic that conflict was, but have resulted from the continuing state of confrontation between Israel and the Arab countries of the Middle East and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>I think it could be said that the problems of the Lebanon itself and the civil war which has been taking place in the Lebanon were, in themselves, very largely a by-product of the Israeli-Arab crisis. Had it not been for that conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs, it is unlikely that there would have been the substantial number of Palestinians living within Lebanon. As emerges from the Committee's inquiries, to a very large extent the conflict which took place within the Lebanon was a conflict between members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and other people- indigenous people- living within the Lebanon. The conflict between Israel and the Arab countries has become much acute over the past 10 or 20 years. But in many respects this conflict has been inevitable, so it now seems, from the first Jewish Zionist settlements in Palestine at the beginning of this century. The conflict results largely from the inability to reconcile the differences between two competing nationalisms, both laying claim to the same small territory. </para><para>The Jewish settlement, the Zionist settlement, in Palestine took place as a result of the Zionist movement, a movement which had as its objective the finding of a national home for the Jewish people who, for many centuries, have endured great persecution in many countries and, in particular, in those countries in Eastern Europe where the great bulk of the Jewish population was living. Founders of the Zionist movement believed that a national home should be acquired for the Jewish people who had retained their separate ethnic, cultural, religious and, to a certain extent, linguistic identity during the most adverse circumstances throughout many parts of the world, and that Palestine, which at that time was very largely unpopulated and undevelopedhistorically it had great ties with the Jewish people- was a suitable place for the Jewish people to settle. Indeed, many of the founders of the Zionist movement predicted with melancholy perspicacity the final solution of the Jewish problem which, as the SS described it, took place in Europe during the time of the Second World War. Many of them predicted that a cataclysm, a holocaust, of the kind which did take place would take place and that it was imperative that there should be settlement in Palestine. </para><para>Until the advent to power of the Nazis in Germany in 1933 the settlement was very slow. It accelerated as a result of the Nazi persecution of the Jewish people in Germany and in the occupied areas. After the end of the Second World War large numbers of Jews from Europepeople whose families had been largely exterminated and who were uprooted from their own homes- settled in great numbers in what was then Palestine. This, at the same time, was taking place during a period of persecution of Jewish people in many of the Arab countries. There was, for the first time, in large numbers a settlement of Sephardic Jews from North Africa and the Middle East. They settled in Palestine with the purpose of buying land, of peacefully settling, of living side by side with the Arab people who were already living in that country, in a national home. Unfortunately for them, and perhaps for everybody, their settlement in Palestine took place at the very same time as the revival of Arab nationalism started to take place. The two nationalisms- the Jewish nationalism, the Zionism, and the Arab nationalism- were coming into flower almost simultaneously during the 1920s and the 1930s, and particularly during and after the Second World War. </para><para>However that may be, the state of Israel was established. Australia played some part in the establishment of the state of Isreal as a legal entity. It became admitted to the United Nations. All of the great powers supported the establishment of the state of Israel. In fact one of the strongest speeches in support of that United Nations establishment and recognition of the state of Isreal was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gromyko,</inline> who is at present the Soviet Foreign Minister and was the Soviet delegate to the United Nations during those debates. This would not perhaps emerge from some of the more recent statements by representatives of the Soviet Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gromyko</inline> himself, but certainly there was no dispute between the great powers on this issue at the time of the establishment of Isreal Since that time there have been- I do not want to deal with matters which I think all honourable senators are familiar with- several major conflicts between Isreal and the surrounding countries. There have been number of smaller constant conflictsguerilla activities of various kinds, raids, boycotts, acts of sabotage and I think it would not be unfair to say, terrorism. During the past years there has been the establishment of the Palestine </para><para class="block">Liberation Organisation representing a number of Palestinian political organisations of some differing persuasions. Some appear to be somewhat more moderate, if that is the appropriate word, than some of the others, but all of them committed to the destruction of the state of Isreal. The Palestine Liberation Organisation itself and every affiliated organisation within the Palestine Liberation Organisation- whether it is the El Fatah or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Yasser</inline> Arafat or the much more extreme organisation, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine- however they may differ on the methods they would apply to the elimination of the state of Isreal all of them are united in their belief that the State of Israel has no right to exist. </para><para>The sub-committee was of the view, and I know that it is the view of all the political parties represented in this Parliament, that this is not a situation which the civilised world can tolerate. Whatever may have been the justification for the Zionist settlement in Palestine- I certainly have no hesitation in saying that it was completely justified whether or not one can say now that it should not have taken place and Israel should not have been established, the fact is that Israel was established and it is a country. Most of its citizens, wherever they were born, in fact were bom after the establishment of the state. It is just as pointless to inquire into whether the Jewish people should have settled in Palestine as it is to inquire into whether English people should have settled in Australia or the United States, whether Dutch people should have settled in South Africa- that may not be the happiest of examples- or whether the Celts should have migrated from Central Asia across to Ireland. There is no point now in debating where people came from. The fact is that the Jewish people are there and that they do have a state. </para><para>The other problem- it is also a pressing problem- is that of the Palestinian Arabs themselves. They are not citizens of any other country and, despite the efforts of some Israeli spokesmen to do so, I do not think that one can deny that the Palestinian people, whatever historical origins they may have had, are also, if they want to have one, entitled to have a state in those areas of Palestine which are not recognised by the international community as being part of Israel. But the solution of the problems of the Palestinians cannot be divided from the solution of the problems of Israel, in the same way as the solution to the problems of Israel cannot be found without a solution to the problems of the Palestinians. </para><para>I believe that the Palestinians are entitled to a state and I believe that the Israelis are entitled to the continuation of their state, on whatever borders they may be. Whatever negotiations there may be to settle those borders, I do not think there can be any dispute- there should not be- about the fact that Israel is entitled to exist as a state within defensible borders. I know that they are difficult to define, but without labouring the point as to whether Jerusalem, for example, ought to be under some sort of tripartite or bipartisan control or whether it ought to be within Israel or divided in some way- without going into those details, which are matters which can be dealt with only by subsequent negotiation- I do not think there can be any dispute- there should not be any dispute- that Israel is entitled to its right to exist. </para><interjection>

            <para>-Senator Sim has asked me whether I place any reliance on the recently reported statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arafat</inline> indicating that the PLO is prepared to accept the existence of the state of Israel. I do not know whether to or not. I certainly would like to, but that brings me to the point that I was about to make. As long as the Palestine Liberation Organisation- the last meeting of the Palestine National Council was described as being a victory for the moderatesmaintains the position that the creation of a Palestine state on the West Bank is merely meant to be a springboard for the eventual destruction of the whole of Israel, I believe that the Government of Israel is completely entitled to say- in fact it would be acting in a most foolish and selfdestructive manner if it were to accept that positionthat it will not withdraw its forces from the occupied West Bank areas and allow the establishment of that state. I believe that there is no doubt whatsoever about that. At the same time, having said that, I believe that Israel cannot achieve peace if it continues to say that it will not tolerate the existence of a Palestinian state or an independent West Bank in any circumstances, and I fear that that is what the present Government in Israel is inclined to do. That seems to be what emerges from what that Government is saying. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>Although these matters were not, so far as I recollect, before the sub-committee when it was considering this reference, the support and recognition which have been given by the Government of Israel to the recent settlement of Jewish settlers on the West Bank in the occupied area are not conducive to a peaceful settlement of the question. It was a totally different matter under the previous Government, when settlements were taking place which the Government did not endorse- it did not do anything in many instances, although it did in some, to stop the settlement- and in respect of which that Government said: 'They are there, but that is a matter that can be negotiated'. For the present Government of Israel to be saying that these settlements not only are being made but also should be made and that the Government will encourage them to be made and they are permanent settlements, I believe, can only have the effect of producing further intransigence on the part of the PLO, and in fact is wrong. In the same way as the Jewish people of Israel or any other people in Israeldespite what the United Nations has decided, I do not believe that Israel is a country which engages in racial discrimination- are entitled to their own nation, the Palestinian people are entitled to their own nation. </para><para>The criticisms which I would make of the Israelis are secondary criticisms, but they are important criticisms. I believe that they are inhibiting the achievement of a peaceful settlement of the whole dispute. Nonetheless the fact remains that for as long as the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Arab countries continue to say that they will not recognise the existence of that state and that it is their objective to destroy it, I do not believe that one can object in any way to the Israelis continuing to occupy the West Bank and refusing to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Statements have been made recently by the Government of Egypt which certainly go well beyond anything which was said earlier. Although there still, as far as I know, is not any pronouncement on an official basis by the  President  of Egypt, at least it does appear now that Egypt is prepared to accept the continued and permanent existence of the state of Israel. As yet, there is nothing clear and unequivocal to this effect in any statement which has been issued by the Palestine Liberation Organisation or the other neighbouring Arab countries. Without it, peace cannot be achieved. </para><para>In conclusion, I suggest that it should be the goal of those people who are friends of Israel, people who wish well and who do not wish ill to the Arab population of the Middle East, people who are trying to avoid bloodshed and to achieve peace in the area, to do two things: We should be urging on the Arab countries, and by whatever influence we can have on those countries which in turn influence the Palestine Liberation Organisation, that there can be no peaceful settlement without their recognising the sovereignty of the state of Israel and its continued existence within secure boundaries. At the same time I believe- this is not as important, but it is still very important- that we should be doing whatever we can to impress upon the Government of Israel that a permanent occupation of the West Bank as a question of principle, the establishment of new Jewish settlements. on the West Bank, is itself conducive only to a future conflagration in the area. I think that Australia can play a part in these matters. We do have relations with all of the countries that are involved. All of them are countries with which we have trading and other associations. If a conflagration or war were to occur, it would affect not only the people of the Middle East but also our own people. We have a responsibility in this direction. I welcome the report of the Sub-committee, which I believe has done something to inform the Australian Parliament and the Australian people of the problems involved in this area. </para></speech>

          <para>- I rise to support the recommendations and the conclusions of the Sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which investigated the Middle East situation. In doing so, I want to say how much I appreciate the fact that on this sub-committee I happened to be one of only two Government members, along with four members of the Opposition, under the distinguished chairmanship of the honourable Kim Beazley. I found that it was an exhilarating experience, especially when compared to the episode of bells and corridor trotting that we have had today, to find that in those circumstances we could examine a matter and come to a reasonable and responsible consensus. </para>

            <para>The report in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of 14 July 1976 referred to the retrenchment of 85 people resulting from the closure of 3 Commonwealth Hostels, in the Australian Capital Territory, on 24 July 1976. In fact, to that date, 6 Commonwealth Hostels in Canberra had been closed. . </para>
            <para>The guidelines dealing with Redundancy Situations in Australia Government Employment apply to employees of Commonwealth Hostels Ltd. Under these guidelines the income of an eligible person was maintained at its level at the date of termination for a period of six months and I am advised that under this provision 69 of those retrenched from the Canberra Hostels were paid income maintenance totalling $174,820 for periods varying from one week to 26 weeks. </para>
            <para>The guidelines dealing with Redundancy Situations in Australian Government Employment do not apply to persons employed by sandmining companies on Fraser Island and they are therefore not eligible for income maintenance payments. It should be noted, however, that an unconditional grant of $10m was made by the Commonwealth Government to the Queensland State Government for allocation at its discretion to create employment opportunities in the Maryborough region; $ 1 m of this to be spent in 1 976-77, and $3m in each of the 3 succeeding years. </para>
