          <para>That the Senate records its sincere regret at the death of His Beatitude Archbishop Makarios III, President of the Republic of Cyprus, and expresses its profound sympathy to the people of Cyprus. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">President Makarios was the inspiration of the modern State of Cyprus and represented it in the world community with wisdom and distinction. He was ordained deacon and priest in 1938. He graduated from the School of Theology of Athens University and he continued his theological studies at Boston University on a World Council of Churches scholarship. On his return to Cyprus in 1948 he was consecrated bishop and began intensive religious, social and national work in his see. At this time he began his vigorous campaign for nationhood for Cyprus. In 19S0, he was elected both as archbishop and ethnarch-national leader of the Greek people of Cyprus. It is a tribute to his qualities that he was elected as both the spiritual and political leader of his country. </para>
        <para>In 19S2 he began his campaign at the United Nations General Assembly for international recognition of Cyprus. During the following years of the decade he fought courageously to achieve his goal, enduring even exile from his country. Following the London Agreement in 1959 that Cyprus would become an independent republic, he returned to Cyprus and was elected its first President. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">President</inline>Makarios played a unique and distinguished role in his country&#39;s national and international affairs. He visited many countries in his quest for a solution to the problems of Cyprus. He tirelessly represented his country at many international conferences as well as at the United Nations and at meetings of Commonwealth Heads of Government. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>remarkable personal qualities earned him an eminent place amongst world statesmen.  His  counsels will be particularly missed at Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings in which he had actively participated for many years. During the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> discussed with him his forthcoming State visit to Australia in November this year. This visit would have been a fitting symbol of the development of longstanding and excellent relations between our two countries. The Australian Government greatly looked forward to it. I am sure that not only those Australians whose country of origin is Cyprus but all Australians will share the Government&#39;s regret that it cannot take place. </para>
        <para>The Government therefore wishes to record its deep sympathy in the Parliament to the people of Cyprus. They have lost a statesmen of great eminence who had long personified his people&#39;s quest for identity and independence. I am sure all honourable senators hope that the search for a peaceful and lasting solution to problems in Cyprus, to which the late  President  had devoted so much of his life, will be pursued with determination despite his untimely death. </para>

          <para>-I support the motion of condolence moved by the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> in respect of the late Archbishop Makarios. The name of Makarios has been written indelibly into the history of the Mediterranean area. Like many world figures in public life, he earned the most loyal friends and the most bitter enemies. Although a man of the church he could be extremely hard in pursuit of his objectives but never losing his humanity to his own people.  His  turbulent career involved the great powers, and despite exile for some years he eventually returned to Cyprus and was elected  President  of the newly independent republic. It is to be hoped that his passing does not reactivate the tragedy of Cyprus in the 1950s and the 1960s and that the stability he brought to that country will be maintained in the years ahead. </para>

          <para>-I would like to support the condolence motion. It is my belief that Archbishop Makarios would have wished that any tribute to him would be a tribute to the Cypriot people. I take it that the Senate views this condolence motion in that way. Archbishop Makarios was a leader, as he has been described by both the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt),</inline> well respected and of good repute. He led the people of Cyprus in times of great trouble. At his death the people of Cyprus were still in trouble. Cyprus is an example of a small nation seeking to be independent, seeking to be free, without the interference of foreign nations. It was the interference of foreign nations that Archbishop Makarios resisted for so long. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is my belief that what he stood for will be remembered. I think that the solving of the problems of Cyprus will be facilitated by the memory which will rest with the Cypriot people and the Turkish people. The solution to their problems will be assisted by his memory. I believe that in a short period reason will prevail across the boundaries of race and religion and that independence, full freedom and peace will come back to the Cypriot people. </para>

        <para>The late Theo Nicholls was known to many of us. He was a member of the Australian Labor Party in this Senate. He was elected to the Senate in 1943 and served here until 1968. Like the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> his career also embraced many of the activities of this Parliament including, at one stage,  Chairman  of Committees. Although I knew him only briefly- I am sure some of my longer serving colleagues can relate some personal ancedotes about him- I remember him as a very cheerful, almost philosophical person, who could always see the humourous side of events in this Parliament. As I am sure all of us would agree, that is a very necessary attribute in this place. He always occupied the same chair in the Senate club room next to the window because, I understand, he believed there was so much hot air inside that it was necessary to get some cool air from the outside.  His  passing is a loss to us and is a loss of a personal friend to many of us on both sides of the chamber. To his family and relatives I extend the deepest sympathy of Opposition senators. </para>
        <para>I also associate the Opposition with the remarks of the Leader of the Government in respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Archibald</inline> Grenfell Price, whose career is well known to most of us.

          <para>-I join in the message of condolence in respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls.</inline> Although I knew Grenfell Price in his latter years as an educationist in South Australia, I am not sufficiently familiar with his career to make a contribution in relation to his activities when he was a member of Parliament. In relation to Theo Nicholls, back in the Depression days I, as a young member of the Australian Labor Party, was introduced to two brothers who came into the Labor Party in South </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Australia from the country areas. They were both unemployed. They were the two Nicholls brothers. One of them was the father of Martin Nicholls, who became the member for Bonython, and the other entered the Senate. Theo Nicholls at that time was trying to earn a few bob to supplement the hand-out he was getting from the State Government and to make a living travelling about on a push-bike exchanging reading books at three pence a time. He lived in Henley Beach Road, Mile End, and was a married man with a young daughter. </para>
        <para>He became secretary of three small organisations on a part time basis because at that time small trade unions could not afford full time officials. He organised the three trade unions and later, with his elevation to the position of trade union secretary, became secretary of the South Australian Trades and Labour Council. From the Labour Council, which at that time did not have a full time secretary, he was appointed as a commissioner on the South Australian Industrial Commission which assessed the basic wage in that State. During his time as secretary of the Trades and Labour Council he displayed the unique qualifications that everyone noted in his time in this place. He. had what many have described as a photographic memory. Without a minute secretary he would attend meetings of the Council and on the next day he would write up the minutes without a note having been taken, and he was accurate. The minutes were never challenged. He would come back from meetings of the Congress of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and, very proud of his capability of remembering, would recite word perfect everything that had occurred, including every resolution that was carried at the ACTU meeting. He would tell you what time the meeting started and what time it adjourned for lunch. No detail was left out. </para>
        <para>He became a senator for the State of South Australia in 1943 under the preferential system whereby a party either had three members elected or none. There was no question of two members from one party and three from another party being elected in those days. Despite the risk that he took on every occasion he remained a senator until his retirement. During that period he held the position of  Chairman  of Committees. In the 1961 election, when I was elected to the Senate, Theo Nicholls was the leader of the Labor team. I believe that it was the only time when the third Labor man was elected in South Australia without the elimination of any Labor candidate on the ballot paper. Until that time it was the highest vote that had been received by the Labor Party. I think that he as leader of the team must take some of the credit for that achievement. He was well respected in the State of South Australia. When I was elected as an impoverished senator he came to me and said: &#39;It will be a month before you get any money from that hard crowd over there. Do you want any cash to carry you on until you get a pay?&#39; That was his attitude. It was a friendship of which I am proud. When I came to the Senate in 1 962 he greeted me by taking me down to the bar and buying me a drink. </para>
        <para>Theo Nicholls displayed his ability to memorise by some of the speeches he made in this chamber with never a note. He did not always accept praise for this but could repeat a speech he made in some other place and at some other time. During his last speech in this place as an old man he spoke for half an hour without a note on Vietnam and the Labor Party&#39;s attitude to it. On that occasion he quoted word perfect and without a note a speech prepared by a journalist. He was very proud of his fantastic ability, an ability which no one could ever understand. After his retirement I used to visit him and on the occasions when he went out with some old colleagues to the city we would adjourn to a club or hotel. He remained in good health and looked after himself despite the loss of his wife some 2 or 3 years ago.  His  married daughter lived next door and assisted in caring for Theo until about 2 months before he died when he took ill. He was unconscious for the last four days. He was given a private funeral. I wish to express my appreciation of the friendship and comradeship of Theo Nicholls during his industrial and political life and to offer my sympathy to his daughter on her bereavement. </para>

When I first came to the Parliament <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> had already retired. He was a member of this place for a long period but at the time of his retirement there was a big political electoral swing resulting in the return of 33 Government senators and three Opposition senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> was defeated at that particular election.  His  name was still mentioned and he had created a very sound reputation for his contribution to the parliamentary life of this country.

        <para>I did want to make special reference to and associate myself with the motion of condolence on the death of former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Theo</inline> Nicholls. </para>
        <para class="block">When I first came to the Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> he was  Chairman  of Committees under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gordon</inline> Brown, the  President  of the Senate at that time. While occupying the positions of  Chairman  of Committees and <inline font-weight="bold">Deputy President, Senator Nicholls</inline> always displayed a tremendous knowledge of the Standing Orders; he was reputed to be able to recite them verbatim. During his time in the chair he showed himself to be a most understanding and impartial presiding officer. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline>has referred to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls</inline> &#39;s prodigious memory. There is no doubt about it; it had to be experienced to be believed. It was evident in his social life. He was a very good mixer and had a tremendous sense of humour. He was able to draw on a vast reservoir of legend and anecdote. Most of it was factual but he also had the ability to elaborate a little to make a good story. He was always entertaining. </para>
        <para>In relation to his ability to memorise a speech, I recall that on one occasion the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Critchley,</inline> a colleague of his from South Australia, asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls</inline> to take part in a debate because of some timing problem. As happened sometimes in the past- it does not happen much now- they wanted to fill in a certain amount of time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls</inline> had to refer to another senator&#39;s speech on the subject. He had about a quarter of an hour to memorise his speech which lasted about 35 minutes. I sat in this back seat and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls</inline> was speaking from his seat near me. I sat with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> copy of the original speech and checked it. It was absolutely word perfect down to the full stops and the pauses between sentences, indicating that he had this great gift. </para>
        <para>He was a very good family man and a good friend to all those who came into contact with him. When he left the Senate, it was poorer for his leaving. Now with his eventual passing at a great age the nation, too, is poorer for losing a very colourful and memorable citizen. I wish to convey to his relatives my personal sympathy. I am very pleased that his time in the Parliament and his contribution to the life of this nation are on record. </para>

          <para>-I wish to make a very brief comment on the loss of former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Theo</inline> Nicholls. He was one of the first people from another State who contacted me when I first arrived here in 1965. He made a very big impact. That was the first time I had met him. One of the things he said at that time was: &#39;If you lose the ability to laugh while you are in the Parliament you might as well give it away now.&#39; That was the way Theo looked at life generally.  His  ability to memorise long tracts, which was mentioned by my 2 colleagues, was quite outstanding. He could also remember poems of probably 150 verses. I think that he compiled some of them because there were no existing pieces of poetry that were long enough for Theo to apply his fantastic memory to. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In relation to the other anecdotes told by my colleagues, I am told-and this is on good authority- that on one occasion when he was called upon at short notice to make a speech, he actually took it from a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> from the other House. He thought the speech had some validity and was of fair quality so he memorised it. The person who had made the speech had introduced the subject in the lower House. The person was in the gallery because he wanted to find out how the debate was going. He listened to Theo speaking for some five or 10 minutes. He thought the speech was very familiar and that he had heard it somewhere before. At the end of some three-quarters of an hour when the speech had been completed without the alteration of a full stop of a comma, he realised it was his own speech that Theo had been using in this place. He came around to compliment Theo on the quality of his speech, but Theo was not admitting that he had nicked the speech from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard of</inline> the other place. </para>
        <para>I believe that it is people of this character who contribute in a great way to the democracy that should live on in both Houses of Parliament. Theo Nicholls mixed well with people of all parties. He appeared not to have any enemies. He had a very acid tongue which he could use when he wanted to do so. Right from an early stage we formed a friendship. Each year we exchanged birthday cards. His birthday and mine were close together. We also exchanged messages at Christmas. I will miss that. I had a birthday card for Theo ready for posting this year. I cannot now send it, of course. I join with my collegues in supporting the motion generally and in particular I express sympathy to the surviving family of the late Theo Nicholls. </para>

          <para>-1 want to refer briefly to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Archibald</inline> Grenfell Price. I make particular reference to the segment in the speech of the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Archibald</inline> &#39;s Chairmanship of the Council of the National Library in Canberra. Because I am privileged to be the  Deputy Chairman  of the Council now I am following to some extent in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Archibald&#39;s</inline> footsteps. The work which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Archibald</inline> Grenfell Price did for the National Library and the National Library Council is bearing fruit today not only in the work of the National Library but also in the National Library&#39;s influence in this sphere throughout Australia. I refer also to his work with the Commonwealth Literary Fund. Many Australian writers and authors have every reason to be grateful to him for his understanding of their claims and for his assistance to them. I recall appreciatively my own personal representations to him on behalf of writers and authors who have benefited from his consideration of their representations and who subsequently have gone on to make their own mark as writers and authors in the Australian context. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Archibald</inline> Grenfell Price was a great man of letters, a great geographer, a great writer and a great educationalist. Australian cultural life has benefited considerably from his long years of contribution to it. As a South Australian senator with some association with the work which he undertook, I am pleased to have this opportunity of paying tribute to him. </para>

          <para>-I want briefly to support the condolence motion and in particular to refer to former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Theo</inline> Nicholls. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and I were elected to the Parliament in 1961. I followed former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nicholls</inline> as No. 2 candidate for the Australian Labor Party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> was No. 3. Before that time I was associated with Theo Nicholls in Trades and Labour Council activities in South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> referred to these activities. It has been said before that the Parliament reflects society outside the Parliament. I think Theo Nicholls contributed quite an amount to the Labor movement, first in the three unions which he represented and later as the Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council. At a very active time during the war years he assumed more important duties on bodies which were set up. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0</inline> &#39;Byrne stated, he was quite an interesting and broad character. He had a lot of experience in society and in travelling generally. He was something of an entertainer. Many of the social gatherings in this Parliament have been lightened, as we all know, by his stories which are now on record for those who would like to read them. I certainly am saddened to know that he has passed away. He was a great friend and colleague in the Labor movement in South Australia. He represented an important segment of society. He made a great contribution. Although he suffered two heart attacks while he was a senator everybody knows that he was  active almost to the end of his life. He had a very active and useful life. I certainly join with the other honourable senators who have expressed sorrow about his death. I would like also to express my sympathy to his family. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister for Science. Following reports that Australia intends to declare a 200-mile fishing zone around Australian coastal territories, is it not a fact that there will be a great need for research into marine biology in these extended waters which could give a reliable assessment of the fishing potential and result in further encouragement for the establishment of an Australian fishing fleet? Will the Minister have discussions with the Minister for Primary Industry in relation to an expansion of marine research into these external waters, including the waters adjacent to the Antarctic? As the lease of ships servicing the Australian base in the Antarctic will expire in a few years, will the Minister consider the purchase of a ship which could service the Antarctic base and also be used for marine research, particularly during those periods of the year when it is not required for the Antarctic service run? </para>

            <para>-The question is quite comprehensive, but the core of it is whether I will discuss with the Minister for Primary Industry aspects of fishing resources in the Antarctic. This is a matter which is under review by the Government. Certainly I will take the honourable senator&#39;s comments on board. It is a fact that the two vessels servicing the Australian Antarctic base at present have a limited life. An interdepartmental committee has been examining the prospects of an improved transport service to Antarctica. This has resulted in recommendations being put forward that a ship providing transport to the Antarctic could also be used for oceanographic and marine science investigation. </para>

Nevertheless, I confirm that an interdepartmental committee has been looking at this matter. Interest has been shown also in the possibility of utilising a ship, at considerable cost, in conjunction with other nations which have an interest down there. So I assure the honourable senator who asked the question that the matters he raised are under consideration by the Government. </para>

            <para>-In regard to the latter question, of course the Commonwealth Police Force will always assist wherever it can in the detention of law breakers and the enforcement of laws. As to the wider question, as I think the honourable senator would know, the Prime Minister on his own initiative has contacted all State Premiers seeking their assistance in the establishment of a Commonwealth-State inquiry into the whole of the drug problem. As I think all honourable senators would know, the drug problem in Australia has international ramifications and it has interstate as well as intrastate ramifications. </para>

          <para>As I understand the position, the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> has already had preliminary discussions with the six State Attorneys-General. Terms of reference are about to be settled between the seven governments of Australia which will be interested in this inquiry. Therefore I can assure the honourable senator that the Commonwealth Government and all its agencies and departments are most anxious to get on with the job of identifying and hopefully solving the problems of drug trafficking and abuse in Australia. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed, more in sorrow than in anger, to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I have read a report of the Aboriginal Medical Service survey which speaks of &#39;an appalling starvation belt&#39; amongst Aboriginals in Sydney, matched only by the most deprived communities of famine stricken Ethiopia or Biafra. The report alleges that more than 25 per cent of Sydney&#39;s Aboriginal children are suffering from serious malnutrition and that most of them have suffered permanent brain damage because of undernourishment. I ask the Minister whether it is a fact that the Aboriginal Medical Service has received no government funds since May of this year, although I understand that a grant equivalent to $20 a head has recently been announced by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner.</inline> Why have these funds been cut off since May? The second part of my question relates to the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Johnson, the honourable member for Brisbane, when he said that Aboriginals are overfed and overprotected. Does not the Minister think that this extraordinary outburst of racism is deserving of censure by her Cabinet colleagues and by all Australian people? </para>

            <para>- I take it that the honourable senator was referring to the Aboriginal Medical Service in Redfern when he referred to Aboriginal children. On that basis I want to advise that during the Supply period from July to September, $120,000 was provided to the Medical Service on 27 July. This grant was made in the same way that funds for the Supply period are always made at this time of the year, pending the release of finance for the whole financial year to be provided in the new Budget. In view of this normal practice of releasing funds during the Supply period- the honourable senator will be well aware of that practice- it is regrettable that the Service resorted to a publicity campaign against the Department. I understand that $65,000 was granted for operational expenses and $55,000 for renovation work which was being carried out on the premises. Unauthorised expenditure of $55,000 by the Service had been the cause of some problems. Operating expenses will be more than were provided for last year. There was never any suggestion in the mind of the Government that the amount of operating funds would be reduced. Further grants to the Service will be made after the Budget is brought down and following a study of the Service&#39;s own application for finance for the year 1977-78, which was received by the Department on 7 July. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I share the honourable senator&#39;s concern about the malnutrition of Aboriginal children not only in metropolitan areas but also in the more remote communities. In relation to the comments of a member of Federal Parliament with regard to Aboriginals being overfed and overprotected, I think they must have been made in a very selective context. We all would agree that there is great malnutrition and deprivation amongst Aboriginal communities throughout this country. </para>

            <para>-I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is lt a fact that members of the recent parliamentary delegation to the Middle East were each issued with 2 passports, one for use in Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon and the other for use in Israel? Is it a fact that separate passports were issued because of pressure that it was felt would be applied by the relevant Arab countries if it were known that members of the Australian delegation were travelling to Israel? If this is the case does it not indicate a servile piece of conduct by the Australian Government towards foreign powers? In future will the Government take steps to ensure that Australia&#39;s national sovereignty and dignity are maintained in such circumstances? </para>

I ask: Has the Minister been made aware of attempts by certain individuals to bribe some medical officers who examine people for invalid pensions? By way of explanation I add briefly that evidently some relatively young people have advised doctors that if they are granted a pension they will then leave the country and have the pension sent to them out of the country. Will the Minister in due course table a list of the number of invalid pensions granted by different officers over the past 36 months which are now being paid overseas? Will the Minister have the Commonwealth Police investigate the allegation that I have made in my question? Will the Government examine the common sense or otherwise of sending pensions that are paid for by the taxpayers of Australia to people who live overseas where the spending of the pension money cannot possibly benefit this country? </para>

            <para>- I will have investigated any claims of bribes being made to medical officers relating to applications for invalid pensions. It will be understood that decisions by medical officers are the basis on which invalid pensions are granted. I would require more specific information than has been given in the question that was directed to me today to enable an investigation to be made into this matter. I shall be happy to give information with regard to the number of invalid pensions which are now paid to people who are resident overseas. It should be understood that there is a portability of pension entitlement for people who are eligible for pensions in this country which enables them to take their pensions with them when they leave to live overseas. The matter of portability has had some consideration. It should also be understood that we are in the process of looking at reciprocal arrangements with several countries with regard to the exchange of entitlements for pensions and benefits and we are awaiting the outcome of some discussions that are being held. The portability arrangements have been in existence for a number of years and apply across the range of pensions. It might be appropriate if I were to give a breakdown of the invalid pensions and benefits during the Senate Estimates committee hearings so that the number paid to people living overseas would be on record for all to read. </para>

A senior counsel will be appointed. The Acting Attorney-General is in contact with his opposite number in Victoria and terms of reference will be announced shortly. Both the Commonwealth and the State Government are very concerned that there should have been a collapse of an undertaking which had multi-millions of dollars of funds involved and which concerned the welfare of many thousands of students. It is desirable that an inquiry should elicit the facts. </para>

            <para>-My question, which is also directed to the Minister for Education, follows from the previous question and the answer that has just been given. Will the Minister take into consideration, when announcing such an inquiry, the possibility that AUS Student Travel Service Pty Ltd, given the co-operation of both the Government and the airlines, particularly Qantas Airways Ltd, could trade themselves out of this difficulty? Will he take into consideration the fact that his answer in the terms used to the question just asked could worsen the situation rather than assist it? Will he take into consideration the fact that there may have been some errors in audit and accountancy which may have led to some commercial judgments being made which were incorrect? Will he take into account that it is possible to correct such errors of judgment and such decisions? Will he take carefully into consideration the possibility not only that the students affected can be assisted but also that the agency itself can be assisted? Will he recognise also the tremendous assistance which this agency has given to students in travelling backwards and forwards overseas? </para>

            <para>-Whether or not AUS Student Travel Service Pty Ltd has any future in terms of financial viability is a matter now before the court. Neither I nor the Government wants to comment upon that. As I understand it, this is a matter of the voluntary application of the agency signalling that it has failed in its liquidity and cannot carry on. Having said that, the inquiry, as I understand it, will look into all the circumstances, including the kinds of circumstances that brought about the collapse. Naturally it will look at the question of future viability assuming that the present application has any validity in that regard. The terms, as I understand them, will be wide enough to look at all the valid causes and in particular at the lessons which one could learn for the future in protecting students concerned against any recurrences of such a nature. </para>

I refer to the Aboriginal Loans Commission which has the power to make loans to Aborigines for the purpose, among other purposes, of enabling them to purchase homes.

            <para>- I understand that since 1974 the Aboriginal Loans Commission has been assisting with finance for home ownership and business enterprises for Aboriginals. I understand that for housing loans the Commission has implemented a network of agents around Australia including building societies and banks. These agents provide information on Commission policies and receive and assess loan applications. They disperse the loan moneys and provide monitoring of existing loans. The housing loans commenced in May 1975. Since then approximately 886 loans valued at more than $23m have been approved. Some 33 loans to the value of $1.3m have been provided through a particular society in the Northern Territory. The scheme demonstrates the keenness of Aboriginals to acquire homes through borrowing. </para>

Was the Bill passed in the other place without amendment? Was it introduced into the Senate in October 1975, and did it lapse on the dissolution of the Parliament on 11 November 1975? In the light of the collapse of two major travel agencies in recent days, with resultant financial loss to consumers, why was this important consumer protection legislation not re-introduced by the present Government? </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator asked a series of questions to which the answer, as far as I can gather, having listened carefully, would be: That is correct. Then he asked why the legislation was not brought back in. The reason is that I have been studying it with State departments and State Ministers and with the industry. It was hoped that there would be some capacity for self-regulation in the industry and in the airlines. If we in Australia need a piece of legislation for every human act we have a pretty funny sort of society. When the situation is one in which the airlines are basically selling airline tickets- they run the airlines, the Australian Union of Students does not run the airlines, to the best of my knowledge- and the travel agencies are getting money from people who wish to travel, it would seem to me to be possible for a well run group of industry people to be sure that they got the money from the people and that they got the money for the airline tickets. I tried to see whether the industry could regulate itself. It has become quite clear in the last three months, after talking to industry, to travel agents and to State departments, that it cannot do so. Therefore the legislation will be coming in. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister.

Is the Minister aware that on 17 October 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy, in his written reasons for the decision in the case the Commonwealth v. the State of Queensland, referred to and quoted from a dispatch sent by the Governor-General to the Governor of Queensland concerning a petition to  Her  Majesty the Queen which had requested a reference to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council? Is the Minister aware that an identical dispatch was sent by the Governor-General to the Governor of Tasmania on 30 January 1974? Is the Minister aware that five days earlier the  Clerk  of the Privy Council informed the Solicitors-General <inline font-style="italic">of Queensland and Tasmania</inline> by cable that he was instructed to advise that  Her  Majesty had accepted the advice of her Ministers in the United Kingdom that the petition relating to off-shore mining rights should not be referred to the Judicial Committee? Does the Minister agree that there is an inconsistency between the dispatches sent by the Governor-General to the Governors of Queensland and Tasmania and the advice conveyed by the  Clerk  of the Privy Council to the Solicitors-General of those States? Will the Minister disclose the precise terms of a message from  Her  Majesty the Queen to the Governor-General in January 1974 which indicated the decision not to refer to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council the petition by the Government of Tasmania concerning questions relating to the seabed adjacent to the coast of that State? What was the substance of that message? If the Minister cannot do that, did that message expressly refer to any of the submissions made to  Her  Majesty by her Australian Ministers. If so, which were the submissions? Does the Minister agree that it is in the public interest that all communications relevant to  Her  Majesty&#39;s consideration of the petition be tabled in order that their constitutional implications might be properly evaluated? </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I rise on a point of order. I think this matter has gone too far. On the Minister&#39;s own admission, this matter is before a court. I take it that it is before a court. It is a matter for inquiry. It is a matter for decision which will very much affect the outcome. For that reason I think it is wrong of the Minister to accept questions on this subject and answer them in the way that he is answering them. I think he is prejudicing the inquiry in the manner in which he is answering the question. As it is a matter of legal inquiry, I raise the point of order. </para>

I have been extremely careful to make no judgments, no comments, no innuendos, no reflections at all. All I have said is that the Commonwealth Government and the State Government will set up a joint inquiry and that the terms of reference of that inquiry will be sufficiently wide to embrace how the circumstances occurred and what relationship there is between AUS Travel Service and AUS itself. In nothing that I say is there any breaching of the rule of sub judice at all. </para>

I preface it by reminding the Minister of the internal inquiry into the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation headed by Professor Birch. Has the inquiry finished and a report been made to the Minister or the Government? If so, when did the inquiry finish and when was the report made to the Government, what were the results of the inquiry and when will the Government table the results of the inquiry? If the inquiry is not complete, when is it likely to be completed, and when will Professor Birch report to the Government and the Parliament? Finally, can the Minister give an assurance to the Parliament that the report will not be classified and treated as a secret document? </para>

Certain things need to be said again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> was quite explicit about the course that the Government proposes to take. These bookings are made through a travel agency with airlines, and one would expect the airlines to be capable of supervising the collection of their own cash. Of course, that will need to be examined in detail by those people who look into these things. As to the financial standing of the Australian Union of Students and its election campaigns, I know nothing about that. If I can find anything that throws more light on the matter I shall certainly volunteer to bring it before the Senate. </para>

There is rather a lot to learn about this matter. The Prime Minister recently visited Kuala Lumpur. I should have thought that the discussions were carefully carried out, were conclusive and were useful. Tomorrow I may be able to make a more specific and definite statement about the general status of the Australian clothing, textile and footwear industry and refer to the matters raised by the honourable senator. Information came to my office before question time today about strong action taken in the European Economic Community, particularly by France, in relation to the clothing and textile imports from the Association of South East Asian Nations area. This matter has been heavily flogged around. The figures concerning the access that Australia has been given can be repeated. I did not take seriously some of the speculative comment which was said to come from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lee</inline> Kuan Yew and which was greatly cooked up by members of various Press galleries around the world. I did not take those reports as seriously as some people apparently did. </para>

            <para>-My understanding is that the opening date for the Black Mountain tower has not been determined. I believe that delays continue in the work to complete the tower and that it is unlikely to be opened before early April 1978. The Department of Construction has prepared designs, on behalf of the telecommunication commissions, to the standards detailed in the report to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Public Works. This Committee investigated the tower proposal in 1972. Provision was made for approximately 1 50 cars and four tourist coaches. In addition 24 spaces are to be allocated for service vehicles for the tower. There will be no alterations to the road to the summit apart from some guard rails and signs for the guidance and safety of tourists. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On present predictions, the capacity of the summit will be exceeded on about 20 days in any year. These predictions were prepared from observations of tourists at Parliament House and the Australian War Memorial. On these days, special control will be necessary to limit the duration of the stay of the people on the mountain. To increase the amount of parking does not offer a solution to the additional traffic and visitors. Some visitors may upset the ecological balance of the mountain. Increased road works also would have that effect. Alternatives, including possible arrangements for transfer of tourists by coach, are being considered but a decision is impossible until experience is available and visitor demand is measured. I am assured that both the flow of visitor traffic and the effect on the mountain ecology will be monitored when the tower is opened to the public. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, by referring to a letter that I wrote to the Minister on 3 August regarding Federal funding for the Namoi Women&#39;s Shelter in Adelaide. In the letter I referred to correspondence from the Office of Child Care stating that approval had been given for Federal funding to enable the centre to employ a supervisor and to purchase equipment. A further letter dated 27 June from the Childhood Services Council stated that a mistake had been made and that the Minister had not approved of the funding. I ask: Will the Minister now rectify the confusion by approving the promised Federal funding to enable the Shelter to pay the salary of the qualified child care welfare worker engaged because financial support had been previously promised? </para>

            <para>- Has the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce been directed towards or attracted to the reports in the Press following the Australian Federation of Travel Agents convention in Hobart in late July? Those Press reports praised the Tasmanian hospitality received by the delegates and claimed that the Hobart convention was the greatest ever held. I ask: Does the Minister agree that such a response gives clear support for Tasmania &#39;s claim to be an ideal venue for conventions with the hospitality of its people, its excellent facilities and its interest and variety in scenery and history and other things which are well known to members of Parliament but which are perhaps not so well known overseas? Will the Minister endeavour, through the Australian Tourist Commission, to have some steps taken to give greater promotion to Tasmania as a convention centre for international organisations? </para>

            <para>-I am glad that the honourable senator asked that question and told us about these Press reports because what he said is true. The travel agents were most enthusiastic. The only person who was furious was me. I was supposed to attend the convention but Cabinet met and I could not attend the convention. It is important that the particular quality of Tasmania should be introduced further into the Australian domestic travel scene and also into the overseas travel scene. I have already taken steps to ask the Australian Tourist Commission to do that. I did it when I was in New York at my daughter&#39;s wedding. I think that this matter is important. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> said is true. Honourable senators probably will realise that when an inquiry was being conducted into TasmaniaSenator Rae is concerned about Tasmania but obviously honourable senators opposite are not so concerned- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bede</inline> Callaghan was asked particularly to direct his attention to the tourist potential of Tasmania. He has done that. </para>

        <para class="block">It gives me great pleasure to present this report on the tax on the wine and the grape industries. The Senate referred this matter to the Committee on 3 June 1976 and the Committee has been devoting most of its energies to this inquiry since that time. We approached all the major organisations in the industries, as well as widely advertising the inquiry in all the relevant areas. Consequently, the Committee is confident that it received a broad range of views on the subject. Almost 70 written submissions were made to the Committee and 20 public hearings were held, including several in the wine making and grape growing areas of the country. I would like to place on record now the Committee&#39;s gratitude for the extensive co-operation and assistance which it received during the inquiry. On commencing our investigations it soon became obvious to the Committee that the industries have been going through a most difficult period. In particular, wine makers have been experiencing severe liquidity problems and grape growers are facing the prospect of not being able to sell all their produce. </para>
        <para>There are several reasons for these problems. The high inflation and rapid increase in wages, materials and overheads in recent years have affected these industries as they have all others. Moreover, winemakers have had to make additional tax payments since the repeal of section 3 1a of the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1973. Of course, prior to 1973, section 31a helped winemakers partly finance their stock holdings and provided an excellent hedge against inflation. Sales of wine, in total, have been growing significantly for some time and while the growth rate has slowed, it is still about 5 per cent per annum. But the pattern of wine sales has recently changed dramatically. Red wine has declined in popularity- by about 15 per cent in the last two years- while white wines sales have soared by over 60 per cent in that time. This rapid change in consumer tastes presents the industries with severe adjustment problems, bearing in mind the long lead times involved in planting grapes and maturing wine. </para>
        <para>Red wine stocks, built up on the basis of sales trends a few years ago, are now too large. Moreover, grape growers are producing appreciable quantities of grapes, which, although suitable for requirements when planted, are no longer desirable for winemaking. A switch in consumer tastes away from brandy in favour of Scotch whisky, prompted by the removal of brandy&#39;s excise differential, has created difficulties for Australian brandy makers, and also for winemakers and grape growers, because brandy has been used in the past as a means of storing the produce of high production years. </para>
        <para>In addition to these problems, which have been basically beyond the control of the industries, it must be said that some of their difficulties have been created, or compounded, by the industries themselves. There has perhaps been over investment in some varieties of grapes, and in vineyards generally, based on expectations of consumption growth which were unfounded. Also, the industries have structual problems, such as grape growers who work properties of an uneconomic size, and a lack of co-ordinated planning between growers and winemakers. Furthermore, industry organisations are fragmented, and currently inhibit the development of a united, systematic approach to the industries&#39; problems. The report which I now present recommends several proposals to help solve these problems and I would like to outline the more important of these. </para>
        <para>In the view of the Committee, perhaps the most important need which the industries have is for a stable climate in the immediate future, to compensate for the period of upheaval which they have just undergone and to allow necessary reconstruction and rationalisation of the industries to proceed apace. In order to help achieve this stability the Committee has recommended that the Government give a firm undertaking that no excise or sales tax be imposed on the wine industry before the end of the transition period for the payment of the deferrred tax resulting from the repeal of section 3 1  a.  This period is currently scheduled to end in 1981-82. In order to bring to an end the fragmentation of industry organisations, the Committee has recommended that the Australian Wine Board, the Australian Wine and Brandy Producers Association and the Federal Grape growers&#39; Council of Australia should combine to form a new organisation, which we have titled the Australian Wine and Grape Corporation. This body would be elected by industry members, funded by a levy on grape growers and winemakers and be independent of government. </para>
        <para>One of its most pressing functions would be to develop closer and more businesslike relations between grape growers and winemakers. It would seek to achieve such essential tasks as the rationalisation of new and replacement vine plantings and the determination of minimum prices for grapes which take more account of the economically viable grower and maker and which do not attempt to defy long term market forces. A major problem area within the industries is the South Australian Riverland. The Industries Assistance Commission has already reported on the urgent need for reconstruction of the Riverland and the ways in which this could be done. The Committee in this Report recommends that the proposals of the Industries Assistance Commission be implemented immediately; that no new water rights be issued in the Riverland until reconstruction is complete and that any conflict of interest between State and Federal government over the area be minimised. </para>
        <para>The Committee has also recommended several proposals which we believe will assist the </para>
        <para class="block">Australian brandy industry. These include an increase in the margin between the duty on imported brandy and the excise on Australian brandy which would match the protection enjoyed by Australian whisky; the tightening up of labelling requirements so as to ensure that only spirit completely distilled from fresh grape wine could be described as brandy and a change in the certifying authority for French bulk brandy imports. Perhaps the most significant instigating factor in commencing the inquiry was the disquiet within the industries over the repeal of section 3 1a. The Committee has carefully considered whether this provision should be reenacted and a large part of our report canvasses the whole question of a special tax valuation for wine and brandy stocks. The conclusion which the Committee has reached is that no special stock valuation provision for these products is justified and that the present arrangements for the payment of the deferred tax are equitable. </para>
        <para>The main reason the Committee drew this conclusion was our belief that the main need of the industries is a period of stability, and that the re-enactment of section 31a or a similar provision would act as an undesirable stimulus, which would lessen the chances of necessary rationalisation and reconstruction being undertaken. Moreover, it would be a stimulus in the form of an interest free loan through the taxation system, which the Committee regards as being inequitable on principle. In our view, the industry will be better able to survive in the long term without a concessional stock valuation. The Committee has also concluded that no changes should be made to the Division 7 provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, or to the provisions on co-operatives, and that the trading stock valuation adjustment scheme should be applied to the stock values under the section 31b transitional provisions. </para>
        <para>Needless to say, I have only briefly covered the major aspects of the report in my few remarks today. The report contains further recommendations and a much more detailed discussion of the issues which concern the industries than I have attempted. I would like to conclude by thanking my fellow members of the Committee for their efforts and contributions during the course of the inquiry. I would also like to thank members of the secretariat, some of whom I see here today, for their kindness, consideration and attention to detail during our public and private meetings and with regard to our travel arrangements. I commend the report to the Senate. </para>

          <para>-I enter the debate in order to allow for some future discussion of this report. In doing so I make a criticism. It may have been my error in not understanding properly what was said but I was under the impression that this report was to be presented tomorrow and not today. For that reason no arrangements were made on this side of the House to engage in debate on what is a very important report from one of our committees. There is no doubt that the Committee has investigated an important and developing industry which is coming under considerable pressure from other sources and perhaps not receiving fair consideration in the market place. For that reason I seek leave to continue my remarks in order to allow other senators to enter into the debate at a later stage. </para>

              <para>- Honourable senators will recall that on 4 December 1 976 a fire at the Naval Air Station, Nowra burnt down a hangar, and destroyed or damaged 10 Grumman S2E Tracker aircraft and associated equipment. The board of inquiry was convened by the Flag Officer Commanding East Australia Area under the authority of the Naval Defence Act and was directed to examine the security arrangements and fire prevention measures which existed before the fire, how the fire was fought, action taken to minimise loss after the fire started, and to make recommendations to prevent a recurrence. It was advised that its report should state whether the fire and subsequent damage and destruction were attributable to acts or omissions on the part of any person or persons. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The board&#39;s inquiry was conducted concurrently with an extensive investigation undertaken by the New South Wales Police Force, assisted by Naval Police and the Commonwealth Police Force. The police investigations continued altogether for over 12 weeks. Approximately 2000 people were interviewed. The board of inquiry enjoyed exceptionally close co-operation and integration of effort with the police. The board of inquiry was assisted by a specialist in fire services and security from the Royal Australian Air Force and by experts drawn from a broad spectrum of specialised agencies of Commonwealth, State and local governments. I take this opportunity to record the appreciation of the Government for the valuable assistance provided by all authorities and persons to the board of inquiry. </para>
          <para>The board of inquiry established that the fire in H hangar was caused by deliberate action. Aviation gasoline was drained to the hangar floor from the tanks of at least two aircraft, the sprinkler system shut-off valve was closed and the gasoline was lit. The person solely responsible for these actions was Able Seaman Graham John Trent. The conclusions I have tabled are taken verbatim from the board of inquiry report, except for names of individuals which have been removed in accordance with the practice that documents tabled in the House should not contain the names of individuals who are the subject of criticism. </para>
          <para>The major conclusions of the board of inquiry were that: the material aspects of security of aircraft within the hangar and of the hangar itself were less than adequate; various procedures relating to security of aircraft and hangars at the Naval Air Station were unsatisfactory; certain persons did not carry out their security duties in accordance with orders; various proposals to enhance the security of the Naval Air Station had not been put into effect; the standards of construction of H hangar were below those considered appropriate today for the safe stowage of aircraft; the response to the alarm was good, the fire could not have been extinguished sooner or more closely confined, the actions taken to fight the fire were sound, and many men showed great courage and determination in fighting the fire and removing aircraft to safety. </para>
          <para class="block">As honourable senators will see from the paper I have tabled, the board also drew conclusions on other matters of lesser importance dealing with inadequacies or deficiencies in the administration of security and fire protection at the Station. </para>
          <para>In April this year Able Seaman Trent was tried by court martial on 13 charges of wilfully damaging a hangar and wilfully destroying or damaging a number of aircraft. The court martial found that Trent did the acts charged but was insane at the time when the acts were done so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions. The court martial ordered that Trent be kept in custody until the pleasure of the Governor-General is known. </para>
          <para>Ten officers have been dealt with for their failure to ensure adequate security of the Air Station and its valuable assets, and for not exercising proper supervision of duty security personnel on the night of the fire. The officers have been censured or admonished, including two severely censured at the highest level. Short of trial and conviction by court martial a censure is the most severe action that may be taken against an officer in peacetime. Consideration was given to the trial by court martial of some of the officers concerned for negligence. Before an officer can be convicted by court martial in relation to negligence, it must be established beyond reasonable doubt that his conduct amounts to neglect in the manner charged. If so, it must further be established that the neglect is blameworthy or culpable in the circumstances. After receiving legal advice it was decided not to proceed by court martial. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that a number of officers had fallen short of the standards expected of them to such a degree that censure or admonition was warranted. In addition, charges were laid against 10 sailors in summary proceedings. The offences alleged involved breaches of discipline committed whilst on duty. One sailor was found not guilty. In the other nine cases convictions resulted and fines were imposed. </para>
          <para>Immediate steps were taken to improve the security protection of naval aircraft and the base complex. The following specific actions have been taken: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>Security of aircraft has been considerably improved by employing sentries in hangars, by more effective mobile patrols equipped with two-way radios, by more frequent random checks by senior station officers and duty officers, and by the introduction of guard dog teams. The number of guard dog teams will be increased shortly. </para>

            <item label="(b)">
              <para>The security of the hangars has been upgraded to the extent practicable at this stage; doors can no longer be opened by outside devices, all padlocks have been checked in good order and the barring of external windows will be completed this month. </para>

              <para>Fire prevention and firefighting measures have been improved by a number of steps including the dispersal of aircraft, the locking of sprinkler control rooms, the improved readiness of firefighting equipment and agents, clarification of orders on the carriage of cigarette lighters and matches, and the removal of flammable liquids and combustible material from hangars on completion of work each day. Action also has been taken to improve the training and exercising of personnel in the fighting of all types of fires that might be encountered on the Station, and to improve procedures to contact duty personnel and the local fire brigade. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Some $43,000 have been expended or committed on works to improve security since the fire. In addition, items have been included in the works program for this financial year to provide for improved security to a number of areas in the Station, principally, to extend the facilities for the introduction of two new fire tenders, to improve the perimeter road, to provide a flammable stowage for one hangar, and to improve security and fire protection in a number of other buildings. These items are being progressed as rapidly as practicable. </para>
          <para>Consideration is being given to a number of further measures including provision of additional security fencing, illumination and security alarms for other sensitive areas, illumination of the aircraft hardstanding adjacent to the hangars, and renewal of fighting in some hangars using flame-proof fitments. Action is proceeding for the early installation of intruder alarm systems to the appropriate hangars at the Air Station. A full periodic inspection of the Naval Air Station has recently been completed. Considerable improvement in the Station&#39;s security awareness has been reported. </para>
          <para>There can be no doubt that the fire at the Naval Air Station, Nowra, was a severe blow to our defence capabilities at the time. The Government was able quickly to replace the aircraft. I wish to acknowledge that this action would not have been possible without the prompt and most generous assistance of the United States Government and the United States Navy. In all, the estimated value of the hangar, aircraft and equipment lost amounted to nearly $9m. The cost to replace the aircraft and equipment, which has already been announced, is estimated at nearly $7m. </para>
          <para>It is pertinent to remind honourable senators that the Naval Air Station at Nowra is an extensive and complex facility. Its primary functions are: to provide a base for the operational squadrons for HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> when disembarked, for training squadrons and for Fleet requirements; to provide organisational and intermediate level maintenance and support for naval aircraft; to provide operational training for air crew and to provide ground training for maintenance personnel. </para>
          <para class="block">In addition to normal naval operational and training flying, the Naval Air Station meets demands for search and rescue and aid to the civil community. The Commanding Officer of the Naval Air Station is also responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Jervis Bay airfield and the missile range. In all, he commands nearly 2000 people and at the time of the fire there were 6 1 aircraft at his Station. </para>
          <para>The Naval Air Station and the Jervis Bay target services group have consistently maintained high standards in meeting their flying, maintenance and training commitments. It could be argued that fault lay in the system where physical improvements to security that had been requested were not provided. This view is not shared entirely by the Minister as it was within local authority to make alternative arrangements pending the introduction of improvements. In any case, it will always remain extemely difficult to prevent the irrational action of a person from within one &#39;s own organisation. </para>
          <para>These points do not excuse the unsatisfactory state of security which existed at the Naval Air Station at the time of the fire. The Minister has asked me to say that he does not condone or under-estimate the faults and inadequacies that this inquiry has exposed. In the face of the fire itself, the performance of that Station&#39;s personnel stands very much to their credit. To enter the hangar and to approach the fiercely burning heat of the fire demanded great courage, a courage shown by many that night. A number of young and inexperienced sailors fought the fire to the point of collapse and after revival continued to volunteer themselves for further duty. Others, well aware of the dangers of the operation, hazarded their lives to remove aircraft from the hangar even to the point of re-entering the burning building after being ordered to leave as the roof might further collapse. They should be commended, and I believe that honourable senators would join me in this. As a result of their actions, 16 personnel are being considered for appropriate awards. </para>
          <para>The most significant lesson from this unfortunate affair is that the security of valuable defence assets rests primarily in the hands of the users. Commanding officers must guard their assets as thoroughly as they have been trained to use them. But it is the personal and continual watchfulness of every officer and man that is our foremost defence for the security of our assets. The chiefs of the three Services share these views in this regard whole-heartedly, and immediately following the fire they took steps to improve security awareness and training on the part of all members of the Defence Force. While the conclusions indicated that there was much that could be done to improve security by way of modern protection devices, firefighting equipment and provision of security personnel, all these must be weighed against competing demands for limited defence resources of money and manpower. It is a delicate matter of judgment to determine just what proportion of our resources should be devoted to what might be regarded as an insurance premium. </para>
          <para>The fire at the Naval Air Station, Nowra, has caused the Minister deep concern. That such valuable equipment should have been destroyed in such a manner is deplorable. That security procedures were not properly observed, and in some respects were inadequate, cannot and will not be excused. The Minister acknowledges to the Parliament the clear and ultimate responsibility he holds in this most unhappy sequence of events. The Nowra fire experience has not been dealt with in isolation. Misfortune can be a harsh tutor. The report of the Board has been closely studied. Where appropriate the lessons of the Nowra fire will be sternly followed. I move: </para>

I am given to understand that the Minister for Defence is making a somewhat similar statement in his own name in another place. My colleague the honourable member for Oxley, the Honourable Bill Hayden, as the Labor Party spokesman on defence will be responding in the House of Representatives to what the Minister says there. In that respect I adopt the remarks being made in another place by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I point out to the Senate and to the Leader of the Government in the Senate that, from the facts surrounding this report, some responsibility rests with an organisation for which the Leader of the Government in the Senate is ministerially responsible. I refer to the Commonwealth Fire Board. In the Senate on 6 December of last year, two days after the fire took place, I drew to the Minister&#39;s attention the fact that it is a responsibility of the Fire Board to ascertain whether, on Australian Government owned property or occupied property, personnel and property are protected by effective and efficient means against the occurrence and results of fires. I also pointed out to the Minister that it is the responsibility of the Fire Board to advise on fire protection matters, to carry out inspections and to act as a source of advice in preventing outbreaks of fire. </para>
          <para>In pointing out those things to the Minister, two days after the fire, I went on to ask him whether the advice of the Fire Board had ever been sought by the Royal Australian Navy concerning its base at Nowra. I also sought information as to whether the Fire Board had ever carried out any inspections of the aircraft base at Nowra. I asked whether the Fire Board would be submitting any evidence to the formal inquiry which was being carried out, the report of which the Minister has now tabled in the Senate. Next day the Minister responded to me and mentioned that a search of the records of the Fire Board had not revealed any request from the Royal Australian Navy for advice relating to the naval base at Nowra. The base at Nowra is an important defence establishment. The Minister said in his statement: </para>

          <para class="block">The Minister went on to point out that the Commanding Officer of the station commands in toto nearly 2000 people, that 6 1 aircraft were at the Nowra station at the time of the fire, that the damage done to the hangar and the aircraft and equipment in it at the time of the fire amounted to $9m and that the replacement cost of the aircraft and equipment is estimated to be nearly $7m. In a defence establishment of this size and importance it is amazing that the advice of the Fire Board, which is charged with the responsibility of giving advice on how to protect these establishments, has never been sought by the Department of Defence on what action should be taken in the event of a calamity of this nature. I believe that the Parliament should take cognisance of that fact. </para>
          <para>As I have said, the Minister told me on 7 December that a search of the records of the Fire Board had not revealed any request from the Royal Australian Navy for advice relating to the Royal Australian Naval Base at Nowra. The Minister went on to say that the Board had not carried out any inspections at the Nowra base but had advised the Department of Defence of its willingness to assist the Naval Board of Inquiry which had been established to look into the recent fire. In other words, not only had there been no request by the Department of Defence to the Fire Board to carry out an inspection but also in all the many years of operation of the Fire Board no inspection of that valuable Commonwealth establishment had been made by the Fire Board. I understand that the Board labours under great difficulties in regard to time and lack of staff. I think I read recently that the number of people engaged on inspections totals four. Frankly, I say that that is not good enough. </para>
          <para>In taking note of what the Minister has said on behalf of the Minister for Defence I suggest to him that he and his Department should be presenting this report to the Fire Board and ensuring on behalf of the Australian taxpayers that more and better use is made in future of the knowledge that lies within the purview of the Fire Board regarding the protection of Commonwealth property. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para>

        <para class="block">Mexico, Licenciado Joaquin Gamboa Pascoe. On a recent visit to Mexico I was received most warmly by the  President  of the Senate of that friendly and important country and was presented by him to a group of senators representing several major regions of Mexico- the South, the South East, the North and the Federal District itself. The  President  expressed appreciation for the co-operation existing between the legislatures of Mexico and Australia in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and told me he had spent a most happy and interesting time in Australia when he visited us in April this year for the Spring meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The  President  said, on behalf of the Senate of Mexico, that, despite the great distance which separates our two countries, advances in communications and technology have brought us closer together. He stressed that Mexico and Australia have much in common. We have an important and growing range of mutual interests which should be strengthened and developed. We are both countries enjoying democratic systems and freely elected government, both strong believers in and upholders of human rights, of traditions of freedom and of the maintenance of free institutions. The  President  said he hoped to see closer co-operation between the parliaments of our two countries, which would assist the development of mutual interests and of shared objectives. </para>

            <para>-I think it is fitting that we should commence this session with a perusal of this very important Green Paper entitled &#39;Immigration Policies and Australia&#39;s Population&#39;, because I think that immigration spells job opportunity. The fact that Australia, like a lot of countries, is facing extreme bouts of economic storm makes it essential that a document such as this be adequately analysed. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson,</inline> a former  Chairman  of the Immigration Advisory Council, I know a number of people who participated in its formulation. I hasten to add that in regard to this document, as with any other document, no two people draw the same conclusions. Later in my speech I will refer to certain renovations regarding assessing future intake compared with the present system which the Government is following. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I deal firstly with the document itself. I think the nub of the recommendations is contained at page 6 where 3 options in relation to Australia&#39;s intake are outlined. In general terms, the middle course of a net intake of about 50 000 seems to be the reasonable one. I say that with some caution because people have criticised Australia&#39;s intake. It does not matter whether it was my party or the present Government, we have agreed that our concept of migration is permanent residence. When I look at some of the snooty attitudes of one or two of the relatively rich western European countries that utilise guest workers I believe that system is wide open to exploitation. I suppose that the nearest one could get to guest workers in Australia is in some selected areas where there has been and is gross exploitation of some illegal immigrants by some unscrupulous employers. Sometimes some of the immigrants are relatives of the employers. </para>
          <para>I think there is a much more serious factor that has to be assessed in relation to the three options contained in this Green Paper. I am probably giving far more credit or boost than is deserved, but I refer to a rather obscure Melbourne paper called <inline font-style="italic">News Weekly.</inline> I refer to the edition of 10 August. It referred to the recent conference that our Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> attended with representatives of the Association of South East Asian Nations dealing with trade expansion. I suppose, for want of a better term, the countries could be called the developed and the undeveloped countries. The article was significant to me because when the Prime Minister was attending that conference three of my socialist comrades and I were in Japan. As everybody knows, the Japanese Press has a highly developed system which prints English editions. It was very easy to get the various viewpoints that were expounded. When I read this infamous <inline font-style="italic">News Weekly</inline> statement, which virtually advocated the abdication of the Australian clothing, textile and rubber industries, I wondered how we could guarantee as far as possible full employment if we had that stupid attitude. That article put the general idea that to maintain stable governments in Asia we must considerably dilute our existing tariff policy. </para>
          <para>If we take the middle option of an intake of 50 000 people- you and I know this- the facts of life are that even people who are sponsored by their relatives are sponsored on the basis that there are job opportunities. I know that there could be a number of people over 55 years, the parents, who will not work. It does not matter whether it is a government of my party&#39;s complexion or of the complexion of the party that is in power now, we all know that it is very hard to prophesy our intake or our needs. The fact is that each year there are more industrial techniques. </para>
          <para>I make this comment as I proceed: The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> probably knows of this dismemberment between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and of a case ibr more emphasis on the secondary needs of migrants. I believe that at times there might not be an efficient, effective liaison between the 2 departments. I am not altogether happy with the situation. Every month each senator gets a report from the Minister that gives job criteria and itemises the various State needs. Sometimes there is a grey area. The need might be for a Spanish stonemason in my State, where there is a desire for Spanish architecture, or it might be the Portuguese community justifying a couple of additional bakers. People go into a sort of a flap for a time. The term &#39;baker&#39; or the term &#39;stonemason&#39; might not be in the list of approved nominations, but the employer can prove that if he gets one stonemason in this area he will probably need about six assistants. The Minister and I had a long fight about a couple of these cases. I know my colleagues had similar cases. I feel that the speed with which we can make decisions is not sufficient. I am not suggesting that any government should renege on the ultimate intake number. It often means that when the person gets here the job opportunity has diminished. This is the difficulty we get. This is the reason why I am striking a note of caution about the broad 50 000 intake. </para>
          <para>I notice that a particular chapter in this Green Paper is related to that very vexed question of definition of refugees. I think the definition refers to people who are subject to political duress. In recent years there have been secondary effects. There has been the position in regard to Portuguese nationalists from Timor. There has been an exodus of Portuguese nationalists from certain African countries such as Mozambique and others. With the transference from fascism to democracy, I do not envy the leaders in Portugal. I know that the Government and people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> have endeavoured to assist Timorese refugees. The great difficulty is that Australia, Canada and, to a lesser degree, the United States are the main countries which accept political refugees. As a matter of fact, I can recite the names of about eight nations which have played a noble role. </para>
          <para>I do not know how closely honourable senators have studied recent foreign affairs papers. </para>
          <para>Look at South America. I will not argue about what has happened in Chile or the Argentine, but according to International Labour Organisation reports and the Department of Foreign Affairs other South American countries are living on a powder keg. To document that assertion, I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a two-page document from the Department of Foreign Affairs signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Parkinson.</inline> It deals with problems arising in Peru. We do not take a lot of people from Peru, but I mention it in developing this recurring theme about an endless stream of political migrants. </para>

            <para>I refer to your telephone conversation of 28 July with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr F.</inline> C. Ness, Head of the Canada, Caribbean and Latin America Section of this Department. You asked us for some information about the trade union situation in Peru, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile. I understand that you have access to the reports of the ILO so I am not reproducing here the information they contain. The most recent reports relevant to your enquiry are GB 203/12/23 Colombia, Nicaragua, Argentina, GB 203/12/24 Bolivia, GB 203/12/25 Uruguay, GB 203/12/26 Chile. </para>
            <para>To the report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 27 July, concerning industrial unrest in Peru, we can add that following the strike in the State-owned mining corporation, CENTOMIN, the miners&#39; trade union leader, Victor Cuadros Paredes, was deported to France. Meanwhile, the Federation of Bank Employees, an affiliate of the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers, had demanded the release of some hundreds of labour leaders arrested following the general strike of 1 9 July and called for the re-establishment of full union rights and the repeal of a government decree which authorises firms to dismiss striking workers. </para>
            <para>Concerning the trade union situation in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, the following summary taken from the International Commission of Jurists Review, No. 17, December 1976, may be of interest. </para>
            <para>In Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, either during or after the coup d&#39;etat, each of the governments dissolved the trade union confederations, and in many cases individual unions were also banned and their activities made illegal. A large number of union premises have been occupied by the police and armed forces, illegally closed and their goods and property seized. Many workers have been dismissed from their jobs, arrested and sentenced by military courts for engaging in union activities and exercising rights conferred upon them by the Constitution, the law and the Conventions of the International Labour Office. Those who, in the opinion of the security forces, are a potential threat to the system have been subjected to continuous harassment and persecution both in their public and private lives. </para>
            <para>Those trade unions which are permitted are severely restricted in their activities. The exercise of the normal trade union rights, including the right to meet and discuss their affairs freely and the right to strike or take other industrial action, have been largely prohibited, suspended or restricted. </para>
            <para>These restrictions on the right of association extend generally in all spheres. Even professional associations, welfare organisations and almost all forms of social activity are subject to the supervision and control of the security authorities. &#39; </para>

              <para>- We are in a dilemma over the question of political refugees. Various governments have endeavoured to meet what they have regarded as humanitarian commitments to such diverse countries as Timor, South Vietnam, Chile and Cyprus. Now other countries are in a state of turmoil. Peru is one of them. Ecuador has its problems too, as has Uruguay. The Green Paper on immigration raises the question whether we should maintain a target of 5000 political refugees outside the normal categories of people entering Australia mainly as permanent migrants. This is something to which we have to give a lot of consideration. I know that the Minister would say to me that there have been top level consultations with the World Council of Churches, the Catholic Church and various other subsidiary groups such as the Quakers to try to get a more effective policy. </para>

          <para>With the best intentions in the world, Australians and even members of the ethnic communities sponsor migrants, but the difficulty is that within 18 months or two years the linchpin of a family might find himself in a totally different situation. Originally he may have been working a lot of overtime or employed in a high grade of work, but technical change is inescapable in industry. With such change some of these people might find their income diminished. Often a case has to be made to the Department of Social Security, as the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> would appreciate, to bend things. It is not an enviable job to decide where the cut-off should be. It is difficult to set the arbitrary figures that the armchair critics suggest government should set. We may have to reconsider the method of assessing cases of hardship. I give an example. With all due respect to the people who prepared the Green Paper- I think this view is shared by other honourable senators- I know more about what is happening among low wage earners in the big city of Wollongong. I attend Macedonian functions and see the battlers. I go to the Portuguese community and I find out how a Portuguese woman domestic working in a motel tries to make ends meet. She could have a sick husband. The Macedonian people may have a language difficulty. They are in the lowest grade of work and cannot advance to higher grades, despite the best intentions of the Federated Iron Workers Association of Australia, until the language barriers are overcome. This is the reason I believe we should refine the whole apparatus of consultation. </para>
          <para>I am happy with the timing of this debate. Because of the unfortunate illness of my colleague, the shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Ted Innes, I had the job of submitting an immigration paper to the Australian Labor Party National Conference in Perth. The paper was adopted by the conference. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will probably study all our comments. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the preamble to the ALP platform called &#39;Henceforth Population&#39;. Broadly, for the edification of the Minister, our policy puts more emphasis on a population council. It visualises a greater infusion of members of the ethnic communities and trade unions into what I call a monitoring service of our migrant intake. I seek permission to have the preamble incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to substantiate what I am advancing. </para>

            <para>-I thank the Senate for its indulgence. To me, immigration has always been an issue that crosses party lines. It is an extremely difficult one. I mention now some other problems. The plight of Lebanese refugees has not been helped by turnovers from one government to another. When the upheaval occurred in the Lebanon, Australia and Canada were prepared to take their quota of refugees, but Brazil would not take back Lebanese refugees who had been born in Brazil. The Minister has indicated to me that we are in the big league now and we have a place on the United Nations refugee commission. Some of the critics in other countries do not do enough. It reminds me of the time when John Kennedy assumed the office of the  President  of the United States. He said that when he went to Europe the West Germans told him what was wrong with the rest of the world. He said to them: &#39;You are enjoying an economic boom. How much are you putting in with other countries to uplift the undeveloped countries of Africa? &#39; Australia does a pretty good job overall. While we have a place on the refugee commission we might tell the commission that it might make some other countries, excluding Australia, Canada, New Zealand and possibly the United States, do a little bit more. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I come back to the qualification I apply to the United States. It has two quotas- one for each hemisphere. Australia applies a general criterion to people entering the country. Canada has a points system that has been revised. The United States appears to have two broad quotas. If we applied the quota system to the whole category of migrants, sometimes you might look over your shoulder and pick up some genuine political refugee who has been passed over because you have done something in his country and you say: Look, chum, we have taken X thousand people from your country. There is another pan of the world where there are problems&#39;. I say that because I speak on behalf of the  Hon.  Bernard French of the Rubber Workers Union and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Garland, the General Secretary of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, who have complained to me that there is a feeling among some Latin American citizens here that now that problems have arisen in Latin America the Government will say: &#39;We have problems in Thailand and South Vietnam&#39;. Asians wishing to come here ask whether we are trying to balance one culture against another and Latin American intakes will diminish. I have never become caught up in the undue sentimentality about South Vietnam. I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Pacific Defence Reporter</inline> and an article by Denis Warner, who frankly could have been called a supporter of the former South Vietnam Government. On page 2 1 of the article he talks about the elite, some high government officials, who sent their sons and nephews to colleges and universities in Europe and the United States instead of expecting them to serve in the ARVN. In other words, they shirked their military obligations when Australian and United States troops were serving in Vietnam. It is not my job to open up old sores about whether Australians should have been there or should not have been there. </para>
        <para>Far too often when I pick up the newspaper I have to sympathise with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I did receive one news release stating that two more officers had been sent to Thailand to look at the possibility of taking more South Vietnamese. I say respectfully that if it is good enough at times to have a look at some Eastern European people to see whether they are identified with extreme political groups- I will not mention them specifically because I could include a lot of people- it is good enough to have a look at some of these Vietnamese who perhaps did not fight in the war in their country but who may have been in charge of houses of ill fame or who may have made a lot of money on the black market. I think it is fair to ask some of those people to put something back rather than to skedaddle again. </para>
        <para>It is not a generalisation. I am simply saying that we should apply certain investigating methods to people who wish to become migrants and claim refugee status. I say this with some feeling because I am always concerned with people from the little countries who do not have many people to battle for them. I am dealing with a case at the moment of a citizen from Afghanistan. He was told that he could not stay here because he was not a political refugee. I think that that happened because somebody read that he entered this country on a tourist visa. I have submitted this matter to the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacKellar.</inline> I believe that in cases like this everybody should be vetted. Today I received an answer from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> to my question on notice No. 1081 in which I was arguing for a filtering system to examine the cases of people who have been denied citizenship or who face deportation. I know that at the moment the Government is in a peculiar situation. In his answer- I do not know when it was preparedSenator Withers said: </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">But he does not say when. At the same time I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacKellar</inline> has given one case of a New Zealander to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to look at and I think that the Ombudsman is dealing with the case of a prominent member of the Italian community in Melbourne. I simply say that these matters should be consolidated. I said so at the national conference of my party. I make no reflection on any Minister for Immigration. I know that it is a portfolio in which he is dealing with people. I have been to my ministerial colleagues after midnight and none of us has been as calm as we are now. I imagine that for every case presented to the Minister by a member of Parliament another one goes across the desk and nobody says anything. As a result people are often unwittingly not treated fairly. I do not wish to be misunderstood. I have never said that in no case should a person be denied citizenship. If a person comes here on a tourist visa and is peddling narcotics or engaging in some other such activity he should be dealt with. I am not arguing against that. I am just saying that we are reaching the stage where members of Parliament are becoming very dizzy when they find the Administrative Appeals Tribunal dealing with a naughty New Zealander and the Ombudsman dealing with an Italian who is regarded as being a little bit left wing. I would like things to be more definite. </para>
        <para>As a matter of fact I am dealing with the case at the moment of some people who are in a political limbo. They are British migrants. I hope that the National Country Party will not take objection. They are people who have probably engaged in militant activity in Britain. They have been waiting 12 months to find out whether they can assume Australian citizenship. Speaking as a third generation Australian I know that some people over there felt that it was infra dig when it was suggested that they should take out Australian citizenship. Now they are accepting it and we are impeding some of them. It is good to have this general melting pot. Now we are putting barriers in their way. </para>

            <para>-That is the point. I have been referring to the complexities of immigration. Let me make another pitch. From time to time mention has been made about the lack of interest shown by trade unions in immigration matters. I say respectfully that most times trade unions do identify themselves with migrants. I refer now to migrants from Lebanon and to the capacity of a family to look after somebody whom they brought out from Lebanon. The case I mention is of a migrant sponsored by a member of the Australian Railways Union. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> Maddox, the New South Wales State Secretary of the ARU assures me that this man has 12 years service in the traffic branch of the railways and has continuity of employment. It was suggested to the Minister that some members of his family who live in Beirut, that hotbed of upheaval in the Middle East, should be allowed into the country. When the man was told that he had too many in the family he said: &#39;I will take three out of the six&#39;. The Minister still refused. I ask that this letter from the Minister for Immigration be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> because it is part of my case that trade unions should be consulted more by the Department of Immigration. </para>

            <para>-We are dealing with the whole question of immigration. I hope that after the Government has perused my incorporation it will agree to having a larger population council to survey things. This is an extremely difficult situation. Today, with mothers working, the big percentage of females in the Australian work force is in manual operations. As people know, I am an advocate for massive credit expansions but I know that if we started another Snowy Mountains project we would not need anywhere near the same work force as we needed previously to do the same job. On the other hand, I know that trade unions are criticised at times for objecting to new industrial techniques. The fact is that new industrial techniques usually mean that fewer hands are needed. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I refer now to the Asian countries. In many cases we have allowed Asian graduates from our universities with particular skills to remain here. I suppose that if we did not do so a number of Asian leaders would be very vocal about our selective migrant intake. We will find some governments, in the light of the conference that took place in Malaysia, being ultra critical about our tariff policy. I admit that in the last few years the State governments have belatedly improved migrant facilities but today many boys of seventeen who came here when they were 10 or 11 years of age, whose families came to Australia at a crucial stage in their education, are facing a maths barrier as regards apprenticeships. At that time our education system was not good enough. It is true that in the main most States are improving their facilities. Take the case of a Greek woman who feels she is near her time of delivery and she is taken to the Crown Street Hospital. They say: &#39;Look, dear, come back in three or four hours time&#39;. That does not happen quite so much now because at least there are a lot more nurses coming from non-Anglo-Saxon countries who can give a bit of assistance. I think that it is a terrible state of affairs that such things have occurred. I know of one woman in my street who carried a stillborn baby inside her for 7 days because of her inability to communicate while her husband was working up at Port Hedland. These experiences leave scars on people. I know that the States have belatedly taken up the challenge. It took a long while for all State governments, irrespective of their political complexion, to do some of these things. </para>
        <para>The present immigration policy should be one of steady as it goes. There are secondary problems involved. One could say to me that there has to be rationalisation of work. Let us take the Chrysler Australia Ltd situation. It would not matter what system operated there. Even the Vehicle Builders Union officials said that some workers had to go. If one has to face an audience of mixed nationality and propose that the last on must be the first to go, one is going to find some irritation. That is nothing new. I had to deal with it in the last year in which I was in industry before I entered the political field. It was a difficult problem. The last people on the job were English people and the ones who just saved their skins were from Deutschland. I am sure all honourable senators can imagine the comments made by people as they went out of the gate. They were given work later on but it is not very pleasant being a union delegate or, for that matter, a manager when one has to make those decisions. </para>
        <para>We all wonder what is the solution to this problem. The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations has argued that most people from 25 to 50 years of age will have at least two completely different jobs in their lifetimes. That is a great problem. Are we going to compound that problem with an unlimited migrant intake? I do not think anybody advocates that. I have not been an advocate of zero population growth. Some of the people who advocate zero population growth are in secluded jobs at universities. If one suggested to them that they should go and join the union whose members are employed by the Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board they would collapse on the spot. The Minister knows that I am always adroit at dealing with a situation in which a union member who is employed by the Water and Sewerage Board may have come to Australia illegally. Often I have been able to argue that such a person is making a great contribution to the Australian work force, in essence a priority of work values. However, I shall get away from the Machiavellian type operations at which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> is horrified. The fact of the matter is that Switzerland was going to hoist out all their Algerian people. Then some of the smart Swiss businessmen wondered who was going to do the work. It should not be a question of using these people as industrial cannon fodder. The sons and daughters of the people who carry out menial tasks will be given opportunities in the higher realms of employment besides maximum wages for their arduous work. I repeat that we have a problem of blending migrants into our community. It is very easy to make outbursts about racism. The current issue of <inline font-style="italic">Time</inline> magazine refers to Sweden. An honourable senator oppositehe is not in the chamber now- asked what was wrong with Sweden. From my experience, the Swedish people are reasonable. When we reach a stage where there is unemployment and job competition people tend to look over their shoulders to see who can beat them for the job. </para>
        <para>I believe that we need a much more effective monitoring system of the intake of migrants, coupled with a more effective link between employment relations and actual job placement. I think that is essential. With the introduction of new techniques and new industries, far more substantial incentive payments may have to be made. My colleagues from Western Australia are far more knowledgeable than I am about some of the industrial problems that have confronted people in remote areas in Western Australia. The fact of the matter is that the capitalist system has bred its own problems. It does not matter what State we are in we will still see television advertisements about having a good life and about how everybody should be able to have, for example, Palm Beach establishments. No doubt there are equivalent places in the other States. When a worker in an industry looks at wage relativity, he wonders whether he will be able to purchase such an establishment. Of course, he is in a lot of trouble if he resists any deflationary measures. </para>
        <para>With all due respect to the authors of this publication, I suggest that we have to devise a more effective way of anticipating problems by joint consultation with trade unions and ethnic groups. I should like to give an example of what I am talking about when I refer to small sections of the community. Last Saturday night I was informed about a case of a Greek couple in their forties who operate a small and successful service station at King Street in Newtown. They have worked very hard for 15 years. Both of them have elderly parents in Greece whom they are anxious to visit. They would like their nephew to come to Australia to be part of their business. I know that it will be difficult. I might win this case but I might not. This is a problem with this type of small business. I know of two other cases involving the Greek community where someone pinch hit for businessmen while they went away. When they came back the businesses were in a shambles. I realise that in this sort of a situation the relative concerned has to be taken on trust when he comes into the business. Perhaps there is an argument and then there is another person for whom work has to be found. He becomes another statistic on the unemployment records. </para>
        <para>My thesis may have been boring to some honourable senators. I said earlier that immigration is people. I believe that the Australian Population and Immigration Council should have a broader base on which to operate. The Macedonian community suggested that the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd was harsh when dealing with some of its workers at Wollongong. That has happened on occasions. I know of a case in which 2 Macedonians were involved in a nasty accident. When they reported back to work after three or four weeks the foreman said that they would have to work at the place where the accident occurred. I contrast that with a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Burgess,</inline> one of the big leaguers of BHP, who asked what was wrong with the unions. No one is perfect. BHP is not perfect. If we get a broader organisation we would be able to assess migrant problems much more easily. </para>
        <para>I should now like to refer to refugees. I should Like to see more effective monitoring of the Latin American situation. The Opposition spokesman on immigration and ethnic affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Innes,</inline> the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Hawke, and the two union officials I have mentioned have tried to collate facts. I do not run away from this problem. I have an obligation and so does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> to our brother trade unionists in those countries. There is no doubt about that. I know that I have to present the facts to the Minister for Social Security and to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs if I want to win a case. With all due respect to the genuine compassion that these two Ministers have shown to refugees from Asian countries, I ask them to consider also the constant turmoil which is part of Latin America. If the Government indicated that it is willing to take in 5000 refugees from Latin America, I would consider that to be a reasonable intake. </para>
        <para>Another point with which I should like to deal is social security payments. I think that we have to convince the ethnic groups that they are entitled to some social security payments. They should be made aware of their rights in this regard. I am not referring to the people who live in the big cities. I am referring to those who perhaps go a little further out to obtain employment and who sometimes do not know their rights. This is a very important document. It cannot stand alone. Our economic policy and our trade policy with Asia also have to be examined. I think that it will involve co-operation to the zenith. It does not mean co-operation only with the major groups. At the moment the Italians, Greeks and Yugoslavs form the major ethnic groups. There are articulate people. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has a grievance concerning a person who belongs to one of these ethnic groups he hammers other people. Some of the smaller ethnic groups do not have strong advocates. If we are to expand our immigration policy we should come a little lower down the line and consider Portuguese and Latin American migrants. A program on ethnic radio indicated that the Argentinians were dominating the situation. I think that the smaller groups have to be given an opportunity. In fact, I am almost advocating proportional representation on this body. I have put my point of view to the Senate. I think my message was loud and clear. </para>

            <para>- I should like to congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> for bringing down the Green Paper on Immigration Policies and Australia&#39;s Population. It certainly sets out clearly the main considerations that the Government and the community ought to be taking into account in instigating migration programs and carrying on the migration program that we already have. I think it is a most valuable document and it certainly will contribute to decision-making on the part of the Government. I think that it is important that this document should be brought to the attention of the community as widely as possible by members of Parliament and by others who are interested in the community to ensure that there is proper discussion on the many profound issues which the document raises. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A particular concern that I have- this is the reason that I rose tonight- relates to chapter 7 of the document which is headed &#39;Society and the Migrant&#39;. In particular, I am concerned about the process by which harmony is established between the various groups in our society, including those which emanate from overseas. I suppose that two main strands of thought run through people&#39;s minds in this regard. The first is possibly the concept which we might term as separatism&#39;- that is the method by which ethnic groups in the community tend to grow up somewhat in isolation from the rest of the community. The second is an approach which is more closely identified with the direction of the community as a whole. It seems to me that one of the clearest difficulties we have in this somewhat philosophical area is deciding how and in what way the communities will determine their own relationship to each other. I am thinking of the process by which the German community which arrived in South Australia during the early 1840s and settled in the Barossa Valley maintained its separate identity in a cultural sense right through until very recently in this present century. In fact it has maintained a cultural identity and at the same time it has taken a full part in the total activities of the State of South Australia. It seems to me that that method of harmonising groups within the community has achieved a good deal in the interests of the whole community. We have seen a cultural identity maintained and a spread from that cultural identity through to the rest of the community in such a way as to enrich the whole of the community. I must add of course that my background happens to be German, along with the  President  of the Senate, but of course that is of no real importance in this debate. </para>
          <para>In regard to the process by which I think difficulties are overcome in achieving this degree of harmony between ethnic groups in the community, one has to have a good deal of regard to the real and deep problems that exist for people arriving in a new country. We know of course of the significant language difficulties and we know the difficulty that people have in gaining a full education from a language which they do not know or a language which they know imperfectly. There are the problems which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> and others have raised in the Senate from time to time in regard to the degree in which health care is effectively transmitted from various sources to the new settler in this country, the way in which he uses the legal services which are available to him and the way in which he can best express himself in the courts to obtain justice for himself and his family. These things do present tremendous challenges to us and I am particularly pleased to see that they have been raised in the Green Paper. </para>
          <para>In the matter of education, which I believe is at the core of this difficulty in ensuring harmonious relationships between the various ethnic groups, we have first thought whether we ought to have a system of education in this country which provides a full bilingual education system whereby each person is educated, perhaps firstly in his mother tongue and secondly in English. Then there is the other thought that the emphasis ought to be on a remedial approach to the language difficulties of a new settler by which he may adopt a better appreciation of English by being taught some rudiments of his own language of which he may have only an imperfect knowledge. Taking those two questions into account and having viewed with some interest the developments of education in the migrant area in South Australia I take the point that I believe it is of the greatest importance to the development of harmonious relationships in the community as a whole that we develop an effective remedial approach to language education so as to ensure that people can learn as rapidly as possible the English language to enable them to take their full part in the community. That is not to deny the right of any individual, be he a new settler or an Australian, naturalised or otherwise, to be trained in languages other than English, and indeed I believe that the education system ought to provide that alternative. I believe that it should not be established in such a way as to take away the basic aim of the education system, that is, to achieve a proficiency in the English language. </para>
          <para>There are of course many different ways of looking at the whole question of the way in which migrants are brought into this country. We have noted the success of the last 30 years whereby immigration has greatly assisted the economic development of Australia and also its cultural development. I believe it is important to maintain that multi-cultural approach which in turn contributes to the whole life of the Australian people. It is doubtful whether systems of immigration such as the guest worker concept, which is used in countries like Germany, contribute very greatly and successfully to the development of their particular culture. In fact I believe the concept is that the guest worker would never be naturalised in the country that he adopts and he could come and go virtually as he pleased. I think the main thrust of our policy- or it ought to be- is to ensure that the people who come to these shores do in fact become Australians and do seek to contribute to its culture by becoming full members of the community. Just looking at the concept of guest workers as it applies overseas, I think it is important to recognise that there is probably a degree of what we might call cultural duress on those who are working in other countries while maintaining their links directly with their home country, virtually remitting all their funds to their home country and, indeed, keeping very strong ties with their home country. It is important to recognise the strength of those ties, but in the Australian context it is important, I think, to ensure that people are prepared to take a very profound interest in the Australian way of life and to assist in its development. </para>
          <para>I tum to one or two points which I think may have been misconceptions in the minds of some people and which perhaps have grown up over the years about the ways in which migrants have or have not contributed or may or may not contribute to the community as a whole. I believe there has been some criticism recently of the fact that a degree of money has left this country because migrants have tended to remit money to their home country. In fact I noted from a Press statement from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on 6 August that last year migrants transferred $358m into Australia, which more than offsets the amount of $3 13m which was sent back overseas. So in fact there is no drain on Australia&#39;s resources in that sense emanating from migration. Another one that has been thrown around from time to time- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> was hinting at this today- is the question of whether migration does in fact contribute to unemployment and whether there are difficulties arising within the community because of the many unemployed migrants. I note also from a news release from the Minister dated 6 August 1977 that in fact the percentage of unemployed persons of migrant origin is very similar to the percentage of unemployed in the Australian labour force as a whole. In fact the differences are marginal and tend to be in favour of overseas-born people. </para>

              <para>- I have not had it lately. I wish to make one other point about this matter. It has been bruited around that migrants, generally speaking, are finding it extremely difficult to obtain work upon arrival in Australia because of the current economic climate. I think it has been said that migrants are tending to remain out of work for periods of up to 12 months. I believe this was in an article that appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 5 August. Again, according to the statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on this matter, statistics in fact relate to people who at some time during the preceding 12 months experienced unemployment for as short a period as one week. I believe it is natural that people arriving in this country will find it difficult to find a job in the immediate sense in terms of one week or two weeks but it seems from the statistics that are available that there has been a fall in the period of time that migrants have spent looking for work after their arrival in this country and that, in fact, this trend is continuing despite the present difficult times. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>One other matter that concerns me in relation to ethnic communities is the current activity in some communities by certain politically oriented bodies. I quote as an example the activities of the Federation of Italian Labourers, Emigrants and Families, which has been attracting a deal of public attention. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> referred to it earlier in respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Salemi.</inline> This organisation is doing a great deal of damage within some areas of the Italian communityin South Australia. It appears to be connected directly with the Italian Communist Party and I understand that it has connections with the Australian Communist Party. </para>

These areas are entirely separate from those areas such as the general welfare of members of the Italian migrant community, which which FILEF is supposed to be dealing.

              <para>- I think that followed on from 1975 when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> made a contribution of $10,000. In respect to the operations of ethnic radio, particularly in South Australia, I mention quickly that it is a shame that the recent closing down of radio station 3ZZ completely confused the position with regard to the establishment of the new Ethnic Radio Commission. I am particularly pleased to see that occur- I am referring to the establishment of the new Radio Commission- and hope to take part in weeks to come in discussions with the Government as to how this Commission may be set up. I believe we ought to have a great deal of regard to local communities and their activities, to their wishes as to how these programs ought to be established and the way in which these advisory committees in the various States ought to be established so as to ensure that we have a thoroughly, truly representative community viewpoint being expressed over ethnic radio on behalf of the ethnic communities. That is as true of South Australia as it is of the already established radio stations in the other States. There certainly is a problem in this regard in respect of the smaller cities merely because they have not at this stage become so highly developed as those stations which are already active in Sydney and Melbourne. Radio stations 2EA and 3EA have been operating for some time. Consequently the closure of station 3ZZ, which was an access station as distinct from an ethnic station, really has confused the general impression of the Government&#39;s policy in respect of ethnic radio. Through the establishment of the new Ethnic Radio Commission it is the Government&#39;s intention to proceed with the continued development of ethnic radio, something which I support. </para>

          <para>Finally, with regard to refugees, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> mentioned that the Government ought to be contributing to a greater degree in this area. I refer to a news release by the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> in this regard which indicates that the Government announced recently a contribution of $lm to a special appeal by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to assist refugees in Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. No doubt this contribution will be gratefully received. It is hoped that it will contribute even more to the welfare of these people. I must take up the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> made in regard to children and orphans in the northern part of Thailand who are ready for adoption by Australian families. Some extra attention by the Government is needed to ensure that these matters are properly carried through. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I support the Green Paper. I look forward to broader community discussions on it and hope that I will be able to contribute something to those discussions. </para>

          <motion>
            <para class="block">That the Senate take note of the papers. </para>
          </motion>
          <para>Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1977-78. </para>
          <para>It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the Budget proposals of the Government. </para>
          <para>At the outset tonight I re-affirm the Government&#39;s basic objectives. </para>
          <para>Our first goal is to maintain the underlying trend to lower inflation. </para>
          <para>Our second goal, which is dependent upon the achievement of the first, is to promote moderate and non-inflationary growth in order to create jobs and reduce unemployment. </para>
          <para>This Budget will move Australia further towards achieving those goals and, in so doing, it will build on the foundations laid by last year&#39;s Budget. </para>
          <para>Over the next twelve months the depths of Labor&#39;s recession, and all of the community hardship that went with it, will be put further behind us. </para>
          <para>This Budget is designed to give a lead to the community by addressing itself directly and realistically to our remaining problems. </para>
          <para>One way in which it does so, in a decisive and unprecedented manner, is by lifting the yoke of taxation that has sapped the spirit and initiative of the community over recent years. </para>
          <para>Unlike our predecessors we believe that taxes have taken too much from the community and that people now want greater charge of their own affairs. </para>
          <para>The new tax system which is announced in this Budget has been made possible because of the efficiency and economy that we have brought to management of Government expenditures. </para>
          <para>The way is now open to get Australia on the move. </para>
          <para>This Budget charts a course towards lower taxation, towards conservation of the nation&#39;s great energy resources and towards care for those most in need within the community. </para>
          <para>It maintains the thrust towards economic stability without sacrificing any of the major social reforms of our first Budget such as the family allowance system. </para>
          <para>Australia&#39;s destiny is a shared responsibility, not something that lies in the hands of governments alone. </para>
          <para>Responsibility also lies with business leaders: it is the private sector that employs most of our workers, makes most of the investment decisions and develops the technologies that can underpin increasing living standards. </para>
          <para>Union leadership bears an equal responsibility: it is the trade union leaders who have to consider the unemployment consequences of their demands for higher pay for those presently in jobs. </para>
          <para>All sections of the community must work together to harness our abundant natural and human resources, if we are to restore vigour and purpose to our national development. </para>
          <para>This Budget sets the nation first; it recognises that there must be a fair sharing of the burdens and responsibilities, and a fair sharing of the rewards. </para>
		  <para>THE RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT</para>
      <para>I turn now to the record of achievement last year. </para>
      <para>The Government&#39;s first Budget was a key element in putting the overall economic strategy in place and, therefore, in the improved economic performance of 1 976-77. </para>
      <para>We budgeted for outlays to grow in 1 976-77 at half the rate of 1975-76, and for a Budget deficit nearly one billion dollars lower despite the costs of full personal tax indexation from 1 July 1976 and significant business tax incentives. </para>
      <para>An increase of 10-12 per cent in the broadly defined volume of money, M3, was then foreseen as appropriate over 1976-77. </para>
      <para>A year later, the Government takes some satisfaction from the record. </para>
      <para>Budget outlays, projected to rise by 1 1.3 per cent, were held to only 10.4 per cent, and for the second successive year outlays were contained within the original Budget estimate. </para>
      <para>The deficit, originally put at $2,608m, emerged because of some shortfall in receipts as $2,740m, but nevertheless very much in line with the original estimate. </para>
      <para>M3 increased by 10.6 percent- well within the range projected. </para>
      <para>The anti-inflationary role of external policy was, in the event, less than had been hoped. </para>
      <para>The burden of Labor&#39;s policy failures on the export and import-competing sectors made devaluation inevitable. </para>
      <para>But, because of determined action by the Government, overall policy was not blown off course and the basic strategy was maintained. </para>
      <para>Naturally, the economy is still adjusting to devaluation. </para>
      <para>Indeed, understanding of that adjustment process is essential to any appraisal of where the economy now is and where it is heading. </para>
      <para>The wages area also failed to contribute as much to recovery as it should have done. </para>
      <para>This outcome, beyond the Government&#39;s control, had serious consequences for the speed of recovery and the creation of new jobs. </para>
      <para>The economy has still not fully attained the pre-conditions for sustained growth. </para>
      <para>Solid progress has been made, but furthering it still hinges crucially on the prospects for inflation and income shares. </para>
      <para>On that, the Treasurer said last year: </para>
      <para>Provided there is significantly less than full flow-on of price increases to wages, an improvement of several percentage points in price performance, and a possibly somewhat greater deceleration in money wages, can be had in 1976-77 as a whole. &#39; </para>
      <para>Prices, and to some extent incomes, did largely develop in that way. </para>
      <para>Excluding health and medical services- prices of which have been sharply influenced by changes in health insurance arrangements having nothing to do with inflation as such- the Consumer Price Index rose by 10.2 per cent over the course of 1976-77 compared with 15.4 per cent in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>More broadly-based price indicators rose in 1976-77 by some 4 to 6 percentage points less than in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>Productivity increased by 3.6 per cent in 1976-77; the profit share rose to 14.4 per cent from 13.5 per cent in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>Company profits increased by 23.5 per cent. </para>
      <para>Although the pattern within-year was not as foreseen, activity for the year as a whole was much as foreshadowed. </para>
      <para>Real gross non-farm product rose for the year as a whole, with growth concentrated in the private sector. </para>
      <para>Consumers spent more, and saved less, out of disposable incomes. </para>
      <para>Business investment, although patchy, strengthened in total; plant and equipment spending, in particular, rose by 6 per cent in real terms. </para>
      <para>Dwelling investment rose strongly for the year as a whole despite some slackness- now being taken up- in the later months. </para>
      <para>Exports were also significantly higher for the year as a whole. </para>
      <para>As presently recorded, economic growth was concentrated in the first half of the financial year. </para>
      <para>Among the reasons for that pattern, which are fully discussed in Statement No. 2 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech, was the effect of devaluation- actual and anticipated-on the timing of expenditures. </para>
      <para>The key point now is that the factors depressing demand and production early in 1977 were temporary ones. </para>
      <para>The forward momentum of private activity is now beginning to re-assert itself. </para>
      <para>Inflation over the year as a whole fell much as expected a year ago. </para>
      <para>Wage costs also grew less fast in 1976-77 than in 1975-76, but the slow-down was less than had been hoped. </para>
      <para>That is closely linked with the major disappointment of 1976-77- the continuation of high unemployment. </para>
      <para>This is a matter of grave concern to the Government. </para>
      <para>Unemployment is a human problem- it is not just a question of statistics. </para>
      <para>It is precisely because of the social and family tragedies that go with unemployment that we have pressed, to the fullest extent, for wage and salary restraint in hearings of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
      <para>The grave imbalance between real wages and productivity resulting from the 1974 wage explosion still remains Australia&#39;s major economic problem. </para>
      <para>That problem can only be solved by winding down real wages relative to productivity; while it persists, it makes all talk of quickly reducing unemployment merely hollow rhetoric. </para>
      <para>Statement No. 2 presents some material on the extent of this imbalance. </para>
      <para>In the most recent National Wage Case hearing the Commonwealth has presented related evidence. </para>
      <para>The Commission must be prepared to face, with a greater degree of reality, the employment consequences of its decisions. </para>
      <para>The basic point is this; if unemployment in Australia is to be tackled effectively, the real wage distortion in our economy will have to be corrected. </para>
      <para>High labour costs have been deterring employers from taking on new workers. </para>
      <para>All too often, the sums favour the alternativesreplacing men by machines or switching to foreign suppliers. </para>
      <para>Partly for the former reason there was an appreciable lift in measured productivity in 1976-77. </para>
      <para>A 3Vi per cent increase in product saw only a slight employment increase; and, with a growing labour force, unemployment therefore increased. </para>
      <para>There can be no doubt that, had the wage determination processes permitted real wages to decline in 1976-77, recovery would have been stronger and unemployment less. </para>
      <para>Instead, so far from having declined, as has been repeatedly asserted by our political opponents, real wages were actually higher at June 1977 than a year earlier. </para>
      <para>Those fortunate enough still to have jobs had their real incomes improved, but at the cost of throwing others out of work. </para>
      <para>Those trade union leaders and others clamouring for &#39;full indexation&#39; might reflect on that result of their actions. </para>
      <para>So might our arbitral tribunals. </para>
	  <para>THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC STRATEGY FOR 1977-78</para>
      <para>This Budget is dominated by two fundamentals. </para>
      <para>First, despite the achievements to date, we still have some way to go in restoring the preconditions for lasting economic growth. 1 977-78 must see a further advance. </para>
      <para>Secondly, our policy strategy established last year and since maintained has been the right one. </para>
      <para>That strategy must be held in place. </para>
      <para>Our Budget decisions will give effect to the objective, stated last January, of further reducing the deficit. </para>
      <para>This will permit an expansion in the broadly defined money supply to take place in 1977-78 at a rate a notch or so lower than in the previous year. </para>
      <para>Our Budget decisions will also give effect to our other budgetary objective stated last January-to keep Budget outlays in 1977-78 to <inline font-style="italic">within</inline> zero real growth. </para>
      <para>We have been mindful, however, of the short term dislocations that might have followed any appreciable reduction of real outlays at this time. </para>
      <para>It is a measure of the painstaking preparation undertaken this year that we have been able to shape the Budget firmly within the parameters of our economic strategy, while accommodating the cost of both last year&#39;s and this year&#39;s major tax reductions. </para>
      <para>Fiscal and monetary policies must be fully supported by the other arms of policy. </para>
      <para>Wage restraint is crucial. </para>
      <para>Externally, Australia&#39;s now clearly strengthening trade account provides an encouraging basis for the current role of external policy. </para>
      <para>There is a mutual dependence between the domestic and external arms of policy which should be explicity noted. </para>
      <para>In shaping its fiscal and monetary stance for 1977-78 the Government has had this well in mind. </para>
      <para>Fiscal and monetary laxness such as the benches opposite have urged upon us would undermine our international competitiveness. </para>
      <para>This Budget rejects that pitfall. </para>
      <para>It will thereby contribute to a more positive outlook for the major development projects now under way and in the offing and their associated investment inflows. </para>
      <para>In short, it will help to ensure that the favourable effects of last year&#39;s devaluation, now increasingly appearing, will be preserved and not just frittered away. </para>
      <para>Against that background let me say something about the role of the private sector in our economy. </para>
      <para>It is now up to the private sector to respond to the brighter outlook which is in prospect. </para>
      <para>As we have emphasised, a re-vitalised private sector is essential to increased productivity and more jobs. </para>
      <para>Governments can only do so much; this Government has consistently pursued the course of making way for expansion of the private sector. </para>
      <para>It is now up to the private sector to play its pan in furthering the progress we have made towards establishing, and building upon, the preconditions for economic recovery. </para>
	  <para>OUTLAYS</para>
      <para class="block">I turn now to outlays. </para>
      <para>In 1977-78 total expenditures are estimated at $26,656m, an increase of 10.5 per cent or virtually the same increase as in 1976-77. </para>
      <para>I mention some of the larger provisions in the Budget; details of these and other provisions are set out in Statement No. 3 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech and other accompanying Budget documents and in Ministerial statements. </para>
	  <para>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</para>
      <para>Outlays for social security and welfare purposes are estimated to total about $7250m in 1977-78, an increase of about 13 per cent on last year. </para>
      <para>These outlays now account for 27 cents in every $1 spent from the Budget, or 56 cents in every $ 1 raised in personal income tax. </para>
	  <para>Pensions</para>
        <para>Social services pensions and benefits are adjusted six-monthly in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. </para>
        <para>Accordingly, the standard or single rate of social service pensions and benefits will be increased by $2.20 to $49.30 a week from the first payday in November. </para>
        <para>The combined married rate will rise by $3.70 to $82.20 per week. </para>
        <para>There will be a further increase from the first payday in May 1978 in line with the movement in the Consumer Price Index in the second half of 1977. </para>
        <para>These increases are estimated to cost $ 1 82m in 1 977-78 and $490m in a full year. </para>
		<para>Repatriation Benefits</para>
        <para>Repatriation disability and service pensions also will be increased in November 1977 and May 1978 in line with increases in the Consumer Price Index. </para>
        <para>These increases are estimated to cost $25. 3m in 1977-78 and $6 1.5m in a full year. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to discontinue the Sustenance Allowance and replace it by a Loss of Earnings Allowance, and to modify existing arrangements concerning pensions related to pulmonary tuberculosis. </para>
		<para>Assistance to Handicapped People</para>
        <para>Special assistance for handicapped people in 1977-78 is estimated at $93m, an increase of 33 per cent on last year. </para>
        <para>This is one of the fastest growing programs in the Budget; it demonstrates that, the need for expenditure restraint notwithstanding, this Government is concerned to assist the underprivileged members of our community. </para>
        <para>At present an allowance of $ 1 5 a week is payable for a severely handicapped child. </para>
        <para>We are extending eligibility for similar grants of up to $ 1 5 a week to parents or guardians on low incomes who are experiencing financial hardship in caring for a substantially handicapped child. </para>
		<para>Aged Persons&#39; Accommodation</para>
        <para>An amount of $50m is provided for expenditure on aged persons&#39; homes and hostels in 1 977-78, $7.6m more than last year. </para>
		<para>Children&#39;s Services</para>
        <para>This year we are providing $73m for children&#39;s services, an increase of $6m on last year. </para>
		<para>Unemployment Benefits</para>
        <para>The estimates include $787m for unemployment and sickness benefit payments this year. </para>
        <para>It is the Government&#39;s aim to see that these funds go to the genuinely unemployed. </para>
        <para>It has become evident that the present arrangement of paying two weeks &#39; unemployment benefit in advance is resulting in persons who have secured employment being paid unemployment benefits as well, producing a very substantial overpayment in aggregate. </para>
        <para>After considering the recommendations in the Myers Report, the Government has decided that in future unemployment benefits will be paid fortnightly in arrears. </para>
        <para>As already announced, an overall review of the operations of the Department of Social Security is being carried out with a view to implementing improvements in the Department&#39;s present systems and procedures. </para>
        <para>The Department&#39;s programs now involve expenditures of the order of $6 billion annually and significant savings are expected to result from the review in 1 977-78. </para>
		<para>Assistance to Aboriginals</para>
        <para>Although Aboriginals have access to normal Commonwealth financed services and benefits the Government strongly supports special programs of assistance for Aboriginals. </para>
        <para>In the Budget we are providing $110m for expenditure on non-administrative activities of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. </para>
        <para>Overall expenditure on programs of direct assistance to Aboriginals in 1977-78 is estimated to be about $176m, compared with $161m in 1976- 77. </para>
		<para>EDUCATION</para>
      <para>The Budget provides for Commonwealth expenditure of $2,371m on education in 1977- 78, $211m or 10 per cent more than last year. </para>
      <para>Late last year substantial general increases were announced in student allowances and benefits; these increases were effective from the beginning of 1977. </para>
      <para>Some living and boarding allowances will be further increased from the beginning of 1978. </para>
	  <para>HEALTH</para>
      <para>At $2,8 14m, expenditure on health care in 1977-78 will again pre-empt a large slice of Budget outlays. </para>
      <para>Payments of Medibank benefits in 1977-78 are estimated at $ 1,494m. </para>
      <para>The estimate of $942m in payments to the States under the hospital cost-sharing agreements during 1977-78 reflects an expectation of firm cost containment in public hospitals. </para>
      <para>Under the Community Health Program the Commonwealth is providing substantial financial assistance for some 700 community health projects. </para>
      <para>In 1976-77 $70m was provided under this Program; this year, based on the Commonwealth contributing 50 per cent of capital costs and 75 per cent of recurrent costs, expenditure is estimated to exceed $79m. </para>
      <para>The Commonwealth will be suggesting to the States that, within this increased allocation, a higher priority be given to the funding of women&#39;s refuges. </para>
      <para>As recently announced, new nursing home arrangements will take effect from 1 October. </para>
      <para>Rates of benefit payable by the Commonwealth and the Hospital Funds will be set at higher rates in each State from that date. </para>
      <para>The effect will be that the benefits, when combined with the statutory patient contribution, will cover fees payable in respect of 70 per cent of patients in non-government National Health Act nursing homes compared with 30 per cent at present. </para>
	  <para>DEFENCE</para>
      <para>The Government is determined to improve Australia &#39;s defence capability. </para>
      <para>Total outlays for defence activities in 1977-78 are estimated at $2,343m, and imply an increase of about 1 per cent in real terms. </para>
      <para>In a Budget in which total outlays are estimated to decrease slightly in real terms, this increase is evidence of the continuing high priority which this Government attaches to defence. </para>
      <para>In particular, further progress is to be made towards achieving the important objectives for capital equipment and facilities outlined in the Defence White Paper presented to Parliament by the Minister for Defence last year. </para>
	  <para>OVERSEAS AID</para>
      <para>Expenditure on Australia&#39;s overseas aid programs is estimated to increase by 12 per cent, from$380min 1976-77 to $426m in 1977-78. </para>
	  <para>HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</para>
	  <para>Welfare Housing</para>
        <para>In 1977-78 $390m will be made available to the States for welfare housing, $15m more than last year. </para>
        <para>I shall refer later to the associated question of finance for private housing. </para>
        <para>Some $22m will be provided for the Defence Service Homes Scheme; repayments of earlier loans and proceeds from property sales are estimated at $72.6m, making a total of about $94.6m available for the Scheme in 1 977-78. </para>
        <para>In 1977-78 an application fee of $75 for an initial Defence Service Home loan will be introduced; an application fee of $50 will be charged for an additional loan. </para>
		<para>Housing Allowance Voucher Experiment</para>
        <para>Last year, the Treasurer announced our decision in principle to undertake a housing allowance voucher experiment. </para>
        <para>Field activity to implement the experiment is expected to get under way at the first siteMelbournelate in 1977-78. </para>
        <para>About $ lm is provided for this purpose. </para>
		<para>Growth Centres and Decentralisation</para>
        <para>The Budget provides $15m for decentralisation purposes, including growth centres, in 1977-78, comprising $5m for Albury-Wodonga, $3m for the Bathurst-Orange and Macarthur growth centres, and approximately $6m for a new program of support for general decentralisation initiatives. </para>
		<para>TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION</para>
      <para>Postal and Telecommunications Services The Australian Telecommunications Commission&#39;s capital program, although larger than in 1976-77, will be funded mainly from the Commission&#39;s own internal resources and from local borrowings; drawings from the Budget are estimated at $65m in 1977-78 compared with $2 15m in 1976-77. </para>
      <para>It is expected that the Commissions will be able to hold basic postage and telephone charges in 1977-78, for the second year running. </para>
      <para>Nor is the Government proposing, as is sometimes suggested, to re-introduce broadcasting and TV receiver licences. </para>
      <para>Some more minor licence fees are, however, to be increased: radio-communications licences will be increased, for some classes of users, from $20 a year to $25 a year, effective from 1 October 1977, and the fees payable by some licensees of commercial radio and television stations are also to be increased. </para>
	  <para>Transport</para>
        <para>As already announced, $475m will be provided to the States for road works in 1 977-78. </para>
        <para>Other large expenditures in the transport area include: $55m to meet expected operating losses of the Australian National Railways Commission; a further $33m towards financing the Commission&#39;s capital program, including continued construction of the standard gauge railway between Tarcoola and Alice Springs; $51m in assistance to the States for urban public transport projects, including $5m for new projects- the first since 1974; $8m for land transport planning and research; and $23m for Tasmanian Freight Equalization. </para>
        <para>Light dues levied on shipping to recover the cost of providing coastal navigation aids are to be increased from 35 cents per net registered ton per quarter to 4 1 cents from 1 October 1977. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided not to increase the level of air navigation charges this year. </para>
		<para>ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INDUSTRY</para>
      <para>In recognition of the depressed outlook for the farm sector the Budget continues to provide for a wide range of rural industry support activities. </para>
      <para>Details are set out in Statements attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>
      <para>Here I mention some of the larger provisions: $53m to facilitate rural industries&#39; adjustment to changing circumstances; $3 1 . 4m for wool research and promotion; $ 15.1m for the continuation of the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign; $40m for continuation of the superphosphate subsidy; and $12m for continuation of the nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy at its present level, the proposed review of that level from 1 January 1978 being postponed. </para>
	  <para>Rural Bank</para>
        <para>We have now approved in principle the establishment of a national rural bank, preferably taking the form of a refinance institution. </para>
        <para>We see the new bank complementing existing credit facilities and we intend to hold discussions in the near future with major lending institutions concerning appropriate structural and funding arrangements. </para>
        <para>We shall press forward with these discussions without delay. </para>
		<para>SUPPORT FOR EXPORTS AND RESEARCH</para>
		<para>Export Development Grants</para>
        <para>The Government is concerned to assist all ex  porters, particularly through further reductions in the rate of inflation, thereby improving the international competitiveness of Australian goods and services. </para>
        <para>As well, direct assistance of $30m- an increase of $5.9m- is included in the Budget for export market development grants to encourage firms to seek and develop overseas markets. </para>
        <para>The whole question of financial incentives to exporters has been referred to the Industries Assistance Commission for examination; meanwhile the Government is not proceeding with the legislation foreshadowed in 1976 to reduce benefits and payments under the Scheme. </para>
		<para>Industrial Research and Development Grants</para>
        <para>The Budget provides $14m for payments of industrial research and development grants in 1977-78. </para>
		<para>Coal Research</para>
        <para>To finance increased coal research the Government will levy 5 cents a tonne on coal produced in Australia in the next three years; the levy will have effect from midnight tonight and is estimated to provide $3.4m this year. </para>
		<para>TRAINING PROGRAMS</para>
      <para>The Government acknowledges the seriousness of the present unemployment, especially among young people. </para>
      <para>As well as the personal pressures on those unable to find work, there is also a tragic waste of the nation&#39;s resources. </para>
      <para>For these reasons the Government attaches special importance to its labour market training programs. </para>
      <para>In addition to the general training assistance available the Government is making increased provision this year for programs aimed at enhancing employment prospects for young people. </para>
      <para>These include the recently introduced Community Youth Support Scheme, the Education Program for Unemployed Youth and the Special Youth Employment Training Program, all of which are now proving their worth. </para>
      <para>The Government is broadening this assistance by extending the Special Youth Employment Training Program to young people under 25 years, to take effect immediately. </para>
      <para>All told, the Budget provides $ 102.7m for employment training programs this year, an increase of 33 per cent over last year. </para>
      <para>Even that very large increase will be surpassed if it is necessary to do so: we will not allow the budgetary situation to inhibit our training programs or our capacity to offer training to people who meet the necessary labour market criteria. </para>
      <para>We intend also to approach the States to seek an early Commonwealth-State conference on the need to upgrade work skills in the community and to consider the adequacy and utilisation of existing resources for training. </para>
	  <para>IMMIGRATION PROGRAM</para>
      <para>The Government has decided not to set a specific immigration program for 1977-78 but to determine in-take on the basis of numbers of eligible applicants. </para>
      <para>Assisted passages will be available for some 16 000 people, about the same number as in 1976- 77. </para>
	  <para>CULTURE AND RECREATION</para>
      <para>An amount of $ 137.3 million is to be appropriated for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1977-78. </para>
      <para>As already announced, the Government has decided to establish an independent authority to provide ethnic broadcasting services and, at a l ater date, possibly other specialised services. </para>
      <para>The proposed appropriation for the provision of the ethnic broadcasting service in 1977-78 is $1.9m. </para>
      <para>Spending on Australia Council programs is estimated at $24.4m in 1977-78, an increase of 10 per cent over spending on comparable programs last year. </para>
      <para>Following a review of Commonwealth involvement in sport, we are providing $1m in 1977- 78 for expenditure on national sports development and assistance; we are also establishing a Sports Advisory Council. </para>
	  <para>LEGAL AID</para>
      <para>An amount of $ 19.6m is included in the Budget to maintain legal aid services in 1977-78 at their present levels; an additional $3.8m is being provided for Aboriginal Legal Aid Services. </para>
	  <para>PAYMENTS TO STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES</para>
      <para>Despite the need this year for overall budgetary restraint, the Commonwealth has maintained its policy of relative generosity to State and local governments. </para>
      <para>In line with the offer made by the Prime Minister at the Premiers&#39; Conference in July, provision has been made for the States to receive $4,336.1m under the tax sharing arrangements in respect of 1977-78. </para>
      <para>I note that this is over $90m more than the estimate of what the States would have been entitled to under the tax sharing legislation. </para>
      <para>The generosity of that increase should certainly enable the State governments to frame constructive Budgets which avoid putting up with indirect taxes and charges. </para>
      <para>As part of this offer State tax sharing entitlements in future years are to be determined as a proportion of the preceding year&#39;s personal income tax collections, excluding special surcharges or rebates. </para>
      <para>The precise percentage to be applied in later years has still to be settled but with this change much firmer estimates of tax sharing entitlements for the year ahead will be known when Commonwealth and States&#39; Budgets are being prepared. </para>
      <para>The Commonwealth&#39;s offer represents a net increase of $62 lm, or 16.8 per cent, in States&#39; tax sharing payments in 1 977-78. </para>
      <para>With Loan Council programs and the special grant to Queensland recommended by the Grants Commission, total general purpose payments to the States are estimated to increase by $685.1 million, or 14.0 per cent, in 1977-78. </para>
      <para>Local government authorities&#39; share of personal income tax collections will be $ 165.3m in 1 977-78, 1 8. 1 per cent more than last year. </para>
      <para>Total general purpose and specific purpose payments by the Commonwealth to States and local authorities this year will amount to about $10 billion net. </para>
	  <para>GENERAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES</para>
      <para>The Commonwealth is continuing to exercise firm restraint in general government expenditures. </para>
	  <para>Staff Ceilings</para>
        <para>Since 30 June, 1975 the number of public servants in employment areas covered by staff ceilings has fallen by about 12 500. </para>
        <para>The staff ceilings now set for 30 June 1978 imply a further reduction of over 3000- or about 1 percent-during 1977-78. </para>
		<para>Civil Works</para>
        <para>A total of $375 million is provided in the Budget for expenditure on new and existing civil works projects in 1977-78- leaving aside Darwin, where the rebuilding program is nearing completion, expenditure is estimated to increase by $14 million. </para>
        <para>The Darwin Reconstruction Commission is to be wound up on 3 1 December and the Department of Construction will take over responsibility for outstanding works. </para>
        <para>The National Capital Development Commission will have a cash allocation of about $ 1 97 million for civil works expenditures in Canberra this year, $6m less than last year. </para>
		<para>Territories</para>
        <para>With the move towards self-government in the Northern Territory, a global allocation of $50m has been included in the Budget for expenditure on those functions transferred on 1 January 1977 to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. </para>
        <para>Provision is made in the Budget estimates for increased revenue from Northern Territory charges; the details are to be determined in consultation with the incoming Legislative Assembly. </para>
        <para>Provision is also made in the estimates for increases in rates and charges in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
		<para>MAINTENANCE OF EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT</para>
      <para>In each of the past two years we have succeeded in keeping actual outlays below the original Budget estimates. </para>
      <para>We aim to repeat that performance again in 1977-78. </para>
      <para>In so doing we shall again demonstrate that we meant what we said about restoring fiscal responsibility and restraining the previous runaway growth in government spending. </para>
	  <para>RECEIPTS</para>
      <para>I come now to receipts. </para>
      <para>Our revenue measures embody two principal considerations. </para>
      <para>First, we see an over-riding need to reduce the burden of income tax so as to restore incentive for personal effort. </para>
      <para>Secondly, we have focused upon the pressing need to conserve and develop our crude oil and other energy resources. </para>
      <para>Again, as in 1976-77, there are no proposals in this Budget to increase duties on beer, or on spirits, or on cigarettes and tobacco. </para>
	  <para>Personal Income Tax</para>
        <para>As I said at the outset, this Government is unremitting in its determination to rein back the growth in the public sector for a number of reasons, not the least of which is its fundamental belief that Australians should be able to determine to a greater extent how they spend their incomes. </para>
        <para>The more successful governments are in the exercise of economy in their expenditures, the more scope they have for reducing the burden of taxation on their citizens. </para>
        <para>Our success since taking office in reducing the rate of growth in expenditure by the Government has made it possible for us to reduce the excessive level of personal taxation. </para>
        <para>Our first step towards reform of the personal income tax system was to introduce last year full automatic indexation to prevent effective rates of personal income tax from increasing purely because of inflation. </para>
        <para>We thus accomplished, in our first year of office, a reform that was initially set down for introduction over a three year period. </para>
        <para>As a result of tax indexation the Government has forgone revenues in 1977-78 of about $965m on top of the $990m forgone last year. </para>
        <para>But the inescapable fact is that, irrespective of the positive benefits of tax indexation, present rates of personal income tax are too high. </para>
        <para>The present tax scale is not only inequitable, it is having devastating effects on incentive and on the will to work. </para>
        <para>Given our conviction that decisive measures are required, we now intend to give effect to our own tax philosophy and, once and for all, to repudiate the high tax policies pursued by our political opponents. </para>
        <para>Accordingly, we are introducing a much improved and simplified tax system that will provide very substantial benefits to taxpayers at all income levels. </para>
        <para>The new measures represent the most revolutionary change yet made to Australia&#39;s system of income tax. </para>
        <para>The essence of the new system lies in the establishment of one tax rate as the basic rate of taxation for the vast majority of taxpayers. </para>
        <para>The essential points of the new tax system are: </para>
        <para>The so-called &#39;general concessional rebate&#39;which gave the misleading impression that taxpayers were receiving a benefit which did not in reality exist- will have no further relevance in the new system. </para>
        <para>The tax threshold will be raised to $3,751 (from the rebate equivalent of $3,154) and no individual with an income below that level will pay tax. </para>
        <para>Dependant rebates are, however, being retained, so that the effective tax threshold for a taxpayer with a dependant spouse will be $5,485. </para>
        <para>A standard flat rate of tax of 32 per cent will be established on all taxable incomes over $3,750; this rate becomes the basic tax rate of the system. </para>
        <para>A surcharge of 14 per cent will be imposed on that part of taxable income between $16,000 and $32,000. </para>
        <para>A surcharge of 28 per cent will be imposed on that part of taxable income over $32,000. </para>
        <para>Instead of the present seven-step scale this will establish a three-step scale incorporating effective marginal rates of 32, 46 and 60 per cent. </para>
        <para>Let me briefly summarize some of the main benefits of this new and vastly simplified tax system. </para>
        <para>The most important benefit is that there are tax reductions at all levels of taxable income. </para>
        <para>Furthermore, the biggest proportional gainers are those on lower incomes at the bottom of the tax scale. </para>
        <para>In fact, the incomes of about 225 000 taxpayers, including many pensioners with small private incomes, will be made non-taxable. </para>
        <para>Some 90 per cent of taxpayers will pay tax at no more than the standard marginal rate of 32 percent. </para>
        <para>As a result, the new system goes a long way to restoring the monetary incentive for individuals to work and to work harder, to take on added responsibility, to work overtime, and so on. </para>
        <para>I now give some examples of how this system will affect selected income groups: a taxpayer on a taxable income of $4,000 per annum or $77 per week with no dependant spouse will have his tax liability reduced by $2.86 per week, nearly two-thirds of his present tax liability; a taxpayer on $ 1 0,000 per annum or $ 1 92 per week, about average earnings, will save $2.83 per week, and his marginal rate of tax will be reduced from 35 cents to 32 cents in the dollar; a taxpayer on $ 1 5,000 per annum or $288 per week will save $ 10.46 per week and his marginal rate will drop sharply from 45 cents to 32 cents in the dollar. </para>
        <para>These reductions will be in addition to those already effected from 1 July last through the tax indexation mechanism. </para>
        <para>The new system will apply from 1 February 1978 for both pay-as-you-earn and, notionally, for assessment purposes. </para>
        <para>As from 1 February next, therefore, the total savings in tax from the new scale and the tax indexation mechanism combined will amount, in the three examples I have just quoted, to $4.46 per week, $5.38 per week and $15.38 per week, respectively. </para>
        <para>These examples- which could of course be multiplied- indicate the substantial benefits flowing to all taxpayers from our program of tax reform and tax reduction to date. </para>
        <para>I now briefly touch on some further aspects of the new system. </para>
        <para>The general rebate of $676 previously allowable to all taxpayers regardless of their expenditures on concessional items would have meant in 1977-78, effectively, a rebate of 40 per cent for any such expenditures over $ 1 ,690. </para>
        <para>With a 32 per cent standard rate being introduced, it had been decided that eligible expenditure above the ceiling will attract a rebate at that rate; the resultant revenue saving will be applied to reduce the ceiling from $1,690 to $1,590, thus making such rebates available to more taxpayers. </para>
        <para>Several consequential amendments in respect of such matters as trust income and the threshold of the health insurance levy will be necessary; details are given in Statement No. 4 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>
        <para>PAYE deductions from salaries and wages will be reduced as from 1 February 1 978, based on the new scale. </para>
        <para>The rate scale and other features applicable for the final assessment of tax liabilities on 1977-78 incomes will in practice be a composite, equivalent to seven-twelfths of the present system and five-twelfths of the new one. </para>
        <para>Again, details are spelled out in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para>As basic provisional tax for 1977-78 is assessed on 1976-77 income, 1976-77 rates of tax will be applied in calculation thereof. </para>
        <para>The subtantial benefit of the new scales will add, from early 1978, to the benefits flowing from the latest round of indexation on 1 July 1977. </para>
        <para>These new benefits will begin flowing to taxpayers five months before the next indexation adjustment. </para>
        <para>Full automatic indexation to prevent effective rates of personal income tax from increasing purely because of inflation will be maintained in repect of the new system in future years. </para>
        <para>However, transitional arrangements will apply with respect to the indexation adjustment due on 1 July 1978. </para>
        <para>Dependant rebates, which will have operated unchanged throughout the year, will be indexed at that time by the full factor given by the annual indexation rules. </para>
        <para>The new rate scale, which will have been operating only during the second half of the financial year, will be indexed at that time by half the factor given by the annual indexation rules. </para>
        <para>The cost of the measure on this basis is estimated at $406m in 1977-78 and $973m in 1978-79. </para>
        <para class="block">Incentives for the Arts </para>
        <para>Continuing its active support for the arts and as a way of eliciting greater co-operation from the private sector, the Government will liberalise the conditions under which income tax deductions are allowable for gifts of works of art and comparable property to public art galleries, museums and libraries. </para>
        <para>Details are contained in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para>The cost to revenue is estimated to approach $ 1 m in 1 977-78 and $2.5m in a full year. </para>
		<para>Company Tax</para>
        <para>As I mentioned earlier, there is a clear need this year to finance the essential personal tax reform that has just been announced. </para>
        <para>That has meant, for one thing, the most rigid control of the Commonwealth&#39;s own expenditures. </para>
        <para>Beyond that, however, we have also had to look elsewhere for increased sources of revenue. </para>
        <para>Since coming to office the Government has eased the burden of tax on business income in several ways, notably by the investment allowance and the trading stock valuation adjustment. </para>
        <para>These measures will produce a very substantial saving in the tax payable by corporate business in 1977-78, of the order of $600m at current tax rates. </para>
        <para>As I said early on in this statement there is a need for fair sharing of the burdens. </para>
        <para>Against the background of the very substantial concessions given to companies last year, and of the recent and prospective increases in corporate profitability, it has been decided to increase the rates of company tax to apply in respect of 1976- 77 income. </para>
        <para>The increase will be 3V4 per cent bringing the general rate to 46 per cent. </para>
        <para>The same <inline font-style="italic">VA</inline> per cent increase in rate will also apply to 1977-78 income of superannuation funds which do not observe the 30/20 rule, bringing their rate to 46 per cent. </para>
        <para>This rate increase is estimated to yield $203m in 1 977-78 and $224m in a full year. </para>
        <para>Even so, company tax in total is estimated to increase by only $174m, or 6 per cent, in 1977- 78, compared with $302m, or 12 per cent, in 1976-77. </para>
		<para>Small Business Taxation</para>
        <para>The Government attaches particular importance to the fundamental role of small business in our free enterprise system. </para>
        <para>Because of the benefits this year flowing from last year&#39;s alterations to Division 7 tax, introduction of an investment allowance and a trading stock valuation adjustment, the effective rate of tax for the majority of small firms has been reduced by between 8 and 10 percentage points. </para>
        <para>This year&#39;s changes to personal income tax will be of particular benefit to the owneroperators of small companies and unincorporated enterprises, whose incomes are more subject to fluctuations than those of the majority of taxpayers. </para>
        <para>There are of course many matters which affect small businesses but which are within the province of State governments- pay-roll tax, workers&#39; compensation and the like. </para>
        <para>As I have said, the small business sector will be greatly assisted by the Budget- the Commonwealth hopes that State governments will have similar regard to the special needs of this sector. </para>
		<para>Film Royalties Paid Abroad</para>
        <para>Most film royalties paid from Australia are at present taxed, on an arbitrary basis, as if the foreign recipient&#39;s profit rate were 10 per cent. </para>
        <para>The Government considers that this produces an unreasonably low effective rate of tax. </para>
        <para>Accordingly, the rate of tax to apply in respect of film royalties paid out of Australia after tonight will be 10 per cent of the gross royalties, which represents our standard tax treaty rate. </para>
		<para>Gold-Mining Taxation</para>
        <para>In April 1977 the Industries Assistance Commission submitted a report on the production of gold. </para>
        <para>The Government- has considered the report but has decided, because of continuing difficulties faced by the industry, to maintain the present basis of taxation and not to eliminate the concessions involved at this time. </para>
		<para>Tax Avoidance</para>
        <para>The Government is well aware of the activities in recent years of tax planners who, increasingly, are promoting tax avoidance schemes and arrangements throughout the business and professional community. </para>
        <para>We propose to crack down hard on such practices. </para>
        <para>Many of the arrangements that taxpayers are being induced to enter into are highly artificial and contrived, but they are causing substantial amounts of revenue to be either lost altogether or deferred for considerable periods of time. </para>
        <para>The Government takes a serious view of these developments and proposes, in these Budget sittings, to bring forward amendments to combat these abuses of the provisions of the taxation laws. </para>
		<para>Coal Export Duty</para>
        <para>The Government will make a further reduction this year in the coal export levy. </para>
        <para>The higher rate of duty will be reduced by $1.00 to $3.50 per tonne and the lower rate by 50c to $1.00 per tonne. </para>
        <para>Should State governments seek to take advantage of this to increase their own royalties the Government will have to review its position. </para>
        <para>I re-affirm the Government&#39;s intention to remove the remaining duty next year in accordance with its previous undertaking. </para>
        <para>The present reduction, which will apply immediately, will cost an estimated $24m in 1977-78 and $27m in a full year. </para>
		<para>CRUDE OIL POLICY</para>
      <para>The world price of crude oil has risen dramatically in recent years but only very minor adjustments have been made to the price of crude from Australian wells. </para>
      <para>Australian crude is now very substantially underpriced. </para>
      <para>Without significant new discoveries in the next few years, indigenous crude oil would fall from meeting about 70 per cent of total Australian demand to about 30 per cent by 1985. </para>
      <para>We cannot afford a pricing policy that flies in the face of all energy conservation principles by condoning excessive consumption of our scarce presently known supplies of crude. </para>
      <para>We are moving to produce an appropriate energy pricing structure. </para>
      <para>The National Energy Advisory Committee has the whole question of national energy policy under urgent study and is reporting progressively to the Government on it. </para>
      <para>We also need a pricing policy that encourages new exploration and ensures full economic recovery of known deposits. </para>
      <para>In partial recognition of these truths, the previous Government announced, and we have maintained, a policy applying import parity prices to oil discovered after 14 September 1975. </para>
      <para>But the previous Government did nothing to conserve the usage from existing fields, to increase the extent of recovery from them, or to develop new fields based on discoveries already made. </para>
      <para>An estimated 400 million barrels of oil could be recovered in Australia at import parity prices that would not be recovered at existing prices. </para>
      <para>This would add about 20 per cent, or about two years&#39; present requirements, to the reserves which would be economically recoverable at present prices. </para>
      <para>Following a Government reference in May 1976, the Industries Assistance Commission has made recommendations directed to an orderly transition towards import parity prices for all local oil. </para>
      <para>The Government endorses this objective and has adopted an approach based essentially on the Commission&#39;s recommendations. </para>
      <para>An annually increasing proportion, or six million barrels per annum, whichever is the greater, of crude oil from each field or new development within fields discovered before 14 September 1975, will be sold at import parity prices, with the remainder sold at the present fixed prices for each field. </para>
      <para>For the first year, commencing tonight, the proportion of oil per field to be sold at import parity prices will be 10 per cent of production. </para>
      <para>In the three subsequent years, the corresponding proportions will be 20, 35 and 50 per cent. </para>
      <para>Beyond this, it is the Government&#39;s intention to move to full import parity as soon as possible thereafter; accordingly it will, prior to the end of the period, review the matter. </para>
      <para>The Government believes that not all the additional profits resulting from these decisions should remain with the producers, and that the community should obtain a return from the exploitation of these resources which adequately reflects their value. </para>
      <para>The fact that the recently increased value of crude oil stems essentially from action by a cartel of foreign oil producers makes the community interest in that enhanced value all the more obvious. </para>
      <para>In view of this, the Government has decided to increase the production levy on crude oil from $2 to $3 per barrel. </para>
      <para>The Government is, meanwhile, examining whether the levy should be replaced by a resources tax. </para>
      <para>The levy will not apply to condensate marketed separately from a crude oil stream; such condensate may now be sold at commercially negotiated prices. </para>
      <para>Nor will the levy apply to liquefied petroleum gas from fields not yet in production. </para>
      <para>This will assist the marketing of L.P.G. and condensate from fields already discovered but not yet developed in the North West Shelf and the Cooper Basin. </para>
      <para>Condensate sold comingled in a crude oil stream will continue to be treated as crude oil for pricing and levy purposes. </para>
      <para>The levy on liquefied petroleum gas from currently producing fields will remain at $2 per barrel. </para>
      <para class="block">Duty on Petroleum Products </para>
      <para>In association with its review of energy pricing and conservation policies, the Government has also reviewed the duty on petroleum products and has decided to increase it by one-quarter cent per litre. </para>
      <para>These decisions taken together will result in additional revenues totalling $180m this financial year, and $2 12m in a full year. </para>
      <para>The pricing and duty decisions combined are estimated to result in an ultimate increase in retail petrol prices of about 2Vi cents per litre, or about 1 1 cents per gallon, in 1 977-78; because of the lags involved, these final price effects are likely to come through rather gradually. </para>
      <para>Petrol will remain appreciably cheaper in Australia than in most other comparable countries. </para>
      <para>The Government regrets the need for any action that adds to consumer prices. </para>
      <para>However, it also realises that the steadily diminishing proportion of our crude oil needs which will be supplied from domestic wells means that increased petrol prices are inevitable in any case; the sooner they are effected, the sooner will excessive use be curtailed, presently uneconomic fields be developed and exploration for new fields stepped up. </para>
      <para>A further statement on the new oil pricing and levy arrangements will be made by the Minister for National Resources. </para>
	  <para>BUDGET OVERVIEW</para>
      <para>Total outlays in 1977-78 are estimated to increase by 10.5 per cent to $26,656m. </para>
      <para>Total receipts are estimated to increase by 14.3 per cent to $24,439m </para>
      <para>The overall deficit is therefore estimated at $22 1 7m, a reduction of $523m on 1 976-77. </para>
      <para>After allowance for overseas transactions, the domestic deficit is estimated at $ 1347m in 1 977-78, almost $650m less than in 1 976-77. </para>
	  <para>THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</para>
      <para>The outcome I have just referred to is consistent with our fiscal stance since taking office. </para>
      <para>In 1977-78 fiscal policy will again reinforce the other arms of policy. </para>
      <para>In particular, the further reduction in the Budget deficit will lighten the burden on monetary policy. </para>
      <para>We are thus a step closer to our objectives of sustainably lowering interest rates and beginning to ease the restrictions on bank lending during the course of 1977-78. </para>
      <para>As that can be responsibly achieved, there will be obvious benefits for the economy. </para>
      <para>I can mention tonight one step in that direction. </para>
      <para>The Government has been concerned, in reviewing the overall housing scene, to ensure that availability of finance is not a barrier to steady and sustainable growth in home building activity, including additions and renovations. </para>
      <para>If borrowers are credit worthy, we would not want them to be denied housing finance because of official restraints. </para>
      <para>Accordingly, the Government has advised the Reserve Bank that it wants to see banks and other financial institutions encouraged to increase their lending for private home building, particularly in those States and areas where the capacity of the building industry is underutilised. </para>
      <para>It is of course being left to individual lenders to determine their levels of lending, taking into account their particular balance sheet positions and their assessments of the housing situation in their areas of operations. </para>
      <para>Despite the many hazards in such projections, the present outlook indicates future growth in the broadly defined measure of the volume of money, M3, in the range of 8- 10 per cent over the course of 1977-78. </para>
      <para>That range may change as circumstances unfold. </para>
      <para>It may also be necessary, as in 1976-77, to adjust policy in response to changing circumstances. </para>
      <para>With those qualifications, I indicate the Government&#39;s present expectation that it will be appropriate for monetary growth in 1977-78 to be somewhat less than in 1 976-77. </para>
      <para>This would maintain the Government&#39;s policy of providing adequate funds for sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down steadily on inflation and inflationary expectations. </para>
      <para>The Government believes that these broad monetary expectations will provide the community with a continuing degree of certainty as to the outlook. </para>
      <para>Overall, these fiscal and monetary policy settings provide ground for cautious optimism about the unfolding of economic conditions through 1977-78. </para>
      <para>Again, however, I stress that restoring the Australian economy from its previously shattered state is no simple task. </para>
      <para>The course of inflation during the first half of 1977-78 will be influenced by several transitory factors. </para>
      <para>These will include the continuing lagged effects of last year&#39;s devaluation, some &#39;catch-up&#39; effects from the recent prices &#39;pause&#39; and the direct and indirect effects of the pricing-cum-duty decisions on petroleum products have just been announced. </para>
      <para>But, more importantly, the basic thrust of policy is such as to further reduce the underlying rate of inflation. </para>
      <para>Fundamentally, of course, inflation- and unemployment- in 1977-78 will be heavily influenced by the extent of wage indexation applying. </para>
      <para>If we assume, for example, that future National Wage Case decisions embody a broadly similar degree of partial indexation as in 1976-77, by mid- 1978 a wide range of price indicators would be registering quarterly rates of increase of the order of 2-2&#189; per cent. </para>
      <para>Unless the degree of wage indexation is reduced, it will mean wage rate increases of around 10 per cent for 1977-78 as a whole. </para>
      <para>Such an outcome would contribute little to reducing the real wage/productivity distortion. </para>
      <para>If the Commission does make a contribution to this problem by lower awards, the outlook for jobs- and unemployment- will be strengthened. </para>
      <para>We shall, of course, continue to urge the bench to do so- stressing in that regard the relevance of the tax relief we are providing. </para>
      <para>As noted earlier, the underlying forward momentum of demand and activity has begun to reassert itself in recent months. </para>
      <para>That process will gather pace over the course of 1977-78. </para>
      <para>Product growth will induce some short-term gains in measured productivity and some further improvement in profitability and profit levels. </para>
      <para>Growth of final domestic demand will again be concentrated in the private sector, with the cuts in personal income tax and some further decline in the personal saving ratio underpinning moderate growth in consumption while the business fixed investment growth already in train strengthens and broadens. </para>
      <para>As the trade account continues to switch around, it will contribute significantly to the growth of domestic product over the course of the year. </para>
      <para>It will also contribute to an improving balance of payments position, although the usual seasonal influences will work in the other direction for the next few months. </para>
      <para>With policy bearing down on inflation and business investment picking up, strengthening private capital inflows and the recently announced resumption of long-term official borrowing overseas should reinforce the capital account also as the year progresses. </para>
      <para>Gross non-farm product should increase by over 4 per cent between the June quarters of 1977 and 1978. </para>
      <para>This compares with a corresponding increase of 1 per cent between the June quarter 1976 and the June quarter 1 977. </para>
      <para>Due to the within-year patterns- particularly the strong first half and weak second half of 1 976- 77- growth of that order in non-farm product over the course of 1977-78 would entail growth for 1977-78 as a whole of about 2 per cent. </para>
      <para>Although seasonal conditions are largely unpredictable, at this stage they seem unlikely to support more than a marginal increase in the volume of farm production; if so, real farm incomes would be likely to fall somewhat. </para>
      <para>Such an overall picture for activity would be consistent with strengthening, though still modest, employment growth during the course of 1977- 78. </para>
      <para>This should broadly take up the growth in the work-force but perhaps not much more than that. </para>
      <para>Such an outcome would reflect, of course, the continuing serious real wage distortion and the characteristics of the wage determination process. </para>
      <para>Our policies will continue to erode that distortion and open the way to increased job opportunities and lower unemployment. </para>
      <para>That desirable outcome would be attainable more quickly were there to be greater moderation on the part of those demanding wage increases and on the part of those awarding them. </para>
	  <para>CONCLUSION</para>
      <para>This Budget has been carefully designed. </para>
      <para>It will be maintaining maximum pressure on inflation in the first half of the financial year. </para>
      <para>In the second half of the financial year, as the results of these policies bear their fruits, the Budget will add a stimulus to activity through the large increase in disposable incomes flowing from tax reductions associated with changes to the personal income tax system. </para>
      <para>The Government, therefore, looks to a further slowdown in inflation in the second half of 1977-78, accompanied by a continuing pick-up in activity. </para>
      <para>In short, this Budget assures further solid progress towards the Government&#39;s economic and social objectives. </para>
      <para>The new reform of the personal income tax is of particular benefit, both economic and social. </para>
      <para>Economically, the Budget builds upon the foundations of the past eighteen months. 1976-77 was not an easy year, and 1977-78- in the very nature of the problems we confront- will not see any dramatic breakthrough to rapid economic recovery. </para>
      <para>But the Budget provides solid grounds for looking to further gains in reducing the underlying rate of inflation and inflationary expectations in the year ahead. </para>
      <para>That will, in turn, be reflected in rising levels of activity and growing job opportunities extending through into 1978-79 and beyond. </para>

              <para>1 ) In accordance with recommendations of the Textiles Authority in its report of 18 June 1976, imports of made up curtains are no longer subject to tariff quota arrangements. Imports of knitted and crocheted net fabrics which are used in the production of curtains also are not now subject to these arrangements in accordance with recommendations made by the Authority in the same report. In accordance with recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in its interim report of 30 November 1976, on certain manmade fibres, yarns and fabrics the Government decided that tariff quotas would continue to apply to imports of a range of textile items, including woven and knitted man-made fibre fabrics of the kind used in the production of curtains, for the twelve months commencing 1 March 1977. Subsequently the Government decided that the validity period of tariff quotas allocated for the quota year commencing 1 March 1977 would be extended for a further period of six months. An interim report of the Industries Assistance Commission concerning the supplementary levels of quota to apply during the additional six months period is currently under consideration. </para>

            <para>The Government has recently established a National Aboriginal Education Committee, comprised entirely of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, to provide it with informed advice on the educational needs of the Aboriginal people including the outstations. </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth Government has direct responsibility for education in the outstations only in the Northern Territory. The approach for a number of years has been to consult very closely with Aboriginal outstation groups about their educational requirements and how these should be met. </para>
            <para>I am aware that in the majority of cases the outstations prefer schooling to be provided by Aboriginal teaching assistants, supported by visiting teachers from the settlement schools. The Government has taken action to overcome these problems by increasing the training of Aboriginal teachers and teaching assistants and by increasing the number of non-Aboriginal teachers qualified to assume the role of &#39;visiting teacher&#39; to remote schools. </para>
            <para>The Government makes every effort to provide education for Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, however remote. Difficulties and delays are sometimes encountered in the recruitment of teachers, with the necessary skills and empathy, to move to the remote areas. </para>
            <para>I understand that the State Government in Western Australia is also actively concerned with these matters particularly in the area mentioned in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Edwards&#39;</inline> article. I am advised that two mobile visiting teachers are provided to service the settlements in this district in a similar way to the Northern Territory. The Western Australian Education Department has established a curriculum development program for outstation situations and elements of this program are currently being mailed at Blackstone. </para>

            <para>The figures that are available for collections in each State of excise on petroleum products do not necessarily reflect actual tax payments in that State. The reason for this is that the figures relate to oil company marketing areas which can overlap State borders- the Queensland marketing area, for example, includes parts of northern New South Wales. For 1975- 76 gross excise collected on &#39;other gasoline&#39; (motor spirit) and diesel fuel in Queensland (as defined) totalled $92.6m. No comparable estimates are yet available for 1976- 77 and 1977-78. </para>

              <para>1) (a) (b) and (c) Pritchard Steam Power Pty Ltd made an application to the Commonwealth Government in early 1 975 for assistance against a program of development as laid down by them. As a result of that application the Commonwealth Government agreed to manufacture, at no charge to the company, three &#39;quick change&#39; power units to detailed manufacturing drawings supplied by the company. The company encountered some difficulty in meeting its own agreed program of work, thus delaying the manufacture of the engines at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, and setting back the overall development program of the Pritchard steam engine. Nevertheless, manufacture of the engines is nownearing completion. A subsequent request for financial support to enable the engines to be tested has resulted in a decision by the Commonwealth Government (announced on 1 July last) to collaborate with the Victorian Government to provide aid for the project, subject to certain conditions about the work yet to be negotiated. </para>

            <para>On 29 April 1977, it was announced that the Government had reviewed the range and effectiveness of assistance measures being accorded the textiles, apparel and footwear industries. This review had been conducted against the background of a continued contraction over preceding months in employment levels in these industries. In view of the market situation prevailing at that time and the prospective market situation for the products of these industries, it was considered that import quota levels applying to many of these products appeared to be too high. </para>
            <para>Accordingly the Government decided to extend the validity period of relevant quota allocations for an additional period of six months and to seek advice from the IAC on the supplementary levels of quota to apply during the additional six months period. I understand the report to which the honourable senator refers was submitted in evidence to the Industries Assistance Commission during its subsequent review of the tariff quota levels for textiles, clothing and footwear items. An Interim Report by the I.A.C. on these matters has been received and is currently under consideration. </para>

          <para>In doing so, the Government had endorsed the continuing need for the independent Australian external broadcasting station. The immediate plans provide for limited improvements to the Radio Australia station at Shepparton in Victoria. The Government also authorised the preparation by my Department, of a detailed program for further improvements to the Shepparton station and the investigation of the facility of establishing a permanent station in Western Australia. At the same time, however, Departmental officers would examine whether restored transmission facilities required to be established in Northern Australia should again be located at Cox Peninsula near Darwin. This examination will be undertaken over the next few weeks after which I expect to receive detailed construction plans for approval. </para>

            <para>I am aware that an agreement has been reached between the South African Coal Oil and Gas Corporation (SASOL) and a Japanese consortium (KOMINIC) comprising Kobe Steel Ltd, Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd and NisshoIwai Co. Ltd to investigate the application of SASOL &#39;s technology for the production in Australia of solvent refined coal from Victorian brown coal. KOMINIC development proposals have been presented to the Victorian Government and provide for a commercial operation commencing in 1983 to produce 1.2 million tonnes per annum of solvent refined coal. It is envisaged that solvent refined coal will be a valuable additive to coal blends used to produce metallurgical coke. </para>

These documents fell into the hands of the United States at the end of World War II. These facts will be fed into the United States federally operated computer at Oakridge Energy Centre and the resultant information is to be made available to all interested parties. In view of the world wide energy crisis, does the Minister intend to take advantage of this service and circulate the information to our Australian scientists who are currently working on similar schemes to convert coal into oil economically. </para>

            <para>-On 2 June 1977(Hansard, page 1847) <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister a question, without notice, concerning flexible working hours in the Commonwealth Public Service. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters has provided the following information for answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The Public Service Board has advised that an evaluation of flexible working hours experiments within the Australian Public Service was completed in September 1976 and produced the following general findings: in general, trials of flexible working hours had been successful and the benefits to both staff and management outweighed the disadvantages; efficiency had not been reduced by the introduction of flexible working hours; flexible working hours offered scope for a better match of working time to workload and for service to the public over a longer span of hours; and staff morale and job satisfaction had increased. </para>
            <para>A majority of departments expressed the view that the benefits of flexible working hours outweighed the disadvantages. The trials appeared to be having no significant overall effect on total hours worked, quality of service or productivity, and in some instances, cost savings were reported through, for example, greater use of capital equipment, decreases in non-certificate sick leave and a decline in overtime hours worked. </para>
            <para>Despite these generally favourable conclusions, changes in patterns of working times have been shown to result in some problems, particularly for supervisors, and comments from a number of departments emphasised that operation of flexible hours schemes requires careful and continuing attention by management to ensure that proper controls are maintained. It is of course management&#39; s responsibility to ensure that schemes are appropriately related to departmental operational needs and that standards of service are maintained. The Public Service Board will continue to oversight the operation of flexible working hours to ensure that those requirements are met and to minimise difficulties which may arise. </para>
            <para>I would repeat the suggestion made by the Minister representing the Prime Minister when he responded to the honourable senator on 2 June, that if he has any specific examples of departments or places where delays have been caused because a system of flexible working hours is in operation he should provide details so that a full investigation can be made. </para>

            <para>Consideration has already been given to this question. A decision in each case will hinge on whether prosecution action is to be undertaken against the particular person concerned. It is presently intended that any such legal action which has already been initiated in respect of offences which occurred prior to the announcement, which was made on 2 June 1977, will be allowed to proceed in the normal way. Seized equipment is usually presented as evidence in such cases and its forfeiture to the Crown follows as an inevitable consequence where the charge is proven. Conversely radio sets will be returned to owners in any cases where the charges are not proven or where it is decided that the prosecution should not proceed. </para>

I also understand that the State Government is looking at the overall relationships that exist between organisations providing health services in remote areas of Queensland.

              <para>My Department has recently completed a detailed analysis of the 1976 matriculation results, examining and comparing factors such as students&#39; age, the stability of enrolments in individual schools, and the students&#39; performance in the Australian scholastic aptitude test. The most significant findings of the analysis were, firstly, that there was a significant drop in the average age of the 1 976 students compared to those of 1975. This point is to be examined further. Secondly, it was found that there had been a marked instability of enrolments in 1976, when only 33 per cent of matriculation candidates did not change schools during the year, compared to 5 1 per cent who were in this category in 1975. Other factors considered to be significant- although these are not quantifiable- were related to the effects of Cyclone Tracy. For example, the rebuilding of Darwin (as far as housing is concerned) did not get fully under way until 1 976, which meant that many students in that year suffered a double disruption in their home conditions- both in living in temporary accommodation (as in 1975) and in having parents involved in rebuilding homes. It will be appreciated that home study under those conditions would be extremely difficult. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Restructuring of the Public Service to reflect the programs and priorities of the present Government has been a continuing process. This has involved a complete review of some departments and of areas of others, the transfer of some functions between departments, and the creation of new departments. Departments also may withdraw vacant positions to a central reserve for later re-use within overall staff ceiling restraints. Thus at any time departments may have varying numbers of vacant positions &#39;in reserve&#39;. </para>
            <para>For these reasons, it is not possible to provide figures for individual departments on a comparable, and therefore meaningful, basis from available material. </para>
            <para>However from 1.7.76 to 31.5.77 there has been a total net abolition of 1 896 positions made up as follows: </para>
            <para>As a result of this process a number of redundant staff have been identified. These have been placed, or are being placed, in alternative employment, except for some locallyengaged overseas staff where, following the closing of some posts and a review of staffing at others, it was not practicable to offer alternative employment. </para>
            <para>The information sought in respect of positions made redundant in statutory bodies is not centrally recorded. </para>
            <para>Arrangements have been made for the Public Service Board to adopt a positive role in co-ordinating the placement of non-Public Service Act staff who become redundant. To date, those authorities which have surplus staff have for the most part been able to redeploy them within other areas of their own organisation. The Board is, however, assisting with the redeployment of 74 staff of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission and a total of 7 surplus staff from other authorities. </para>

            <para>I am not aware of any suggestions having been made that part of the Medibank levy reimbursements to the State of Queensland be allocated to the Australian Inland Medical Service&#39;. Medibank levy proceeds are paid into Consolidated Revenue and reimbursements of levy as such are not made to States. Payments from Consolidated Revenue are made to States under the hospital cost sharing agreements for services given at recognised (public) hospitals. Therefore, should a suggestion be received as outlined by the honourable senator it would be an impractical proposition. </para>

            <para>The relevant legislation in the Australian Capital Territory is the Objectionable Publications Ordinance. Production, distribution or sale within the Australian Capital Territory of pornographic material involving children is an offence under that Ordinance.

            <para>Following the announcements in the White Paper on Australian Defence in November 1976 (Chapter 4, paras 88 and 91, page 24) Requests for Proposals were forwarded to eleven manufacturers in the United States of America and Europe inviting proposals for the provision of a new tactical fighter aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force. The Requests for Proposals sought a wide range of detailed information about the aircraft proposed. </para>
            <para>Responses were initially required by 17 January 1977 but the closing date was later deferred at the request of a number of manufacturers to 1 February 1977. </para>
            <para>The detailed investigations mentioned in the Defence White Paper are proceeding but they have been affected by a number of factors including the late submission of proposals by the United States companies, due to a U.S. legislative requirement that such proposals be submitted through the U.S. Department of Defense, and the lack of detailed information provided by some of the prospective suppliers. </para>
            <para>As this is a most important decision for the Government very careful consideration and planning is required. Until all of the information necessary for such consideration is available and has been examined by the Government, no decision on generic type or further evaluation can be made. This need for careful consideration and planning was reflected in the Request for Proposal, where it was clearly stated that there was no approved timing for the project, and that it would be developed through a flexible strategy. The companies were given broad guidance of project development and planning but it was pointed out that this guidance was subject to constant review in the light of new developments, including company responses-it was emphasised that the milestones could change. </para>
            <para>The Government will proceed with project development with all the responsible expedition and care that this extremely difficult decision demands. To proceed with undue haste in the face of real uncertainties would be foolish and, although there may be some annoyance over the delay, a demonstration of prudent and analytical management is not likely to provoke public criticism. </para>

              <para>1 ) The Australian Tourist Commission recognises Canberra as one of Australia&#39;s chief attractions for overseas visitors.

              <para>The Commission&#39;s marketing strategy varies according to conditions in each of its markets, but basically it works with all facets of the travel industry by educating them on Australia&#39;s travel attractions, and by using advertising, publicity and promotions to reach potential travellers. Because of Canberra&#39;s prominence in the Australian travel scene, it is always included in these approaches. </para>

              <para>In terms of material, the Commission uses films, audiovisual presentations, photographs, posters, display material, travel manuals and guides and a range of promotional and informational literature.

          <para>Promotions take many forms, depending on the circumstances in the market. A recent example was the Australian travel trade mission to North America, on which there was a representative of the Canberra travel trade. </para>
          <para>Promotions are continuous, either educational to the travel trade or motivational to potential travellers. These days they are usually aimed at selling particular tours or a range of tours. </para>
          <para>The Commission&#39;s destinational and convention films, which feature Canberra, are distributed to selected travel audiences throughout the markets. In the United States alone, more than 200 000 potential travellers see these films each year. </para>
          <para>The Commission&#39;s travel counsellors are familiar with Canberra&#39;s importance in the national life and with its attractions for overseas visitors. Many of the 100 000 inquiries they answer each year are concerned with visits to the Capital. </para>
