            <para class="block">To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: </para>
            <para>We, the undersigned, express our concern at reported plans to alter or delete certain provisions of the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act, 1973. These provisions embody many of the principles of International Labour Organisation conventions on maternal and child protection, notably numbers 3, 102, and 103, conventions which Australia has, regrettably, not ratified. They represent, thus, enlightened and considered thought on the importance of the early weeks and months in the parentchid relationship, with particular reference to the role of the father and the importance of natural feeding as long as possible. The beneficial effects, both physical and psychological, to mother and infant of natural feeding, have been convincingly established, and the present provisions for paternity leave recognise the positive good a father&#39;s assistance and participation at this stage in his child &#39;s development can do. </para>
            <para>We are also concerned for the health of any mother whose confinement takes place six weeks or less before her return to work after twelve weeks of maternity leave; such a mother is, we consider, medically unfit to rejoin the work force, and should therefore be considered eligible for such sick leave as she has accumulated. </para>
            <para>At the same time, the right of the mother to rejoin the work force after such reasonable time as she thinks the health and welfare of her child and herself require, and the wish of the supporting parent who is ready to work rather than receive social security benefits, must be safeguarded. Your petitioners ask that the Senate take action to preserve the rights of parents and children. </para>

            <para>-My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, is in respect of the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech which was read in the Senate last night by the Minister. Can the Minister say whether the principle of full indexation as applied from 1 July 1976 will be continued throughout this financial year, including the new tax system? In asking that question, I refer the Minister to pages 19 and 20 of the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>

            <para>-When I read the Budget Speech last night- it was greeted with great enthusiasm by honourable senators on this side of the chamber but with stunned silence by honourable senators opposite- I realised that it was a quite complex document. I found it to be more complex than budget speeches presented in previous years. In a number of areas, I thought, it needed greater debate and understanding. I concluded last night that I would be very careful in answering questions which asked for precise details. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the Dow chemical company proposal to establish a petro-chemical works at Redcliff in South Australia. Is it a fact that the Dow company is prepared to go ahead with the project provided that a $245m loan can be arranged with South Australia for the infrastructure associated with the plant? Is the Minister able to say whether the South Australian Government has made an approach to the Federal Government for loan funds for this purpose? As the project would provide job opportunities for more than 3000 people during the 4-year construction period and would provide a stable operating work force of more than 700 when the plant was established, can the Minister say whether a decision has been made on this important matter? If not, when will the Government be in a position to consider it? </para>

            <para>- If any honourable senator approaches me before question time seeking information such as this, I will try to get details for him. That applies to honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> said that he wanted to know something about this matter. I have some information which I will read to the Senate. The South Australian Government has requested certain Commonwealth assistance for the establishment by Dow of a petro-chemical complex at Redcliff. The request does not involve a loan to Dow Chemicals but Commonwealth support in the Loan Council for a special addition to South Australia&#39;s semi-government borrowing program to finance State provided infrastructure related to the project. This request is presently being considered by the Commonwealth against the background of the major review of infrastructure financing being carried out by the Commonwealth and the States. In addition to funds for infrastructure the Premier indicated that for the project to proceed removal of the $2 per barrel excise on liquid petroleum gas condensate would also be required. Last night&#39;s Budget Speech announced, of course, that this duty will not be applied to condensate from fields already discovered but not yet developed in the Cooper Basin. </para>

            <para>-My question to the Minister representing the Treasurer follows one asked earlier by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. Is the Senate to understand that the very Minister who came into this chamber last night and read the Budget Speech of the Treasurer is telling this Senate that he is now not able to tell us about such a fundamental aspect of the Government&#39;s policy as full indexation? In view of the Minister&#39;s half reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland in which the Minister talked about preparing himself for questions on the Budget Speech- as the representative of the Treasurer he ought to be able to answer questions, especially fundamental ones- I remind him of what appears on page 20 of that Speech which he himself read. It says: </para>

              <para>- I imagine, although it has not been stated to me, that what the Leader of the Opposition is referring to is one of the statements attached to the Budget Speech. They are of course never read out. I have not even read them myself yet. This demonstrates one very very clear thing- the need for me to be quite certain that any interpretations by the Opposition are accurately rendered by me and that information is obtained from the Treasurer. </para>

            <para>- I ask of the Minister representing the Treasurer a question which does not relate to the Budget. I preface my question by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that in many overseas countries it is possible to direct dial around the world from public telephones. No doubt such a facility would at least be technically feasible at the moment in Australia, but a 3-minute overseas call from Australia might cost $10 or $12 and by the time a person put in the number of 20c pieces to cover the charge the 3 minutes would be just about up. I am not asking as I have on previous occasions for consideration to be given to the minting of a silver one dollar coin although I think it is a good idea. I should like to know whether the Minister will ask the Treasurer to examine the whole range and size of coins that are used in the Australian currency at the moment with particular emphasis on modernising and reducing the size of all the coins and also introducing a sensibly sized coin to the value of either $2 or preferably $3. Such a coin obviously would be extremely useful for a host of purposes apart from long distance telephone calls. </para>

I refer particularly to the joint statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications of 15 August relating to advisory committees on ethnic broadcasting services. I acknowledge that it is pointed out that the advisory committee will be the National Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Council but I refer particularly to the State ethnic broadcasting advisory committees which, according to the statement, are to be announced in the near future. I ask: Will the Government, in giving effect to its decision, take care to consult people involved in immigration and ethnic areas so that all areas of opinion, action and experience, as well as contemporary interest, will be involved? </para>

I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> and all the Poles concerned that it was considered but in view of the publicly known policy of the Government that there was to be, as far as possible, zero growth in this Budget, and also the policy of restricting new initiatives to the absolute minimum, I regret that the Government was unable to accede to any new initiatives in this direction in this year&#39;s Budget. </para>

            <para>-I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory <inline font-style="italic">News</inline> of 10 August 1977 reported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Isaacs, the Australian Labor Party leader in the Northern Territory, as saying that he had been advised from an impeccable source that extra revenue of some $ 1 5m was to be raised on top of normal internal revenue in the Northern Territory budget. The Australian Broadcasting Commission in the Northern Territory said today that the figure would be $2 1 m. In view of the fact that Budget documents give no indication that these allegations can be substantiated and that they would appear to be nothing more than a red herring to worry and disconcert the Northern Territory community, will the Minister comment on these statements? </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In view of the patent inability of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who represents the Treasurer in the Senate, to give information pertaining to the Budget, perhaps the Leader of the Government knows something about the Budget which his Government has presented, especially in view of his colleague&#39;s comment a moment ago that there were some galahs on this side of the Senate. I draw the attention of the Leader of the Government to the statement on page 17 of the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech that as a result of tax indexation revenue amounting to $965 m would be forgone in the financial year 1977-78. I ask whether it is correct, as implied on pages 125 and 134 of Budget Paper No. 1, that this revenue comprises $825m arising from the current income year and $140m arising from the previous income year. Would it not have been more truthful for the Treasurer to draw attention to the fact that the benefit to taxpayers from tax indexation in this financial year is not $965m, as his Budget Speech asserts, but $825m? </para>

Can the Minister say whether powdered milk products produced at other factories in any way constituted any threat to the health of infants? Specifically, can the Minister say whether the products of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd, the other major producer of these products, manufactured at Parramatta in Sydney were at any time suspect? Is she satisfied that the standards and quality of powdered milk produced by Wyeth were always of the levels required? Can the Minister advise the Senate whether all the problems associated with salmonella infection in baby milk powders have now been overcome? </para>

            <para>-I have not yet read Budget Paper No. 2. I think I mentioned that earlier. I said that any senator who wants a serious answer to any question should come to me prior to question time and I will endeavour to get it. I snail not be drawing out of thin air some assumption of knowledge that I do not believe I necessarily possess at the moment. Therefore honourable senators may take it that I will be very careful in answering questions, to be right on these matters. As I recall the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech, he indicated that a desirable aim of the Government in bringing down the inflation rate was to be able to bring down interest rates and, in managing the money supply, to be able to help in that process. I think it extremely unlikely that Budget Paper No. 2 would contain what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said. Over and above that, my view on this is quite well known. One of the things one wants to do in a society like Australia is to bring down the inflation rate in order to be able to bring down interest rates. </para>

            <para>-Senator Walters has drawn my attention to allegations that an Australian Labor Party advertisement in the daily Press was misleading and to an answer which is reported to have been given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> the Opposition spokesman on economic management. As the advertisement dealt with allegations of the Government&#39;s economic mismanagement and so on, I suppose he was the appropriate man to make a response, although it is always difficult to determine who is responsible in the Labor Party for speaking on economic matters. The Labor Party seems to be unable to make up its mind who it&#39;s spokesman is on these matters. The charge that has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> about the advertisement, which I have not seen but about which I have heard, would seem to be well justified. It is a fact that the Trade Practices Act does not provide any method of taking proceedings to correct misleading advertisements by political parties or politicians. The consumer protection provisions of that Act apply only to misleading or deceptive conduct in matters relating to trade or commerce. However I must say that it is rather passing strange that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> in answering <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters,</inline> should fall back upon legal technicalities and apparently not be prepared to defend the advertisement on its merits. </para>

While in no way insinuating any impropriety on the part of any person, will the Minister assure the Senate that there is no question of any doubt about the integrity of officers of any relevant departments or commissions in view of the fact that insider traders in the Australian Capital Territory are not presently subject to laws applying in this situation in other States? </para>

              <para>-Is the Leader of the Opposition now pleased that I give a legal opinion, or is he chiding me for it? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> raised a question regarding insider trading under the laws applying in the Australian Capital Territory. I am afraid that I am not sufficiently aware of the details of that legislation to be able to give a specific answer. However I will certainly have the matter looked at. Nevertheless I think I should say something further about the article by Chanticleer&#39; to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> has referred. I think it refers to the boys in Canberra having the sort of information on which fortunes are made. I do not know to what that is really referring. It is probably not meant to be a serious reflection on Commonwealth public servants, who are certainly at times in possession of such information. However, it would certainly be a very serious breach of the Crimes Act if any one of them used that information in that way. I have no reason to believe, and I am sure that the Government has no reason to believe, that any Commonweath public servants are doing so. However, I will look at the matter further in respect of the insider trading provisions of the legislation referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> and I will advise him and the Senate accordingly. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer to the actions of the Minister in submitting one case, involving the possible deportation of a New Zealand national, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and another case, that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Salemi,</inline> an Italian resident in Melbourne who is also facing deportation, to Professor Richardson, the Federal Ombudsman. Are we to interpret those actions as meaning that people from Comonwealth countries may appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and that people from nonCommonwealth countries will have the right to go before the Ombudsman? I also ask the Minister whether that procedure will be followed in relation to people who are denied citizenship. </para>

            <para>-Australian citizens and people having resident status in Australia may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of decisions made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs under section 12, 13 or 48 of the Migration Act 1958. Sections 12 and 13 of the Migration Act provide powers under which the Minister may order the deportation of people who have been admitted to Australia for settlement and who are convicted for crime. People who have been admitted to Australia temporarily or who are here illegally do not have the right of appeal to the Tribunal. However, people not having resident status and prohibited immigrants may request the Commonwealth Ombudsman to investigate any complaint they may have concerning administrative actions of departments or officials. The Ombudsman is not authorised to investigate actions taken by a Minister. </para>

          <para>The New Zealand citizen to whom the honourable senator refers exercised his right as a person having resident status in Australia to apply to the Tribunal for review of the decision of the Minister to order his deportation pursuant to section 13 of the Migration Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Salemi,</inline> on the other hand, being in Australia illegally and not being the subject of a deportation order made under section 12 or 13 of the Migration Act, or for that matter any other section of the </para>
          <para class="block">Act, has no right of appeal to the Tribunal.  His  legal representative complained on his behalf to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, alleging amongst other things errors on the part of the Department in the manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Salemi</inline> &#39;s application for amnesty had been handled and in the advice furnished to the Minister. It is a matter for each individual to decide whether he will exercise whatever right of appeal is open to him. The citizenship of the individual has no bearing on the matter. The Administrative Review Council, which was established under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, will review and make recommendations on other classes of decisions which the Council considers should be the subject of review by a court, tribunal or other body. I hope that that explains the matters raised by the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- A report about this matter appeared yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times.</inline> It was not a leak. It is true that no public announcement has been made by the Government in regard to this matter. The reason for that is that the Attorney-General intended to write to the former Ministers concerned or to their solicitors to convey the decision of the Government on this matter. I now have reason to believe that the solicitors for three of those involved and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy, who was not represented by a solicitor in relation to this matter, have been informed of the Government&#39;s decision. They have received the Attorney&#39;s letter. In that case, I am prepared at this stage to confirm the decision of the Government that the Commonwealth has agreed to pay reasonable costs- as determined by the Crown Solicitor for the Commonwealthof the defendants in the proceedings brought by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey.</inline> As to the further question <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> asked about whether these costs would cover the costs of proceedings on appeal in the New South Wales Supreme Court and Court of Appeal, the contemplation is that the reasonable costs incurred by the defendants will be met in all the proceedings which flow from those instituted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey.</inline></para>

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. Regrettably, odd cases are still coming forward indicating that a small minority of the medical profession has abused the position of trust doctors occupy by making false Medibank claims. As their own association does not appear to be taking disciplinary action against them, has or would the Government consider deregistration as the appropriate penalty rather than a fine which is of little consequence to such people? </para>

            <para>-The Government is presently studying the Fox Report. The honourable senator will understand that questions relating to research into nuclear energy should be directed to the Minister for National Resources and I will forward that part of his question to that Minister. The honourable senator will be aware that the Australian Atomic Energy Commission is within that Minister&#39;s portfolio. However, I can make some general comments in relation to other energy sources, particularly the work that is conducted by branches of my Department, particularly the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, on solar energy. The Senate should be aware that when we speak of research into solar energy it may be that the work that is carried out by the CSIRO is only a small part of the vast amount of research into solar energy by institutions, universities and colleges of advanced education. There is a great deal of work being done and increased funds, although the amount is not great, have been directed this year towards solar energy research by organisations within my responsibility. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable senator&#39;s question also embraces research which is being done in other areas of energy. Again a great deal is being done in Australia and overseas. On solar energy work by the CSIRO, we will be spending in excess of $1.4m this coming year. As I have mentioned previously, it is reported that the United States of America will be spending approximately $200m this year on this research. The information obtained there will be very valuable to this country. From my reading I understand that Canada is spending about $750,000 on solar energy research. There is also a great deal of work being carried out on behalf of the Australian public into coal research, liquefaction and gasification of coal and oil shale. There is also electro-chemical research which is particularly important and geothermal research has been receiving attention. </para>
          <para>There are programs being conducted generally throughout Australia for wind, wave and tidal energy research in an attempt to obtain benefits for this country. There is also the very important area of photosynthesis which is the traditional use of solar energy in the development of plants and research is being carried out into the use of plants for conversion into useful fuels. I believe that what is occurring in space research has great prospects for solar energy. It has been predicted that, during the next few years, it will become possible to overcome the problems presented by the atmospheric layer around the earth and to beam purer solar energy back to earth stations by way of short wave or other types of communication. So, there are great prospects for general use of many energy forms other than solar energy. </para>

It was stated last evening in the Budget Speech that there will be an alteration to the method of payment of the unemployment benefit. The benefit is now paid fortnightly in advance. In future it is to be paid a fortnight in arrears. The Minister&#39;s statement circulated this morning referred to inaccurate speculation regarding the benefit and suggested that the change in the method of payment will apply only to new applicants for the unemployment benefit. Can the Minister say what is the actual position? Will those people presently receiving the unemployment benefit have to wait 3 weeks or a month before they receive payment? </para>

            <para>- It was one of the Budget announcements that in future payment of the unemployment benefit will be made in arrears instead of in advance as at present. We will continue to pay by cheque on a fortnightly basis and the 7-day waiting period for eligibility will be retained. The changes will apply to those people who apply for the benefit after 1 November. We will retain the present system of fortnightly cheque payments for all those people who are currently receiving the unemployment benefit. There will be no change to their situation. Those people who come onto the unemployment benefit after 1 November will have to wait until a fortnight has elapsed before they receive their payment. I could issue a full statement as I did to honourable members and senators last night about this matter and all the Department of Social Security and Commonwealth Employment Service offices will have instructions today on the new procedures. Where a person is currently receiving the unemployment benefit and continues to receive it after 1 November there will be no change in the payment of cheques to him. </para>

What is the present status of Vietnamese refugees who arrived recently, as I understand it illegally, in Australia? What is the Government&#39;s attitude and policy with regard to these people? Have they been or will they be given Australian citizenship? If they are to remain in Australia where will they be accommodated and what action will be taken to fit them into the Australian community? What sources of income do these people have to sustain them at the present time? What is the Government&#39;s attitude towards the offers made by some State governments, as I understand it, and certainly by community organisations to provide accommodation and sustenance for these refugees? Is there a likelihood of a continued substantial influx of refugees from Vietnam? Finally, what would be the position if entry under similar circumstances by people from another country were to occur? </para>

In view of the detailed nature of the question I suggest that it be placed on notice. In the meantime I say that where refugees have arrived in this country there is an immediate payment of a special benefit to them. If they are in foster care the appropriate payments are made for fostering. Also double orphan and all sorts of other payments are made. If the honourable senator places the question on notice I could give detailed information as to what State governments are doing and how we are co-operating in making the settlement of these people as comfortable and secure as possible. </para>

The information, as I stated it at that time, was that unauthorised expenditure of $55,000 by the Service had been the cause of some its problems. I will now draw the attention of the Minister to the matters that have been raised today by the honourable senator to see whether any clarification of the statement that I made yesterday is necessary. If so, I will be prepared to clarify it for him and for the Senate. As I understand it, there were difficulties in the Supply period for the Aboriginal Medical Service at Redfern. As I said yesterday, its application for finance for this year was received only on 7 July. Funds were available for it and there was no intention that funds would not be forthcoming in this coming year. </para>

The Government has again reminded the IAC of the importance of that aspect. I imagine that a statement on that matter will be made tonight, if it is able to be delivered in the time that we have available. If it is not made tonight it will be made tomorrow. I refer the honourable senator to the White Paper on manufacturing which stresses the importance of the IAC having regard to any employment consequences of any recommendation it makes. </para>

            <para>- On 24 May <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> asked me a question about political prisoners in Pakistan. I said that I would seek information for him. The Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> has now provided me with the following answer. The Australian Government is aware of the recently published report of Amnesty International which expressed concern over the treatment of political opponents of the Government in Pakistan. As a matter of principle, the Government believes that political prisoners in any country should be brought to trial with as little delay as possible. The Government&#39;s concern at the large number of political detainees held in many countries throughout the world has frequently been made known in the Parliament and will continue to be so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The present political situation in Pakistan makes it difficult to know exactly what developments have occurred recently relating to political prisoners. The present Martial Law Administration led by General Zia al Haq removed Prime Minister Bhutto from office on 5 July and plans to transfer power back to the civilian authorities by way of a national election on 18 October. The Martial Law Administration initially placed a number of political leaders under temporary detention but has since released all of them. A number of political prisoners, detained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bhutto&#39;s</inline> Government, have also been released by the Martial Law Administration, but we do not know how many. All political activity is at present subject to controls under martial law. </para>

              <para>-On behalf of the Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann)</inline> I give the following response to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> earlier today. The published estimates of revenue from the supply of services by the Department of the Northern Territory show that actual collections in 1976-77 were $30,383,589, while estimated collections in 1977-78 total $51,201,000. The total estimated increase is therefore just under $21m and is made up of 2 components. The first of these is derived from the estimated growth in demand for all services supplied by the Department of the Northern Territory at current rates of tariffs and fees and totals $15m. The second component is an estimated general revenue increase of $6m which has been budgeted for by the Government but as explained by the Minister for the Northern Territory in his public statement issued immediately after the Budget was brought down last night specific increases in this context will be determined by the Northern Territory Executive and be subject to approval by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">That unemployment and the failure to improve the employment situation in this country is a matter of great importance in all our community should be self-evident. It should be self-evident to everyone in this House. From the attitude of </para>
          <para class="block">Government supporters both in this place and in another place it seems that this is not so. Hence the Opposition has moved this motion today. The spectre of unemployment in this country is frightening not only because of the number of people unemployed, which now totals according to the Government&#39;s figures 340 000 people in the community, but also because of the unremitting increase in the figures, the nature of the people who are unemployed and their distribution throughout the community. It is worth noting, I believe, that the attitude of prominent government members often changed with time and their position in the House. In September 1974 the shadow Minister for Labour, the Honourable John Malcolm Fraser, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government should pay the minimum wage if the number of unemployed exceeds 250,000. By that time it will be almost impossible for these people to get a job. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I believe it is interesting to compare that statement with his statements as Prime Minister and with the statements of his Ministers and supporters in this place. </para>
          <para>We have a severe unemployment problem across the nation. In some areas it is more severe than in others. Aboriginal unemployment, of course, is a national disgrace. In toto amongst Aboriginals the unemployment rate exceeds 50 per cent. The predominance of youth amongst our unemployed is a new phenomenon. Youththat is people under 21, now comprise 50 per cent of the unemployed in this country. A further factor not seen in the unemployment figures is the so-called hidden unemployed-the large numbers of married women who have lost their jobs in the last two years due to the continuing downfall in employment opportunities in this country. We have a regional bias in unemployment. We have areas of manufacturing in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with quite hair raising levels of unemployment. All rural areas in this country have high levels of unemployment. In all these areas the proportion of unemployed who are under 2 1 or 25 is very high. In Newcastle there are 1 50 unemployed youths for every job opportunity. Even more difficult is the fact that the duration that people are unemployed has increased and now averages over 1 8 weeks. It continues to increase, as it did in the past. Large numbers of people in this country face long term idleness. The young unemployed particularly face the associated social problems of an increased incidence of crime, vandalism, drug abuse, marital breakdown and suicide. The hopelessness which follows this long term idleness leads to lack of motivation for work which is a feature of all unemployed in the community. </para>
          <para>To this national disgrace is added the Government &#39;s lack of action and the Government&#39;s lack of willingness to do anything about the unemployed. All countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with varying degrees of the same problem, are taking steps actively to increase employment, to create jobs, to provide positive assistance for those who are unemployed and to provide positive assistance to supply jobs. The present Government adds small amounts of funds to retraining and support schemes to benefit a few, but it persistently refuses to consider job improvement, job creating activities, either by economic measures or by direct government action to increase the number of jobs available in the community. </para>
          <para>The Budget brought down last night does nothing to improve the hopes of the unemployed. Commentators, editorialists, economists, the  President  of the Australian Chamber of Commerce do not expect unemployment to improve. Even the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch),</inline> who used much more sober language this year than he did last year, when speaking about unemployment said that his activities should broadly take up the growth in the work force but perhaps not much more than that. In view of the accuracy of his predictions last year there is no hope for the unemployed. Anyone who heard the program <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> this morning would have heard the  President  of the Small Businesses Association, who sounded as though he was in grave danger of having a stroke, judging by the language he used and the manner in which he described last night&#39;s Budget. </para>
          <para>The Government has obviously confirmed its intention to use unemployment as an economic tool to beat inflation in a way that no other country is doing. The unemployed seem to be statistics to play with or perhaps a club with which to attack the trade unions in this country. Added to this, the past, present and future actions of the Government as forecast in the Budget last night are aimed at further attacking the unemployed, further increasing their hardship and further making them more disadvantaged in the community. The Government began its divisive attack against the unemployed before it took office. There is no need for me to repeat, as has been repeated in this House many times, the story of the continual attack in this community on the so-called dole bludgers, with all its division and all the difficulties it has created. Ministers and members in this House and in the other place have proclaimed that unemployment is a myth. One can say only that that is some myth, with 340 000 unemployed arid 250 000 on unemployment benefits, which is an increase of 70 000 since the present Government took office. At the same time it is worth noting that in the last 1 8 months the number of people employed in the manufacturing and construction industries in this country has decreased by some 100 000. New depths have been reached in the last few days by the member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peter Johnson)</inline> who attacks Aboriginals whom he says are overfed and overprotected. It is interesting to note that at the time this gentleman made this statement figures showing the fearful malnutrition and ill health of Aboriginals in this country were released. </para>
          <para>The Government introduced taxation of unemployment benefits. It further added to the burden of the unemployed by taxing not only the benefits but also the dependent children&#39;s allowances which unemployment beneficiaries receive. No pensioner who receives dependent children&#39;s allowances has those allowances taxed, except the unemployed in this community. This was clearly a discriminatory act against the unemployed, those out of work through no fault of their own. Work tests were tightened. School leavers were excluded from eligibility for unemployment benefits. Six weeks&#39; waiting time was introduced for the so-called voluntary unemployed. Despite these measures unemployment increased by 70 000 during this period and continues to increase. According to the predictions of everybody, including the Treasurer, it looks likely to increase in the future. The Government has introduced a measure which will increase the hardship of the unemployed, increase confusion for both the beneficiaries of unemployment benefits and the public servants who have to handle these benefits. In justification for this change the Government puts forward arguments that are manifestly dishonest and deceitful. The Government intends to change the system of unemployment benefit payments to two weeks in arrears instead of in advance and it is doing this without removing the present seven days&#39; waiting period for unemployed in the community and without enabling the Department of Social Security, by increasing staff, to handle the sorts of changes that will be necessary. </para>

              <para>-Perhaps if you will let me develop the argument a little bit you will see that I do not intend to take the line that you obviously and mistakenly think I am. In future new claimants will have to wait at least 1 5 days before receiving any benefits. In fact they will have to wait almost certainly 1 8 days or more. An overburdened staff in the Department will have to cope with a new system. As the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> said in answer to a question today, for a considerable time it will have to cope with two systems that run in parallel. There is at present considerable confusion and delay in the Department and in the Commonwealth Employment Service in the handling of unemployment benefits and sickness benefits. Things have become so bad that for the first time in the history of the Public Service members of the Department have put on work bans and overtime bans and have refused to handle inquiries from members of Parliament and have refused to collect statistics. At the moment we cannot get the exact number of people on unemployment benefits in this country because members of the staff are refusing to collect statistics. In Melbourne there was the lovely spectacle of fist fights in the Department of Social Security because of unemployment benefits. This is because of the present frustration, and to that is to be added the frustration that will be caused by this change. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Government uses two main arguments in justification of the change. Firstly, without quantifying the sum, the Government claims that a large sum will be saved by avoiding overpayment of benefit. No figure on how much this will be seems to be given anywhere in the Budget Papers or the Minister&#39;s speech. The information is that the saving will be some $1.8m in a full year. The second argument that the Government uses is manifestly dishonest. The Treasurer used it in his speech last night. It is the argument that this change is a result of the Myers report recommendation; that somehow this change has the approval of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Myers</inline> in his report on the unemployment benefit system. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Myers</inline> did recommend a system of payment fortnightly in arrears, but in his recommendations he was very careful to point out that if this were done in isolation, without at least removal of the 7-day waiting period, hardship and injustice would result. I quote from paragraph 4. 1 1 .7 on page 2 1 : </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Indeed, the two measures fit hand in glove -  the two measures being fortnightly payment in arrears and removal of the 7-day waiting time-  as fortnightly payment in arrears without abolition of the waiting period would cause hardship in the period before the first cheque was received. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>He also recommended a series of streamlining procedures to improve the administration of benefits in the Department and to improve the assistance available to the unemployed. He recommended changes similar to those set out in the Norgard report on the Commonwealth Employment Service. He recommended abolition of the 7-day waiting period, as did Professor Henderson and the Reverend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Martin</inline> of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty and as has everyone in the welfare field who has had anything to do with unemployment beneficiaries. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Myers</inline> also recommended a change in the roles of the CES and the Department of Social Security so that the CES could be an employment service fitting people to the right jobs, counselling people about employment and how to get jobs and improving their prospects of getting jobs. The Government has taken one recommendation out of his report in complete isolation, and in doing so it has placed itself in serious danger of setting up false economies in the system and setting up more confusion than exists at present. </para>
          <para>It is worth remembering that within seven days of the Myers report coming down the Government announced that it could not accept the report because it would cost too much money to implement the recommendations. This statement was contradicted immediately by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Myers.</inline> He asked for figures to back up the Government&#39;s statement. They have not been forthcoming. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Myers</inline> pointed out that there was a difficulty, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will be pleased to know the Opposition acknowledges, in that the present payment system is not related to the period about which the beneficiary has declared his circumstances. In fact, in order to have prompt payment to people who qualify for unemployment benefit, the waiting period must go. If it does not go the present system of advance payment should remain. People should be able to claim the benefit as soon as they become unemployed. Those who can establish that they need an earlier payment than payment in arrears should have the option of a cheque for one week&#39;s benefit in hand, with the next payment being for one week. Further payments could then be made fortnightly without difficulties. </para>
          <para>One knows that the system which is being proposed is causing concern in the welfare area and in the Department of Social Security itself. As with so many other Government measures, the new system will result in more people being thrown on to the care of the voluntary welfare agencies, especially in the first and second weeks of their unemployment. These agencies are having enough difficulties at the moment because of our difficult economic circumstances. To suggest, as the Minister does, that the best way for people to get over their difficulties in the first week is to avail themselves <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the special benefit procedure, I believe, is to be completely heartless and without concern for the very people who will need help. The special benefit procedure is very difficult. It causes division among beneficiaries. The harshness of it can be seen in the manner in which it was applied to unemployed school leavers. Even an unemployed school leaver with a mother on a widow&#39;s pension was unable to get special benefit. That person was not considered to be in any great distress. </para>
          <para>According to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Myers,</inline> it would take 15 days for the first cheque to be received under a new setup, but he was talking about his complete system. He was talking about the various reforms which he advocates in both the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service. I understand that officers of the Department of Social Security believe that no payment is possible within 18 days of a claim being lodged for unemployment benefit. Many recommendations of the Myers report and the Norgard report are essential to an efficient transformation from a system of payment in advance to a system of payment in arrears. Forms will have to be redesigned to establish the continuing eligibility. Information regarding the procedural arrangements must be given not only to departmental officers but also to all the claimants. It will have to be given in foreign languages. The already inadequate accommodation at Social Security offices will have to be upgraded. More counselling will be necessary. </para>
          <para>There is no indication in the Treasurer&#39;s speech or in the Minister&#39;s statement that the Government realises that unless it trains and attracts sufficient staff to ensure that there will be a swift turn-around of payments to beneficiaries the system will fall down. If there is a delay in the setting up of a new system or in the processing of some income statements, sometimes complete pay-runs will be missed, irregularities of payment will occur and there will be a bankup of frustrated unemployed who have not received their payments. The counters will be full as they are now and the phones will be blocked as they are so often now because at present the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service are on a staffing level sufficient to cope with about 100 000 unemployed, not the 340 000 that we have now. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Myers</inline> in his report pointed out that the overpayments problem- the $1.6m that the Government is so concerned about- was related most commonly to staff difficulties and the scarcity of staff. It was related also to the overcentralisation of the present system. In fact, offices which were decentralised had a better record than the large centralised offices of Sydney and Melbourne. The Government gives no indication in the Treasury Papers that it is willing to put money into decentralised offices. In fact it has stopped the system of decentralisation which the Labor Government was encouraging. </para>
          <para>It will be no good if the Government skimps over the administrative changes that will be necessary to put this change into operation efficiently, because it will create confusion and frustration and end up penalising the unemployed, who are most disadvantaged. The people who are most likely to become unemployed are the unskilled workers and the workers on very low incomes. Frequently low income earners literally live from week to week. They have literally no savings. Now they will have to go 15 to 18 days without payment of unemployment benefit unless they can obtain assistance through the special benefit system. They will have this special benefit thrown up to them as a sop. Applying for special benefit is a very difficult operation and success would involve a great change in the present system, which obviously is not coming. The voluntary organisations, such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence in Melbourne and the Mathew Talbot Hostel in Sydney, will have further increasing numbers to care for under this system. </para>
          <para>The second justification which is given in the Treasury statements is that this measure will save the Government $60m in Government expenditure. The sentences are so juxtaposed as to give the impression that this will be the saving of overpayments. I have repeated that the overpayments count for about $ 1.6m. The $60m saving referred to has nothing to do with overpayments. It is merely due to the fact that for 2 weeks at least there will be a delay in the final payments at the end of this financial year, and 60m will be transferred from this year&#39;s payments to next year&#39;s payments- a transfer which will not assist the taxpayer, a transfer that will not assist the Government, a transfer which will merely annoy and cause distress for an infinitesimal number of people compared to the whole state. </para>
          <para>In his Speech last night the Treasurer gave very little hope for the unemployed in this community. The commentators who viewed the Treasurer&#39;s Speech last night gave no hope for the unemployed in this country. No responsible observer of the Budget, whether in business, in the unions, in the newspapers or anywhere else, gives any hope for an increase in employment in this country next year which will make any difference to the number of unemployed in this country next year. The Treasurer claimed that his budgetary strategy was one to cause increase in disposable incomes in the second half of this financial year which would somehow lead to a consumer recovery. The commentator sent by the Taxation Institute of Australia to the Australian Broadcasting Commission last night to observe and comment on the Budget said that those who gain least are the real consumers of this country- those on about average weekly earnings, those on just below average weekly earnings and those on just above average weekly earnings. Their tax gain will be less than $2 a week- from $1.20 a week to $1.60 a week- and this will be more than counteracted by the increased transport costs adding to the price of goods and the increased cost of petrol in the cars they drive. </para>
          <para>If we cannot expect recovery from this quarter we cannot expect recovery from any other quarter, and if we do not get recovery we will not get an increase in employment. Even the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> who on the most conservative estimate will save $80 a week in tax from the tax changes, is not sufficiently wealthy to cause a consumer led recovery in the community by himself. Business does not expect recovery. Manufacturers do not expect recovery. The unemployed can see no light ahead. At the same time the Government increases the difficulties and the hardships of the unemployed in the community, as it has done consistently since it came into power. This is obviously a matter of considerable urgency. This is obviously a matter of considerable importance to the whole community. Speakers after me will talk about the methods which can be used- methods which are not inflationary- to increase the number of employed in the community. Commentators all over the country are wondering what the Government is about and why the Government is so unconcerned about the unemployed in the community. </para>
          <para>It is callous and it is indifferent for people in government in this country to show such little concern for the unemployed and to use unemployment as an economic tool. The Government in this country today shows its callousness and great unconcern, as it has done since it has been in power, by making things more difficult for those who are unemployed, by making benefits harder to get, by making application for benefits difficult, by failing to increase the allowances for dependants of people who are unemployed and by now introducing, half-cocked, a system of reform which, with all the other suggestions of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Myers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norgard,</inline> may be a very good system but the Government is pulling out that reform in isolation, an act which can only make life difficult not only for the unemployed but also for the people in the Department of Social Security, particularly those clerks in the office who answer the telephones and who will have to handle the great confusion which will inevitably arise. The Opposition suggests that, rather than attack the unemployed, and rather than make life difficult for the unemployed as the Government has done, the Government should take positive steps, as every other government in the world is doing, to create jobs, to stimulate the economy sufficiently, to take up sufficient of those unemployed and to create an economic recovery, which will mean that once again we can return to a sensible situation in this country without the difficulties we have at present. </para>

            <para>-For the last 25-odd minutes the Senate has been listening to a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> allegedly on a matter of urgency. In reality it was a speech that roamed over the Budget, taxation reform, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and the problems in social security. One really wonders where the urgency was. I think that it would have been far better if it had been confined to the general Budget debate, but that is the Opposition&#39;s privilege. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> started his speech with a quotation from the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> I suppose that that really is not very relevant to unemployment. Let me quote two Ministers of the Whitlam Government. These two quotations, for which I call on my memory, really highlight the causes of the present unemployment. The first one was by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron. I remember him saying when he was Minister for Labour that if unemployment ever reached 250 000 he would resign. Those of us who were here then recall that the figure passed 250 000 but he did not resign. He found some reason for not resigning. It was not until he was reluctantly dragged screaming from the tart shop one day that he was replaced by another Minister. He knew when he made his offer to resign that unemployment was increasing, and it was well past the figure of 250 000 before he was translated into the Science portfolio. There is one of the underlying causes of the present unemployment, brought about by the mismanagement of the previous Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other quotation- again I call on my memory- is from the first of the Australian </para>
          <para class="block">Labor Party Treasurers. I forget how many Treasurers Labor had. It had real Treasurers, part-Treasurers, half-Treasurers and all sorts of Treasurers. Labor even had Khemlani working for it at one stage. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean</inline> who when he was Treasurer said that everybody ought to remember that each man &#39;s pay rise was at the expense of another man&#39;s job. Those two factors are really what the present unemployment is all about. No matter how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> may like to go on, the fundamental cause of unemployment in Australia has been excessive wage increases. There is no doubt about that. Whether anybody likes it or not, ultimately a man &#39;s labour is a commodity like any other commodity. Honourable senators opposite say that a man has the right to strike, that he has the right to withdraw his labour, that labour is something one sells on the market. That is what the Opposition has argued for years. When honourable senators talk about a man&#39;s right to strike they say that he has the right to withdraw that commodity. I say that labour is a commodity and it is subject to the laws of supply and demand. If the price of labour is increased too much, other things being equal the demand for it will fall off because buyers turn to substitutes or they buy less. That is a simple fact. </para>
          <para>What the Opposition will not get through its head is that for most of the post-war period in this country there was very high employment associated with a buoyant demand for goods and services. In that sort of situation- the country was under a Liberal and National Country Party Government for 23 years- employers usually were able to pass on wage increases in the form of higher prices for the goods and services they produced. The current environment of higher unemployment is associated with a general slack in demand for goods and services and with highly competitive selling conditions. In the present circumstances the average employer is no longer able to pass on the cost of his labour increases. What does he do? He sheds labour. He looks for cheaper labour, substitute labour, or goes through his operation to see whether he has some fat he can cut out. Whether the trade unions like it or not, what Treasurer Crean of the Labor Government said in early 1973 or 1974 was true. It was true then, it is true now and it will always be true. </para>
          <para>If the Labor Party was really concerned about unemployment, one would think that it would be using its influence with the trade union movement to have the movement moderate its demands. I suppose the real tragedy in this country is that the Labor Party has no influence with the trade union movement. Rather, the boot is on the other foot. The real tragedy in this country is that we have a person allegedly looking after the interest of the trade union movement while wearing one hat and seeking to further his own political ambitions while wearing another hat. The unemployed, the trade union movement and the Labor Party have no idea where they are going. Until the trade union movement ceases making excessive claims for wage increases and until the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission ceases granting those increases, the basic cause of unemployment in Australia will persist. </para>
          <para>One of the other great causes of unemployment in this country was another action of the Whitlam Government. Honourable senators will recall that all of a sudden that Government slashed tariffs across the board by 25 per cent. What happened then? Manufacturers in Australia exported jobs. The products that they had been making in Australia were made overseas and were brought in under the low tariff. That was a stroke of economic genius! The Labor Party put out of work 100 000 textile workers and 30 000 bootmakers. </para>

Why do honourable senators opposite think that the previous  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes),</inline> almost lost his seat at the last election? Corio used to be a safe Labor Party seat. Why did it almost turn out to be a disaster for the Labor Party at the last election? It was almost a disaster because of the great unemployment brought about in the textile industries in the electorate of Corio. What happened in Tasmania at the Bass by-election? Who put all the people out of work in the electorate of Bass, which is in a State in which the Labor Party used to be able to boast that it had five members of the House of Representatives? How many members from that State do they have now? Why? Due to the lunatic tariff policies of the Whitlam Government, which put many people out of work. </para>

              <para>-I thought we were talking about unemployment. I suppose that if one was going to talk about the great unemployed we probably would be talking about the Opposition because it would be the most unemployed group of people I have met for a long time. All the Opposition does is hang around digging up a little bit of dirt here and a little bit of dirt there. We are supposed to be talking about the problems of unemployment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> said that this Government is a failure because it has not established some of the great schemes he advocated to alleviate the problem of unemployment. I remember that the previous Labor Government established the RED scheme- initials; not the colour red. the famous Regional Employment Development scheme was going to solve unemployment in Australia. It was such a disaster that the Labor Party abandoned it. Yet, it is talking about instituting schemes such as the RED scheme again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> said that many countries have great schemes such as the RED scheme. Let us look at the world record of unemployment. I am informed that Canada in May 1977 had 7.7 per cent unemployed; in the same month the United States had 6.4 per cent unemployed; Australia had 5. 1 per cent; Germany had 4. 1 per cent; Italy had 6.8 per cent; and the U.K. had 5.6 per cent. </para>

I should like to look at the record of this Government in this field. The basic purpose of the much maligned Commonwealth Employment Service- it is maligned by a number of people in the communityis to find jobs for people and find people for jobs. It ought not to be forgotten that last year the CES placed 467 000 people in employment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> smiles; does he not believe those figures? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> also talked about those who do not have the capacity to obtain work because they do not have any skills. </para>

              <para>-Yes. They tend to be unskilled, as I understand the statistics. I often wonder whether that is not due to the famous education system we have in Australia. We are aware of the situation. There is a scheme known as the National Employment and Training scheme. At the end of June 1977 there were 1 9 300 people in training under this scheme. </para>

              <para>-Honourable senators opposite knock it. There is also the CRAFT scheme- the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training scheme. As I understand it, last year that scheme assisted 41 600 persons to improve their employment opportunities. Under the relocation assistance scheme 400 persons were assisted. As to apprenticeships, because of the reaction to what is generally known as CRAFT, as I understand the figures, there are now 1 1 589 more apprentices in New South Wales; 13 441 in Victoria; 5626 in Queensland; 3316 in South Australia; 4706 in Western Australia; 1428 in Tasmania; 1106 in the Australian Capital Territory; and 365 in the Northern Territory. That is something to be sneered at, according to the Opposition. That is something about which it is said this Government is doing nothing. I remind the Senate of the famous statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron. It was reported both in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> and in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of 14 August 1974.

They have about the same mental approach to modern technology. That is one of the causes of the present level of unemployment. The more honourable senators opposite walk around preaching their gloom the longer the unemployment is going to last. The Labor Party, of course, has thrived on gloom for years. Labor Party members hate to be a happy party. They like everybody to be sunk in misery, with no prospect, no optimism and no faith in this countryno nothing. I believe and my colleagues believe, as we have great cause to believe, that as a result of the policies pursued by the Government since it came into office and as a result of the Budget which was put down yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> this country does have a great future. </para>

              <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> points out, there has been a flow-on of those cutbacks to private industry. The result was that there was no demand for goods. The Leader of the Government in this place talks nonsense when he talks about lowering wages. If his argument is right, then the low wage states of India, the Philippines, Indonesia and a mass of other countries would all be prosperous. The fact is that modern experience tells us that the more we can keep people in employment and the more we can encourage consumer demand the better chance there is of providing work opportunities for everybody. So there is a need, as the Labor Party has said, to examine the promises of these people who put Labor out of office because it was said that we could not manage the economy. Of course, that statement was a complete fraud, as everybody knows. It is true to say today that not only can this Government not do it but in fact its Ministers come into the Parliament and refuse to answer questions about how it will get the economy going. The future looks brighter, they say. They say that they will train people and that they are training more apprentices. The Government is training people in community welfare schemes. It has all sorts of fancy schemes but it does not have any jobs. Last night with regard to training programs <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> read this statement: </para>

              <para>-The Government ought to be finding jobs for those people. There are jobs in the Public Service. Skilled men are required in the Public Service and in most of the statutory authorities but they cannot take on skilled men who are unemployed because of the staff ceiling policy of the Government which has been applauded by Government senators. There have been 12 500 people sacked from the Commonwealth Public Service and more are to go. Because of staff ceilings the railways industry cannot take on skilled workers to repair railway tracks. This would be productive work which would improve the economy. Then, the Government introduces a Community Youth Support Scheme- this is where I was interrupted. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> stated that this scheme would improve the ability of young people to apply for jobs and to find employment. </para>

          <para>Curently 1 16 projects are in operation involving a lot of young people. The Opposition wants to see these young people in jobs. We want to see jobs created. Everyone inside and outside this place, knows that the huge cut backs in expenditure by this Government to reduce the deficit meant, in fact, that every important, constructive project in Australia was either slowed down or stopped. Not only was the Commonwealth unable to employ people but also, as I have said, many of the statutory authorities which could presently be employing people cannot do so because the Government has stopped them from doing so. It will continue to do so. The Budget Speech stated 12 500 fewer people are employed in the Public Service and there will be fewer tomorrow. What has been gained by this? All that has been gained is general disagreement and resistance from the trade unions and the Public Service. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> mentioned there is also a lack of assistance in social welfare schemes as a result of staff ceilings. That is known from evidence given at Estimates Committees. It is known that almost every department has been embarrassed by these staff ceilings. Many of them cannot do their job properly. Evidence is available to support that. It has been reported here yet the Government still claims that it is necessary. </para>
          <para>Twelve months ago it was claimed that service could not be obtained from the Commonwealth Employment Service because of a lack of staff. What happened? After 12 months it came out that the Opposition was right and 300 more people were appointed to the staff of the Commonwealth Employment Service. As I have said, after nearly 2 years and after promises to get the economy going, professional people have no business confidence. There is more unemployment. Unemployment continues to grow quarter by quarter and no doubt it will continue to do so. Apparently it is accepted by the Government that there could be an unemployment rate of 7 per cent by early next year. In his statement concerning the last unemployment figure in July, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> reported: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>At end of July there were 337 391 unemployed persons registered with the CES or 5.4 per cent of the estimated labour force of 6.2 million. </para>

          <para class="block">That is a lot but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> talks about the Labor Government. After nearly 2 years in office the Government is still blaming Labor for unemployment. Unemployment has more than doubled since the Labor Government was in office. </para>

          <para class="block">The figure was less in 1975. My time is limited. I do not intend to stop and listen to honourable senators on the other side of the chamber who seek to interject. I have less than half the time allotted to your leader in which to speak. The fact is- it cannot be counteracted- that in every department services have been hamstrung and industrial trouble has been created by staff ceilings. The Government could employ skilled people in many of these areas but it will not do so because it believes some fiction about the deficit. It believes that the deficit must be reduced by reducing workers&#39; wages. That is its only solution. In the United Kingdom people like honourable senator&#39;s opposite have been putting forward this nonsense for two years. What was the result of a recent survey in the United Kingdom when a team of German experts and businessmen were invited to the United Kingdom by the government and the people to see what was wrong with the British economy. People over there blame the British worker in the same way as Government supporters blame the Australian worker. <inline font-style="italic">The Guardian</inline> of Monday, 1 August had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Germans blame the British manager. West German businessmen working in Britain put the blame for our economic problems on British management, not the British workman, according to an article yesterday in the news magazine <inline font-style="italic">Der Spiegel.</inline></para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The facts are clear. The Government&#39;s solution to the unemployment situation is to break the promises that it gave on the election eve to agree to full wage indexation. In addition, the Government says that wages must be reduced. It says that there is more industrial disputation than at any time. As the Australian Council of Trade Unions representative pointed out to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, that is quite untrue. The Government is using these devices to try to confuse the Australian electors in the same way as it confused the electorate on the eve of the election that defeated the Labor Government. The Government will not answer the pleas that have been made by State governments. It is true that the performance of the Labor Government in industrial disputes is better than that of this Government. It is true that the States with Labor governments have a better record of industrial peace than States with Liberal governments. The Government cannot put its finger on any of these things in a realistic way. </para>
          <para>I put it to the Government, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> has pointed out, that many of the people who come to this country have great disabilities under present circumstances. The Government is making that situation harder for them. It is not making it easier for the unemployed person to get a job. It is not training people for jobs. It is training people but there are no jobs. It is making it more difficult for people who are displaced. Over the years the numbers of people unemployed have increased. The number of months for which unemployed people have been unemployed has increased. It is now evident that the trend which occurred early this year meant that people who were unemployed for 6 months represented 80 per cent of those who were registered as unemployed. The Opposition wants to draw to the attention of the Government the need for an important revision of the works program, a revision of assistance to the States. Not only has the Government caused these troubles in the Federal area, but also it has caused the States to have a recession which has meant that people cannot be employed in the way they should be employed. </para>

          <para class="block">This discussion could really only be of value if, in the course of it, we were able to determine the causes of the problems that confront us and then determine to overcome them. If we spend only an hour or two in bemoaning a circumstance, in producing, as I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> did, a doleful story and in inferring that Australia and Australians are totally incapable of getting out of the problems which he and his Government over three years of socialist experiment evolved for them, then our whole contribution will be merely to emphasise the problems that confront this country- to emphasise unemployment, to emphasise the disasters that are built around an unemployment-inflation situation. </para>
          <para>I take a moment to mention one or two of the things that have been said in the debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> referred to the need to assist the States in the circumstances in which this country finds itself. Good heavens, the States are wealthier now than they have even been in the history of this country. If they have the capacity to do things that will solve some of the problems that confront the country, certainly that capacity is not related to their financial ability to do those things, but rather to their determination to recognise them and to carry them out. I further remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop-</inline> I am sure he is well aware of this-that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Callaghan,</inline> the British Labour Prime Minister, said not very long ago that as a government you cannot spend your way out of inflation and unemployment. As a government, you have to establish the sorts of circumstances that will bring a measure of initiative and confidence into commercial and industrial operations, a measure great enough to seek to employ all those who are capable of being employed in a society. That is the job of a government and it is not possible, as some socialists around the world have suggested, to just spend your way out of problems of inflation and unemployment. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline>spent quite a deal of time talking about the disaster of the suggestion that the payment of unemployment benefit should be a payment fortnightly in arrears. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> quite clearly and quite properly pointed out that that is the normal way of receiving payment for anything. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> referred to unemployment as a national disgrace. Well he should know, because he contributed quite successfully to the establishment of unemployment in this country. He said further that unemployment benefits should not be taxed, but surely if unemployment benefits, along with the moneys that a person earns in the course of a year, happened to form part of a taxable income it is reasonable that they should be taxed. Why should they not be taxed? They are contributed by every taxpayer in Australia in the first place. We say that in a just circumstance of unemployment of course they should be paid to the people who are eligible to receive them. But if they form part of a total taxable income, then they should be taxed like any other such income. </para>
          <para>I refer again to the words pf the first part of the motion that is before us: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government&#39;s failure to take positive steps to improve employment . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> G. Whitlam, in his three years of office took very positive steps to establish unemployment. He has certainly done a fine job in leaving to Australians a legacy which is going to be, is proving to be and which everybody accepted would be an extraordinarily difficult legacy to overcome. He was eminently successful in producing unemployment and inflation. Indeed, in the three years in which he was in office, from 1972 to 1975, he saw an average annual increase in the level of unemployment in excess of one per cent. It increased from 2 per cent or just over that figure to well in excess of 5 per cent in a threeyear period. Incidentally, in the first year of the Fraser Government-and this is nothing to be enormously proud of in the total- the increase in unemployment was 0.2 per cent, which is less than one-fifth of the average annual increase in unemployment during the years of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s Government. Those years also saw an increase in average wages and salaries of 15 per cent, 28 per cent and 1 3 per cent. </para>
          <para>Here is the other point that is of extreme importance: In those three years we saw increases in government expenditure of 23 per cent, 33 per cent and 38 per cent. Is it any wonder that on coming to office we were confronted with unemployment and inflation immeasurably high in terms of Australian economic history. Labor&#39;s only recourse to that problem, as our leader clearly stated, was the establishment of the Regional Employment Development scheme- a scheme which left many somewhat futile objects throughout the community and which was so disastrously expensive that it was abandoned by its instigators. The solution to the problem of employment in Australia surely lies- this Government is aware of it and I believe that more and more people in Australia are becoming aware of it- in the establishment of circumstances whereby this economy develops to the degree that its commercial and industrial enterprises once again know stability, once again know incentive, once again know that there will be a reward for initiative and once again know that profit is available. In those circumstances and in those circumstances alone are we going to solve the unemployment problem that confronts us today. Of course we are aware of it; the whole community is aware of it. The important thing is that the community should be listening to this debate, should be reading of matters in the Press and should be discussing amongst themselves and analysing the causes of the problem because they are pretty clear and pretty easy to identify. Having identified them, they have to make a determination that they are going to solve them, because in a democracy any legislation is about as good as the strength of the will of the people to make it work. Hopefully Australians are beginning to reach the point where they are determined to make it work. </para>
          <para>I remind the Senate that in the financial year ending 30 June 1977 real wages actually increased. People could buy more at the end of that year than they could at the beginning. But real wages had risen to such an extent that they had put vast numbers of jobs in jeopardy. The thing which Australians and most of all the trade union leadership, the leaders of industry, the Government and the Opposition have to recognise is that that is the basic cause of the problems that confront us. The guilt for the situation that confronts us in Australia probably lies predominantly with the radical element of trade union leadership. It has sought successfully, over 3 years of weak socialist government, to price Australians out of the work force and out of competition around the world. All it succeeded in doing was to export job opportunities from this country; to switch the emphasis from labour intensive to capital intensive operations. That very switch of emphasis makes re-employment and overcoming the problems that confront us infinitely more difficult. It is about time Australians en masse recognised that these circumstances confront them with an enormous problem to which there is no easy or quick solution. There has been a tendency and will continue to be a tendency to use sophisticated machinery, to use computerisation and to do all those things which minimise the use of labour. In the circumstances that confront this country today that is a disastrous position. </para>
          <para>I refer to the final part of the motion that is before us this afternoon which alleges that the Government is discriminating against the unemployed, lt is pretty childish and stupid to assume that any government of any colour would set out to discriminate against the unemployed. The people in this Government, like the people in the Opposition, are adults. They are not likely to set out to discriminate against the unemployed. The Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> in this chamber this afternoon referred to programs related to the Commonwealth Employment Service right through to the added areas of apprenticeship and various youth training schemes which are now applicable to people up to the age of 25. He outlined the many serious and effective contributions to overcoming the unemployment problem of this country, particularly in the youth area, in which this Government has been involved. The contributions are significant indeed. They cover something like 40 000 to 50 000 people in all. In apprenticeships alone the rise in the last 12 months has been in excess of 10 per cent. </para>
          <para>Let me remind the Senate that this Budget includes no less than $787m for unemployment and sickness benefits. That is a massive amount of money. </para>

            <para>- The Government will regret the day it brought down this Budget. It is fairly obvious that the enthusiasm of last night has dimmed somewhat today. It was fairly evident at question time that the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> who represents the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> in this place could not answer questions concerning the Budget nor could the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> who was questioned subsequently. In fact the speech of the Leader of the Government today indicates that he is unable to present the case in support of the Government&#39;s Budget proposals and particularly the Budget proposals which endeavour to do something about unemployment. The Treasurer admitted a few minutes ago before the National Press Club that the figures in the Budget are somewhat rubbery. Indeed, they are very rubbery. The whole of the Budget propositions are rubbery. They will get the results that the Government deserves. Our point is that the electorate does not deserve the consequences of this Budget. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Nothing positive has been done in this Budget which will relieve the problems of the unemployed in this country. I agree with one thing and one thing only which was presented last night. Unemployment is now very much a social and human problem. The Budget which was delivered last night inhumanly neglects the growing problem of unemployment. In fact it is discriminatory. Let me give an example. It places $3,500 in the pocket of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> through taxation changes but offers nothing for the increasing number of Australians who are unemployed. This is the point we are making today. The urgency motion today has been moved to highlight immediately what the Budget proposes. As far as the unemployed are concerned- that is the matter we are debatingwe are dealing with an inhuman Budget. No job creation schemes are contained in the Budget. There are no real incentives to companies to employ. There are no public works schemes. I repeat: There are no public works schemes. The emphasis is on stimulating the private sector, placing the whole onus for the recovery of our economy on the private sector and neglecting the fact that we are a mixed economy and that the private sector has to be assisted and stimulated by expenditure in public areas. That is what the Government is neglecting. Upon that philosophy it will fail. Every action taken based upon that philosophy will lead to failure. </para>
          <para>If this were just a matter of statistics we would not worry so much. It is a matter of consequence and a matter of humanity. Many thousands of Australians are unemployed and will continue to be unemployed. Their numbers will increase. The Government must accept responsibility. It must not rest upon the Budget that it presented last night. The Budget ignores the viable propositions put forward last week by the Australian Labor Party for major spending on programs to create work. Instead it offers only a paltry $23m extra on training schemes. This is a drop in the ocean compared with what is required to get people back to work. Rather, this Government proposes a continued decline in employment. That is deliberate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> said that we accused the Government of discrimination against the unemployed. He said, in effect, that this was a deliberate charge against the Government. We put it differently. By its attempts to bring inflation under control and reduce the real value of wages by using the unemployed, the Government is discriminating against the unemployed. The Government&#39;s use of the unemployed to recover the economic situation is in my mind discriminatory and, again I use the word, inhuman. </para>
          <para>The Government proposes a continued decline in employment. Under this restrictive Budget it is certain that more than 400 000 Australians will be unemployed early in 1 978. That is the continuing trend. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for 1976 show that 12 per cent of the work force was unemployed at some point during the year. That makes the situation even worse. Twelve per cent of the work force throughout the country will be affected by unemployment. Forget about the 5 per cent and the 5.5 per cent; look at the real figure. Twelve per cent of Australians will be affected by unemployment in a single year; that is 700 000 families in Australia will be touched by the tragedy of unemployment. We must face up to that situation. That is why we say that the matter is urgent. That is the reason for the urgency debate. Let me make the gentle comment in passing, without being overly insulting, that the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> who is responsible for much of what has to be done in the area of unemployment, should be speaking in this debate. Unfortunately she is not present. The Leader of the Government in the Senate has taken up the defence, possibly on her behalf. I believe that she deserved a better defence than she was given this afternoon. </para>

              <para>- The Ministers have shown today that they are incapable of understanding the Budget. I can understand why they do not understand our proposition. The community knows exactly what we are talking about and that the matter is extremely urgent. The Budget certainly will push up the percentage of unemployed in 1977-78, thus increasing the community&#39;s insecurity and despair. It is ironic that, with unemployment reaching a total of 337 391 persons in July 1977, this Government prefers to ignore the problem or, should I put it more kindly, substantially to ignore the problem. This amounts to the greatest denial of government responsibility in my experience. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street),</inline> when releasing the July unemployment figures, said: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>There was no clearly evident trend in the labour market during July. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What a denial of fact that is. What a cover-up of an escalating emergency in the community. When unemployment increases by 4598 in July he can say only that there was no clearly evident trend. I believe that that is a cover-up. It is a cover-up by the Government and an evasion by the Government of its responsibility. Unemployment has deepened and is increasing at a greater rate in Australia than in any other comparable country. I heard the figures quoted by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, but he did not go right down the list to include the Scandinavian countries. By comparison, unemployment is increasing at a greater rate in this country than it any other country. Whilst the recession deepens the Treasurer says- I use his wordsthat a slower volume of growth is necessary. The plight of the unemployed is sidestepped. </para>
          <para>Handouts for the oil companies and to persons with above average weekly earnings were evident last night. I declare that the priorities of this Government are quite wrong. Unemployment is chronic and must be tackled by any government that is concerned with the plight of its people. Let me take the case of Queensland to show that the situation is chronic. The problem faces not only Queensland but also the rest of Australia. In July 1977 unemployment in Queensland reached 49 8 1 7 people or 5.64 per cent of the work force. This is above the national average of 5.44 per cent. This is an increase since June 1977 of 1237 persons. In June 1976, 38 586 persons were registered as unemployed, which was 4.5 per cent of the work force. So one can see the increase. In the period June to July 1976 there was a drop in the level of unemployment in Queensland. I think the message is clear. Unemployment in real terms is on the increase. It is certain that in January and February 1978 it will exceed the post-war record which was established by this Government in the same period this year. So Queenslanders can be apprehensive. </para>
          <para>Let me give an indication of how bad things are in Queensland. At the principal employment office in Brisbane 981 people were registered as unemployed, at Alderley 609, at Annerley 1503, at Brisbane 1633, at Chermside 1282, at Fortitude Valley 2388, at Inala 1244, at Indooroopilly 817, at Mount Gravatt 1537, at Nundah 1419, at Redcliffe 1070, at West End 1043, at Woodridge 990, at Woolloongabba 2994 and at Wynnum 1744. The metropolitan total was 21 254. Unfilled vacancies numbered 802- one vacancy for every 30 people unemployed. The Leader of the Government tells me, or endeavours to tell me, that the matter is not urgent. Consider also that the greatest number of unemployed are young people. I would like to say a word of commendation about the Community Youth Support scheme. I speak in support of those people who are working on a very miserable budget and endeavouring to provide some comfort and assistance to young people in Brisbane, at a variety of centres. To this point they have been undersupported financially but have provided community centres in the various suburbs to allow young people to escape from their despair. I give great credit to the people who run these community centres. The young social workers attached to these community centres deserve our commendation. The Government should proceed to support these centres but should realise fully that they do not help the unemployed in finding jobs. They merely assist these young people to get into communication with people in the same position as themselves. </para>
          <para>I refer to another support scheme which the Government has introduced but which, to my mind, is a complete failure and is providing cheap labour to failing industries. That is all it does. There is very little training component in a scheme which subsidises an employer to the extent of $60 to employ a young person. What has happened and what was bound to happen is that employers, some of necessity, have abused the scheme. There is very little training in the scheme itself. The abuse is widespread. Even in the country areas, which the National Country Party represents, there is a misuse of the scheme. Young people are taken on under this scheme as jilleroos and in other rural occupations, and they are receiving no training at all. In one case which has come to my attention a person sent out under the training scheme acted as a housekeeper and saddled a horse on only two occasions in three months. That is the abuse of the scheme, and it is widespread. The Government should have a good look at the scheme because all it does is institutionalise short term employment- dead end jobs. It has the opposite effect to that intended. It is demoralising to the young person who is employed under those conditions and who knows that the employer pays only $11 towards his keep. At the end of 6 months he is bound to find himself on the scrap heap. The Government should look at the scheme again and not boast about the $50,000 - </para>

            <para>-To use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges&#39;</inline> own words, we have just heard from him a rubbery speech. It was rubbery because it stretched our credibility. He said a lot about unemployment. To listen to him, one would think that he did not understand what is causing unemployment. Indeed, to listen to the whole Opposition, one would think that it did not understand what is causing unemployment. Let me put it in one word. It is inflation. It is inflation resulting from actions of the Opposition when in Government. This Government has been trying desperately ever since it came to office to reduce that inflation. It is now getting on top of it, but it has taken a long toll. </para>

          <para class="block">If only the Opposition would appreciate that. High and rising wages and prices have caused businessmen to cut back, to protect themselves. They have adopted all sorts of labour-saving devices. They have reduced the number of fulltime employees, used part-time employees where necessary, and not replaced or have retrenched employees. We cannot blame the businesmen for adopting this attitude. It is up to them to maintain the profitability of their organisations, and this is how they have had to do it. At one time one would have wondered whether members of the Opposition had ever spoken to any of these businessmen. I now believe that honourable senators opposite know what they are doing. They propose massive increases in government expenditure. They know the consequence of that would be further inflation.

              <para>-I will tell the honourable senator how it is causing trouble to the beef producers. It is stopping the sale overseas of live carcasses. I refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Primary Industry Survey</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr H.</inline> S. Conkey, Managing Director of Conkey and Sons Ltd. He gives some figures on the effect of loss of production in his company caused by strikes and work restrictions on the slaughter floor during the 12 months ended December 1976. He discloses that the number of cattle and sheep submitted for slaughter and the actual kill were very substantially less and that as a consequence the slaughtermen lost approximately $3,135 each in wages and the labourers on the slaughter floor each lost $3,477 in wages. That is the sort of action that this industry is involved in. In addition <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Conkey</inline> assures us in the article that had his company been sure that all livestock submitted would be killed it would have employed at least 100 additional people. Can anyone say that the officials in that union do not have a vested interest in unemployment? I say to the Senate that these people are interested only in chaos and anarchy. Unemployment forms one of their main planks. </para>

          <para>The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> has referred to some of the Government&#39;s initiatives. In particular I refer to the initiative whereby unemployment benefits have been indexed. This is a very substantial benefit granted by the Government. </para>
          <para>The Budget produced last night is a good Budget. It is sound; it is sensible. It offers initiatives to people who are prepared to work, but at the same time it attacks inflation, it cuts back the deficit, it reduces the Government&#39;s own expenditure and certainly it will lead to a recovery in the economy. It is the recovery in the economy which is important to job creation. The creation of jobs will come from an economic recovery whereby the business community will be able to expand and work will become available. That is the object of this Government. It is a perfectly good object and a sound object. In the light of these comments, I move: </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">On the second occasion in the space of 12 months, it is my privilege to rise and present to the Senate a far reaching and searching report on the important issues affecting my people- the Aborigines of Australia. It is indeed a pleasure, as the lone Aboriginal Federal member of Parliament to table before honourable senators the report of the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights- a committee which I had the honour to chair for most of its inquiries and deliberations. </para>
          <para>Whilst I present this report, which is that of the majority of&#34; the Committee, and naturally I am bound by it- I feel that I would be remiss and failing in my duty towards my people if I did not express my disappointment that the Government saw fit to abdicate its total responsibility to the Aboriginal people and to condone the proposed introduction of complementary legislation dealing with Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I say that the Government has avoided an area of responsibility given to it by the people of Australia in the referendum of 1 967. This is my sole criticism of an otherwise long, arduous and fruitful inquiry into a question which has vexed my people for nigh on 200 years- that is, the ownership of their traditional lands. </para>
          <para>An Aborigine&#39;s affinity with the land has no comparable conception to the white Australians, who look upon land in a materialistic manneras something to be enjoyed to the exclusion of others, to be guarded against and walled off from all others and to be viewed purely as an item of social wealth and standing within the community. The British concept, that a man&#39;s home is his castle and no man dare take it from him, is in complete contrast, I believe, to the meaning which my people have always had concerning their beloved earth. Land, to the Aborigine, is the whole of his being, the place of the spirits, the churches and the home and source of life itself. It is the place where human spirits dwell before birth and after death. Ultimately it is the extension of our souls. </para>
          <para>I feel that all members of the Committee were affected and moved by this strange and mystical love of my people for their land. As the hearings progressed they too became more aware of the uniqueness and fierceness of this great love that my people have for their land. After it was established in December 1976, the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory held 1 1 days of public hearings- eight in the Northern Territory and three in Canberra. Evidence was taken from 65 persons. Towards the end of the inquiry the Committee divided into sub-committees for visits to 16 Aboriginal communities for discussions with Aboriginal leaders on the subject matter of the inquiry. </para>
          <para>In clause (A) of its terms of reference the Committee was requested to examine and report on the provisions of the Land Rights Act relating to the identification of traditional owners of Aboriginal land and the means of establishing the views of Aboriginal traditional owners to the satisfaction of the relevant land councils. </para>
          <para>I deal now with the identification of traditional owners. Evidence put to the Committee indicated that tribal people generally knew who were the traditional owners of the land and that disputes about ownership of land were rare indeed. Because of this and other evidence placed before it, the Committee concluded that the methods adopted to date by both land councils are appropriate in order to identify the Aboriginal traditional owners. However, both land councils expressed concern at the pressure by various interests to identify traditional owners. The Committee believes that as a result of this pressure there is a risk that identification may not be as thorough as is considered necessary. The Committee stresses that part of the Government&#39;s on-going responsibility is to ensure that the land councils and the agencies involved in the identification process have adequate time and resources to carry out the necessary procedures for identification. </para>
          <para>The Committee concluded that generally the procedures of consultation with traditional owners adopted by the land councils are appropriate. However, the Committee found that in some instances the communication of land council decisions was ineffective, particularly where a delegate may not have the necessary clarity of explanation. The Committee considers that trained Aboriginal officers of the land councils should be made available to explain any intended action of the councils to Aboriginal groups or to traditional owners. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the Northern Territory legislation. In clause (B) of its terms of reference the Committee was requested to report on the adequacy of provisions of the law of the Northern Territory relating to entry to Aboriginal land, the protection of sites of significance, wildlife conservation and entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land. Under the Land Rights Act the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory is empowered to make ordinances in respect of these matters, hence the reciprocal legislation. In accordance with this power the Aboriginal Lands and Sacred Sites Bill was introduced into the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 3 March 1977. This Bill which relates to the protection of sites of significance, entry to Aboriginal land and entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land, lapsed on the dissolution of the previous Assembly. The wildlife conservation aspect is covered in the Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Ordinance which was assented to on 26 May 1977. </para>
          <para>The Committee considers that the main deficiency in the Aboriginal Lands and Sacred Sites Bill was that the role of the Land Councils was reduced and as such did not accord with Federal Government policy. The Committee also considers that some of the provisions of the Bill were complex and confusing and could lead to uncertainty and delay in administration and enforcement. Many problems associated with the reciprocal legislation would have been overcome if close and meaningful consultation had been undertaken in the first instance by all parties concerned and because of this the Committee has concluded that such consultation should take place before the reciprocal legislation is reintroduced into the new Assembly. </para>
          <para>The Committee believes that in relation to entry to Aboriginal land the Northern Territory legislation should contain the following provisions: Power to delegate by the Land Councils; permits to include conditions laid down by traditional owners; conditions to include that a person should leave the land if requested by the traditional owners; power to revoke permit with penalty for non-compliance; the right for a community occupying land not occupied by the traditional owners to issue permits to allow visits to that community; the traditional owner to have power to delegate; the traditional owner to give permission to enter his land in circumstances where it is not practicable to obtain permits from a Land Council; and that officials, politicians and police should notify in advance their intention to enter Aboriginal land. </para>
          <para>In respect of sacred sites the Committee believes that the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act should be examined and where appropriate its provisions adopted. In particular any legislation should make provision for the initiative for the protection of sacred sites to rest with the Aboriginals themselves. A statutory authority with Land Council representation should be established and be responsible for coordination of requests for protection, the initiation of prosecution and establishing the most appropriate method of protection in each circumstance. Sign posting and fencing should be avoided where possible. Is should be mandatory for prior adequate consultation to be held between organisations and individuals and the relevant Land Council. If there is any proposed activity that requires earth works or clearing the maximum penalty for desecration should be imposed and the onus of proof to establish that the desecration was not wilful should rest with the defendant. </para>
          <para>In relation to wildlife conservation, while the Committee concludes that the provisions of the Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Ordinance are generally adequate some amendments are needed to make provision for the Wildlife Commission to negotiate and conclude agreements with the relevant Land Councils to protect fauna and to ensure that Aboriginals have a right to kill wildlife for food and ceremonial purposes in cases where there is no agreement with the Commission. </para>
          <para>In respect of entry to seas adjacent to Aboriginal land, the strong views expressed to the Committee give credence to the suggestion that control of the seas by Aboriginals could give rise to ill feelings between the Aboriginal and nonAboriginal communities. As far as nonAborigines were concerned there was ample evidence that there was substantial recreational use of the waters in the large centres of nonAboriginal population, such as Gove. Barramundi fishing is taking place within 2 kilometres of Aboriginal land or land under Aboriginal claim. The Committee notes that the Land Rights Act was drawn up so as to preserve existing rights. The provisions relating to mining are the most obvious example of this. The Committee is aware of the strong desire by Aboriginals to obtain rights over the 2 kilometres area. These expectations were raised in the Aboriginal community following recommendations by the </para>
          <para class="block">Woodward Commission. The Committee believes that the non-fulfilment of these expectations could also have serious repercussions. The Committee is of the view that sacred sites within the sea should be protected. The Committee has endeavoured to formulate a proposal which takes account of the various points of view presented to it and the needs of the whole community. It therefore proposes that Northern Territory legislation should make provision for the following: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">

The report accordingly recommends that the Parliament establish a committee to inquire further into the operation of the Lands Rights Act. In conclusion I should like to make some brief comments on the dissenting report by the honourable Gordon Bryant and the honourable Les Johnson. I refer specifically to paragraph 8 of that dissenting report and I will read it if I may. It reads: </para>

            <para>- I support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> proposing that the Senate take note of the report of the Joint Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory. I apologise for my inability to express in flowery langauge the mythology surrounding the belief of Aborigines that land is an extension of their soul. I am not capable of using the phraseology which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> used but I do recognise that to Aborigines land has a greater significance than its commercial value has to Europeans. I support the criticism contained in the dissenting report relating to the report not being seen. I do not think that it was ever the intention of those who put their names to the dissenting report to imply that this was the fault of the officers of the Committee. Although I have not seen a copy of the report I accept as a result of my confidence in the officers of the Committee that it is in accordance with what was decided at the final meeting of the Committee. However, as I have been informed only on the telephone of the contents of the dissenting report, I question my ability to comment on it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The reasons for dissent as expressed in the dissenting report were the result of many factors. Firstly, there was a time limit placed on the presentation of the Committee&#39;s report. Secondly, the Committee&#39;s work was interrupted by the prorogation of Parliament to enable the Queen to open the new season of the Parliament and the Committee had to be re-appointed. Thirdly, because the reference given to the Committee was so wide, it was thought advisable for the Committee to visit Aboriginal communities. This necessitated touring to the remote corners of the Northern Territory. For a long time now following my initiation into the committee system, I have been concerned about committees of the Senate. I have spent a lot of time serving on them. I have done my best to assist in the preparation of reports. But I find that, although the reports contains so many recommendations, that is the end of the matter. No one then takes any notice of the report. This was the case with the report of the Senate Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. This was also the case with the report on Aborigines in the southwest of Western Australia. That report contained some 35 recommendations. We cannot point to one of those recommendations having been implemented by the Government. I have often been inclined to wonder whether the appointment of committees has not been for the purpose of excusing the Government for not doing something about a very important issue. </para>
          <para>This was my first experience as a member of a joint committee of both Houses. It will be my last experience. I found that members of the other House are so busy- that is realistically the positionthat although this Committee comprised 14 members and senators the Committee had to divide itself into sub-committees in order constitutionally to hold meetings because it was rarely that we could get a quorum to enable a meeting of the full Committee. I do not think that this is good enough when dealing with questions concerning the Aboriginal people. The matter before the Committee was an important one. The Committee met finally for 2 days in Canberra for the purpose of finalising its report. It had before it a suggested report from the  Chairman.  After consideration of that report by the whole Committee, the report was changed so much that no one could keep track of what was to appear in the final report. I still do not know, although I was a member of the Committee, what the final report says. However, I accept what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> has said about the findings of the Committee being accurately stated in the report. </para>
          <para>During the course of finalising the report, two members of the Committee indicated that they wanted to submit a dissenting report. One member wished to express some criticism, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> has done today, of the Government for not accepting its responsibility. Instead of legislating on the whole question of land rights in accordance with the powers which the referendum gave it, this Federal Government is handing some of this responsibility to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. It was pointed out that the ambit of the Committee was restricted and that the Act provided that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly should enact supplementary legislation in respect of four questions. The Committee had the power to determine only whether the legislation of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was sufficient to meet the intentions of the Aboriginal </para>
          <para class="block">Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill. That was a view which was to be placed in the dissenting report but from what I am told I believe that it does not appear. </para>
          <para>The other matter referred to in the dissenting report is the strong belief that Aborigines should have control over seas adjoining Aboriginal land for a distance of 2 kilometres. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> has said, this was an expectation following the Woodward Commission report. The Aboriginal Land Council had submitted proposals to the Woodward Commission for control over seas adjoining Aboriginal land for a distance of 10 miles. The Commission rejected the claim saying that it could not close the seas to that extent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward thought that there was some justification for a buffer zone in order to ensure privacy for Aboriginal land. The decision on the area of the zone had to be arbitrary. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward selected 2 kilometres. A belief built up in the minds of Aboriginals that they had, and should have, an entitlement to a 2 kilometre zone. </para>
          <para>The Committee discussed this matter and took a vote on whether it should be 2 kilometres. The Committee comprised one more member from the Government parties than from the Opposition party. The Opposition members who were present at that meeting voted for 2 kilometres. That was in accordance with Australian Labor Party policy which was re-affirmed in Perth recently. Therefore, excluding one member, 50 per cent of the Committee membership was somewhat committed to that proposal. In addition there was one member of the Committee from the Government parties who also supported the proposal. So, although there is a dissenting report signed by two members of the Committee saying that there is justification for granting a 2 kilometre zone to the Aborigines, the impression given is misleading because, if there had been full attendance at that Committee meeting, that would have been the majority decision. </para>

              <para>-I have tried to point out that it is nearly impossible for members who are overloaded with work to attend meetings. I would say that there have been occasions when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> has considered the winning of an election in Western Australia more important than Aborigines in the Northern Territory, so I would not be too critical of those who did not attend meetings. I point this out because the Minister could be misled in the belief that with the exception of 2 members the Committee was strongly of the opinion that there should be a 2 kilometre restriction. It is not a fact. The fact is that it is the opinion of the Committee as a whole that it should be 2 kilometres. After the resolution was put and defeated it then became a question of what was best for the purposes of the Aboriginal community and the community of the Northern Territory as a whole. I was a member of a sub-committee which assisted in the actual writing up of the alternative. After being a party to the final words I felt that I could not be a party to the dissenting report. Therefore, my name does not appear on the report. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There are a few points I want to make. The Act places great importance on the Land Councils of the Northern Territory, that is, the two appointed or any future land councils to be appointed. As the Land Councils have the responsibility under section 24 of the Act to compile and maintain a register of the names of persons who, in the opinion of the Council, are traditional owners, they must have a map of the sites. Members of the Committee went to a meeting of the Land Council and to a meeting of the traditional owners from Arnhem Land which was held in Batchelor. Subsequently, we went to the settlements and interviewed the Aboriginal people. The thing that is noticeable is that when tribal Aborigines are in their setting or are together, each one knows who has responsibility for each area of land. There is no dispute over it. Despite the fact that the Land Council employs linguists and anthropologists to go into the question of mapping and of interpreting who has responsibility for areas of land, this information can be found out on any occasion. The Aborigines know who owns the land. </para>
          <para>The Commissioner also has the responsibility, under section 15 of the Act, to ascertain whether the Aborigines making the application or any other Aborigines are the traditional owners. He must be certain when an application is made that it is made by the traditional owners. He must possibly be more certain than the Land Council. The Land Council&#39;s job of identifying traditional owners is easy in that traditional owners know who they are. Tribal Aborigines do not lie. When this was pointed out to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Ward, who was the tentative Commissioner, he said: &#39;Yes, I agree with that. You can accept their word. They simply do not lie.&#39; Despite the fact that the Commissioner will decide who are the traditional owners on the evidence presented, our system of decision-making requires a whole string of academics. The European legal system necessitates bringing into the field academics for the purpose of convincing the Commissioner that the claim is justified. It is an unfortunate aspect which brings up the whole question of the Land Councils being inundated at the present time with land claims. There is some novelty about , the Land Council which the tribal Aborigines do not fully understand. There is insufficient contact between the two. Whilst the Land Council can be excused at the present time for not having more contact with the tribal Aborigines in the field, it is more qualified than any other section, as it has trained field personnel, who could be Aborigines, for the purpose of going out and explaining the operations of the Land Council and getting the opinion of the tribal people. </para>
          <para>With the present staff ceilings and the number of claims that they must process at the moment, the personnel of the Land Council is insufficient. Surprisingly, while an amount of $171,000 was made available in last year&#39;s Budget to support the Land Council, there is nothing in the 1 977-78 Budget for this purpose. It is an impossible position in that whilst there is a committee to investigate what is necessary in this area, the Budget gives no assistance to Land Councils. It is true that with mineral royalties Land Councils would at some time be self supporting and not in need of Government financial assistance. But that situation has not occurred. It must be remembered that the Land Council has only some rights to royalties on Aboriginal land. Despite the fact that the Act designates some land as Aboriginal land, Aboriginal land is defined in the Act as that land to which the Minister has appointed a land trust for the purpose of administration. As the Minister has appointed no land trust, or had not done so until our last hearing, there is at present no Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. Therefore, there is no income from that source to the Land Council. </para>
          <para>There is no provision in the present Budget to allow the Land Council to continue to do the work it was doing or to increase the work it was doing. I refer here to the method of identification which members of the Committee thought was quite easy and was being done capably and properly. Aboriginal Land Councils, which seem to have control over Aboriginal land under the Act, cannot do anything on Aboriginal land unless they have discussed it with the residents of the land and are fully convinced that the Aborigines concerned realise what they are talking about. They cannot do anything unless they have the approval and permission of the traditional owners. They must do two things. They must have discussions with the residents and they must have approval from the traditional owners. They must know who the traditional owners are and they must have a method of communication. It is important that the costly operation of discussions between traditional owners and the Land Councils continue. It is ridiculous at this time for personnel limitations to be placed upon the Council. This Government is not doing what it says it is doing for the Aborigines in the granting of land. It is putting many impediments in the way of giving effect to its promise of land rights. It must be remembered that this refers only to Aborigines who have a claim to unalienated Crown land and not private land. The Commissioner must report claims for private land and the Minister will decide on this matter in future legislation. </para>
          <para>The Committee had to decide whether the legislation of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was sufficient with regard to the right of entry on Aboriginal lands, the protection of sites of significance, wildlife conservation and the entry onto seas adjoining the Aboriginal land. Our inquiry was concerned with whether the legislation was adequate as it was legislation that had been passed as many ordinances many years ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Letts,</inline> the majority leader of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly- I believe he is now unemployed- on that occasion agreed that the existing Act was unacceptable in any direction. But after our first conference with him he introduced legislation to cover the four points in the form of a Bill before the Assembly which would become an ordinance. I think he was badly advised in regard to the presentation of the Bill. It was widely criticised by most sections of the Northern Territory and particularly by the Aboriginal community. It has no meritorious clauses in it and was the subject of strong condemnation by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who gave evidence before the Committee. </para>
          <para>There has been some suggestion that promises to confer with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs were not fulfilled and the legislation was passed without the Department of Aboriginal Affairs being a party to consultations on it. </para>

              <para>- Well, I take it that it was the fault of that now unemployed man in the Northern Territory. The evidence was so strong that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Letts</inline> admitted under cross-examination that there were vital mistakes in the legislation and therefore vital amendments would have to be made. The amendments could not be made before he felt that it was essential to go to the people in an election for the Northern Territory. What those amendments were to be and whether they would meet the requirements of the Act I do not know, but they are not before the Assembly. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Letts</inline> is no longer there for the purpose of introducing his amendments. As a result of the election, there is now the possibility of a majority group in the Assembly who will be more sympathetic to the Aboriginals&#39; claims than was the previous group which was in control of the Assembly. So that dismisses all the legislation in regard to Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Committee, as indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> has suggested proposals with regard to Northern Territory legislation. If we have Aboriginal ownership of land, then one who should be entitled to go onto the land or the one who should be entitled to give permission to go onto the land must be the owner and must be a traditional Aboriginal. By the very nature of the size of Aboriginal land, the granting of permission to a person, before he leaves the city of Darwin or Alice Springs, to enter Aboriginal land should be delegated to the Aboriginal Land Council. That was acceptable to the Aboriginal communities. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Letts</inline> had some system in regard to authorising an Aboriginal as the authority. As to what are sites of significance brings up difficulties insofar as some sites of significance in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory are so secret and so sacred that the Aboriginals do not want anyone to know of their whereabouts. That means that they cannot agree with the registration of certain sites; they cannot agree to putting up a notice that trespass is prohibited; they cannot agree to putting up a warning to indicate that the land is a sacred site. Therefore, possibly the less said about a sacred site, the better. </para>
          <para>The greatest desecration of sites has been carried out by government activity. A bulldozer might be used to get a road through or to start a pine forest or something else. Sites are also being desecrated by tourists. It is thought that those sites which are threatened with desecration should be listed and should be protected by signs or fences or by some other method. Such sites play a part in their ceremonies and their family life. Certain members of the tribe have a responsibility for protecting the sacred sites of the area. That tribal member should be acknowledged as the one with the responsibility to look after certain areas and the authority to order anyone out. </para>
          <para>I return to the control of entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land. I think it is very unfortunate that the two kilometres of the sea area adjacent to the land will not be available to Aboriginals. The evidence suggests that it was never intended that if Aboriginals had control of the two kilometres adjoining their coast that area would be closed to white man&#39;s interests, but that permission would have to be given by the Aboriginal community as to what white men would be allowed entry and for what purpose. We were defeated on that question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner&#39;s</inline> report has recommended that provision be made for the right of Aboriginals to full use of the sea adjoining their land. If that is accepted, no ordinance of the Northern Territory or action of government can deny them the right to the use of that area. If others are using it and have the right to use it for sport and fishing, then that right has to be considered by the Commissioner, in consultation, if there is an objection to Aboriginals using it. The other point which I think is important is where someone already has a right to commercial fishing in the seas adjoining Aboriginal land. The opinion of the majority of the Committee is that they should not have to sacrifice this commercial right- a right which they already have- but that Aboriginals should have a say in the granting of new licences and whether restrictions should be placed on fishing in that particular area. This is the final decision of the Committee. </para>
          <para>I wish to pay a tribute to the Committee. Although perhaps I said some harsh things about members of the Committee at times, I think they worked well. I think they wanted to do the best possible for the Aboriginal community. I pay tribute to the dedication and work of the secretarial staff. I pay particular tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> and his capabilities as  Chairman  and the manner in which he conducted the hearings. Although we had some pulling into line at times, I think everyone enjoyed the exercise under his direction and chairmanship. It was an experience. I only make the plea that this report be not treated as previous reports in that it be thought that the Committee has finished its job and that is to be the end of the matter. I did not support the proposal for the establishment of a permanent committee because I think the Minister would have a responsibility to take notice of the Committee and to police the implementation of the decisions of the Committee. He should not have a committee continually looking over his shoulder. Nevertheless, that was a decision of the majority of the Committee. I go along with and give my endorsement to the report. </para>

            <para>-Unfortunately the program for tonight does not permit us to prolong this debate very much. I want to touch on a couple of points before we close the debate this evening. I refer to the matters raised principally by the previous <inline font-weight="bold">speaker, Senator Cavanagh.</inline> The happy thing, I suppose, is that I agree with his concluding remarks. I join with him in thanking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neville</inline> Bonner for his chairmanship of the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory and in thanking the Committee Secretariat for its contribution. The couple of points I want to mention before seeking leave to continue my remarks at a later stage are as follows: Firstly, I mention the query about the involvement of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The Government decided to allow certain aspects of this legislation to be dealt with by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I for one still believe that that was a sensible decision. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The operation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 has to be looked at in the context of an Act which will have a very considerable effect on all people who live in the Northern Territory. There are obviously some very strong views about the operation of that Act in the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities in that Territory. I think the evidence which was brought before the Committee and which showed the very strong views that are held will have a very useful effect within the Northern Territory community. The views have had an airing. The Committee has been able to take them into account. The Assembly itself has had a most valuable exercise in producing a Bill which initially was laid before the Assembly but which the Majority Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Goff</inline> Letts, now agrees was deficient in a number of particulars. The Assembly has been involved in a way which will enable it to make a substantial contribution to the operation of Aboriginal lands in Australia. </para>
          <para>The second point is that the Committee itself has been questioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> I think the value of the Committee has been proved. If we look at the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Letts</inline> we see that he, in the process of this inquiry and the other representations that he has received, has been brought to a different point of view about the way the legislation ought to be framed. I think that fact in itself demonstrates the value of the exercise that has been sponsored by this Parliament. It has resulted in a degree of dialogue between the national Parliament and the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly- a degree of dialogue that I think was necessary. I think this contributes to a better understanding between the two parliaments and to a better understanding in both parliaments of the problems involved in the Act. </para>
          <para>The last point I make relates to the 2-kilometre limit on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> touched. He expressed some dissatisfaction with the finding and talked about the voting in the Committee. I simply say to the Senate that this was an area where it was not possible to meet the competing wishes and requirements of the different people who came before the Committee. In fact, the Committee was faced with totally inconsistent demands. On the part of Aborigines there was a request for a 2 -kilometre area of the sea right round Aboriginal land. That request had been founded, I think, on the view put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward who considered the original request for a much wider area of the sea. I accept that a large section of the Aboriginal community had come to expect that they would receive 2 kilometres of the sea as part of their Aboriginal lands. This is a very serious matter and something at which the Committee had to look very carefully. </para>
          <para>On the other hand the Committee also had to look at the quite obvious community expectation that the right of access to the sea which is enjoyed by Australians everywhere else in Australia should be enjoyed in the Northern Territory as it has been in the past. There was considerable weight of evidence from the nonAboriginal community that people had this expectation that they would be able to enjoy the sea in the way that other Australians do. These people made it quite clear that they regarded this matter as an important part of their ability to lead an enjoyable life in the Northern Territory. The recreational values of the seas were very important to them. I do not believe that a decision to close off what was nearly 80 per cent of the Northern Territory coastline could have been taken without very serious repercussions within the total community of the Northern Territory. So the Committee was faced with a situation where it simply could not meet the competing demands that were placed before it. </para>
          <para>I hope that the recommendations we put forward will provide a helpful guide to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in reaching a solution which, firstly, will guarantee to the Aborigines the traditional access that they have had to the seas and which the Commonwealth Act requires should be preserved to them; secondly, will enable the protection of areas which are of special significance, be they sacred sites or areas close to significant Aboriginal communities; and at the same time will result in a preservation of what I would call the normal Australian recreational rights to use the sea for the total community. I think that the Committee, faced with a very difficult choice, has done the best it could to achieve a compromise solution which meets the basic needs of the whole community in the Northern Territory. The matters dealt with in the report are complicated and long. As I say, there are other matters before the Senate tonight which ought to be dealt with. I now seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

              <para>- I want to be as helpful and as courteous as I can. This matter has launched into general debate. No notice was given of succeeding speakers. There is no list of speakers. Nobody has any idea what the report is all about. We have launched into the jetstream without any knowledge of what we are engaged in. Whilst there is a great amount of concern and a great amount of hope to understand, it does not help many of us very much if what we have is a series of incidental remarks which nobody knew would be launched upon us. </para>

              <para>- It is not rubbish, it is truthful. Tonight we have a debate on one of the most important reports that could come before this Parliament. The Government is trying to bog down debate on the report because the Government does not want it discussed. Earlier tonight an arrangement was made that there would be one speaker for each side. I did not propose to comment, except to ask respectfully that the report be brought on for debate at the earliest possible time. </para>

              <para>- I raise a point of order. A point of order can be taken only if the rules or the Standing Orders are broken and someone is out of order. An honourable senator cannot raise a point of order for the purpose of discussing an arrangement. Whatever the arrangement was, the question is whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> should be given five minutes to speak to the subject. He has not been given time to speak. He has taken the only alternative available to him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton&#39;s</inline> point of order has no substance because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is not in breach of the Standing Orders. That is the basis on which a point of order can be taken. So there is no substance in the point of order. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps I might continue as I began, in the hope that we might be able to get a little clarity and a little understanding. I referred to what I was informed was the arrangement between both sides. It either was or was not an arrangement. It seems to me to be an arrangement. To get the Business of the Senate in the hands of the Government, procedures have been taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> can speak now if he wishes. Of course he can. I still want to clear up his point that he had not been fairly treated or that some Standing Order had been breached. That was not the case as presented to me. </para>

              <para>- In view of the Minister&#39;s remarks, I think I ought to clarify the position before I continue with my contribution to the debate on the amendment to the motion moved by the Minister. He would clearly recall that there were three speakers on that side of the House to one speaker on this side df the House. That is a negation of democracy. </para>

              <para>- You are the chief clown, so that fits you too. A statement was then made by the Government Whip, and he was followed by the Minister. So that makes three speakers on the Government side when in fact there was one on the Opposition side. Thousands of dollars have been spent on setting up the Committee, on the travel involved and on the publication of the report itself. This is the first time in history that a Senate select committee has introduced a report that does not exist. No member of the Committee, certainly those on the Labor side of the House, has a copy of the report. We heard what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> said tonight. He never properly saw the final draft. Other Labor members of the Committee tell me they never saw the final draft at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> who headed the Committee, is suppressing information that ought to be available to all members of the Committee. I am amazed and ashamed that such a thing should happen. </para>

It probably means that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> has not seen it. If the Minister has not seen it it is a dereliction of duty on behalf of the Government members of the Committee. </para>

To my knowledge, the report in question has not been circulated to each and every member of this Senate. I stand to be corrected, but I have not received a copy. To my knowledge the report has not been presented to the Senate in the normal, regular way. I genuinely believe that the procedure this evening is highly irregular. It is inconsistent with the custom and practice of this Senate, and the debate is completely out of order. I ask you to rule that way. With respect, if you do not, it will mean that at any time a  chairman  of a committee may ask the  Clerk  to place on the business paper notice of his intention to submit a report on behalf of the committee when the committee may or may not have agreed to the substance of the report. I repeat that, as I understand it, so long as I have been in this Senate, which is just on 8 years, I have never known there to be a debate on a report from a committee when the Senate has not had the committee&#39;s report before it. Therefore I honestly, sincerely and genuinely submit that this is completely out of order. </para>

              <para>-The Minister is starting to see reason. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I have tried to stick to the line of argument that the Government is reluctant to discuss this report. First of all, it was most reluctant to distribute it. There was a surreptitious distribution of the report after the Senate commenced sitting tonight. That is not good enough. It is totally inconsistent with all past customs and procedures of this Parliament. When I was rudely interrupted by points of order I was wanting to point out that when the Hay report, which I consider to be a pretty fair report, was compiled it was deliberately held up by the Government for two months. It was leaked to the newspapers first, particularly the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> so that the Government could create an atmosphere in which it could slash spending on Aboriginal affairs in the Budget 12 months ago. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Government is playing the same game with this report, apparently. It did not want it exposed to public scrutiny until it got this Budget out of the road in which the Government again has slashed spending on Aboriginal affairs. The Hay report was so desired by people that, when it was known that I had a copy of it- I am not saying how I got it; I did not steal it; as a matter of fact it was given to me by a member of the Liberal Party-two other members of the Liberal Party offered me two secret reports of the Government in exchange for one Hay report. That is how worried they were about it. When the Hiatt report was brought out it also was suppressed and the recommendations which should have been adopted by this Government were not adopted. Because there was insufficient time the Hiatt report was not properly debated in this Parliament. In fact debate was suppressed on that occasion too, even though the Opposition asked for a full, wide-ranging debate on the Hiatt report. </para>
          <para>The Government suppressed the report because it did not intend to adopt the recommendations, particularly in relation to the National Aboriginal Conference. Today the NAC is organised on the basis of the boundaries of the Department&#39;s administrative areas. All tribal affiliations have been abolished. The Government has done the wrong thing by every Aboriginal in this country, whether he be urban or tribal. The Government is hoping to get away with it. That is why the report was not produced tonight for discussion. That is why it was not given to members of this Parliament. The Government wanted to suppress the report and to have a nice tidy little debate, with one member from the Opposition side and three members from the Government side participating. The matter would never have been brought back again. I challenge the Government to bring on the debate on this document on the first Thursday night on which we have General Business. Let us have a free, open and democratic discussion on it. </para>

          <para class="block">The recent IAC draft report on textiles, clothing and footwear has heightened uncertainty in these industries to a degree which the Government considers unacceptable. Numerous requests have been made to the Government seeking clarification of the Government&#39;s attitude to these industries and an indication of the rules of the game so manufacturers can plan accordingly. Greater certainty about Government policies towards industry and economic prospects is essential if investment and employment are to be sustained. These industries have been subject to many difficulties and pressures over recent years. Imports have increased steadily, notwithstanding the application of short term measures of assistance. Employment has declined from about 167 000 in 1971 to less than 120 000 now. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s basic position is that it regards efficient textile, clothing and footwear sectors as important and continuing pans of Australia&#39;s manufacturing industry. The significance of these sectors in terms of employment and related social considerations is fully recognised. We are determined- as are other developed countries- to preserve an efficient industry, not necessarily with the present composition, but with an essentially permanent character. The Government will apply what it termed in the White Paper on Manufacturing Industry &#39;sectional policies&#39; to meet the special problems of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. Support will be provided for a defined period during which the industries concerned should make a real effort to improve their structure and efficiency and hence improve their long term outlook. Specifically, the Government will now: </para>

              <para>Ask the IAC to provide advice on the construction and implementation of a policy, in both its short term and long term aspects, which takes into account the Government&#39;s basic position which I have just referred to. In addition, the IAC will be asked to pay specific attention in its final report to the employment implications of its specific recommendations, including: </para>

          <para class="block">I wish to turn now to the level and allocation of quotas for textiles, clothing and footwear in the next quota period. In April this year, the Government announced it would extend the validity period of quota allocations for six months from January 1978 for footwear and brassieres and from March 1 978 for textiles and other clothing. We sought urgent advice from the IAC on the supplementary levels of quota for the additional six months periods. The IAC has advised that lower levels of quota for certain items appear necessary to sustain activity and employment in the local industry sectors concerned. The Government has accepted the IAC&#39;s recommendations. </para>
          <para>The Government has noted that the existing method of quota allocations, which is in general on an historical importing base in many cases dating back to 1973-74, has introduced rigidities into the quota allocation system. Accordingly the Government has decided to reserve 15 per cent of total quotas for cases involving anomalies. It has also decided that all quotas be made transferable and that for all quotas allocated on an historical basis, a moving base period will be used. Details of the supplementary quotas and the changed procedural arrangements will be announced in separate statements as soon as possible. </para>
          <para>The Government has considered the position of local firms who invested in off-shore production facilities prior to the introduction of quotas with the objective of placing a substantial part of the output from these facilities on the Australian market. Provision will be made within the quota reserve for such firms. Honourable senators will be aware that a number of such cases have occurred recently with respect to Australian operations in a number of developing countries. The Government&#39;s decision will assist the viability of these operations. Textiles, clothing and footwear form an important part of these countries&#39; exports to Australia. Trade in these products was an important element in the Prime Minister&#39;s talks with the five Association of South East Asian Nations leaders in Kuala Lumpur earlier this month. During those talks the ASEAN leaders expressed their strong wish to improve their trade with Australia. As the Prime Minister informed the House earlier, there has in fact been considerable growth over the past five years in ASEAN exports to Australia, even for sensitive items such as textiles, clothing and footwear. The balance of trade with Australia which has been of concern to ASEAN countries has moved relatively in ASEAN &#39;s favour during that period. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister was able to point out the considerable scope, even in present economic conditions, for increasing ASEAN &#39;s share of the Australian import market and announced measures which we hope will facilitate increased two-way trade between ASEAN and Australia. The ASEAN heads of government and the Prime Minister agreed that they should improve consultative mechanisms to promote further cooperation on mutual trade problems. Our trading partners appreciate the difficult economic problems which we face at the moment and accept that our ability to expand our imports will depend in an important way on economic recovery in Australia and the access which our own exports have in other markets. The Government&#39;s policy is directed towards achieving an appropriate balance between providing opportunities for our trading partners and sustaining activity and employment in the Australian textiles, clothing and footwear industries. </para>

            <para>- by leave- As the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> pointed out, he made the statement in the Senate this evening in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fife)</inline> and also in his own capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce. In the first sentence of his statement the Minister pointed out that the recent draft report of the Industries Assistance Commission- I emphasise the words draft report&#39;- on textiles, clothing and footwear has heightened uncertainty in these industries to a degree which the Government considers unacceptable. Speaking on behalf of my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Young,</inline> who is the Opposition&#39;s shadow Minister for business and consumer affairs, I recognise the problems that are inherent- particularly because of the economic situation that currently exists in Australia as a result of unemployment problems- when draft reports embodying proposals are presented by the IAC. Whilst draft reports might have been desirable a couple of years ago when the employment situation was not as acute as it is today in Australia, the simple fact of the matter is that the Government should now be looking at whether draft reports are desirable. It should also bear in mind that advisory councils have been established by the Minister. </para>
          <para>I have not attended meetings of the clothing and footwear advisory council but I have attended one or two of the other advisory councils that have been established by the Minister. For example, on behalf of the parliamentary Labor Party I have attended meetings of the industry advisory council that the Minister established for the printing industry. I have represented my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Young,</inline> at meetings of the industry advisory council that has been established within the purview of the Department of Industry and Commerce to examine the metal manufacturing industry. I believe that a lot of common sense is spoken around those tables by men who come from the employers&#39; section of the industry, men who come from the trade union section of the industry, men who come from the Department and men who are connected with, involved with or whose businesses are associated with the respective industries. I suggest to the Minister that members of the IAC could be invited to sit around those tables and listen to the points of view of the people whose businesses are affected and the points of view of the representatives of the workers involved in those industries whose jobs are affected. I think it is about time that the Government adopted that attitude and asked the IAC to adopt that attitude. </para>
          <para>In discussions that I have had with my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Young</inline> we agreed that in view of the high degree of unemployment that exists in these industries and the problems that are created by men and women being put out of work in these industries, there is little that the Government can do other than what it is doing. I strongly suggest to the Minister that he and his colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fife,</inline> should consider inviting the IAC to send observers to meetings of some of the manufacturing industry advisory councils- if that is the correct terminology- that the Minister has set up. </para>

As a representative of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party I have heard the views of employers, workers and trade union leaders in the printing industry and in the metal manufacturing industries. I view with scorn- if I may say sosome of the arguments that have been put forward by our friends opposite in debates on unemployment when I sit around a table at a meeting of that nature and see the great desire of men who employ workers and the workers in industry to solve the problems of the industry. </para>

              <para>-That is correct. I notice in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Time</inline> magazine of 1 5 August 1977-1 mention this by way of interpolation- that Italy has imposed curbs on Japanese motor cycles; Washington has signed accords whereby Taiwan and South Korea have promised to restrict their export of shoes to the United States; Japan now limits its sales of colour television sets in America; United States Steel and Zenith are suing the United States Government in an endeavour to force it to impose countervailing duties on imports of European steel and Japanese colour televisions on the grounds that rebates of value added tax in foreign countries constitute illegal export subsidies. So far the courts and the United States Treasury Department have sided with the 83 nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which holds that such tax rebates are not violations of international trade rules. </para>

              <para>-As my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne,</inline> says, &#39;Oh what a tangled web we weave&#39; when international agreements are thrown by the board. Some nations are practising protectionism; others are not practising protectionism; and Australia under this Government seems to be having- if I might say so with respect to the present Governmenttwo bob each way. This Government has to make up its mind about what attitude it will adopt. I recently visited the United States. The United States is blessed with a very large market of some 240 million people. Unfortunately, in this country we have a market of only some 13 million people. So far as textiles are concerned, the quality of the United States product is far superior and much cheaper than comparable products in Australia. </para>

          <para>Having made those remarks, again I say that because of the great employment difficulties that exist in the industry we realise that the Government has virtually no alternative other than to adopt the attitude that it has adopted but I suggest to the Minister that he should invite the IAC people to sit round the table with the othersemployers and employees- who are engaged on the manufacturing advisory councils and listen to the facts of life so far as the industry and the problems of the workers in Australia are concerned. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave- In October last year, I announced substantial increases across the board for 1977 in allowances for the ten student assistance schemes administered by my Department. The Government is continuing its policy of providing a comprehensive range of assistance to students to ensure that all are able to achieve their maximum potential and will not be prevented from doing so by a lack of financial support. Under the present Government the numbers of students assisted has grown and a record number is expected to be assisted in 1 978 as shown in the following table: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="074232197708174_48_0.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>Allowances</para>
        <para class="block">This growth in numbers, combined with increases in allowances for 1977, has resulted in a large increase in the funds allocated for direct assistance to students. In 1975-76 expenditure on student assistance was $ 154.9m. For 1976-77 expenditure increased to $ 186.9m. In considering allowances for 1978 the Government has had to balance economic restraint against its concern that students should not suffer hardship. Changes have therefore been directed to students whose needs were assessed to be the greatest. Those students who must live away from home to continue their education, those students who are self-supporting and those students who have the responsibility to support dependants are, in my view, most affected by rising costs. Allowances for these groups will be increased with effect from 1 January 1 978 at an additional cost for 1977-78 of $4.3m bringing the total appropriation for the financial year to $224.7m. </para>
        <para>The following increased rates will apply for 1978. Other allowances under the scheme will remain unchanged. </para>
        <para class="block">

        </para>
        <para class="block">Assistance for Isolated children </para>
        <para>The maximum rate of the additional boarding allowance is to be increased from $450 to $500 per annum for 1978. </para>
		<para>Aboriginal Secondary Grants</para>
        <para>The boarding allowance limits- the maximum amount reimbursed of the actual costs- will be increased for 1978 from $1,450 per annum to $ 1 ,600 per annum where the student is enrolled at a boarding school, from $28 per week to $30 per week for students in hostels and from $20 per week to $22 per week for students in private board. </para>
		<para>Postgraduate Awards</para>
        <para>In 1959 the Commonwealth for the first time offered competitive awards to students undertaking postgraduate research. From a modest beginning of 100 awards in that year the number has now grown each year until, in 1977, there is an estimated 2235 postgraduate students being assisted under three schemes. These schemes offer the original Postgraduate Research Awards, Postgraduate Course Awards which were first made in 1971, and Postgraduate Awards at Colleges of Advanced Education since 1974. For 1 978, 700 new awards will be offered for competition. This is a reduction of 100 on the number offered in 1977 and, because students offered awards in previous years are continuing their studies, will reduce the total number being assisted to an estimated 2130 in 1978. This desision, which brings the number of awards on offer to approximately the number made in 1974, has regard for the increasing supply of students with higher degree qualifications in recent years, a situation which justifies a small tapering of the scheme. </para>
		<para>Means Tests</para>
        <para>To ensure that maximum assistance is directed to the most needy, entitlements to benefits under most schemes are subject to means tests which are normally applied to the combined incomes of a student&#39;s parents in the previous financial year. Maximum benefits are payable where the combined parental income, less certain allowable deductions, such as for other dependents, is not more than an amount called the marginal adjusted family income, known as MAFI. Parental incomes in excess of the MAFI attract a reduced entitlement calculated by reducing the maximum allowance by $2.50 for each $10 by which the combined parental income exceeds the MAFI. To compensate for rises in incomes during the last financial year, the means tests will be relaxed to ensure that maximum benefits continue to be directed to those most in need. The MAFI for the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and related schemes and Additional Boarding Allowance under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme will be increased from $8200 to $8700 for 1978. Similarly the MAFI for the Secondary Allowances Scheme and the Special Supplementary Allowance under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme will be increased from $5 100 to $5800. </para>
		<para>Loans</para>
        <para>Last year the Government appointed a committee to examine the desirability and feasibility of introducing a system of loans for Australian post-secondary students either as a supplement to existing schemes or as a replacement in whole or in part for those schemes. The valuable report of the committee was tabled in Parliament on 2 June 1977. It recommended two interrelated loan schemes, one of relatively small loans administered mainly by educational institutions and one of larger loans administered jointly by educational institutions and financial institutions. Careful consideration has been given to the committee &#39;s recommendations and it has been decided that no action be taken at this time to implement a scheme of student loans. </para>
		<para>Business Colleges</para>
        <para>I have indicated the substantial additional expenditure which will be provided for student assistance in 1977-78. It is appropriate in this context to refer to the Government&#39;s decision to phase out the payment of a fees subsidy to a small number of private business colleges. Following the abolition of fees in tertiary institutions, including technical colleges, by the Whitlam Government, a few private business colleges attracted per capita grants. The colleges had to establish themselves as non-profit-making institutions and, subject to the normal means tests, students at the colleges were eligible for Tertiary Education Assistance Allowances. About one-half the students receive these allowances. </para>
        <para>For 1 976 my Government decided not to approve of the payment of fee subsidies to any additional colleges because of the escalating costs. Out of a total of more than 100 private business colleges currently in existence, only 1 8 attract the benefits. These 1 8 colleges have some 4000-odd students enrolled in courses approved for the fee subsidies involving a cost of $2.36m in 1977. The size of the per capita grant varies substantially between institutions. Most of these institutions, in addition to the subsidy, charge fees of as much as $600. One possible action for the Government would have been to include all private business colleges in the fees subsidy scheme. The costs of this action would have been very great. Not to do so, however, would be to continue an inequitable and discriminatory system of assistance. Since fee subsidies have been paid to some colleges more than 80 private business colleges have continued to operate and provide a useful service without Government assistance and I see no reason why these, and those which have received assistance to date, should not continue to do so and complement the parallel courses made available in government institutions. </para>
		<para>Migrant Education Program</para>
        <para>Additional funds are being provided in 1977-78 for the Adult Migrant Education Program. A sum of S9.663m is included in the appropriations for 1977-78, as compared with an expenditure of $8,959,645 in 1976-77. These funds will allow the Adult Migrant Education Program to be maintained in 1977-78 at a similar overall level of activity to that in 1976-77 and provide for an increase in the living allowances for adult migrants attending full time English language courses. The new rates of living allowances mean an increase of $9.15 a week for single students and $16.55 for a married student with a dependent spouse and bring the allowances to $45.15 and $76.55 a week respectively. The allowance for dependent children is increased from $7 to $7.50. These revised rates will apply from early November 1 977. </para>
        <para>The Adult Migrant Education Program offers a range of full time and part time courses and classes including evening continuation classes as well as radio, correspondence and television English language programs. Funds for migrant and multicultural education in schools are provided, in the main, through a component of the Schools Commission&#39;s General Recurrent Grants Program. An amount of $25.45 7m was provided to education authorities in the States in 1976-77 through that program. The Schools Commission is yet to recommend the level of funding for this purpose for 1978 although funds for 1977-78 will be sufficient to allow at least a similar level of activity nationally to that in 1976-77. In addition to the Schools Commission grants $560,000 is included in my Department&#39;s appropriations for the production and supply of special teaching and learning materials for primary schools with children from non-English speaking backgrounds and for special assistance in respect of refugee children. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- In the statement which has just been made, the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> has ranged over a number of subjects. I do not wish to speak at length on them because there are other matters to be dealt with tonight. In view of the statement which has been made, there are two or three matters on which I feel comment should be made. Firstly, with regard to student allowances, I believe that the increases quoted in the statement will affect only a very small proportion of students; that is, about 5 per cent. The great bulk of students will not be affected by these increases. I think it would be quite misleading to suggest that this increased assistance will have any notable impact on students in Australia. I also point out to the Senate that the last time the Minister made a statement in respect of student allowances the calculations in that paper showed that the number of students who would benefit under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme in 1976 would be 84 000, whereas in the present estimate that figure has been revised to 96 000. The estimate for 1977 was 9 1 000 and now we find that the revised estimate is 100 000. It is understandable that complete accuracy cannot be expected in making these judgments, but nevertheless there appears to be a very big discrepancy. Therefore one wonders just how accurately the Government can make its calculations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Of the other two matters I wish to refer to briefly, the first is the question of migrant education. I remind the Senate that despite the fact that the Minister states that the funds being provided this year compare favourably with those of last year- $9.6m is being appropriated this year as compared with $8.9m in the last Budget, which amounts to an increase in real terms of about zero- in the previous Budget, under the Labor Government, the amount was not in the area of $8m or $9m but was $2 1 .4m. I hope it is not forgotten that in the Budget last year this Government cut in half the allocation for the migrant education program. Comparisons between the amount allocated this year and that allocated last year may appear quite acceptable. </para>

              <para>-That fact did not escape me; I noted the inclusion of that reference by the Minister in the latter part of his statement. I suggest to him that that is not relevant because recurrent grants were involved previously under the Schools Commission. The fact remains that in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> last night the appropriation for migrants in the 1975-76 Budget appears as $2 1.4m. In the first Budget of the Liberal-National Country Party Government, that is in 1976-77, the allocation was halved to $ 10.3m. This year the Minister advises us that the allocation will be about the same figure. </para>

              <para>- If the Minister is getting upset at the facts I am presenting to the Senate, that is understandable, because he is getting upset, and has been for a long time, about this Government&#39;s performance in regard to education. The last time we debated this matter in the Senate he got terribly uptight because we explained the manner in which this Government had gone back on its commitment in the education field. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>That brings me to the last point I want to raise in this debate tonight. I am quite sure that we will have adequate opportunities to go through this matter in more detail as we proceed through the Budget session. It is another example of this Government&#39;s attitude towards education. I refer to the way in which the Government has dealt with independent business schools. This Minister published an article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> a few weeks ago in which he said that it is only a matter of logic that you support the non-government sector of the school system because that relieves the burden of the government run sector. That is a fairly logical argument. It is one which we support. It is one which we ourselves built into the education assistance program in this country through the establishment of the Schools Commission. Now I ask: Why is not the same principle adopted in respect to independent business schools? They themselves have provided a service through secretarial courses and courses of that nature over the past few years, assisted by a scheme that was introduced by the Labor Government to give them a measure of support. </para>

              <para>-I will pick up the Minister&#39;s interjection in a moment. The Labor Government believed they were worthy of support on the same principle, on the same basis, as we believed the non-government schools sections should get support. The Minister himself is on record as supporting that principle. Despite the fact that we introduced that scheme this Government quite arbitrarily, without even making an announcement about it, simply wrote to the principals of the various business colleges around Australia and said: &#39;The scheme is wiped as from now. You are finished; you are on your own.&#39; When we brought this scheme in they could get assistance only on the basis that they became non-profit making organisations. I understand that it is now legally impossible for them to change that legal position because of complications involving State laws. I am not in a position to authenticate that but I believe that all the information which has been sent to all members of parliament indicates that these business colleges are now locked into a position of nonprofit making organisations on the basis of the subsidy that the Labor Government decided to give them. Now all of a sudden this Government turns around and says: &#39;We are taking it from you. &#39; Those business colleges are left in an extremely difficult position. I do not know what the Government proposes to do. I do not know whether it is going to help them out in some way. Apparently it is not, because tonight the position is confirmed. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I shall close by referring to the interjection the Minister made a few moments ago, that is, that we intended to phase out the scheme. That is not true. What the Labor Government did say was that the 18 colleges affected would be the only ones assisted. Once the decision was made for them to become non-profit organisations, that was it. We did say that no further institutions would be assisted under the scheme. It is not true to say that the Labor Government intended to stop the subsidy because we introduced it only in our last 12 months in government. As I indicated initially, the statement reflects the general attitude of the Government towards education, that is, to freeze the funds and where possible to get out of as many financial commitments as possible. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>It was announced in the Budget Speech last evening that the Government is introducing new arrangements for the pricing and taxation of crude oil produced from presently known Australian fields. For several years I have been arguing that energy in Australia is unrealistically priced. The price of petrol here is less than half the price in countries like Japan, France and Italy. While consumers would welcome the continuation of this situation, the fact is that it cannot continue. The quadrupling of international oil prices in 1 973-74 ushered in a new and disturbing realisation of the essential role oil plays in the standard of living the world either enjoys or aspires to. Events since then have reinforced that realisation. </para>
          <para>Oil plays a key role in the transport on which the modern world depends. It is also the energy source for which we face the most critical shortages. President Carter&#39;s energy statement contained the estimate that on current trends, demand would overhaul supply some time around the mid-1980s. Nobody seriously questions this forecast. If this situation is permitted to occur, the market price for oil will be anyone&#39;s guess. Governments the world over must make every attempt to forestall such a demand-supply squeeze. They must take active steps to mitigate the effects or dearer oil- a certainty whether or not world demand outpaces availability. Oil supplies 45 per cent of the world &#39;s energy needs and 47 per cent of Australia&#39;s. It will remain for decades the most important energy source. It is at the heart of any country&#39;s energy policy. </para>
          <para>I am currently preparing a statement which will deal comprehensively with all forms of energy. That statement will be presented to the House as soon as practicable. The matters discussed in this present statement form an integral part of that forthcoming statement of energy policy. For Australia, our central energy policy objectives must be threefold. Firstly, we must encourage oil exploration and development. Secondly, we must encourage greater economies of energy usage and encourage people to use other fuels in preference to oil. Thirdly, we must foster a more intensive search for alternatives to oil. Each of these objectives requires the price to be increased. That is why I have constantly argued that we should move gradually and predictably towards higher oil prices. This approach allows us to avoid the large, abrupt, destabilising increases which would otherwise occur. </para>
          <para>Price is not the only instrument available to promote our policy. Clearly the Government can and will exhort consumers to reduce their usage of oil products in the national interest. But realistic pricing remains critical to the success of a policy. Energy saving measures like, for example, insulation of houses, need to become recognised money-saving propositions. Higher priced oil will also assist in bringing about the economic introduction of alternative energy technologies such as coal conversion and solar power. A higher price will raise the return on successful exploration. An improved return on investment provides a strengthened encouragement for exploration; moreover, we would expect that higher earnings by existing producers will be ploughed back into further exploration here in Australia. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> has given a general outline of the new arrangements. I will now describe in some additional detail the pricing, allocation, and levy arrangements, and deal briefly with the question of their likely impact. As already announced, the Government has decided to implement a scheme which will take the price of indigenous crude oil from presently known fields in the direction of import parity. This will be achieved through a uniform method of price determination. The new scheme will apply to each presently known field in Australia and will apply from midnight on 16 August 1977. Producers will receive the import parity price, determined by the Government every six months, for a specified part of their production. Import parity will be received for either the first six million barrels of oil produced from each field per annum- called the &#39;basic allowance&#39;- or a proportion of production per annum, rising over time according to a specified schedule, whichever is the greater in any particular case. The schedule is 10 per cent from 1 7 August 1 977 until the end of the present financial year, rising to 20 per cent for financial year 1978-79, 35 per cent for financial year 1979-80 and 50 per cent for financial year 1980-81. </para>
          <para>For all additional production from each field or new development, the producers will receive the price which was current up to the time of the introduction of the new arrangements. That is $2.33 per barrel in the case of the Bass Strait fields and $2.88 per barrel in the case of the Barrow Island fields. All production from the Moonie and Alton fields and other small fields will, in practice, receive import parity prices, as the output from these fields will be well below six million barrels per annum. </para>
          <para>The Government will review the position before June 1981 to decide the rate at which the further progression to full import parity for presently known fields should take place. Oil from fields discovered after 14 September 1975 will continue to receive full import parity. The present crude oil absorption policy, whereby all crude oil produced in Australia is required to be processed in Australian refineries, will be continued. Indigenous crude oil, with its high yield of light fractions, is ideally suited to the local market demand. The export of indigenous crude oil would therefore simply mean the exchange of our own oil for another, probably less suitable, imported oil. The existing embargo on exports of crude oil will therefore remain in force. The Government is, in any case, under an obligation to continue the present crude oil absorption policy and associated allocation arrangements until at least 1980. This is because most refineries have undertaken considerable plant investment on the basis of that policy and to prematurely abandon it or phase it out would arbitrarily disadvantage a substantial section of the oil refining industry. </para>
          <para>The import parity price will be set every six months by the Commonwealth Government. It will be calculated on the basis of the price of Arabian light oil at the nearest refinery port, adjusted to allow for an appropriate quality differential. This differential will take account of the suitability of indigenous crude oil for the local market. For the period until 3 1 December 1977, the import parity price will be set at $13 per barrel. Officers of the Department of National Resources will be having discussions with the oil industry in the near future to determine the precise basis on which the import parity price should be calculated in future periods. The new pricing arrangements give a consistent set of ground rules applicable to all present and future developments in existing fields. They will remove any apparent arbitrariness inherent in the previous method of price determination. The basic allowance will apply to the combined existing developments in each presently known field and to each substantial new development in such fields. The figure of six million barrels per annum has been selected to ensure that new developments will immediately receive import parity prices for all or most of their production. It will ensure, firstly, that different producers are treated equitably and, secondly, that adequate recognition is given to the fact that oil from the smaller fields is typically more costly to produce than oil from the larger fields. </para>
          <para>As already announced, the crude oil levy will be increased by $ 1 per barrel to $3 per barrel. The levy will be deducted from the price for import-parity oil, and added to the price for below-import-parity oil. In effect, therefore, producers will pay the levy on import-parity oil, and consumers will pay the levy on belowimportparity production. The likely effects on prices, company profits, and Government revenues of the new arrangements were mentioned in the Budget Speech. The new arrangements will increase the prices received by existing producers approximately as follows. For the remainder of 1977, the average price for all Bass Strait fields already in production, net of the crude oil levy, will be about $3.20 per barrel. For Barrow Island, the average price received will be about $6.60, and for Moonie the price received will be $10 per barrel. If world prices rise at 6 per cent per annum and no further changes are made in the levy arrangements, corresponding net prices by 1979-80 could be of the order of $6.20, $7.30 and $11.60 for Bass Strait, Barrow Island and Moonie respectively. </para>
          <para>The net prices in the early period would be somewhat lower than the prices which would have resulted from acceptance of the precise Industries Assistance Commission recommendations. The new arrangements will immediately increase the average price into Australian refineries of all oil including imports by approximately 25 per cent. While the actual extent of any petroleum product price increase will be a matter for the Prices Justification Tribunal, the resultant increase will probably be of the order of 2V4c per litre on the price of regular motor spirit. On this basis, the recommended price of regular motor spirit in Sydney would rise to approximately 19c per litre. </para>
          <para>The Government is, of course, most reluctant to increase the price of petroleum products to Australian consumers. But the option of maintaining indefinitely a low price for the bulk of Australian refinery feedstocks is simply no longer available to us. It needs to be recognised that the Australian consumer has been paying less than the real value of the petroleum he uses. Furthermore, over the phasing-in period he will continue to pay less than in most overseas countries. Compared to the new likely price of 19c per litre in Sydney, the French motorist pays 39c, the Japanese motorist pays 38c, the German, Swedish and British motorists all pay over 30c. Petrol prices in Australia remain considerably below the 25c per litre in New Zealand and are now at roughly the same level as Canadian prices. Only the United States among major Western countries has cheaper petrol than Australia and the thrust of  President  Carter&#39;s energy policy is to increase the price of oil products to American consumers. </para>
          <para>It must be recognised that our decision to move towards import parity pricing for known crude oil merely hastens the inevitable. In the next few years, production from the Bass Strait fields will begin to decline as those fields approach the end of their economic life. These fields comprise 90 per cent of present day Australian production. Hence oil produced overseas, imported at prevailing world prices, will account for an increasing proportion of the input to Australian refineries. Furthermore, should more oil be discovered in Australia, it is already established government policy that that oil will be priced at full import parity.The new arrangements will effectively increase the amount of oil available from presently known fields. There are over 400 million barrels of oil, or two years worth of consumption, locked up in fields and not economically extractable at current prices. Australia cannot afford to leave this oil in the ground. The basic allowance of 6 million barrels per annum of oil at import parity prices for each new development will provide an assurance that these reserves can be extracted. </para>
          <para>There are several considerations other than basic energy policy considerations which the Government has necessarily had to take into account when formulating its new policy. One is the Government&#39;s overriding aim of lowering the rate of inflation and raising the level of activity in the economy generally. There is a need also to avoid the significant dislocation which could be expected to follow as particular industries suffered large cost increases. It is for these reasons that the Government has decided to increase prices gradually rather than all at once. The new arrangements will result in very substantial increases in the profits of each of the current producers. For this reason the Government is considering the application of a resource tax to these profits. Accordingly the Government will be seeking early discussions with the relevant oil producing companies on these matters. Any decision on the future of the crude oil levy will be taken in the light of decisions on the resource tax. </para>
          <para>The Government considers that the new pricing arrangements represent the most appropriate way of bringing Australian oil prices to world levels. The new taxation arrangements will aim to achieve an appropriate division between producers in the form of net returns, and the Government- and hence the taxpayer- in the form of taxation revenue. Over the transitional period, the Australian consumer of petroleum products will, for some years, be able to pay prices based on crude oil prices below the price of imported crude. Many other countries in a less fortunate position than Australia have had to adjust to the hard reality of high oil prices very rapidly. Our own oil reserves will allow us to adjust gradually, and consequently at less cost in terms of disruption. But we must take advantage of the time these reserves have allowed us to adjust our oil consumption habits and to prepare substitutes for imported oil. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>- The statement is a crucial one at which the Opposition will be looking carefully. No doubt we will be given the opportunity to debate the subject matter. The consequences which flow from the statement and the decision of the. Government are serious. One would question the wisdom of introducing such measures at this stage. As a Queenslander, I view with alarm the cost increases which will flow from the decision. I do not share the confidence of the Government &#39;s spokesman that this decision will not be inflationary. It seems that the cost of petrol to the consumer will be raised considerably. In the rural and provincial areas of Queensland the cost is likely to be prohibitive. We understand the need to protect our reserves. We also understand the need at this stage to keep costs low. We accept the proposition that the Government has been putting from time to time about the need to cut back the rate of inflation. I believe that the Government should have looked at the dislocation in the distribution industry throughout Australia before it implemented this policy. It would have been necessary to look at the report of the royal commission on the petroleum industry and to apply its recommendations in order to prevent the grave dislocations which have affected the costs of many people in the industry and which will eventually affect the cost to the consumer. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I thought the Government would have discussed with the oil producers the increases in profits before it brought down this proposition. It appears to me that the oil producers will take advantage of windfall profits and will resist strongly any measures by the Government which will lessen these windfall profits and which will make them pass back some of these profits to the nation. It was with concern that I read that the Government had not taken into consideration beforehand the windfall profits which would flow and had not taken the necessary measures, together with the other policy decisions, to control those windfall profits. We must realise that the Esso company, which is in control of the Bass Strait fields, has made considerable profits to date. I believe that the figure which was transferred to the parent company overseas was about $130m. </para>

              <para>-Perhaps that is correct. Let us say that it was a fair profit from the exploitation of the Bass Strait fields; Esso made a fair profit. I would say that any increase in the price of local oil to bring it to world parity must be made in such a way that windfall profits flow back to the nation and not to overseas investors in large sums. I think the Government intends this. That appears to be the intention in the statement. I think the United States took a substantial share of the windfall profits which flowed from an increase in the price of Middle East oil. I am suggesting that this should hold here. In any case, I have said more than I wish to say at this stage. The Opposition seeks to debate this paper. In order to facilitate that, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

              <para>-This Notice of Motion relates to the Australian Capital Territory Consumer Affairs (Amendment) Ordinance 1976, which has been the subject of intense examination by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and lengthy correspondence between the Committee and the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> since December 1976. The Ordinance contains amendments designed to strengthen the powers of the Director of Consumer Affairs to obtain information from suppliers of goods and services and to institute or defend proceedings on behalf of consumers. There were four provisions in the Ordinance which the Committee considered unduly trespassed upon individual rights and liberties </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Section 15a of the Ordinance empowered an investigating officer to require information and documents from persons, and refusal or failure to comply with such a requirement would be an offence, the only defences being incapacity to comply or the defence that the requirement was not reasonable for the purposes of the Ordinance. The Committee considered that the offence ought to be refusal or failure to comply without reasonable excuse, so that a person who considered that the demands of the investigating officer were unreasonable, for example, because compliance would prevent the continuance of his business, could ask a court to excuse him from compliance with those demands. The Minister has now agreed to put the defence of reasonable excuse into this provision, although it should be noted that provisions similar to the one now in the Ordinance have been passed by the Parliament in various Acts. </para>
          <para>Section 15c of the Ordinance also provided that a person would not be excused from supplying information or documents on the grounds that they might incriminate him, and that information or documents compelled under the Ordinance could then be used against the person from whom they were required in certain proceedings under the ordinance and under a number of other ordinances. The Committee considered that this provision violated the long established right of a person not to be compelled to be a witness against himself. The Minister has agreed to amend this provision so that information and documents compelled under the Ordinance may not be used in any proceedings except proceedings for refusing or failing to comply with a requirement or for supplying false information. </para>
          <para>Section 15e of the Ordinance provided that officers would not be obliged to produce to a court information or documents obtained under the Ordinance except in proceedings under the Ordinance or certain other specified ordinances. The Committee is always wary of restricting the power of courts to obtain information and documents and of conferring upon executive or statutory bodies privilege from court orders. In this case the Committee considered that the provision in certain circumstances could hamper litigants, in proceedings unrelated to the Ordinance or the other laws specified, when they desired to subpoena information or documents to assist their case, and could prevent courts from obtaining the truth in some kinds of proceedings. The Minister has agreed to replace this provision with one which would allow the person from whom information or documents were obtained to make a submission to a court against their production in proceedings, so that, in effect, it will be for the court to decide whether it ought to obtain the information or documents in question. </para>
          <para>Section 13 of the Ordinance repealed and remade section 16 of the principal Ordinance whereby officers were immune from all civil or criminal proceedings in respect of anything done in good faith under the Ordinance. The Committee accepted this provision in the principal Ordinance because it had the effect only of conferring privilege in defamation actions in respect of statements made by officers of the Consumer Affairs Bureau. The amending Ordinance, however, by empowering officers to enter and search premises, under warrant, and to compel information and documents, gave a new significance to section 16, which would confer an immunity from legal proceedings which the Committee considered could be dangerous. For example, an officer might negligently cause damage to property while acting in good faith in seaching premises under the Ordinance, and would be immune from action arising from such damage. The Minister has agreed to amend the Ordinance so that the immunity conferred will be confined to defamation actions arising from statements made by officers. The Committee wishes to consider further in the future whether even this immunity is too wide. </para>
          <para>The Committee has subjected this Ordinance to very close and detailed scrutiny, but it is considered that all laws of this nature ought to be closely scrutinised, particularly from the point of view of protecting individual rights and civil liberties, including Bills which pass through this place and which sometimes are not given the close attention which they ought to have. It is to be hoped that if and when the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory gains legislative powers, it will subject the laws of the Territory to the kind of scrutiny which the Committee now gives to them. In view of the undertaking given by the Minister to amend this Ordinance so as to overcome the objections of the Committee, I withdraw Business of the Senate, Notice of Motion No. 1, standing in my name. I would like to thank the Minister for the Capital Territory for his co-operation in relation to this matter. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this statement is to bring to the attention of the Senate, the measures being taken by the Government to assist the States in the development of their water resources. Even within the current difficult budgetary constraints, the Commonwealth has approved grant funds totalling $6.66m to the States. This will be matched by State funds. It will augment State programs concerned with the assessment of surface and underground water resources and their quality. In addition, about $390,000 will be available in 1977-78 for water research projects in priority areas. Such areas have been identified by water operating authorities throughout Australia through the Australian Water Resources Council. The Commonwealth will also be providing $50,000 towards an action program to control a serious water hyacinth infestation along the Gwydir River. New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia will contribute a similar sum to the cost of the action program in 1977-78. This infestation continues to be a potential threat to our highly productive irrigation areas along the Murray and its tributaries. </para>
          <para>The Government also recognises the appropriateness from a national perspective of being involved in the development of water resources and flood mitigation projects in the States. The Commonwealth will continue to meet its obligations to the States in respect of assistance authorised under previous programs. I have now been authorised to bring forward a new national water resources program as a basis for providing assistance for projects identified by the States as having top priority. In the present difficult budgetary circumstances, the Commonwealth will not be allocating funds for individual water resources projects. However, in 1977-78, $lm of grant funds has been allocated for the New South Wales coastal rivers flood mitigation program. These grants will be allocated on the same funding basis with State and local authorities as in previous programs. We recognise that it is urgent to ensure continuity of work on flood mitigation projects along these rivers. The States will be duly notified of the details of the new national water resources program. </para>
          <para>I also draw the attention of the Senate to the current inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. This Committee is examining the role of the Commonwealth in the assessment, planning, development and management of Australia&#39;s water resources. I would hope that the report on the inquiry will provide valuable guidance to the Government on these important matters.

          </talk.start>
          <para>In 1967 Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand met and established the association of South East Asian Nations. The principal aims of the Association, set forth in the ASEAN Declaration signed in Bangkok on 8 August 1967, are to accelerate the region&#39;s economic growth, social progress and cultural development, and to promote regional peace and stability. The leaders of the five ASEAN nations undertook to promote active collaboration and mutual assistance in matters of common interest in economic, social, cultural, technical and administrative fields. This undertaking was reaffirmed in the Declaration of ASEAN concord issued at the end of the first ASEAN Summit Conference held in Bali last year. </para>
          <para>ASEAN leaders recognise that only through interdependence and self-reliance will they secure peace and stability in the region. And they have concerted their energies to establish the region as a force for stability and concord. The five countries have made a significant effort to develop friendly relations with their neighbours as well as to accommodate the changing pattern of involvement of the major powers in South East Asia. The ASEAN countries have firmly held that ASEAN is not, and should not be, a security organisation or military pact. Increasingly their concern has been with the problems of economic development. This reflects their clear recognition of the very close connection between economic development and social and political stability. Coinciding with ASEAN &#39;s tenth anniversary, Australia together with New Zealand and Japan received an invitation to meet with the Heads of Government of ASEAN in Kuala Lumpur on 6 and 7 August. The occasion was of significance: It was only the second time in which the five leaders had met together and the first at which any leader of another country had been invited to meet with the five ASEAN Heads of Government as a group. The meetings with the ASEAN Heads of Government were of the greatest value in furthering the strong and friendly ties that have linked Australia with these five countries for more than three decades. The meeting demonstrated, at the highest level, our mutual desire to enhance Australian/ASEAN co-operation. </para>
          <para>Australia strongly supports ASEAN &#39;s objective of preventing domination of the region by any major power and we have a significant interest in helping to ensure that ASEAN succeeds in its efforts to generate the economic growth and political stability for which it is striving. Our relationship with ASEAN is one which will require continuing and special attention. The opportunities which the Kuala Lumpur meeting provided to discuss policies in an open and direct manner have made many of our policies better understood, particularly those relating to our economic and trading positions. </para>
          <para>The opening meeting between the leaders of the five ASEAN countries, Japan, New Zealand and myself afforded a useful opportunity for us to make contact as a group and to exchange views on matters of common regional concern. At Australia &#39;s suggestion, world economic trends and their implications for the region were discussed. Matters which were raised included our common problems of inflation, economic recovery and international trade. The goodwill between the eight countries was most evident. This goodwill has the most important long-term implications for the development of a framework of co-operative, imaginative and mutually beneficial relations between the countries of ASEAN and their neighbours. The meeting the following day between myself and the five ASEAN Heads of Government was particularly successful and significant. It established strong foundations for the further development of relations between Australia and ASEAN. </para>
          <para>The ASEAN Heads of Government raised the question of our trade and they expressed the strong wish to increase their share of&#34; trade with Australia. I emphasised that the balance of trade with ASEAN countries has moved relatively in ASEAN &#39;s favour since 1970-71 from a ratio of 3.4:1 to 2:1. The growth rate of imports to Australia from ASEAN over the last five years has averaged 30 per cent per year and because of import competition and changing demand patterns, employment in the Australian textiles, clothing and footwear industries has declined from about 160 000 in 1971, to less than 120 000 today. Given the short term economic difficulties Australia has experienced over the past few years, there is little prospect of imports from ASEAN continuing to grow at the rapid rate of the last five years at the further expense of Australian industry. There will be further opportunities for ASEAN &#39;s exports to Australia to increase when the economic and employment situation in Australia improves. I believe the ASEAN countries understand this. And there are opportunities for ASEAN &#39;s exports to Australia to expand by competing with other countries that export to Australia. ASEAN enjoys only a small share of Australia&#39;s imports of textiles, apparel and footwearunder 10 per cent of the value of such imports from Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan combined, and clearly there is room for improvement in this share. </para>
          <para>In discussing the desirability of increasing ASEAN &#39;s share of the Australian import market, it was agreed that an annual ASEAN trade fair jointly sponsored by Australia and ASEAN, be held in one or other of the State capitals. The first of these fairs will be held in 1978. I also emphasised that ASEAN trade opportunities in the Australian market were heavily dependent on Australia&#39;s access to other markets, particularly the European Economic Community, for Australia&#39;s agricultural products. Australia&#39;s experience in endeavouring to obtain access to European markets has been far from satisfactory. Many of our agricultural products have been utterly excluded from the EEC by huge import levies. In 1 960, our exports to members of the EEC accounted for 40 per cent of our total exports. That proportion has now been reduced to 14.8 per cent to a significant extent because of the restrictive policies of the EEC. To make matters worse, artificially stimulated domestic surpluses in the EEC are being exported subject to subsidies which frequently change and are often quite exorbitant, disrupting our other traditional markets around the world. A recent example is the EEC subsidy or &#39;restitution&#39; on malt. As from November, the subsidy will increase by more than 30 per cent; and this arbitrary rise could have very damaging effects on the Australian malt industry. </para>
          <para>The ASEAN members and Australia noted their common interests as commodity producers. </para>
          <para class="block">We expressed our joint concern at the decline in recent years of the terms of trade against commodity producers and the difficulties sharp fluctuations in commodity prices have caused producers. The role Australia has played in commodity agreements for stabilising world trade was raised and we expressed our support for the concept of a common fund for commodity trade. </para>
          <para>The ASEAN leaders also welcomed the initiative Australia had taken at the June Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in establishing a Commonwealth task force to consider the part a common fund would play in commodity price stabilisation. The ASEAN leaders expressed the hope that the adoption of complementary trade policies would benefit both ASEAN and Australia. In this respect they indicated their desire to increase their own imports from Australia. There has been some speculation in the Press about discriminatory measures against Australian imports continuing to be applied. I was assured by the Malaysian Trade Minister, in the presence of the Malaysian Prime Minister, that discriminatory impediments in the way of the development of that trade had been removed. The Government attaches considerable importance to that assurance. In order that we might discuss mutual trade problems before they become difficult or acute, I suggest that ASEAN and Australia should establish better arrangements for consultation on trade matters. The precise form such consultative machinery might take is still to be determined. We want arrangements which will be responsive and can be activated quickly by either side. Our objective is to have a forum for discussion and identification of problems in all aspects of trade between us. It was agreed that our foreign ministers should make appropriate proposals to our respective governments at the earliest opportunity so that the proposed new arrangements can be established. </para>
          <para>In looking at ways in which we could promote closer economic co-operation, we agreed on the need to establish a sound basis of knowledge from which a long term economic relationship between ASEAN and Australia would be developed. To that end we proposed and will finance a joint ASEAN-Australia research project. Its success will require a major mutual effort. It is envisaged that it will take the form of an independent research team in each of our six countries working together and assembling cooperatively the basic material, ideas and proposals for- greater co-operation. It will not be expected to bring quick results. But it will give us a reliable foundation on which to build a long term economic relationship. Another matter which was raised was the basis upon which Australian import quotas are issued. A review of the principles involved has now been undertaken and details will be announced shortly. </para>
          <para>At the post-ASEAN talks Australia also announced a significant expansion in the size of Australia&#39;s aid program to ASEAN countries, and several measures aimed at improving its quality. These proposals are indicative of our positive interest in the economic development of the region. They can be briefly summarised. Australia will contribute an additional $10m to the ASEAN-Australia economic co-operative program. We have increased our forward commitment for total bilateral aid to the five ASEAN countries by $90m to $250m. In order to improve the quality of our aid we will untie it further to allow increased procurement of materials and equipment from within the ASEAN region. We will also fund some local costs and enter into cofinancing arrangements with international organisations, where this is considered appropriate by the recipient country. </para>
          <para>The ASEAN leaders sought Australian assistance in developing five industrial projects which ASEAN is promoting, and the Australian Government confirmed that it would contribute to those projects within our available resources and capacities as the projects become more clearly defined. It is envisaged that our assistance will take the form of feasibility studies, technical training, design and construction work, and possibly assistance in the development of infrastructure. Discussions at official level will be held about the five industrial projects when appropriate. The ASEAN leaders were also interested in our policy on Australian investment overseas. I indicated that the Australian Government welcomed investment overseas where this contributed to the economic and social development of the countries concerned, but at the present time we would have difficulties with investment which involved little more than the transfer of operations to other countries with a consequent loss of jobs in Australia. Because of our willingness to encourage Australian investment in the ASEAN countries, an ASEAN suggestion that we sponsor an ASEAN-Australia investment seminar was accepted. It is envisaged that this will be a major seminar based on the experience of one which was held most successfully earlier this year between the European community and ASEAN. </para>
          <para>Whilst in Kuala Lumpur I also had the opportunity of having particularly useful talks with the Prime Minister of Japan, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fukuda.</inline> A number of matters of significance in our bilateral relationship were discussed, including the importance Australia attaches to stability in trade. Australia seeks predictable and growing access to the Japanese market for agricultural products on a stable basis. As to Australian beef exports to Japan, I pointed out to the Japanese Prime Minister that the present arrangement of negotiating beef quotas every six months was disruptive to the beef industry&#39;s ability to operate effectively. It should be possible to devise a system which both affords reasonable protection to the Japanese beef industry and gives more predictable and stable access to the Japanese market. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fukuda</inline> agreed that our officials should work together closely to devise a system which would better serve the needs of stability. Our officials are expected to meet shortly in Japan to consider various alternatives including, for example, a fixed base quota together with a growth factor related, say, to beef consumption in Japan. </para>
          <para>The current state of negotiations on the long term sugar contract was also raised. I stressed that the security of long term contracts as bankable documents should not be compromised in any way. The Government&#39;s strong support for the generality of the case put by Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd to the Japanese refineries and the Government&#39;s belief that CSR had made concessions enough was also emphasised. Any concessions made up to 1980- when the contract expires- would need to be compensated for by some arrangement after 1980 covering both price and tonnage. It is the strong desire of the Australian Government and, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fukuda</inline> indicated, of the Japanese Government also, that the commercial parties resume meaningful negotiations and arrive at a prompt and mutually beneficial solution. It is in the interests of all concerned that the negotiations be brought to resolution as quickly as possible. </para>
          <para>During the three days of discussions, the Philippines and Japan both raised the subject of uranium with me. Both stressed the importance of nuclear power to meet their future energy needs and expressed the hope that Australia would be a future supplier of uranium to them. They were informed that the Government&#39;s decision on this issue would be taken shortly and that their representations would be taken into account in reaching that decision. The ASEAN leaders warmly welcomed the initiatives </para>
          <para class="block">Australia had taken and all our discussions were both constructive and helpful. The ASEAN leaders are playing a positive and progressive role in the development of our region. I am confident that as part of this process ASEAN will strengthen and extend its relations with Australia and other countries. Australia is concerned to promote the totality of its relationship with ASEAN. The measures agreed at Kuala Lumpur will add significantly to this. </para>

          <para>- I regret delaying the Senate. Yesterday at Question Time I raised a question concerning a petition to the Privy Council. In answer to my question, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> asked that I place the question on notice. I did so but I see that those questions of which notice was given on 16 August this year have not been included in the Notice Paper. </para>

            <para>- I handed it in immediately, as a matter of fact. I regret having to raise this matter but I have just observed that fact. Having raised it, I believe it is necessary for me to explain why I raised it. It was as a result of a letter that I wrote to the Premier of Tasmania on 18 July 1977, his reply to me of 26 July 1977 and my subsequent reply to him on 2 August 1977. So as not to delay the Senate and as each of those documents is only one page I seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> my letter to the Premier dated 18 July and his reply dated 26 July. </para>

          <para>Recently whilst engaged on an examination of another matter, the case of the Commonwealth -v- Queensland and Another (1975)7ALR351 attracted my attention. </para>

          <para>On 30th January, 1974,  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Paul Hasluck)</inline> sent a despatch to  His Excellency  the Governor of Tasmania <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Stanley Burbury ) in identical terms to the letter referred to by His Honour Mr Justice Murphy in the case which you mention.</inline></para>

          <para>In actual fact confirmation that  Her  Majesty had not only received such advice from  Her  United Kingdom Minister (sic) but had accepted it, is contained in an official cable from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Godfrey</inline> Agnew, the  Clerk  of the Privy Council to the Solicitor-General for Tasmania who formally lodged the Petition to  Her  Majesty with the  Clerk. </para>

            <para>- It will be seen that the documents deal with the case of the Commonwealth v. Queensland and Another (1975) which attracted my attention. In the reasons for his decision  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy quoted from a letter from the Governor-General to the Governor of Queensland relating to advice given to  Her  Majesty by her Australian Ministers in the matter of a petition seeking referral to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. I understood that since Tasmania was also a petitioner a similar letter was sent by the GovernorGeneral to the State of Tasmania. It seemed to me that, if  Her  Majesty acted solely on the advice of her Australian Ministers, as suggested by  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy, this would represent some alteration in the relationship between the States and the Commonwealth and that situation could adversely affect the rights of the States. The Premier of Tasmania replied to me. That reply is now a matter of record. It is my concern to ensure that the rights of the States to advise  Her  Majesty in constitutional matters affecting the States are not clouded by any misunderstanding of the message given by  Her  Majesty to the Governor-General in 1974. That is why I am concerned that the question which I was asked by the Leader of the Government in the Senate to place on notice did not appear on the Notice Paper. </para>

Notice of a number of claims had been given to the Interim Aboriginal Land Commissioner before the commencement of the Act on 26 January 1977. Some of those claims were not traditional land claims and some were not claims to vacant Crown land or to alienated land held by Aboriginals. The Commissioner has now invited the submission of traditional claims under Paragraph 50 ( 1 ) (a) of the Act in order to establish with certainty which of the claims previously submitted are traditional claims of the kind which he should investigate and report upon to myself and the Minister for the Northern Territory under the terms of this paragraph of the Act. Those applications, previously submitted, which were made on the basis of need rather than traditional claim, will be dealt with in accordance with the normal procedures operative in the Northern Territory. </para>

              <para>1 ) The sufficiency of Australian Legal Aid Office funding inevitably falls to be considered in a Budget context. In 1976-77 the Government provided for legal aid, other than Aboriginal legal aid, $17,976,600 compared with expenditure of$12,527,206 in 1975-76. This represented an increase in funds of 43 per cent. During the current review of legal aid, the Government has maintained the existing level of activity and staffing of the Australian Legal Aid Office. The Government considers that in principle matters such as the opening of new regional offices and staffing should be decided by the new State and Territorial Commissions. </para>

              <para>A successful legal aid scheme must depend in large part upon the contribution made by the private legal profession both in reduced fees and in voluntary services. The private profession has had experience in the development of legal aid policies in managing the various Law Society, Law Institute and Legal Aid Committee schemes throughout Australia. It is therefore appropriate that the private profession should have a substantial but not dominant representation upon Legal Aid Commissions. </para>

              <para>Yes, it has been considered by me. I raised it as a possible option wilh State Attorneys-General early in 1976.

Because of the neglect of the former administration, this proportion has begun to decline &#39;. As I stated in my speech to the APEA Annual Conference on 18 April 1977, &#39;The Labor Government deliberately held back mineral exploration and development. By the time they went out of office, investment in the industry had practically stopped. This Government is determined to revive it. We will not penalise the mineral industries in which Australia has a comparative advantage. Since coming to office, we have removed unnecessary barriers hindering exploration companies and, where necessary, we have provided positive incentives to encourage exploration and mining activity&#39;. </para>

              <para>I agree that it is desirable that individuals and groups are given adequate time to prepare submissions to Governmental inquiries. In setting reporting dates for inquiries, the Government seeks to allow sufficient time for them to perform their tasks including obtaining public input. Some inquiries, particularly Royal Commissions, are deliberately given a high degree of autonomy and it would not be appropriate for the Government to specify detailed operating instructions such as the time to be allowed for receipt of submissions. In any instance where a person or organisation has difficulty in meeting the time limit set for lodging of a submission with an inquiry, the appropriate course would be to write to the  Chairman  of the inquiry explaining the difficulties involved and seeking an extension of time. </para>

              <para>Under the 1967 Commonwealth-State Offshore Petroleum Agreement a State government is required to consult the Commonwealth Government, inter alia, before an exploration permit under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 is granted or renewed.

              <para>In accordance with the Agreement and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, exploration permits Q/4P, Q/5P, Q/6P and Q/7P were issued to the Australian Gulf Oil Company on 1 September 1968. The initial 6 year terms of these permits expired on 31 August 1974. In addition two exploration permits were issued over areas of the Torres Strait adjacent to the northernmost extent of the Great Barrier Reef on 1 October 1968. These are Q/10P granted to California Asiatic Oil Company and Texaco Overseas Petroleum, and Q/11P, granted to Gulf Interstate Overseas Limited.

          <para>The companies applied for renewal of the permits in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and these applications were referred to the Commonwealth by the Queensland Designated Authority. Taking into account the recommendations of the Royal Commissions into Exploratory and Production Drilling for Petroleum in the Area of the Great Barrier Reef, the Commonwealth has deferred its decision on the renewal applications. </para>
          <para>The previous Government banned oil drilling in the Reef Area pending research into possible effects of oil on the ecosystems of the Reef. Since the change of government Commonwealth Departments have been examining the nature of the research that might be appropriate in the context of the Royal Commissions&#39; recommendations. The examination has not been completed and thus no decisions have been taken by the Government in this regard. </para>

            <para>In answering the honourable senator&#39;s question it should first be said that any decision to abolish mental institutions would have to be taken by State governments. The Commonwealth Government&#39;s attitude concerning mental hospitals is inherent in its overall health policy which is to develop the most efficient and effective services possible to meet need. </para>
            <para>As pan of this policy many community based alternativesto acute treatment in psychiatric hospitals, and to long term care in large remote mental institutions, have already been provided. Numbers in these institutions are continuing to decrease. There is also a strong move among health professionals for the integration of mental health services within the general health services. Already a considerable amount of psychiatry is practised in the wards of general hospitals. </para>
            <para>The Government is committed to the best possible services for the mentally ill. This development will greatly reduce the need for mental institutions, but hasty abolition would be against the interests of patients. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In May 1976 the United Kingdom Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State for Energy announced a f lm, two-year feasibility study to assess the possibility of extracting energy from waves around Britain&#39;s coast. </para>
            <para>One of the four devices being studied is the Salter Duck, which is a type of oscillating vane, which, due to its shape, has the possibility of being able to extract a high percentage of the incident wave energy. These devices rock to and fro with the waves and have, therefore, been referred to as &#39;nodding ducks&#39;. </para>
            <para>The United Kingdom has one of the world&#39;s most favoured coastlines for wave power. Availability of this form of energy throughout the year is high and tends to coincide with the pattern of seasonal demand for electricity. Australia is not so favourably endowed. </para>
            <para>For this reason, I believe that, at this time, it would be more advantageous for Australian scientists to maintain a watching brief on the experiments being conducted in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, than for similar research to be initiated in this country. </para>
