        <para>To the Honourable  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned students, parents, teachers and citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: </para>
        <para>That the report of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations on Employment Prospects by Industry and Occupation, July 1977, p. 197, states that, in respect of Stenographers/Secretaries: </para>
        <para>With the exception of new business college graduates the demand for less experienced and less skilled people in Sydney is in balance with the supply. </para>
        <para>Business College graduates are exactly what the market wants and employers demand. </para>
        <para>In one of the few fields of employment shown by the report to be under-supplied, the Government is effectively reducing the ability of business colleges to train enough secretaries and stenographers for the positions which are available. </para>
        <para>The sixteen technical colleges in the Metropolitan area of Sydney which accommodate 3,220 students in day secretarial studies do not have the capacity to accommodate more than 6 per cent of the 2,435 students at non-State business colleges in the same area who will be disadvantaged by the Government's recent decision to withdraw fees subsidies and living allowances from the end of 1 977. 1977 School leavers who wish to undertake a course in Secretarial Studies and thus ensure they obtain a worthwhile position of employment on graduation are being forced to pay fees of the order of $ 1 , 400 for the year and also to forgo TEAS living allowances. </para>
        <para>The Government's decision is unfair, unjust, discriminatory, unreasonable and capricious. </para>
        <para>Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government will act immediately to undertake a thorough review of the position of non-State business colleges, guarantee interim funding forthwith and reverse its decision. </para>

            <para>- I do not know how many times I or the Prime Minister have to say that this is not a decision which is to be made by the Government; it is a decision to be made by me as Attorney-General. It is a rule which was clearly understood and stated by the Prime Minister when he was speaking about the resignation of my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott.</inline> The proceedings in Queanbeyan involved claims by the Government to what is known as 'Crown privilege' or public interest privilege' in relation to a large number of high level documents- Cabinet submissions, Cabinet decisions, correspondence at that level between Ministers and so on. On Monday 3 November the magistrate upheld the claim that those documents should not be made available as evidence in the proceedings. The parties are now considering action to be taken in relation to that decision. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have taken the step also of writing to the solicitors for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey</inline> to ask them what evidence they have in support of the information which has been laid by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey.</inline> At the present time I have not received a reply from them. Certainly it would not be proper for me to make any decision on this unless I was informed fully as to what evidence is available to the informant and unless I had examined the evidence on this matter which is in the hands of the Government. That is the position as it stands at the present moment. The matter has largely been held in abeyance because of the proceedings in Queanbeyan. Certainly it has not been resolved because the parties have not indicated what steps they are going to take in response to the magistrate's decision, nor have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey</inline> 's solicitors replied to my inquiry of them as to what evidence they have on this matter. </para>

I was more than interested to see that in the forthcoming general election campaign our opponents, as usual, will be devoting their time and attention to affairs of the past, whereas the present Government, led by a progressive Prime Minister, has progressive policies for the future. We are quite prepared to propound those policies. I have no doubt that honourable senators opposite all look downhearted this morning not so much as a result of the Records Office party, but as a result of the results of the gallup poll published in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> I suggest that they also study that poll.

I refer to the answer given by the Treasurer yesterday in answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition relating to land transactions. The Treasurer indicated that any land transactions with which he was associated were conducted by a family trust company and not by him. I also refer to the revelation of shareholdings by the Premier of Queensland in companies involved in the contractual relations with the Queensland Government. Will the Government immediately implement the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament to the effect that there should be full and frank public disclosure of financial interests of members of parliament in order that the public may be satisfied that this Parliament is beyond reproach? </para>

            <para>-I should have thought that the honourable senator has been here long enough to know that the pecuniary interests of members of parliament fade into insignificance against what ought to be disclosed as to the pecuniary interests of Ministers and their staffs. I thought it would have been well known that one of the first acts of the present Prime Minister was to introduce a most rigid and searching procedure for both Ministers and ministerial staff. There is a total and absolute obligation on all Ministers to update their pecuniary interests for the Prime Minister in a special form. I am trying to recall whether this must be done annually or every six months. </para>

              <para>-It is every six months. All Ministers must give this to the Prime Minister. The obligation also rests on the members of the ministerial staff. They have to update their pecuniary interests. That information comes to me as the Minister for the time being in charge of this area. This Government has been most scrupulous in that procedure. The question as to whether this obligation ought to be extended to other areas such as back bench members of the parliament is still under consideration. But I thought everybody would realise that if pecuniary interests are to be declared this ought to start with those holding executive positions in government and their staffs. The Government has not legislated in this area but it has introduced stringent, rigid internal procedures which, as far as the Prime Minister and I are concerned, have overcome the immediate problem. </para>

The point of my question was the report of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament which recommended that there should be full and frank public disclosure of the financial interests of members of parliament. It was that report, particularly in relation to Ministers, which I asked whether the Government would implement and not machinery which is a private arrangement between Ministers. </para>

              <para>- I suppose some governmentswe had one between 1972 and 1975- have an inclination to rush into things without feeling their way. The matter of pecuniary interests has not been varied by this Government. As I have said to the honourable member, that report on the extension of what ought to be done is still under study by the Government. I assume that the honourable senator was a member of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament as he takes such an interest in it. As I understand the report it applies not only to members of parliament but also to certain members of the Public Service. It was also suggested that it ought to apply to certain members of the media. I do not know whether this meant members of the Press Gallery or media people in other places. It is very easy to make recommendations. One of the more difficult things is to make them work well and effectively. The most urgent area that needed to be tackled was that of Ministers and ministerial staffs. That has been tackled in a thorough going manner. We will look at the other areas when we come back in the next Parliament. </para>

The Commonwealth Government regards this project as vital for Aborigines. As honourable senators would be aware the project is conducted by the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists and is funded by the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Government has a responsibility for obtaining the co-operation of State authorities. In his statement yesterday the Minister made clear his concern that the project should continue. I will refer the question <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> posed this morning to the Minister and obtain information on the two points that have been raised. I give the assurance that the program will continue but I will refer the matter of the two people concerned and their suspension to the Minister for Health. </para>

This depends upon a number of principles and also whether the law should provide for class actions. These questions were referred to the Law Reform Commission for consideration and report on 1 February 1977 and I notice from the latest report of the Commission which I tabled yesterday that it has this matter in hand. For those honourable senators interested, the issues are summarised in paragraphs 86 to 90 of the report. The Commission indicates that it proposes to publish discussion papers on the matter early next year. </para>

            <para>-I am always grateful for interjections because they help to point up what was done under the Whitlam Government and what is being done today under the Fraser Government. My recollection is that in 1975 under the Whitlam Government there were about 11,500 ABSEC or Aboriginal secondary education, grants. If I recall <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner's</inline> question aright, he asked how many such grants are being made available this year. This year it is estimated that there will be some 14,500 grants, compared with some 13,834 last year. Next year there will be 15,200 grants. That is an approximation. Therefore the number of grants by this Government compares more than favourably with the number in the past. In fact, there has been an enormous increase. There has been a very substantial increase in the maximum reimbursement of boarding allowances and costs. For example, for 1978 the boarding allowance will rise from $1,450 to $1,600. The allowances for students in hostels will increase from $28 a week to $30 a week, and for students boarding privately the allowance will increase from $20 a week to $22 a week. This is a basic step towards helping Aboriginals to gain better employment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think the primary answer to the question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> lies in a number of other factors. For example, the Fraser Government has laid down a policy called 'a national strategy for Aboriginal employment'. That is an initiative of recent months. It is a policy which impinges on all portfolios. It is a policy which asks the whole of the government framework including, one hopes, State and local government, to give some preference and priority to the employment of Aborigines. If one looks at the total potential work force of Aborigines in Australia, which out of a total population of 150,000 Aborigines must be only 30,000 to 40,000, one can appreciate that if the three spheres of government apply themselves to this policy there will be no real problem as regards employment if Aborigines choose employment rather than their traditional life style. </para>
          <para>Within the portfolio of Education there is a concentration now upon the revision of curricula to make the training and education of Aborigines more meaningful, whether they choose their traditional or the European style of life. This revision is now taking place, and we are looking towards the appointment of careers officers or vocational guidance officers to bridge the gap between school and employment, which is a vital matter as far as Aborigines are concerned. </para>

            <para>-I think it is a well known fact that Labor put nearly 200,000 people out of work in 1974. Unemployment rose by 157 per cent. As I said here the other day, most of the unemployment arose from the lunatic economic policies of the previous Government. I gave one instance where that Government was determined to increase imports to this country. It sent for a report. The report said that if the Government did certain things only 29,000 would become unemployed. .If it would give force and effect to its economic dogma, the Labor Party did not care about putting 29,000 people out of work. It did not care at all. It said: 'Let us put 29,000 people out of work so that our economic dogma will be put into effect'. What happened? Some 107,000 people went out of work. I would have thought that the Labor Party would have a bit of humanity, but it does not care about people who are unemployed. The Labor Party would rather stick with its crazy economic dogma which led to the greatest unemployment and the greatest inflation in this country this century. </para>

            <para>-Yes. As honourable senators would know, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight</inline> who has pursued a very keen interest in this matter, for several years past various interest groups- universities and archival organisationshave expressed dissatisfaction with Commonwealth archival facilities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight</inline> in particular has been stressing the need for an effective building program to provide suitable archival facilities appropriate to the importance of the vast store of archival wealth for which the Australian Government is responsible. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am sure that honourable senators will be pleased to know that the Government has approved in principle the construction of a national building for the Australian archives at a preliminary order of cost of $ 1 8m. It has also decided to authorise the National Capital Development Commission to arrange an architectural competition for the building and to report back to Cabinet with firm proposals for construction when the results of the competition are available. The construction of this national building will be a most important step forward in our archival program. As the honourable senator would also know, the Government has decided that this year it will proceed with construction of the repository in the suburb of Mitchell in north Canberra. The estimated cost of this is $6.25m. I can inform the honourable senator that a contract has been let for this building and the work will commence shortly. </para>
          <para>While on the subject of archives, I mention for the benefit of honourable senators from South Australia that the Government also has approved the expenditure of $ 1.3 m for the extension of the Adelaide repository. The Government also has approved the preparation of designs for a $1.7m extension to the Brisbane repository. Each of these three buildings will provide a full range of services, including conservation workshops and air conditioned storage. Our activities in Victoria and Tasmania are still in the early stages of development. </para>
          <para>I am certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight,</inline> who has been very keen on seeing the commencement of the Mitchell repository, will be interested to know that it is scheduled for completion in October 1979. Its completion should enable the removal of the huts adjacent to the Kings Avenue Bridge which have been not only poor storage but, I think it is fair to say, an eyesore in the national capital. </para>

            <para>- I understand that my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs received a report on 1 November this year. It indicated that some 520 applications had been received on 20 October in the office of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Melbourne. Of these applications, 342 were dated as having being filled in by the end of August. Another 240 applications had been completed before the end of July. I understand that the average waiting time for processing applications is about 12 weeks. Therefore, this action has prevented those people being eligible to vote at the forthcoming election. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is certainly not the fault of this Government that these people were unable to acquire Australian citizenship in time for the next election. The Minister has been informed that the reason given for not forwarding the applications to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs at an earlier date was that an action committee associated with the applications wanted the people concerned to be interviewed outside working hours in the areas in which they live. Notwithstanding this lengthy delay in submitting these applications, the Minister has advised that interviews will be held at the Brunswick Town Hall on 2 December next when about 25 per cent of the applicants will be interviewed. Everything will be done to expedite the processing of these cases in view of the delay that has been experienced by the applicants concerned and which was caused by the delay in forwarding their applications to the Department. </para>
          <para>As far as the citizenship ceremony held recently at Oakleigh is concerned, it has been reported to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that some disruption took place during the proceedings caused by three persons who later identified themselves as members of the Australian Labor Party. These persons were talking to new citizens at the rear of the hall after the new citizens had received their certificates, but before the speeches following the formal proceedings had been given. Apparently, these activities had the effect of disrupting the smooth flow of proceedings at the ceremony. </para>
          <para>No objection is raised to new citizens being helped to fill out enrolment forms, but it is expected that such help would normally be given after the proceedings had been finalised. With regard to action to be taken, I remind the Senate that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs wrote to all parliamentarians in October this year, referring to the citizenship ceremonies and mentioning that such a ceremony is a formal legal process in which the whole community unites in welcoming new citizens to this country. It is an occasion which impresses upon candidates the honour and dignity of citizenship and the responsibilities and privileges they take as Australian people. The Minister tells me that he has had a very favourable response from parliamentarians from both Government and Opposition parties. It is unfortunate that a few have seen fit to abuse what seems to be a well established and understood tradition of assisting migrants in their citizenship following the ceremony. </para>

            <para>-I think my question should be addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, although it does have Treasury implications. Is there any prospect of the Senate being advised before it rises today or, if not, within a few days, of the findings contained in the interim report of the Industries Assistance Commission on the operations of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd at Queenstown in Tasmania which I understand was furnished to the Government on 30 September last? I ask this question because of its extreme importance and because of the widespread concern in Tasmania expressed by all shades of political opinion about this very important matter. Will the Minister agree that the terms of the report hold the key to the future of the Mount Lyell mine and therefore the future of the whole west coast community in Tasmania? </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator's comments are quite appropriate. It is a very important report on Mount Lyell. One acknowledges that and one acknowledges that legislation has been put through the Parliament in the last couple of days to try to do something about the situation in Queenstown. Industries Assistance Commission reports come through the Business and Consumer Affairs ministry to the Government for consideration. That is the present process for consideration of these reports. The reports are always considered by a group of Government departments which have an interest in the area, and this is what is happening. Once that matter has been concluded, the honourable senator may be quite sure that as in the past the Government will make its proper announcements. </para>

            <para>-I am very concerned about the way droughts are occurring. It is a long time since Australia has had what I would call a national drought. There has been drought State by State. It has been possible to balance up by moving stock to a good place from a bad place. The pattern of droughts developing at the moment is making me very uneasy indeed. I think the honourable member knows the situation. The Commonwealth has always stood ready to help the States, which basically are concerned with administering these matters. The Commonwealth is always ready to help the States with finance. It has done so in the past and the Prime Minister has made it very clear that he will do so again on request. This is what we always should do, and all governments have done that. </para>

Officers of my Department have been having discussions with officers of other departments, as I understand it, in the city of Brisbane to work out the best possible solution so that nobody is personally inconvenienced or disadvantaged. That is my policy and I will insist on it being carried out. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and it follows upon questions by Senators Bonner, Keeffe and Cavanagh concerning the deferment of portion of the national trachoma campaign in Queensland. Is it not a fact that it was the elected Aboriginal councils of the Aboriginal communities in Queensland which requested the removal of the two field officers concerned in the Queensland trachoma campaign? I point out, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that the Aboriginal councils are elected and that the two field officers are self-appointed Aboriginal political activists. Is it not a fact that the Queensland Premier acceded to this request? Is it not also a fact that the national trachoma campaign continues in all other respects- medical, surgical and in conjunction with the Queensland program that has been in operation for 20 years- except for the suspension of these two Aboriginal political activists? </para>

But I reject that proposition, however attractive it might be.

          <para>The fact is that the Whitlam Government itself faced the intractability of a problem which created equally difficult solutions as to whether one stayed with maintaining some 18 business colleges or in fact brought about equity. There are some 100 business colleges in Australia. Eighteen of them receive some kind of per capita grants and attract tertiary education assistance. The remainder do not. The Whitlam Government itself froze the number which would receive this assistance and would not let any more in. </para>
          <para>The problem is one of balance and is not one that in itself is totally clear one way or the other. The Government has given further thought to the matter and has decided to continue with the payments to those colleges. It has asked the Tertiary Education Commission to look at the matter m longer term. I take it that that would have the support of both sides of the Senate, considering that particularly from the Government side there has been an enormous interest in seeing that this problem is resolved satisfactorily. </para>

            <para>-It is true that recently the Commonwealth Government announced that an additional $2.3m would be spent on adult migrant education beyond the increase already made in the Budget. Western Australia's share over recent years in terms of cash flow has been as follows: For 1975-76, $240,567; in 1976-77, $357,097; and for the program year 1977-78 the Budget allocation was $368,600. An additional $3 1,400 is being allocated to this year's program, making a total of $400,000. Actually, that amounts to a 1 2 per cent increase this year. In addition, Western Australia will share in the supplement in regard to existing full-time courses at tertiary institutions, in the on-arrival English language programs, in vacation English language courses and in a variety of initiatives in regard to the English language courses at the work place, and so on. Western Australia 's migrants will also, of course, be sharing in the increased living allowances which are now, basically, at the level of the unemployment benefit. </para>

            <para>- The Government has expressed concern at all times about the level of unemployment. We were most concerned about the level of unemployment that we inherited from the Labor Government. When the Labor Government came to office in 1972 there was a level of unemployment of about 2 per cent. When it went out of office in December 1975 the level of unemployment had grown to 5.2 per cent or 5.3 per cent- a three per cent increase. That occurred in the last 18 months of office of the Labor Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That dramatic increase in unemployment was caused by the Labor Government's irresponsible policies, which created not only record unemployment but also record levels of inflation. That has been the problem which the present Government has had to tackle. It has tackled effectively the rate of inflation, reducing it to below double figures. Unfortunately the Government has not been able to reduce the level of unemployment. It has increased slightly over the period of two years that we have been in office. </para>
          <para>The latest level of unemployment is due to the dramatic effects of the Latrobe Valley strike. An additional 53,000 people were registered for unemployment because of the irresponsible actions of trade union leaders about which we never heard any complaints from the Labor Opposition and in relation to which no real suggestions and leadership have been provided by the Labor Opposition or the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That is the unemployment situation in this nation at this time and they are the causes of it. The Government is confident that its policies of containing inflationary pressures in this country and encouraging private investment and development are commencing to work and that there will be an increase in the number of vacancies for employment in the private sector. </para>

The honourable senator may recall that some time ago I answered a question from him on this subject in which I indicated that my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs had advised that, due to our incapacity to have proper representation in that country and to receive proper reports through the normal diplomatic channels, the Department of Foreign Affairs has to rely to a large extent on media reports of what is happening. The honourable senator will recall that my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs also advised that he and his Department had no reason to disbelieve any of the reports emanating from that country. </para>

          <para>It has been said that one of the most tragic events of recent years has been the absolute cruelty, slaughter and deprivation of human rights and liberties in that country. It was a country which, prior to the emergence of the Khmer Rouge, was by repute one of the most contented and happy countries in the South East </para>
          <para class="block">Asian region. With the de-escalation and cessation of the war in South Vietnam, one saw the emergence of the Khmer Rouge in former Cambodia. Those who used to laugh at the domino theory should consider what has been happening in Cambodia ever since then and the senseless, mindless slaughter of innocent women and children, let alone male political opponents. It brings a sense of shame to us all that we have no capacity to stop it. As to the honourable senator's query about what Australia would be prepared to do about aid, I am quite certain that, if proper sanity returned to that country and if aid teams were able to enter it to relieve human suffering, the Australian Government would be in the forefront of those willing to offer help. </para>

            <para>- My question follows upon an earlier one put to the Minister for Education. This year the Government has produced a national Aboriginal employment policy to assist Aboriginal people generally, but particularly in their communities in isolated areas. I understand that as part of that policy there has been a review of the Aboriginal education field with a view to training more Aboriginal people as aides, teachers, et cetera. Is the Minister in a position to indicate the present situation? Is it the intention of the Government to increase the number of staff within the Department to give added emphasis to the training of Aboriginal people to work within their own communities? </para>

I reminded the Senate yesterday that in terms of recruiting Aborigines to be trained as full teachers at Batchelor Teachers Training College and of recruiting teaching aides the Government is aiming to increase the numbers and to use both preservice and in-service training. I also reminded the Senate yesterday that we hope to develop at Ti Tree, some 100 miles or more north of Alice Springs, a multi-purpose training centre to train aides which can be used by departments such as the Department of Health to bring an in-service upgrading to the whole of the Territory. At the moment I am having discussions with the Government to see whether we can get some increases in the intake, particularly of teaching aides. Overall, I am hopeful that we will be able to increase greatly the quality of the in-service training of the present students. I remind the Senate that it is important that there be an increase in the number of Aboriginal teachers and aides so that their cultures shall be undisturbed as far as possible. </para>

Is it not a fact that Professor Hogan, who has been one of the advisers to the Government and to the Government parties, has forecast that in the first half of next year unemployment will rise to 8 per cent of the work force? Can the Minister state whether, in his opinion, that is a reliable forecast? Is he now able to say what the Government expects the level of unemployment to be? Is it not a fact that the Prime Minister when announcing policies on the eve of the last election said that a Liberal government would find work for all who wanted work?

            <para>-I am surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> or, indeed, anyone in the Opposition raising the question of Professor Hogan s forecast on unemployment which was so grossly abused by their leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> who completely distorted the Professor's statements. Apparently </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline>is now repeating those distortions. Professor Hogan indicated that the forecast on unemployment which he was making related to the normal peak level of the year, namely, January 1978. Of course, as we know, that time of year is the time when unemployment is at its highest level because of the large numbers of school leavers who come onto the labour market. </para>
          <para>Professor Hogan gave some predictions in regard to that period of January next year. The figures he cited did not relate to the first half of next year. They were not intended to indicate a permanent level of unemployment for next year at all. He has gone to great pains to repudiate the claims originally made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and now being repeated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> Those claims are totally false. It surprises me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> has not understood, the falsity of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> about Professor Hogan 's predictions. </para>
          <para>Professor Hogan indicated there would naturally be a rise in unemployment in January next year. His worst prediction was that unemployment could rise as high as 8 per cent, but he was not firmly predicting that at all. He went on to say that the level of unemployment would fall after January and that there would be a general improvement in economic conditions during 1978 due to the policies which the Fraser Government has been pursuing and on which he has been an adviser as well. He expressed confidence in economic recovery next year. As far as the promises of this Government in relation to unemployment are concerned, I simply remind the Senate that the Government has been concerned to provide opportunities for employment. </para>
          <para>I have indicated that the basic policy has been to encourage the private sector and to create a stimulus in that sector. We have been faced with this intractable problem of unemployment which was created by the Labor Government, as I have already mentioned. There was an increase in unemployment of 3 per cent in less than about 18 months. That was the situation we inherited. The Government, in accordance with the promise that was made, has set about trying to do something in relation to the matter. In fact, through improvements to the National Employment and Training scheme and through the institution of the Special Youth Employment Training scheme we are providing work or training for over 100,000 young people. Those schemes are constantly being reviewed and improved and we will continue to do that. </para>

              <para>- I really do not have anything further to add to the answer I have already given. It is very difficult- in fact too difficult- to forecast levels of unemployment at any time. It is foolish to be making such predictions. Professor Hogan, who is a very careful and distinguished economist, has already indicated the difficulties that he has in making forecasts. He has made some but he has also made many qualifications to them. I have already dealt with some of the qualifications in my answer to the honourable senator's question. </para>

Professor Hogan has indicated himself the difficulties in making such forecasts. I would like to make just one last point. One of the greatest distortions and confusions that affect forecasts of the unemployment level comes about as the result of strikes such as the Latrobe Valley strike in which an additional 53,000 people were added to the list of unemployed in one month in Victoria. </para>

            <para>-Under the formula whereby for the first time local government will get a revenue growth supplement which will rise at the same rate as increases in Commonwealth income tax revenue, South Australia has done very well. In the last year of the Whitlam Government South Australia received $6.8m for local government. In 1976-77, under the Fraser Government, it received $1 1.9m and in 1977-78 it will receive $ 14.2m. In the first year of the Fraser Government it received an increase of 75.7 per cent and in the second year an increase of 19.2 percent. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think the honourable senator asked me how the share of revenue received by South Australia compared with that received by other States. With the exception of Tasmania, which because of a population problem had some adjustments made to its allocation, the increase this year of 19.2 per cent received by South Australia is higher than that received by other States.

        <para class="block">I am disappointed that the VIP schedules are up to date only as to 30 June. I have been asking for the VIP manifests for some months. The information was not made available to Estimates Committee A or to the Committee of the Whole when this subject was debated. We now find ourselves in the situation where all we have been provided with is a manifest of flights from 1 March to 30 June. There is no way in which the public at large will be able to ascertain just who has been using VIP flights from 30 June to when the Senate rises. This is of great concern not only to me but also to a great many other people. I am sure that most honourable senators opposite know why I am interested in VIP flight manifests. They know there is a certain gentleman whom I have claimed on many occasions overuses VIP flights. </para>

            <para>- He is the incumbent of Yarralumla- the Governor-General. I hope that the new Governor-General, when he takes office, will take cognizance of the stringent economies that have been imposed by this Government and will not misuse or overuse VIP flights. I note that the Minister, when tabling this report, said that he will place a copy of it in the Parliamentary Library. I hope he will make available to me one copy to take away. What is the use of tabling documents when, as we have found so often since this Government has been in office, not sufficient copies of reports, whether on VIP manifests or on other matters, are available. Often there are no copies available. </para>

        <para>We are told that the Minister will place a copy of this report in the Parliamentary Library. It is a public document once it has been tabled in the Parliament but how on earth will all the people in Australia who are interested in the overuse of VIP flights be able to see the report? They cannot come to Canberra and get into the Parliamentary Library to look at the document, so the Government ought to make copies available. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said in answer to a question yesterday that he would make available tens of thousands of the uranium report kits to people who wanted them. He did so because they promote the Government's policy. Here we have a document which is great public interest but only one copy is available and it is in the Parliamentary Library. I hope that the Minister will provide me with a copy of it before I leave the precincts of the Parliament today. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

          <para>- At the time when the Committee adjourned consideration last evening there was a number of questions asked of the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> which had not yet been answered. Also there had been some debate on the amendments which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> moved. In regard to the first amendment there is a point that ought to be given consideration by the responsible Minister when other legislation is introduced. A problem is raised by the amendment which deserves further consideration. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The second amendment seeks to amend proposed section 87 by leaving out the expression that the Tribunal 'is satisfied that the circumstances justify its so doing9 and inserting as the grounds of specification the words 'there have been persistent breaches of standards, specifications or conditions'. I do not really think this amendment is satisfactory. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> for giving me such an impressive audience. In regard to the second amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> which specifies the circumstances which the Tribunal should take into account, I do not feel the enumeration he puts forward is more satisfactory really than what is contained in the Bill at present. I do not think the </para>
        <para>Tribunal would need to consider only persistent breaches of standards, specifications or conditions. There may be one breach, and it may be a very important one, or there may be other matters which justify the Tribunal taking action. I do not really think that the honourable senator has found the answer to this problem. I hope that the Government will have a further look at this matter when it is making a general review of the Act. </para>
        <para>There is one other matter apart from the questions which have already been raised and about which the Minister has been asked. That is the matter which I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate. Unless I am mistaken I do not think that this has been mentioned by the Minister. I refer to the provision in the proposed section 79e (2). Proposed section 79e sets out the various powers of the Special Broadcasting Service. I believe that basically the powers are sensible and fairly normal for the operations of the Service. But sub-section (2) says: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The provision under this Part of broadcasting or television services shall be in accordance with such principles as are prescribed. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This provision concerns me. I feel that it ought to be looked at again. Obviously nothing much can be done about it today. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> I refer again to proposed new section 79e sub-section (2) which provides: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The provision under this Pan of broadcasting or television services shall be in accordance with such principles as are prescribed. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This provision worries me. I can imagine the principles which a government- not our Governmentformed by those opposite might manage to prescribe and might tie into the activities of the Special Broadcasting Service. I ask the Minister to indicate whether some revision might be made of or some further consideration given to this question of the adequacy of merely prescribing principles. The regulations which are put down may be quite all right. They, of course, will be subject to the scrutiny of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. Nonetheless, it seems to me to be a wide prescription that is provided in this proposed new section. I would appreciate some comment on it. </para>

The first amendment to us does not seem to add anything in the context of the Bill. The comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> with regard to proposed. new section 79E sub-section (2) are equally applicable to proposed new section 79d (b). In the overall context of this legislation the reference to principles being prescribed or purposes being prescribed falls into the same category. I draw the honourable senator's attention to that fact. </para>

          <para>- I will be brief. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> asked why the special broadcasting services could not, in effect, do their own thing and why they did not have guidelines or regulations. The knowledge that the two radio stations, 2EA and 3EA, have transmissions in more than 20 languages must have escaped <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline> It is impossible to monitor so many languages in practical terms and to ensure that standards are being observed. For this reason, upon reflection, guidelines are necessary. The previous Government was very keen on monitoring and the establishment of guidelines for standards. I do not see why the Labor Party would not support a similar situation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline>incidentally, was critical of the fact that the Minister could make particular decisions in the field. I remind him that in ethnic broadcasting the Minister is advised by NEBAC-the National Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Council-on policy matters. Since we are good at acronyms, SEBAC- the State ethnic broadcasting advisory committees- in New South Wales and Victoria advise him on day to day programming matters. So both NEBAC and SEBAC members, with the exception of a couple of departmental officers, are in fact representatives of ethnic communities. There is in fact a direct and continuous link. </para>
        <para>Some comment was made about the powers of the Special Broadcasting Service which are dealt with in proposed new section 79E. They are similar powers in terms of property acquisitions and so on to those that are given to the Australian Broadcasting Commission in existing legislation. I think no comment was made on those powers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> rightly drew attention to the need for the interests of smaller States to be taken into account. I shall make sure that my colleague in another place understands that. The two points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> deserve comment. The first one was in regard to substituting a test that there should be persistent breaches. I suggest to him that the real and critical matter is the nature and magnitude of a breach. We would not want to insist that there be persistency of breaches of great magnitude. Of course to say that is to understand, and I think he would acknowledge that. The second point relates to sponsorship. I make it clear that the </para>
        <para class="block">Government does not intend that there should be full and uncontrolled sponsorship at all in this field, but there should be some on limited matters. </para>
        <para>I do not want to take the time of the Committee on this but I suggest that since both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> have raised some queries which I think deserve further thought- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> 's in terms of particularities I would be prepared to invite the Government to give early attention to the comments that have been made here and in its early approach to the whole consolidation and reform of the broadcasting and television legislation, including the wireless and telegraphy legislation, to take into account all the critical matters raised by both sides of the chamber. That may accommodate the honourable senator's views </para>

          <para>- When I moved my amendments yesterday the House of Representatives was sitting. I. pointed out the danger, particularly in regard to small areas, of the Special Broadcasting Service becoming a commercial Australian Broadcasting Commission station. The Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> has said that the Government will look at the question. He has also said that it will look at the provision relating to the length of licence and what circumstances would result from the length of licence being reduced from 3 years to 12 months. In the light of that and in the light of the- <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> it may be of interest to view that just prior to that quorum being called there was one Labor person in the chamber and he has responsibility ibr the carriage of this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> walked in, as Whip, and called for the quorum. I noticed that while the doors were open two Labor senators from Tasmania approached the doors, saw that a quorum was being formed, and walked away. Now there are still only two Labor people in this chamber. There has been a deliberate attempt, after all the rubbish honourable senators opposite went through a few moments ago, not to do any work today. I do not know where they are, whether they are sitting in the sun or what. But if this is the way they want to run this chamber we will certainly go along with them. </para>

          <para>-The provisions of clause 23 should be singled out for concern. In referring to these provisions in particular, I am not saying that the Opposition approves of the provisions of the other clauses with which we are dealing in this bracket. We find proposed section 106b particularly objectionable. This deals with the secrecy provisions applicable to members and staff of the Broadcasting Tribunal. The comments we make about it relate in a sense to the comments made in relation to earlier portions of the legislation. The question was asked: What documents should be kept secret from the Australian public in relation to the broadcasting industry? The Minister, of course, gave some answer when he referred to contracts between employer and employee and things of that kind with which we would not disagree. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The point about section 106b is that it refers to the whole question of the assembly of information to the finances and ownership of the broadcasting industry. As was pointed out yesterday in the course of debate on the question of finance and ownership of the Australian broadcasting industry, the Government's record on this matter is not a good one. It involves the issue of licences contrary to the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act; it involves files which suddenly become lost. That sort of administration has characterised the last two years. It is quite extraordinary that this type of provision, which provides for the assembly of information, is inserted and is then qualified by the provisions of proposed section 106b which imposes very severe penalties on those members of the Broadcasting Tribunal and its staff who divulge any of that information. In our view the vast majority of that information should be public material. We do not know why there are penalties in this legislation for the non-disclosure of information which is not appropriately public material when there is the Crimes Act. Why is the broadcasting legislation singled out for special provisions of this kind which deal with the non-disclosure of information? </para>
        <para>We welcome the principle that the Tribunal should assemble material just as the old Australian Broadcasting Control Board assembled material, although not as much as the public would have liked. We remind the Government that public standards regarding freedom of information and accessibility to information have changed in Western democracies and are changing in Australia. It is extraordinary that this legislation is introduced despite those changes which are and ought to be properly taking place. </para>

          <para>- I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act which was passed in 1975 by the Whitlam Government. It contains provisions the same as those which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> now questions. The Whitlam Government thought they were appropriate at that time. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> also of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976. My recollection is that that legislation was passed by this Parliament without comment. It is natural and proper, particularly in commercial practice, that matters which are viewed to be confidential- I dealt with this last night- should have their confidentiality maintained. That is a principle that has been upheld by the Senate in its Estimates Committees. No new precedent is being set. The provisions are eminently sensible. Public servants are forbidden to disclose confidential information. I see no reason there should be any objection to the principle. <inline font-style="italic">( Quorum formed).</inline></para>

          <para>-There are a number of proposed new sections in this part of the Bill on which the Opposition would normally have liked to comment. They would have been matters of comment though, rather than indicating particular opposition. However, I wish to indicate quite specifically opposition to clause 28 of the Bill which is the provision dealing with review of decisions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I really find that this section is one which makes a mockery of the so-called nature of the Broadcasting Tribunal as a quasi-judicial body. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In this country in the past couple of years there has been a lot of talk about the nature of the broadcasting structure. There has been a lot of talk by the Minister about divorcing the granting of licences and the renewal of licences from the process of government and of taking those questions out of the hands of politicians and putting them into the hands of a quasi-judicial body which would deal with them, one would hope, in a quasi-judicial way. </para>
        <para>How does this proposed new section 1 19a operate in regard to the deliberation of that quasi- judicial body which will deal with important matters in Australian broadcasting, important matters relating to the granting and renewal of licences and so on? How it operates effectively is this: It says to the Broadcasting Tribunal: 'When you are weighing the facts, when you are balancing the information before you and trying to reach a decision about who should get a licence to broadcast or about who should have a licence to broadcast renewed, you do so in the knowledge that only one side can effectively appeal'. So if there are two sides before this quasi-judicial body, the Tribunal has to decide what should be the justice of the situation in regard to those opposing sides- one representing a proprietary interest and the other, one would think, representing a public interest. The Tribunal is told by its own legislation that the side which represents the proprietary interest- the Reg Ansetts, the Kerry Packers of this world- will have the right to appeal. But the other side which one hopes, if this legislation is interpreted generously, may represent the public interest effectively has no right to appeal on these important matters. It is an extraordinary provision for any Government senator who claims to be a lawyer to approve in this House of review. It is an extraordinary provision to go into any legislation which is passed by the Senate because of the consequence of it all. There can be all sorts of glib explanations for it in terms of particular subparagraphs of the proposed new section. But the fact that remains is simply this: It hangs as a sword of Damocles over the head of the Broadcasting Tribunal as to who can appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </para>
        <para>It should be borne in mind that in any adversary situation in the legal sense before the Broadcasting Tribunal, the parties do not come equally to the Broadcasting Tribunal in terms of power. There are no provisions in this legislation to assist members of the public in a financial sense who want to take proceedings or participate in proceedings before the Tribunal in regard to these very important matters. The financial power is all on one side, the side of the licensee who, in renewal proceedings, again is granted that additional right to appeal. It is totally unsatisfactory for the Minister or Government senators, as they probably will do, to get up and say, You must understand that this broadcasting legislation is just part of the whole scheme of things the whole grand design that we have for Australian broadcasting.' It is quite clear that there is no grand design; there is, in fact, a grand mess. </para>
        <para>If this legislation is passed we will of course be promised something else in 1984 or some such time, if the Government is returned to power, which will patch up the mess that is made today, but that is not satisfactory. After all, in 1976 we were told that broadcasting legislation to fix the whole thing up would be introduced in March 1977. We are now in November 1977, dealing with but a little bit of that legislation that was promised for March 1977, so it it completely unsatisfactory for the Senate to be fobbed off, in regard to its proper function of considering legislation, by the suggestion that in years to come these things will all be fixed up by a more benign, intelligent and interested government than, apparently, the one we have at the moment. </para>

          <para>- My understanding and advice is that the right of appeal is not restricted to any one interest at all. If there are any nuances to the argument they will be referred to my colleague for study. I find it, if I may say so in the best of charity, a strange homily that supporters of a Labor government which did nothing in the field except use its ministerial authority arbitrarily for three years should lecture this Government upon reform. In fact, that Government merely injected into the granting and policing of licences the arbitrary power of the politician. </para>

          <para>- I rise to direct attention briefly to the large number of matters which are included in Schedule 1 under the heading 'Minor and Consequential Amendments'. That is again, in my view, bad drafting, bad construction. A great many of the matters there included are neither minor nor totally consequential. Without going through them in detail I would, in view of the limited time available, merely direct the attention of the Senate to that fact. </para>

            <para>- In view of the circumstances in which we find ourselves today, when a great number of Bills have to be dealt with in a very limited time, I will make my comments brief. The arguments concerning education have during the last 12 months or so been canvassed widely in the Parliament and no doubt will be again during the course of the coming election campaign. I want to place on record that there have been two achievements of the Fraser Government in the field of education. The first has been that it has killed any hopes that have existed in this country, initiated by the efforts of the former Labor Government, to raise education in this country to standards which would enable every child at a government or non-government school, and later in the tertiary institution, to obtain the kind of education which that child wants. The second achievement of the Fraser Government has been the reactivation of the old State aid debate. In the last few weeks we have had question after question being put in this chamber to the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> by Government senators- we call them Dorothy Dixers- in response to which he has made it quite clear that he is happy to see the old State aid debate reactivated in this country, to the detriment of all school children in Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I deal firstly with the question of the hopes that have been destroyed by this Government. It is sufficient to say, without going into all the details of the education debate, that the States are now being starved of funds for education by this Government. Evidence of that appears in the figures which have been published in the Budget Papers. In the three years in which the Labor Government was in office it undertook the biggest task in education of any government in this country. We knew when we came to office in 1972 that, for the first time, a Federal government had to take it into its hands to stimulate education spending in this country. After 23 years of neglect by our predecessors, we had to do that and we did that. In those three years we increased the allocation to the States for education by an average each year of 41 per cent in real terms. This Government, which claims to have done so much for education, has frozen the funds for education this year. The real increase in two years of office of the Fraser Government has been one per cent. The record should be compared. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Education comes into this chamber and talks day after day at Question Time about how standards have been improved in the various States and claims credit for it for the present Government. Every educationist in Australia knows that the things that have been achieved in recent years have been achieved almost exclusively by the Whitlam Government -not by the Fraser Government. The intentions of the present Government ought to be made known. Every educationist and every parent in Australia should realise that what they have had over the past two years is only a taste of what they will get in the succeeding three years if the present Government happens to be in power after the next election. To make matters worse, the Government is also intending to transfer to the States so much of the expenditure in the tertiary sector- universities and colleges of advanced education- and it will do the same in respect of schools if it can possibly get away with it. It is all part of the federalism plan to transfer these financial responsibilities back to the States and to force the States into imposing a State income tax in Australia in 1 978 or 1 979. </para>
          <para>Yesterday and the day before the Minister had to admit that certain legislation which is on the Notice Paper does mean that the States will be able to impose a State income tax in the next two or three years. The Minister was reluctant to admit it, but the facts are there for all to see. The legislation will not be dealt with before the Parliament rises because the Government wants to hide the facts from the Australian people. There is no need for me to restate the arguments. The picture is quite clear. Fortunately the Australian people can see the picture in this issue quite clearly. A clear majority of Australians accept the fact that this Government has cut into education spending to the detriment of the government schools, the non-government schools and the tertiary sector. </para>
          <para>The second point I mentioned refers to the achievements of the Fraser Government. Not only is the Government responsible for a reactivation of the old state aid debate, but also it is part of the Government's decision not to accept the recommendations of the Schools Commission. I am speaking now specifically of schools. It has in fact instructed the Commission to obey its policy decisions. The evidence of that is shown clearly in the Schools Commission's report of this year. I believe that it is worth while quoting the relevant section to show just how the Commission itself is so concerned about the trend of thinking of this Government. The Schools Commission was formed in 1973 for the purpose of giving moneys to government and non-government schools on the basis of need so that the schools that had the greatest need in fact would get the appropriate assistance. One of the most important aspects of that was to ensure that the divisive government versus non-government schools debate would be brought to an end, and the Commission has done great work in that area. Let us consider what the Commission said in its report, which is in contrast to the Government 's direction to the Commission, forcing it to put money into high resource, high income non-government schools- not the poor Catholic schools or the poor non-government schools but what are called the levels 1 and 2 schools where the Commission had demonstrated that there was no justification for doing it. Before I deal with the section of the report where the Commission refers to the question of reactivating what is commonly called the state aid debate, at page 10 it had this to say about the Government's attitude towards putting more money into levels 1 and 2: </para>

            <para>Levels 1 and 2 schools - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the high resource non-government schools, the Melbourne Grammars and Sydney Grammars and so on- cannot be accorded priority for additional assistance within the funds available for 1978. As these schools already operate at levels above those of the national average their need for additional funds cannot be as great as other less well provided for schools. </para>
          <para class="block">Dealing with capital funds for the non-government area, the Commission made its attitude quite plain when it said:  the Commission does not believe that the situation in 1978 warrants the transfer of $3m out of other programs to make this possible. </para>
          <para class="block">Returning to the Commission's comments about the divisive nature of the Government's policies, it states at page 3 of the report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A feature of the Commission's work since its inception has been its success in drawing together the diverse interests in government and non-government sectors. Traditional barriers between these sectors have been substantially reduced and individuals and groups within them have been encouraged to work together in the common interests of educating all Australian school children to the best possible standards. The operation of the Commission's joint programs and the development of formal and informal planning relationships between government and non-government schools and systems are significant examples of the evolution of this concensus. This is a major outcome of the Commission's work over the past four years and indeed may be one of the major achievements of the Commonwealth in its role in Australian education. The Commission views with great concern the implications of the guidelines for the maintenance of the situation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the most damning indictment, the most damning statement on a government policy that I have ever read in the report of a statutory body. It is saying to the Government of this country that it is on the wrong track, that it is undoing the work that has been done over the past three or four years by the Schools Commission. The Schools Commission knows the motivation behind it. This Minister purports to know better than the Schools Commission, with all the resources behind it to determine the needs of schools in both the government and non-government sectors. Yet the Government has the hide to turn around and tell the Commission that it does not know what the real needs are, that the Government knows better than the Commission and will direct it to put funds into those schools. Is it any wonder that the Commission, which is composed of educationists from across the whole spectrum of education in Australia, including the Catholic schools and the government schools, the governments themselves, universities and academic people, unanimously decided on the recommendations made in this report? The Minister has answered Dorothy Dix questions during Question Time, trying to make out a case for the wealthy schools, sucking up to the wealthy non-government schools that he and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the other people went to. That is the reason it is all being done. Whether the Minister went to such a school I do not know. </para>

              <para>-I will take that back about the Minister, but a lot of his colleagues did, and that is where their real interests lie. The Commission was formed to put a stop to all that. As it has stated in its report, it made so much progress towards stopping it but now this Government wants to undo that progress for the sake of some cheap political advantage. These people talk about class, privilege and so on, and say that the Labor Party does not like to help anybody who is successful, and all that sort of nonsense. We like to help the people which authorities such as the Schools Commission have identified as people, schools and systems which need assistance. That was the purpose of our action. That is what we created. That is what the Government is trying to destroy. I do not intend to go any longer because there are many other Bills to be dealt with today. I close by saying, as I said earlier, that the Australian people are awake to what is being done by this Government in the educational field. I only say that in the succeeding three years- if this Government happens to be returned on 10 December- the situation will get a lot worse than it has been over the last two years. We are dealing cognately with two Bills, namely, the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill.

            <para>- in reply- I shall be very brief. I simply recite a few facts. For the calendar year 1976 the Whitlam Government in its last year cut education in Australia by $ 105m- the only cut which education has suffered. The Whitlam Government also set aside triennium funding, froze student allowances at the June 1974 figure and was able to have the Schools Commission say of it that in its three years of office the gap in respect of resources between government schools and non-government schools had widened to the detriment of the non-government schools. That is the record which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> is inviting us to deal with. What a pity he did not read or hear the speech which the very distinguished Australian Labor Party Minister for Education in the Whitlam Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beazley,</inline> made two days ago. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> said today is profoundly rejected by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beazley. Senator Wriedt</inline> would not have made his statements about the divisiveness of state aid if he had, in fact, thought to read what that very worthwhile former Minister said. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> was using the Schools Commission to talk about the divisiveness of state aid. This is what the former Minister said: </para>

            <para>I do appeal to the Schools Commission to come back to the conception we had about its work, that is, that it is quite  irrelevant to the Commonwealth whether an Australian citizen happens to be a child in a government school or a child in a non-government school. They are all Australian citizens. </para>

          <para class="block">So the honourable member went on. I commend him thoroughly for those remarks.

              <para>- Yes, faster than Karmel envisaged. So, in everything which has been said today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> there is a fundamental denial implicit in what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beazley</inline> has said. The Schools Commission which has been used to berate us has said that the maintenance of effort in all government schools has been exceeded. It went on to prove that in three States the whole secondary system had risen to the level 2 category. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> says that moneys should not be applied to level 2 non-government schools, but he is quite happy to have moneys applied to level 2 government schools. He talks about divisiveness! That is the scandal of the Labor Party. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I simply say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beazley</inline> has given the answer to that statement. It was necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beazley</inline> to invite the Schools Commission to understand that we are all Australians and not people divided. This, of course, is the message that the Government will carry out. The Government does not believe that the gap should continue to widen as it did under the Labor Government. This Government believes that assistance to government schools should be increased substantially. When the Government came to office it in fact reversed the adverse decisions of the Labor Government. It reversed the cuts in education and gave in fact a two per cent real money growth. The Government set up a rolling triennium program and it unfroze student allowances. Now it is argued that the Government is guilty because it is attempting to do something about the widening gap. The fact is that opportunities are now available for all students in the field of tertiary education. The Government has brought to the under-privileged education groups- the 750,000 people in the technical and further education field in co-partnership with universities and colleges-something that the Labor Party profoundly rejected. This Government has extended help to the under-privileged, the disadvantaged, children in institutions and children living in isolated areas. </para>
          <para>Need I go on? The whole thrust of the Government's policies has been to help and to lift from disadvantage to equality of opportunity. The document from the Schools Commission that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> seeks to use against the Government is the most profound record of this Government 's achievement in uplifting government school standards. This is an example of the very federalism which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> seeks to berate. No doubt the Labor Party intends to reverse the Government's federalism policies. The honourable senator has been very silent on that point. No doubt a Labor Party government would go back to the taxation policies of the Whitlam Government that trebled income tax, doubled sales tax, doubled the rates of customs and excise and so on. The very federalism policy of the Government has given the Schools Commission the opportunity to note that the States are capable of improvement above maintenance of effort. I think we have a proud record. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beazley</inline> has noted, the Government has exceeded the Karmel targets. </para>

              <para>-Senator Wriedt laughs, but the facts are against him. During a time of great economic restraint due to an economic condition created artificially by the Labor Government, the present Government has given top priority to education and will continue to do so in the future. In two years the Government has introduced more major reforms, through the Williams committee, through the Tertiary Education Commission and through a whole range of reforms, than the Labor Party ever dreamed of. This Government has acted. Members of the Opposition have prattled. I commend the two Bills to the Senate. </para>

How could any honourable senator on this side of the chamber possibly get to his feet to speak while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> was still speaking? I want to make it clear to the Government that the arrangements have broken down today because of the procedures that have been adopted. Sessions often have come to a rather rapid and constricted close, but we have had the necessary discussion to ensure maximum debate on what the Opposition considered to be the most important of the Bills in respect of which there was to be some shortage of debating time. The Leader of the Government must accept the responsibility for what has happened today because this morning he immediately took it for granted that there could be no discussion or arrangement on the time limits for various Bills, that there could be no discussion on whether we could limit the time of speakers in the debate. We have always had this arrangement but today it is not to be the case. We came in to the Senate and immediately had steamroller tactics adopted by the Government. </para>

We realise that the Government needs to get its legislation through before the proroguing of the House of Representatives tomorrow. I am sorry to have to make these comments today. On previous occasions on these last sitting days we have been able to arrange to have as much debate as possible and still meet the requirements of the transport officers to get honourable senators away. The Opposition has moved certain amendments and I have taken this opportunity to speak in order to ensure that those who wish to speak on this Bill will be able to do so. </para>

            <para>- I wish to speak briefly because what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has done is raise the question of arrangements between the Whips which, as I understand it, is not a matter for discussion in the Senate. Such arrangements have no formal status in the Senate and it becomes a matter of embarrassment when there are allegations that there has been some departure from arrangements. It becomes an embarrassment which it is impossible to resolve in the public arena. I simply put on record that as far as I am concerned the normal procedure in this place will be followed and if the Opposition chooses to indicate whether it has speakers on a Bill I will follow my normal practice of providing you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> with a list which shows the names of those honourable senators who it has been indicated to me have an interest in speaking. Of course, whether or not you call those honourable senators is a ma'ter for your discretion, as it always is, but I suppose you would have no objection to my saying that in 99 cases out of 100-1 can think of only one exception in the last two years- you follow the list that has been given to you. </para>

One of the unfortunate things about parliamentary proceedings when the chamber is under pressure is as to time. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> that at the completion of each of the sittings with which he and I have been associated there has been heavy pressure of legislation in the last couple of days. But it is unfortunate that so much of the limited time - </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator interjects, 'Whose fault is that?'. But, of course, in such a situation no government has been without fault. It is no good referring back to situations in the past such as when the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> closed the debate on 43 Bills. It is a fact that in every session of the Senate I have ever attended- half of those were while the Australian Labor Party was in government and half have been while our parties have been in governmentthe same problem concerning the passing of legislation has arisen. The only additional point I wanted to make, before that interjection interfered with my train of thought, was that it is extraordinary when we are in this situation that so much of the available time is spent on technical matters, whether they be the calling of quorums or argument about the procedures which are being followed. This limits still further the amount of time that can be spent on debate. I simply say to the Opposition that if we are to have any sensible debate on any of the matters which remain before us, we ought to make that our objective. </para>

            <para>- I refer to Part HI of the State Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill 1977 which deals with non-government schools. I. take the opportunity at the Committee stage to correct a statement made by the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> during the second reading debate. He has made the statement publicly. He said that the Schools Commission referred to the marked gap between the resources available to government and non-government schools. It is a poor situation when a Minister deliberately drops a word from a quotation. In fact, he did that in a newspaper article some months ago. The Commission did not speak about the marked gap between government and non-government schools. It said government and most non-government schools'. If one reads that phrase in the context of the Commission's report, one sees that the Commission was excluding those non-government schools to which this Government directed it to grant more money. I believe that is a matter which ought to be brought to the attention of the Committee so that the position can be made clear and so that the Commission can be defended. Its report has been distorted by the Minister. I repeat that the Commission was emphasising that there was a gap between the resources available to government and most non-government schools, but not to all non-government schools. The Commission has been consistent and it has maintained its traditional position of emphasising the provision of additional resources to those lower level, low resource non-government schools- a position which the Australian Labor Party strongly supports. </para>

            <para>- I would like certain aspects of the State Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1977 to be clarified. Clause 9 (5) (b) refers to the numbers of students at affiliated colleges and provides that one-half of the number of resident full time post graduate students at that student residence or affiliated college in that year shall be included in the number of residents in that particular college in addition to the full time undergraduate students. I ask the Minister: Has this been a long standing practice? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Clause 17 (4), on page 19 of the Bill, contains no reference to post graduate students in colleges of advanced education. I imagine that there are now post graduate students at colleges of advanced education, even though they might be few in number. If there are post graduate students at colleges of advanced education, why would a similar situation not prevail for them as applies for university students at affiliated colleges? In respect of clause 28 (5) (b), I am unable to see how the amount of $132,607,000 is obtained. Would that figure have been arrived at arbitrarily, or does something in the Bill indicate that such a figure should appear in this particular clause? </para>

            <para>- The answer to the first question is yes, it is a long standing practice. Post graduate students account for half the numbers. As to the second question, relating to colleges of advanced education, to my knowledge there are no post graduate students at those colleges. However, there might well be post graduate students at those colleges, and if that is so one would want to treat them equally with other post graduate students. With respect to the honourable senator's third question, my advisers remind me that the amount of $ 132m appearing in clause 28 represents the sum of capital amounts available. What the honourable senator said is correct. </para>

            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Copies of the amendment are in the process of being circulated to honourable senators. Since this Government came to power it has become the practice in the Senate on the last day of sitting of all sessions of the Parliament to debate Bills dealing with primary industry. It strikes me as a fair comment that the problems associated with Australian agriculture are receiving very little priority. In fact, they are always at the bottom of the legislative list. I always find myself on the last day of a parliamentary sitting commenting upon the fact that Bills are not receiving sufficient consideration by the Senate and that the Government obviously looks on the problem of Australian agriculture as one of the low priority jobs. </para>
          <para>We are all aware of the fact that there are grave difficulties facing practically every sector of the rural industry. The problems associated with the apple and pear industry have been with us for the whole of the 1970s. We are required from year to year to deal with matters affecting the industry in the form of some stabilisation of the industry itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> is handling these Bills. I am reminded that on a number of occasions he has made statements in the Senate and elsewhere that the industry itself has to take the measures to put its own house in order. That is leaving the Government out of the picture and accepting the principle that sectors of the industry should in some way or other in their diversity and different geographical locations come together in some coherence and order and take the necessary steps to resolve the problems they face. That is pie in the sky. We believe that governments have an obligation to give leadership, take initiatives and bring in the sort of legislative processes to which the industry can respond. </para>
          <para>Again, we find ourselves in a critical state of mind in relation to this industry. We do not disagree with the general steps outlined but we believe that the proposed assistance is not adequate and that more needs to be done by the Government. It is clear that if the Government is really sincere about helping Australian agriculture it should be giving a lot more time and attention to the diversification of problems which are obviously occurring not only within the industry but also within the regions of the industry. There are specific problems in the apple and pear industry relating to the apples produced in Tasmania. Tasmania produces two-thirds of the total export trade. Therefore whatever happens on overseas markets has an importance relevance to those whose livelihood, investment and future are tied up with stabilising the industry. </para>
          <para>The purposes of the first Apple and Pear Stabilization Bill was to bring about some stability. That type of ad hoc legislation has been continued in the subsequent seven years. It is not difficult to say that the restructuring of the industry is continuing. But there has been a tendency by many people involved in agriculture in Australia to diversify their interest from the growing of fruit to other forms of agricultural activity. Because of the general nature of the problem facing agriculture, that is not a very palatable alternative nor is it a profitable alternative. Of course, when we have changes in the export market for apples and pears, then the industry faces a very serious problem. </para>
          <para>I was somewhat surprised to read of the debate that took place in the other place because when my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scholes</inline> moved the amendment which I am suggesting should be considered by the Senate today, he was berated by the Tasmanian members, all of whom are up for election and, therefore, whom one would have expected to have shown a bit more interest in the problems facing the apple and pear industry in Tasmania. The last time the Senate dealt with this matter it actually carried an amendment, with the support of the Tasmanian senators, in which concern was expressed about the inability of the industry to reach a stable position. The Government has not taken that into consideration. It has turned its back on that and we find Tasmanian members of the House of Representatives, who are all up for election and whom one would expect to be much more interested in the plight of the industry, making statements that the support is not required. I find it difficult to appreciate how they can come to that conclusion. Within the second reading speech and in the representations that have been made to the Labor Party by the industry in Tasmania the point is made. In a telegram sent to me the executive director of the State Marketing Authority, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Windas</inline> Smith stated, in part: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The best way to overcome this problem is to increase Commonwealth contribution to supplementary support scheme say $3 for each $ 1 from State sources. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is precisely what the Opposition believes should be adopted in this place. The Opposition proposes therefore to move an amendment to that effect. I cannot understand the illogical thinking of those Liberal Party or National Country Party Members of the House of Representatives who take the view that there is not a problem in the apple and pear industry in Tasmania. As recently as less than a month ago newspapers circulating in Tasmania have drawn attention to the problem. I cannot share the enthusiasm, although I concede that there has been some minor improvement, that has been expressed in the other place that the recurring stabilisation schemes are doing anything substantial to alter the very unsatisfactory state of income of those who have investment and activities related to the growing of apples and pears. </para>
          <para>Clearly, the Government has not taken any steps to extend or promote employment retraining schemes for apple and pear orchardists. If we are going to talk about restructuring the industry we must have a plan of what we are going to do with those people who wish to leave the industry. As honourable senators know, something like 40 per cent of those in the industry have left it in recent years. They go to the cities or to some other location and there are no effective steps to retrain them. No one can tell me what they are to do with their time and their skills. Surely this comes within the purview of government responsibility. If people are to be encouraged to leave agriculturethat has been the basis of all the rural readjustment schemes- I want someone on the Government side to tell us what we are to do with the people. We are supposed to be concerned about people. We are supposed to be concerned about their economic future. We are supposed to be concerned about their capacity to play a meaningful part in the economy of this country yet there is no training scheme adequate to train these people who have geographic problems, location problems, who cannot be readily absorbed from that particular industry to which I am referring, the apple and pear industry- it applies equally to other readjustment schemesinto some other form of industrial or rural activity. </para>
          <para>That surely has to be recognised as part of the responsibilities of government. I cannot accept the philosophical position that Government supporters take that the private sector can stand on its own two feet and that the individual should be making his own decisions. The purpose of government is to lend its resources and experience, its assistance to those who, for a whole variety of reasons, find that they are unable to continue in the ways they had previously operated. </para>

              <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting I was drawing attention to the debate on this legislation in the other place. I find it difficult to appreciate the reasoning behind the following statement made by one Government supporter in that debate: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>As I said, this year the support is not required; the growers do not need it. It is not of much use giving the growers the money if they cannot use it. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That statement seems to me to indicate that Tasmanian members have no appreciation of the problem not only in their own State but also in the rest of the industry throughout Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">There are certain differences in the industry in different States. The Opposition's amendment does not distinguish between States. It might be argued that in some States the problem is more acute. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the sort of assistance proposed in the amendment could be said to be a waste of public funds. On every fair assessment of the state of the industry, the assistance is needed. </para>
          <para>The Opposition has moved its amendment, recognising the plight of the export section of the apple and pear industry throughout Australia which requires this assistance. Therefore, I think we are entitled to say that Government supporters from Tasmania are out of touch with reality, out of touch with the needs of the industry and out of touch with the economic problems that face the industry. I think we are entitled also to say that the Government has done precious little to reduce the cost of distribution and shipping. As a consequence, cost increases have eaten into the return to the apple and pear grower. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show a rate of inflation of 13.1 per cent for the year ended September 1977. That inflation flows right through the cost structure. The problems to which I have referred in the last two debates concerning apple and pear stabilisation need to be examined carefully by the Government. </para>
          <para>The Opposition believes that the $3 a box for apples and the $1.20 a box for pears are necessary to keep the apple and pear growers alive until a Labor government is elected and effective restructuring arrangements are introduced. In those circumstances we are of the view that the Senate ought to look seriously at our proposition, as it did on the last occasion when we were able to prevail upon a sufficient number of Government senators to support a proposal that the Government have a fresh look at this industry. We did so not because we wanted to alter the Government's legislation but because we felt that a mere repetition of previous assistance measures did not go to the heart of the problem, did not really recognise the economic factors, did not recognise the human factors and did not recognise that the industry requires much more encouragement and assistance from the Australian Government. </para>
          <para>So often when people talk about assistance to the various industries of this country they tend to place some of the blame on the States. We have heard a lot about the much vaunted federalism policy. It has been said that, because of that policy, the States are in a position to come to the aid of different sectors pf industry. If that is to be the way in which federalism works, it negates the whole principle. Export matters are within the province of the Federal Government and therefore Federal Government assistance should be the principal component of assistance to the apple and pear industry. In the light of those circumstances and recognising that time does not permit a full debate on this issue, I urge the Senate to support my amendment and to give serious consideration to the propositions which the Opposition has put before it. </para>

            <para>-Time is short today and we do not have long to deal with a great number of matters; so I shall be as brief as possible. This is a matter of very considerable importance which should not be dealt with in the somewhat flippant or political way in which the Opposition has dealt with it today. I support the legislation. It is important legislation dealing with an important industry- an industry which is of great importance to my State of Tasmania and of very considerable importance to Australia as a whole. It is an industry which not only provides some of the basic foodstuffs to the people of Australia it is also an important export earner. It is an industry which has had its troubles. It is an industry which over recent years has had a great deal of troubles. Two things have happened recently, particularly to the industry in Tasmania but generally, which make the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> totally inappropriate. One thing that has happened is that the industry is enjoying the best overseas markets for years, and that is something about which we all should be saying Thank God '. Thank God that an industry which has had these troubles is able at the moment to say that it will not need a government support scheme this year. The legislation proposes a continuation of the existing scheme which was barely used or barely necessary in the last season because the market returns to the producers were sufficient. It is expected that a similar situation will prevail in the forthcoming season. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The last time legislation of this type came before the chamber I expressed my concern in more ways than one. I have been delighted to And that the fears I expressed at the time did not eventuate. It may be that next year this very volatile and variable overseas market will cause the Government to do more for the apple and pear growers of Australia. With the best overseas markets for a long time and with the introduction by this Government of the freight equalisation scheme, which has enabled the Tasmanian growers to compete on an equal basis in the Australian domestic market for apples and pears, the situation is not such as was described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline> Whilst I agreed with his general expressions of concern I felt that he was out of touch with the reality of the moment. So I do not accept his criticisms of the attitude of the Tasmanian members in the House of Representatives. Those Tasmanian members are far more sensitive and far more in touch with the reality of the situation than is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline> The industry is, from every inquiry that I have been able to make, quite happy to accept the current proposal of $2 per box of apples. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck)</inline> has battled very hard for the apple growers of Tasmania, and I believe that of the jobs that have been done by any member of the House of Representatives his has been an excellent job. In his speech, which is reported on page 2991 of the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> of 7 November, he read a telegram which he received and which I believe is best summarised in the first few words of the telegram. The telegram is from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Windas</inline> Smith, the executive director of the State marketing authority in relation to apples, and it reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Current maximum support of $2 per bushel for apples is appropriate . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Windas</inline> Smith and the other industry representatives with whom I have spoken say that they regard the assistance as appropriate at the moment and that the scheme is unlikely even to be used this year, I am quite prepared to say that if the industry is happy there is no reason for the Parliament to intervene in the somewhat hypocritical way in which I believe the Labor Party's amendment has come before this chamber. It has come before the chamber from a party which did more to destroy primary industry in Australia than any other party has done in any similar period of government. I do not have the time to elaborate on that statement, but I do not think I need to. I think everyone in this chamber is familiar with what was done to destroy primary industry. Need I do more than simply say that the farmers of Australia, the primary producers, who were told by the former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> that they had never had it so good, responded to him in very clear terms in December 1975 as they will again in December 1977. </para>

              <para>-I see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> feels that politics is a betting matter. I suppose it is a matter of chance at times. I do not think that there is any uncertainty at all as to what the Australian people will do in December. They will not be interested in re-electing the most disastrous government that it has ever been the misfortune of Australia to have to put up with. We could talk about what that Government did by way of the creation of inflation and the creation of unemployment and the destruction of primary industry in so many ways. If one were to get into a debate on those matters, a debate I would have thoroughly enjoyed had we had more time, one could talk about things like the Australian Rural Bank, which we are about to introduce and about which the Labor Party did nothing, and all the other things, but let us leave that to the hustings. </para>

          <para>I simply take the opportunity to indicate on behalf of Tasmanians that we will support the industry in the same way that we have in the past. If it needs fighting for, we will tight for it. If the apple turns sour in the future so far as overseas marketing is concerned, I am quite certain I speak for my Tasmanian colleagues in both Houses when I say that we will be the first to say to the Government that something needs to be done. At the moment I do not propose to support what I regard as a totally hypocritical political exercise by an opposition which has done more to destroy the people which it is now pretending it will help than has ever been done. </para>

If he really believes his own assertion that the assistance will not be called upon he has no rational reason for voting against this amendment. We have seen from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> a repetition of the cant and humbug that Liberal Party members from Tasmania in the House of Representatives have always displayed on this issue. We know the esteem with which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> holds the honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck).</inline> The Prime Minister endearingly called him a grub and told him to crawl back into the apple. </para>

          <para>The other matter I wish to refute is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> allegation that the Labor Government destroyed primary industry.

For the present financial year, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has forecast a further 16 per cent decline in net farm income. Regardless of whatever may have happened to primary industry under previous governments, that fact is pertinent to what is happening to primary industry under this Government. </para>

            <para>- It is pretty clear that we have been sitting for six weeks and that we normally sit for two weeks. We are dealing with a series of Bills designed to assist the apple and pear industry. The purpose of the Bills was carefully explained in the second reading speech. The purpose is to extend the support provided under the stabilisation scheme. It will be based on a maximum level of support of $2 a box. The maximum quantity eligible for support is two million boxes. Support will be limited to sales 'at risk' to Europe, including the United Kingdom. This will also apply to pear exports and will be based on a price of 80c per box. The maximum quantity eligible for support will be 1.4 million boxes, again for sales 'at nsk'. It has not been mentioned in the debate but I think it could be mentioned usefully as the second reading speech states that the Australian Government is consulting with the States on an assistance program for 1978 which could involve an additional $lm to assist apple exports to Europe including the United Kingdom. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The scheme has been operating since 1971. Therefore it was introduced by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. It was carried on during the time of the Labor Governmentthat period of great unhappiness for us all. It is now being continued by the current Government, It has been very important for the apple States, particularly Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. It provides a measure of stability which is badly needed. The apple and pear industry is an uncertain industry. It has problems; we all know that. I think that this continuation of support will allow the industry further time to adjust. That might become necessary. The number of apple-bearing trees has fallen by 25 per cent during the past four years, and the volume of exports has fallen to about half the 1975 level. So it is obviously an industry that has had problems, that needed stabilisation and needed some time to readjust itself. </para>
          <para>There are some hopeful signs about the 1977 export market return, but these are not finally known yet. European apple market prices were exceptionally high because of poor crops in Europe following the 1976 drought. There was a reduction in supplies from other southern hemisphere countries. So things may look a little brighter. I underline the word 'may'. I trunk it is mentioned in the second reading speech that we are dealing with a volatile market scene. The 1978 prospects for prices in Europe are really looking more favourable than we had expected a couple of years ago. All in all, those are particularly good features at the current time. </para>
          <para>The amendment of course is not supported. I think there is no mention in the second reading speech of the Industries Assistance Commission's work in this area. Therefore in order to complete my remarks I have looked into this subject. The apple and pear stabilisation scheme was the subject of a recent IAC inquiry, as a result of which the Government's decision to extend the scheme to 1977-78 has been taken. It can be shown that the Government has main;tained the level of support at this level for three years now, despite the IAC recommendations that the scheme should be discontinued after 1977. </para>
          <para>Sometimes we hear contrary remarks, although not very often in this chamber, I must say, because it tends to contain a fairly sensible group of people. We see lots of stuff in the newspapers from time to time lecturing us all about protection and so forth and how important it is that the IAC recommendations be taken as the last word of God. Here is a particular case in which primary industries, which tend to think that they do not get much of a fair go, have been particularly helped by the Government. The Government has said to the IAC: 'We do not agree with the recommendations in this case. We will go further and do more to help'. I think that shows that the Government behaves sensibly in all cases. It believes in the maintenance of support at this level. It believes that the scheme will assist the industry. It has confidence in the industry and it equally has confidence in members of its parties from Tasmania and other States who, if the industry again suffers difficulty and needs adjustment and help, will bring forward, as they always do, propositions both with sense and wise argument. They are taken account of by the Government. As honourable senators can understand, the Government will in no way support the amendment. I also mention that the matter was canvassed in the same form in the House of Representatives, where the amendment was also rejected. </para>

              <para>-That being so the Senate is now debating the Customs Tariff Validation Bill (No. 3) 1977 and the Customs Amendment Bill 1977.

          <para>The Customs Amendment Bill is an attempt to overcome the drug problem in Australia. The Opposition certainly agrees that the drug problem is of great concern to Australia and is in need of urgent solution. Therefore we do not oppose that Bill. The Bill is based on the assumption that the existence of more severe punishment will deter drug traffickers. In view of the enormous profits that are reaped by drug traffickers and in view of the exploitative effects of these people on the youth of Australian society, it seems only appropriate that the financial and penal sanctions imposed on offenders should be increased. The Bill provides for penalties of up to $100,000 or up to 25 years imprisonment, or both, for drug trafficking offences. As that was the recommendation of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence, the Opposition accepts those penalties as being appropriate. </para>
          <para>It is important to note that my colleague, the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen),</inline> pointed out in the House of Representatives that many drug traffickers are also drug addicts who have entered the trafficking business to keep themselves supplied in funds and in drugs. These people may well be the unfortunate sufferers of the more severe penalties to be imposed under this legislation. That sort of person needs help, and we would hope that the application of penalties that will come into effect under this legislation will occur in a qualified and compassionate manner. </para>
          <para>As the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare recently reported in its very excellent report on drug trafficking, Australian governments have never committed themselves to any substantive and comprehensive policy on drugs. Drug abuse in Australia has been dealt with in a rather piecemeal fashion. There is obviously clear and urgent need for government to provide a comprehensive framework to deal with all aspects of the drug abuse problem. Because this Bill deals with only one aspect of the problem it may well have only a limited impact on the overall purview of the situation. For the reasons I have mentioned, the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I thank the Senate for its support of these measures. I think it is recognised- the comment has been made- that the drug problem is a wide social as well as a legal problem. However, the fact remains that enormous profits are being made by particularly evil members of the community who are prepared to traffic in drugs for their own large profits. Certainly the penalties that are now being introduced in these measures are designed to provide an adequate and proper sanction for that. Hopefully they will be a realistic deterrant to those people. </para>

            <para>- These two measures to which the Senate is giving consideration are important pieces of legislation. The Labor Party does not propose to oppose the schemes which the Government is putting before the Senate for its deliberation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The measures are proposed in order to give effect to the Government's package of assistance to the beef cattle industry, assistance that one must say is somewhat belated. It has been introduced only since it has been apparent to anyone associated with agriculture that the beef industry is in a state of acute crisis, desperation and near-bankruptcy; that the vast majority in the industry, especially in Queensland, because of its dependence on the export market, are struggling to survive. In various other parts of Australia the beef industry also is in such desperate straits that there is need for Government intervention and assistance. It is worth while to bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that the proposed assistance came not only after the plight of the industry was obvious but also after motions of no confidence had been moved against the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> in several centres throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>I wish to refer particularly to the first such motion of no confidence which, in February of this year, was moved by the Farmers Union of Western Australia. That was to be followed by similar motions in other parts df Australia, more importantly that which was carried at the end of September last at the Cattlemen 's Union Conference in Toowoomba. As the plight of the beef producer has become more noticeable and acute we have seen develop a growing militancy among farmers in this industry. It is a shame that the Government moved only after the problem had reached such proportions that Government intervention provided the only way in which producers could be saved from economic ruin. </para>
          <para>That militancy among farmers is continuing to develop throughout Australia. Only today we heard that leading figures in the beef industry are considering running independent Country Party candidates in the forthcoming Federal election. When we look at what happened at the Toowoomba conference we know why this legislation is before the Senate. The Brigalow Lands Agreement legislation was first adopted in 1962. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has now become aware of the deficiencies and inadequacies of the representation that has been given primary industry by the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair.</inline> The motion of no confidence which was carried overwhelmingly, at the Toowoomba conference contrasts startingly with the rousing reception that was accorded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator may laugh, but many farm industry leaders have expressed to me the wish that someone of the calibre of Bob Hawke would represent people in the agricultural areas of Australia. Obviously they feel the need for militant representation, which they are not getting now, to protect their interests. That proposition has over the last year been put to me consistently by farm leaders. I am only expressing their view that this Government has let them down; that they need a representative with the charisma and drive of Bob Hawke to lead them to the promised land that has not been reached under this Government. </para>

              <para>- Honourable senators may be vexed to learn of these murmurings of dissent, that there is such dissidence in the farming community because the Government has failed it time and time again. I repeat it, it was not until the crisis had almost reached the point of no return that the Government acted. Of course, in Queensland that disenchantment will become apparent in the results of the election next weekend. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We do not oppose the scheme because we realise that once the present state of desperation in the industry has been reached Government intervention and assistance is desirable, but we are of the view, and would hope the Government would accept it as constructive criticism, that if there were effective administration of the States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Act, which was passed by the Parliament almost a year ago there would be no need for additional legislation. That body was given the responsibility of dealing with this kind of difficulty. Clearly there are deficiencies within the administration of that Act. The measures are also restricted insofar as their impact is concerned, especially the proposal to defer payments by the brigalow land settlers in Queensland. It relates only to that area. I concede and the Opposition concedes that a very difficult situation exists in central and southwestern Queensland. But there are other areas in Australia that also are in a serious and parlous plight. The Government must surely accept some blame for its inability to extend the provisions applying in this case to those other disaster areas. </para>
          <para>The beef incentives payment provides for the payment of $10 a head with a limit of $2,000 to each beef cattle producer. That will do only one thing. It will see him over his current difficulties. It will not solve his problem. It will just keep him alive for a short period. The cost of the administration of this proposal will be high. For the beef cattle producers in extreme circumstances it will hardly touch the bottom of the barrel especially after the cost of mustering the cattle for spraying for disease treatment has been deducted. Supporters of the Government must accept that there are very serious limitations to this proposal that the Senate is discussing. </para>
          <para>I am sure that all members of the Senate will agree with me when I say that the problems of the beef industry will not be solved until more markets are found and the trade in export beef is increased. I know that there have been some positive achievements in this respect, but they have not been good enough. It was said in 1975 that if a Liberal-Country Party government were elected it would expand the areas of export, it would find new markets and it would solve the problems of denial of access to markets for our beef producers. That has not happened. It is easy to talk at election time about what one is going to do. In 1974, when we had problems with meat prices in Australia, we had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser, Mr Anthony</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> advising the beef producers of Australia, whose herds at that stage numbered 28 million, that they ought to get them up to around 40 million. Thank God they did not and that the size of the herds increased to only 32 million or 33 million. Every person who bought into the industry at that time, unless he has access to extraordinary resources, has found himself in a parlous financial position. </para>
          <para>The Government will say in this debate that it has done what can be done to obtain markets for beef, but I say that it has not done enough. Recently the British Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Silkin, visited Australia. He was here only two months ago. He said that there was no chance of the European Economic Community 's common agricultural policy being changed and no chance of Australia getting the considerably greater access that it needs to that market. The Government sent John Howard to Europe as Minister for Special Trade Negotiations. I think it has to be said that he has come back empty handed; that the door was closed in his face. He was quoted in the Australian newspapers as saying on his trip back to Australia several days ago that there are some prospects- that is about all that is being said- of getting access to markets overseas. That is not enough. We were told during the last election campaign that the present Government would get access to export markets. It has failed dismally to do that. </para>
          <para>The Government also promised to restructure the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. It has failed to do that. It has failed to make it a dynamic, vigorous marketing organisation. It has left that organisation with its hands tied behind its back, without the effective powers that are needed to increase the domestic consumption of meat and to allow it to become more active and competitive in world markets. We note that the Government belatedly has provided funds for the introduction of carcass classification. Those are matters which have been on the agenda for a number of years, as you will concede, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline></para>
          <para>The plight of the beef industry has been getting noticeably worse, and the industry leaders and those in the industry itself have constantly put forward proposals which at least would have provided some chance of improvement in the economics of the industry. Now we are asked to approve a very minor step, and we do that; but we suggest to the Government, as we have done time and time again, that if it will come forward with a scheme to alter drastically the whole structure of the industry, a scheme that will bring stability to the industry and provide funds and encouragement to enable it to survive, it will have the support of the Opposition. In those circumstances, the Opposition is not prepared to do more than offer constructive criticism and support for the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support the two measures before the Senate- the Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Bill and the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill. In my area, the two are matters intrinsically linked. The brigalow area was founded around Rockhampton with schemes 1, 2 and 3. Schemes 1 and 2 have been going for some considerable time and some of the participants in them have been able to get established in a small way. Unfortunately, in the brigalow 3 area the story is not quite so rosy because the participants were not able to get on their feet before the disastrous beef slump hit them. Queensland might not be the largest beef producing State, but it does have the largest number of specialist beef producers, and therein lies a peculiar problem for Queensland. Whereas in many other areas the beef producers also produce grains and wool and are able to exploit seasonal conditions in order to get a quick return from a cash crop, the specialist beef producers do not have the luxury of those alternatives. The brigalow beef producer has a peculiar problem in that a large amount of capital was invested to enable him to go on to his block. Large areas of land had to be cleared and fenced and improvements had to be made in order to make him viable, Because of those factors the brigalow beef producers were not able to get their heads above water before the disastrous slump hit them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In this legislation the Government has recognised that it does have some responsibility. It has been said that these people did not have their arms twisted to force them to go on to the settlements, but they were encouraged by both the State and Federal governments. In this legislation the Government is accepting some responsibility and recognising the need to provide assistance by declaring a moratorium on repayments and interest rates in order to help them over their problems. At the same time, assistance is being provided to all beef producers under the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill. A cash grant will be made, and the cash wil be payable when they take certain measures,* such as upgrading their herds or spaying females up to two years old so that the large cattle numbers in Australia can be brought down. </para>
          <para>Both these measures are quite practical. They will be of immediate assistance and, we hope, will give a bit of heart to these people and help them to stay on the land and become viable producers. As this Government said when it took office in 1975, its main aim was to reduce the inflation that was inbuilt in our economy. Any help that we might have provided would have been negated if we had not reduced costs. It would have been eaten up completely. The Government took a very hard Une but a responsible position in relation to inflation and the Australian economy. At long last we are starting to see those actions bear fruit. </para>

              <para>- I do not know where the honourable senator got his figures. The internal statistics are far different from that. At long last we are starting to see our efforts bear fruit. Not only are we giving assistance but it is real assistance because the cost structure is starting to come down. At long last beef producers will start to have a bit of heart. It must be quite devastating when one is probably a third or fourth generation beef producer to see aU one's efforts and the efforts of one's forefathers dissipated completely through no fault of oneself; not through bad management or bad seasons but just through some quirk of fortune which is completely outside one's control. That is what has happened to this industry. </para>

The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> is to be congratulated. He has copped ridicule during the last few years but things have been completely out of his control as he and his Government have grappled with the situation to try to get viability back into this industry. We all admit that these are small measures but they are designed to assist within the overall strategies and policies of this Government which are directed towards getting our country viable again. We have pulled it back from the brink. We believe it is on the way up. I commend these Bills to the Senate and congratulate the Minister and the Government for the measures they are taking to try to give heart to people and to get viability back into industry. </para>

            <para>- The Senate, in a cognate debate, is debating the Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Bill 1977 and the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill 1977. 1 shall confine my remarks to the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill. Today we are faced with the situation where we have 17 Bills on the Notice Paper plus two Appropriation Bills. Whilst many people in the Government claim time and time again that this is a House of review, we find that all of this legislation will be railroaded through the Parliament today. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> has pointed out, quite a number of those Bills deal with primary industry. When we rose for the winter recess the honourable senator made the same comments. All the primary industry Bills were left until the last moment.

            <para>I now have additional information from the Minister for Primary Industry, who has the responsibility for construction of the laboratory. </para>
            <para>He advises me as follows: </para>
            <para>Construction of the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong was not commenced last year. It has not yet commenced, as the project was deferred early in 1976 because of the need for the present Government to institute deliberate and careful restraints on all forms of expenditure. The position will be reviewed again this year. </para>
            <para>Existing arrangements with reference laboratories overseas are being maintained to ensure that we have support if necessary to aid in diagnosis of any introduced exotic animal disease. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Although a statement was made in the LiberalNational Country parties policy speech put down on 25 November 1975 that a high priority would be placed on this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> said that the Minister for Primary Industry had advised him that early in 1976, just a few months after this Government had been elected to office, the Liberal and National Country parties did not propose to proceed with the animal health laboratory at Geelong. So this is another promise that has been broken. </para>
          <para>We are now faced with the situation in which not a penny has been allocated in this year's Budget to construct the laboratory. Furthermore, it is feared that bluetongue disease has been located in the Northern Territory. This matter is of great importance to beef producers in the Northern Territory. We have been informed that the virus cannot be analysed in Australia. We have had to send the virus over to a laboratory in South Africa to be examined before it can be ascertained whether in fact the disease is present in Australia. I understand that the disease was located at the Government's Beatrice Hill Research Station out from Humpty Doo in the Northern Territory, which I have had the pleasure of visiting on more than one occasion. I must compliment the people there on the manner in which they perform their work. I must compliment them also on being able to locate this disease. I hope that we can do something to prevent it from spreading to other parts of Australia. </para>
          <para>Of course, if the laboratory had been constructed at Geelong we would not have to wait for months to find out whether in fact this dreaded disease is in the Northern Territory. We would not be placed in the position that New Zealand now bars our animal imports as was reported in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> of 4 November. The article stated: </para>

            <para>The director of the Agriculture Ministry's animal health division, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr G.</inline> H. Adlam said today Australian scientists had located the virus in insects from the Northern Territory. </para>
            <para>There is no evidence that the disease is present in Australian farm animals' he said. </para>
            <para> But the animal health authorities have sent samples of the virus to the world reference laboratory in South Africa to establish whether it is pathogenic for animals. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If a laboratory had been constructed at Geelong, it would have been practically operative now and we would not be faced with having to rely on a country such as South Africa with which we do not have very good relations to examine and process this virus and to send us back the report. </para>

              <para>- I know it has. As I pointed out before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> came into the chamber, one of the promises the Government made in its policy speech was that it would give a high priority to the construction of this laboratory at Geelong, a project which had been set in train by the Whitlam Government. Whilst we on this side of the chamber are often criticised by honourable senators opposite for having no interest in primary producers, there are many facets of interest to primary producers which we set in train when in government but which have been delayed by this Government. This laboratory is one of the most important of them. Our Government intended expending $S7m so that Australia had a laboratory which could examine any of the viruses which could be catastrophic to Australian primary industry. </para>

          <para>I hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> when he replies can give some assurance that the Government intends constructing this laboratory. It will be no good the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> saying in their policy speech next week that they will place a high priority on the construction of this laboratory because that is what they said two years ago. So far as I am aware, and according to the answer which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> gave me in March this year, nothing has been done. There is nothing in the Appropriation Bills currently before the Parliament, which we will not be able to debate fully, to indicate that one cent will be spent on the construction of this laboratory. I hope that the Minister can give us some definite indication to which the Government can be held if by some chance it is returned to office on 10 December. </para>

            <para>- in reply- One is always fascinated to hear observations by members of the Australian Labor Party on what is wrong with the Government, what the Government does not do to help primary industry, what ought to be done or how much more could be done and how much more they would do. However, one always remembers its time in government as one largely comprised of promises, cost expansions, inflation being put beyond bounds and people in primary industry being driven almost to their knees. So most of the Opposition's propositions are pretty hollow. In recent times we have had a lot of evidence of union troubles on the waterfront, dislocation of shipments of primary produce such as wheat, beef and, from time to time, mutton. Yet we did not hear from the Opposition then about its attempts to overcome those problems or that it was trying to persuade its union colleagues to do something about the problems and to be much more active about those things. Therefore one tends to regard the Opposition's comments as being, to say the least, very hollow and not very practical. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This is another case in point. The Opposition does not oppose the Bills. In effect, it supports them but makes some noise off the stage as the Bills go by. However, the animal health project which was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> deserves serious comment. It is a matter of concern. I agree with some of the comments <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> made about the importance of animal health. From time to time there is need for diseases to be identified. In my lifetime of association with primary industry there have been many scares that did not become great scares but which caused some measure of concern. I know the Government is anxious to move ahead with the animal health laboratory- it is anxious about animal health generally- but when it became the Government it was forced to look at the quantum of government expenditure and to bring it down to more sensible levels consistent with what the community could afford. There were many measures that were not able to be proceeded with because the resources were not there. However, honourable senators can take it from me that the Government is serious about this project and regards it as urgent. It has looked into it seriously, and the Senate can expect to hear from the Government in due course about it. </para>
          <para>In relation to the Brigalow Lands Agreement Amendment Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> said that the Government had moved only after a vote of no confidence in the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> had been carried in Toowoomba. The fact is that the offer to the Queensland Government was made many weeks ago, but legislation could not be proceeded with until the Queensland Government had agreed to accept the offer, and this occurred only last week. When we talk about export markets, their problems and the need to expand them we ought perhaps to remind ourselves that we had a record level of beef exports this year- over 650,000 tonnes. The expansion of the Japanese quota will be of considerable help to us. Our requests in this regard have been continuous and have been going on for quite a long time, and the recent decision by Japan to raise the quota has to be regarded as being due to the pressure applied by the Minister and the Government. </para>
          <para>The general considerations of the brigalow land scheme are well known to honourable senators and were covered in the second reading speech. It is a Queensland scheme which is supported by the Commonwealth Government. Till June 1975 $ 18.6m had been committed to the scheme. The assistance given by the Commonwealth is on the basis of a loan repayable over 20 years, with interest at the long term rate applicable at the time of borrowing. The money is used to survey and provide acquisition resources, to construct access roads, to develop ballot blocks and to make loans to holders of ballot blocks. Altogether 360 blocks were involved. The financial difficulties of many of the people involved in the brigalow scheme have resulted from the recession in the beef industry. This occurred before they had a chance to establish themselves fully. </para>
          <para>The Federal Government and the Queensland Government feel that they have a responsibility to those settlers because both governments were involved with them. Therefore this Government has set out in this measure to discharge that responsibility. The purpose of the Bill is known to honourable senators. As I have said, the Queensland Government has indicated its willingness to enter into the agreement. There are two major proposals contained in the Bill. Firstly, Queensland will receive a one year moratorium on its repayment commitments to the Commonwealth. The principal repayment will be deferred for the year and spread over the balance of the period of the loan. The interest payment for the year will be waived. This provision has been included in the legislation on the basis that Queensland will pass on the same concessions to needy settlers for an average period of two years. Some settlers will receive those concessions for a longer period and some will receive them for a lesser period. Secondly, the Government is extending the repayment period to the Commonwealth from 20 years to 27 years. That condition will be viable to the Commonwealth only if the State grants the same concessions to the settlers. </para>
          <para>The Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill 1977 has been the subject of much discussion and much debate- much more so in the other House than in the Senate. I think that its principles are well known. It is hoped that the Bill will allow producers to do more about animal health. I agree that both animal health and husbandry are critical factors in beef production. The Bill should help producers with their cash flow problems. It should help to maintain the national animal health levels. The scheme relates to procedures and performance during the oneyear period from 23 September 1977 to 22 September 1978. The eligibility criterion is the ownership of 50 or more cattle kept for beef production as at 30 June 1977. Eligible persons may be paid $ 10 for each head of cattle up to a maximum amount of $2,000 for recognised procedures which include dipping and other treatments for external parasites and drenching and other treatments for internal parasites. Such treatments would include tuberculate testing, blood sampling and vaccination for brucellosis and the spaying of female cattle less than two years of age. Under the provisions the Minister is allowed to accept other disease control measures as recognised procedures. The Bill provides that partnerships, companies and trusts will qualify for a payment as if they were individual owners engaged in the bona fide activities covered in the two Bills. I suggest that, as the Opposition does not oppose these two measures and as the time available is very limited, the question that the Bills be read a second time should be put. </para>
          <para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>
          <para>Bills read a second time, and passed through their remaining stages without amendment or debate. </para>

Of course, one of the honourable senators who interjects has spent his time and his staff's time recently in trying to succeed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth</inline> 's important electorate of Mackellar. Maybe honourable senators opposite have time to do those sorts of things, but they ought to give us time to deal with this important legislation and to deal with the very important questions which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth</inline> raised in his letter, a copy of which has been circulated to honourable senators. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth</inline>'s fears are not shared by me, but they certainly would be shared by those apostles of free enterprise who sit on the other side of the chamber; those who say that there should not be any limitations upon the powers of the Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack spoke earlier this year about the growth of executive power in the Parliament. Where is he today to express the doubts and observations of W. C. Wentworth? He is not even here. The Party, the all-powerful Party, the one party state, has expressed itself, so not only the Party but also the Parliament has to fall into line. </para>
          <para>What does this Bill seek to do? It seeks to establish a company, not a statutory corporation. Its behaviour is to be governed by a memorandum and articles of association. The Prime Minister promised in November 1975 that he would transform this country. He was going to rectify all the ills and deficiencies of the economy. Where is the economy today? There is more unemployment. Inflation is still at double figures despite the Government's rhetoric and despite what the Government believes which is contrary to the opinion of the economic forecasters who say that we do not have business confidence. </para>

          <para class="block">We are dealing with this matter in the last hour of the parliamentary session. Is the bank to be a statutory corporation? Is it to be the statutory body that was promised by the Prime Minister? Not only was it promised by the Prime Minister, it was also referred to on several occasions by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. He was asked a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> on 25 October. That is not so very long ago. It is within the last fortnight. Part of his reply was: </para>

            <para>As I said at the beginning and have said subsequently the Government is at the moment studying carefully with the Bank and the Australian Industries Development Corporation the most preferred method of funding, and when in consultation with the banking people and with AIDC that has been decided, the decision will be announced. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That decision was to establish a corporation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> replied in a similar fashion to a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> on 13 October. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> had asked whether the proposed national rural bank would be a statutory body established by legislation. In the reply which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> gave there was every indication that that was the approach to be followed. We do not get a statutory body; we get an Australian Rural Bank which is to be a company. The Government has not explained completely or adequately to either House of the Parliament who will be on the Board of the Bank. All that is known is that the board will comprise a  chairman  appointed by the Treasurer, a government nominee, also appointed by the Treasurer and two persons representing primary producers to be appointed by the Treasurer. </para>
          <para>Questions must be asked. Who else will be on the board? Will there be a representative of all the trading banks or of each of the trading banks? What will be the size of the board? Will the other members of the board be able to out vote the Treasurer's nominee or will the Treasurer have the power of veto? The Government seems unsure about what it is trying to achieve because this is legislation by haste. This is legislation that is ill thought out. This is legislation that seeks to fool the rural community that its demands for more adequate access to rural finance will result from this piece of legislation. We are not told why the Government decided in favour of a re-financing institution instead of the Commonwealth Trading Bank proposal for the removal of the lender of last resort provisions, and permission for the Development Bank to act in its own right. Anyone associated with agriculture will know that it is the lender of last resort provisions which are the key to the problems associated with the sector of the rural community that wants access to finance. </para>
          <para>The proposals to which I am referring have the support of the primary producers organisations. Is it any wonder then that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Burston,  President  of the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council- I am sure he would not be concerned if I was to say that he is a person who can be regarded as a supporter of the Government has issued a statement criticising the Government's proposals. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>While welcoming the establishment of the Australian Rural Bank, it is most disappointing that so many of the details are still vague and undefined. </para>

          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. specific details were not provided in either the Bill or the Treasurer's Second Reading Speech. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">He added that details had not been provided about the interest rates to be applied, the criteria to be used for lending, the guarantee of increased skills of loan appraisers, the facility for producers to approach the Development Bank direct, without first being referred by trading banks and the terms and conditions of loans. Thus, the Council expressed its doubts about the validity and the direction of this legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Burston has been adequately supported by the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation and the Australian Farmers' Federation. </para>
          <para>The Opposition takes the view that the Development Bank has the expertise and the branch structure to handle direct relations with primary producers. Use of the Development Bank would appear to coincide with the Government's intentions to assist small businesses. In what way does the Government see this refinancing institution as making any tangible contribution to the problems? Do we set up a rural bank or do we use the resources that are already available to us. Who will be able to assess the viability or otherwise of those who want access to finance in the rural sector? Who will be able to make a judgment about that? Will it be the existing private trading banks or the other lending authorities which in many cases can be regarded as usurers in the way they handle their financial relationships with rural producers? The Government has taken some steps in respect of small businesses but does not seem to have been able to co-ordinate its thinking in financing small businesses in the rural community. Therefore, the Opposition has come to the conclusion that the Government has accepted the trading banks' compromise- after all, the trading banks originally opposed the establishment of a national rural bank during the term of the Labor Government as they have done under this Governmentwhich will go no way along the road to providing the sort of financial relief and debt assistance that is now so vital to the survival of Australian agriculture. </para>
          <para>Time does not permit during the debate on this matter to do more than just make passing reference to and criticism of this piece of legislation. The bank will be a furphy. There is no other way to describe it. It will be a phoney. This is a plausible piece of legislation which is not going to contribute a great deal to the very fundamental, deep seated structural problems faced by our rural sector. It will be basically ineffective but the Opposition would not want to be shown to be more than pointing out the deficiencies in the legislation. Therefore, the Opposition moves the amendment which, after all, supports the establishment of a rural bank but points out the hypocritical way in which the Government has introduced the legislation. Finally, in respect of the matters which we have been debating at short notice and for such a short time today, each time the Opposition raises what it considers to be valid criticisms of the legislative approach to the rural crisis, we get the inevitable bucket from the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> and from Government supporters about inflation as though the Labor Party invented inflation. In the period in which we were in government we had an unfortunately high rate of inflation. It was part of a world-wide trend. It was not within the capability of that Government to control the rate of inflation, having regard to the extensive trading relations with other countries that preceded the election of the Australian Labor Party Government in 1972, the revaluation of the currency which flowed from the mining boom of the 1960s and the capital that poured into the country at that time. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators opposite say that there was too much money chasing too few goods. That there was so much money in circulation was the result of the disastrous policies of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. Yet in the period from 1972 to 1975 when we were in government, farm incomes were at a record high level. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> has been very severely misquoted and misjudged over his statement that 'farmers have never had it so good. ' I suggest that Government supporters should examine farm income and projected income for the years 1976 and 1977 and compare that with the income which farmers actually received in 1973, 1974 and 1975. That misquoted statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> can be shown, in the historical context of the period in which it was made, to be true. </para>

              <para>- The graph shows very dramatically that he was speaking the truth in respect of income in those particular years. I am sick of hearing Government supporters, and sometimes the Minister, trying to make out that every ill, every deficiency and everything that has ever gone wrong can be traced back to those three brief years, 1972 to 1975. If honourable senators examine properly the Budget Papers of that period and the present Budget Papers they will find that the three years of the Labor Government contributed $850m in direct aid to the rural sector. That aid has fallen away dramatically in the 1976 and 1977 Budgets. That amount of $850m compares very favourably with the amount of assistance that was given in the three years before the Labor Party came to office. </para>

          <para>It is about time there was some recognition of the fact that the problems that beset the rural community are structural. They are inherent in the economy of this country. They are inherent in the economy of every other agricultural country of the Western world. The problems will not be solved by cheap and nasty gibes and rhetoric which so often characterise the debate of Government supporters when dealing with the more fundamental problems that face Australian agriculture. The Opposition does not oppose the setting up of the Australian Rural Bank. We on this side do not believe that it will solve the debt problems that face farmers in this country. The rural indebtedness is something in excess of $3,500m. That indebtedness has been with us for a considerable number of years. It is the small farmer and the middle sized farmer who need assistance. There is nothing in this legislation that indicates that any more money will be available at cheaper rates of interest. That is why I conclude by saying that it is a phoney piece of legislation. It is window dressing legislation designed to try to fool and hoodwink the Australian farmers into thinking that this Government believes in giving them assistance. The Government has not done that and it will fail miserably to do it. </para>

            <para>- We have just listened to 20 minutes of the usual diatribe from the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> started off by complaining about the lack of time in which to debate this Bill but he spent about five minutes of his 20 minutes talking to the Bill, and the other IS minutes were a complete waste of time. Whenever the honourable senator speaks he wastes time, so he should not have spoken at all. I support the legislation and reject completely the amendment moved by the Opposition. The first point of the amendment says that the Bill dishonours the November election promise of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> I will read that statement in full later. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Bill agrees entirely with the Government's policy statement made at that time. The Opposition says that it would set up a rural bank as a statutory corporation. This is a rural bank. It is being set up by statute and it will be an organisation. I will deal with the last two matters at a later time, when I refer to the Commonwealth Development Bank submission to our Government. I will read only portion of our policy statement because of the limited time remaining for this debate. The Government's policy statement of 1975 on primary industry reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We see the need for a special institution for this purpose as there are many types of investment in primary production which require a variety of medium to long term lending arrangements. With long term finance the producer is best able to avoid unpredictable price variations due to varying seasonal conditions or world demand for agricultural products. With this in mind, we intend to establish a National Rural Bank in conjunction with trading banks and other lenders in the rural sector to provide rural credit to cover the investment in land. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The bank will also finance machinery, plant, stock and farm equipment, lend for farm development projects for the expansion of existing projects and refinance existing short term rural debts. The terms of lending would be appropriate for the purpose of the loan. Interest payable would be at bank interest rates for medium term loans and marginally better for long term loans. </para>
          <para>It is envisaged that the bank would function by relending through existing financial institutions but may be involved in direct lending in some instances. As a refinance institution, staff would be kept to a minimum and security and other documentation held and processed by the onlending financial body. </para>
          <para class="block">Nothing in the legislation before the Senate conflicts with that policy statement. The planning for this national Rural Bank began in 1 976, after our election to office. Unlike the Opposition when it was in office, we do things very carefully and thoroughly. I was fortunate to be a member of a sub-committee of the rural committee that was appointed to research this matter. The honourable member for Ballaarat, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jim</inline> Short, was the  chairman  of that sub-committee. We received many submissions from many organisations and had meetings with them. We kept in touch with officers of the Department of Primary Industry and of the Treasury. We received many dozens of submissions and had meetings over many months. I am happy to say that this Bill reflects the recommendation of our rural committee. </para>
          <para>The need for this Rural Bank is amply demonstrated in particular by a Bureau of Agricultural Economics publication called <inline font-style="italic">Rural Credit in Australia</inline> dated 1972 and a document called <inline font-style="italic">Rural Policy in Australia</inline> dated 1974. Both set out quite clearly the need for long term finance for the rural sector. Among the points that are underlined in those documents is the fact that returns are far slower in rural industries than in most other industries and in the short term returns often are quite unreliable. In many rural industries there is a slow turnover of money in regard to the capital that is involved. I am aware- I am sure most honourable senators also are aware- that because short term finance is available at the moment many producers have been forced into a high interest rate situation. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline>in his speech and the Opposition in its amendment have supported the proposition put forward by the Commonwealth Development Bank. This proposition was considered very thoroughly by our committee and by the Government. It was a well prepared case, and I congratulate the Commonwealth Development Bank on the work it did. Our committee rejected the suggestion, however, for two reasons. The Commonwealth Development Bank is regarded by many primary producers as a bank of last resort. Once they have gone through the normal banking institutions and have been rejected, the Commonwealth Development Bank is regarded as the last resort, second last only to the rural adjustment organisation. If a rural bank were set up under that proposal a farmer whose application for finance was rejected would have nowhere else to go. Under the legislation before the Senate a farmer can go from bank to bank. If he gets an unsatisfactory reply from one bank he can go along to another bank. Much, of course, will depend on the recommendations of the local bank manager. </para>
          <para>We on this side of the chamber believe in private enterprise. We would be most unhappy to see a very large proportion of rural lending being carried out by an instrumentality with government control. Many rural producers expected, quite unnecessarily, that this banking institution would offer highly subsidised interest rates. I am sorry that that expectation came about. Certainly nothing the Government said led them to that expectation. Personally I would be very much against highly subsidised interest rates. One of the direct effects would be higher land prices. Certainly very few farmers want that. Because of lack of time I refer honourable senators to the comments of the honourable member for Moore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hyde,</inline> who touched on this point in the other place. </para>
          <para>The provisions of the Bill allow for the establishment of the company called the Australian Rural Bank Ltd. The shareholders will be, by consent of the Treasurer, the existing lenders to rural industries. These will include the Commonwealth Bank and the Treasurer himself. The </para>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth will provide funds to this Bank. The funds will be appropriated by Parliament. The Bank will also use funds from the income equalisation deposit trust account and will attract loan funds from many other sources as well. The Rural Bank is designed to lend money to shareholders who will on-lend to primary producers. The primary producers include those engaged in the fishing and forestry industries. This facility will be particularly important to the fishing industry with the pending extension of our fishing limits to 200 nautical miles. </para>
          <para>The term of the loans will be for up to 30 years. I emphasise 'up to 30 years' because each application will be treated on its merits. As an example, on some projects it would not be feasible to lend for a period anywhere near that length of time. A big problem at the moment is faced by many rural producers when they receive finance for, say, a shearing shed which will last for 100 years. The present lending institutions expect them to repay the loan within three or four years. The Bank will demand that normal commercial conditions of viability will apply. This will be judged by the local people. It is to be hoped that the Bank will attract experts in rural lending. These people are fairly thin on the ground at the moment. It is to be hoped that this Bank will attract people who are expert in the knowledge of farming and in the knowledge of farm finance. One of the big advantages in setting up this Rural Bank in this way is that it will retain the traditional banker-client relationship which is so valuable. There is nothing to stop a client if he is rejected by one bank from making an application to another bank. Finally, I wish success and a long and happy life to the Australian Rural Bank. </para>

            <para>-The Australian Rural Bank Bill 1977 which is currently before the chamber is a Liberal-National Country Party gimmick.

We are to have the premature election following the dissolution of the Parliament tomorrow notwithstanding the fact that the Appropriation Bills have not yet been passed and that the electoral laws at the time the Governor-General agreed to the dissolution were in a state of anarchy and in fact had to be twice amended to legalise the election which the Governor-General had approved.

Clause 4 of the Bill authorises the establishment of a company by the name of the Australian Rural Bank Ltd. </para>

              <para>-It is to be set up by act of Parliament. I was hoping some legalistic casuist on the other side would come in with that interjection. It was established by statute but as this term is understood by the people to whom it applies, the farmers, a statutory corporation is a body like the Australian Wheat Board or the Australian Wool Corporation which operates independently of private institutions which may already be established in the field. This institution authorised to be established by this Bill does not do that. All it does is provide a source of funds- a fairly puny $45m at that- as a source of finance for the private banks and for other lenders who are not stipulated to lend on to farmers. To legal casuists it may be superficially true that this is statutory because it is established by statute but it is not a statutory corporation as the term is generally understood by the people to whom it applies. It certainly cannot be compared with such statutory corporations as the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Wool Corporation. The Bill does not remove the obnoxious lender of last resort provisions which currently hamstring the Commonwealth Development Bank. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> correctly stated that most primary producers see the Commonwealth bank as an unsatisfactory institution because it is only a lender of last resort. These provisions will still apply to the finance provided by this legislation. </para>

          <para>As for private enterprise, if this Government really believes its own rhetoric about private enterprise of course we would not have seen the Bill in the first place. The Government would have left this field to the private enterprise banks which, by its own tacit admission in introducing this BUI, are not doing the job they are supposed to do. They will not do it in the future either of course because they still effectively control government policy in this area as they control and dictate policy to the Government in the area of meat marketing. The legislation authorises the recruitment of $45m of capital, some from the trust fund established for income equalisation deposits. It does not specify who will hold the shares in this company, other than that the Government may hold some. It does not specify how many the Government will hold, who the other shareholders will be or what portion of the equity other shareholders will hold. It stipulates the people who are empowered to appoint four of the directors but it does not state how many directors there will be. It does not state who will appoint those other directors or by what method they will be appointed. </para>

That well-known National Party hack, Harry Miller, who has already been given 15 sinecures by this Government- which said there would not be any more jobs for the boyswill probably be appointed as a director of this institution as well. This establishes the point I made at the outset. This legislation is a gimmick, the form of which has been conceived by the private banks and dictated to this Government by the private banks. It has been aborted by this premature election. If it is not aborted, if it is not premature, why are not these facts spelt out? Why are not these vital provisions stipulated in the legislation? Who will subscribe the share capital- the equity capital- as distinct from the finance? Who will effectively control the company? Who will be the directors? How many directors will there be? Who will appoint them? </para>

              <para>-No, I certainly would not expect to be appointed as a director to a financial institution like this when there are so many boys waiting for jobs to be appointed as sinecures by their Liberal-National Country Party mates in this Parliament. The Harry Millers and the Paul Gerbers and all those people who were apologists for the Liberal and National Country Party m November 1975 and since are just waiting to cop their rewards for services rendered and services anticipated. Insofar as it has any meaning at all, what this institution will do is pick up the bad risks that the private trading banks are not willing to take on. It will not do that very successfully with a lending capacity of $45m. </para>

          <para>As my colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)-</inline> I think he is still the honourable member for Melbourne Portsobserved in the House of Representatives two days ago, when the aggregate farm debt is in excess of $3 billion, the finance provided by this legislation amounts to a little more than one per cent of that figure. So in that context we can see how significant the lending capacity of the bank will be. Of course, if an amount greater than $45 m is provided for this institution, as was suggested by way of interjection by some National Country Party members of the House of Representatives, it begs the question which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> keeps posing in a different context: If more funds are made available or are recruited for a particular purpose, what effect will that have on interest rates in general? This legislation, I repeat, dictated to this Government by the private banks, just as the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation legislation was dictated by the meat exporters, follows that consistent pattern which the Government has established. The second clause of the amendment moved by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> states that the Bill does not comply with the policies enunciated quite clearly by farm organisations. I do not intend to refer to all of them. I shall refer to an announcement by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council which certainly would be regarded by its own members as a politically conservative organisation, normally aligned with one of the two conservative parties represented in this Parliament. On 3 November the  President  of that organisation issued a statement criticising this legislation. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>While welcoming the establishment of the Australian Rural Bank, it is most disappointing that so many of the details are still vague and undefined. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is an understatement, if ever I heard one. The reason why the details are vague and undefined is that this Government wants to fool the people at whom this legislation is directed. That is the major reason. The second reason is probably just the time factor- that is, the legislation was aborted by the premature electionand the Government's need to be seen to be doing something for the farm or rural community which has suffered a fall in net income of more than 20 per cent in the two years that this Government has been in power. The AWGC listed about seven specific items of criticism. One was that the Government did not stipulate the interest rates which were to be applied or the criteria for lending which were to be used; also the legislation did not provide the facility for producers to approach directly the Development Bank without being referred by trading banks. As I interpret the legislation, there is no way in which producers can approach the bank directly. If there is a way in which they can do that, I would be grateful if the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> would point it out in his closing remarks. I cannot see any provision for that in the legislation. The legislation specifically refers to providing funds for banks and other lenders who are not stipulated. Presumably, they are stock and station agents- or stock firms, as they are known in some parts of the country- who in north-western Tasmania and probably in other areas are charging from 16 per cent to 18 per cent interest on carry-on finance. </para>
          <para>There is a case for the establishment of a specialist financial institution for the rural sector but not- as I regret to say some people seem to believe- some institution which will provide unlimited amounts of finance at nominal rates of interest. There is no case for the establishment of such an institution, in my view, but there is a case for the establishment of a specialist institution providing a full range of banking services with provision for longer term lending than is normally available from commercial banks and seasonal finance in lieu of that frequently provided by stock and station agents at exorbitant rates of interest This legislation does not achieve either of those worthy objectives. It will provide finance under lender-of-last-resort conditions. It will not provide carry-on finance on a seasonal basis. It may provide finance to the stock and station agents to lend as they have in the past. </para>
          <para>What this Government should have done and what the third clause of the amendment moved by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> seeks to have done in the next session of Parliament is to expand the facilities of the Commonwealth Development Bank or to set up separate wing of the Commonwealth Development Bank. That Bank already has established the branch infrastructure which is necessary to provide such facilities. It could set up a special section to provide direct lending facilities and a full range of banking services free from lender-of-last-resort restrictions. This legislation provides nothing that is worth while. It is another pre-election gimmick. </para>

            <para>-I support the Australian Rural Bank Bill which to the rural industry of Australia is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has been established since Federation. Honourable senators opposite who criticise it show their abysmal ignorance. It provides a broad framework within which to give long term loans of capital to the people of the great primary producing areas in Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">From that viewpoint and the viewpoint of the rural communities this Bill is the best piece of legislation since Federation. </para>
          <para>I pay a tribute to the rural industries and to the acumen, initiative and determination of the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> who has come under criticism today in the discussion on the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Bill. Although the establishment of a national rural bank has been a major plank for many years in the platform of the party which I am privileged to represent in this chamber, it is the efforts of the Minister for Primary Industry which have brought it to fruition before the Parliament. Of course I couple with him the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch),</inline> who introduced the legislation into the Parliament. </para>
          <para>This Bill is another example of the fulfilment of the policies which were projected in our rural policy speech prior to the 1975 election. It has been said that the Government has not honoured its election promises. I have to lay that canard to rest. It was said in the lower House and it has been repeated in both Opposition speeches in the Senate today. My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> dealt with it. He quoted from the policy speech. Because of the exigencies of time, I refer the Senate to page 30 1 1 of the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 7 November 1977, which reports the Minister for Primary Industry as saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I see the Australian Rural Bank in this form as completely identical with the undertaking given by us in our rural policy speech prior to the 1975 election. That document of November 1975 stated: </para>
            <para>We intend to establish a National Rural Bank in conjunction with trading banks and other lenders in the rural sector to provide rural credit to cover the investment in land. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is precisely what this Bill does. The Minister went on to quote three other paragraphs of our rural policy. The next one states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Bank will also finance machinery, plant, stock and farm equipment, lend for farm development projects for the expansion of existing projects and refinance existing short term rural debts. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>It is envisaged that the Bank would function by relending through existing financial institutions but may be involved in direct lending in some instances. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is provided for in the legislation. The policy document also states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As a refinance institution, staff will be kept to a minimum and security and other documentation held and processed by the on-lending financial body. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is provided for in the legislation. The Minister went on:  . . it is completely identical with that promise. I believe that this legislation is in a form that will be beneficial to primary producers. </para>
          <para class="block">In introducing the Bill the Treasurer said that it was the product of the most extensive processes of investigation and consultation and that the Bank would be unique in many respects. He said that it will be the first financial institution set up by the Commonwealth for the sole and specific purpose of facilitating the provision of finance to primary producers and that it will provide an excellent example of a partnership between the Government and the private sector financial institutions. </para>
          <para>You see, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> honourable senators on the other side of the chamber cannot stand private enterprise. I is like waving a red rag at a ull. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> was his usual vitriolic self today when speaking about the private enterprise system and the private trading banks. Whenever one talks about the private enterprise sector, which is responsible for 75 per cent of the employment in the community Opposition senators sound off with their socialistic policies. That is all they can espouse. They were rejected in 1975 for that and I suggest that they will be rejected in 1977 for that reason and for other reasons. </para>
          <para>One of the great problems over the years about providing finance in primary industries in rural Australia has been the difficulty of developing properties to a stage of better production on the one hand, while being saddled with repayments of capital on a short term basis on the other hand. This in a very real sense has stultified the development and extension of our great primary industries. It has been the cause of great concern to the primary producing industries. It is pleasing to note that the definition of 'primary producer and 'primary production' in the legislation is very wide. It covers all aspects of producing. It covers not only the normal run of wool, wheat, sheep, beef, fruit and so forth, but also fishing and forest operations. So the whole of the primary industry sector is covered by this broad, umbrella piece of legislation which will be of tremendous importance to the future development of this nation. </para>
          <para>When we add drought, bushfires and other natural hazards such as the waiting period in the case of grain crops, from the sowing of the seed to the harvest of the crop, together with the uncertainty of seasons and overseas markets, to the factors I have mentioned which compel the necessity of long term finance in primary industry, surely it can readily be appreciated by those who want to understand that there is a great need for legislation of this kind. As I have said already, people on the Opposition side do not want to understand. They want primary industry socialised. They do not believe in the private enterprise sector coming into this area and we must make allowance for this fact. Everyone else must appreciate that there is a great need for an institution of this type to cover the purchase and development of primary industry properties, particularly in the case of young people who are starting off in life. </para>
          <para>It is not contended that this piece of legislation will solve all the problems of primary industries. That has never been said. What we do say is that this legislation is a framework which gives hope to the great primary industries of this nation. All I suggest is that the legislation be given a trial, that it be seen in operation. I am certain it is going to make a great and practical contribution to the future development of the great primary industries of this nation. </para>

          <para>Various references were made to what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> had said. I did interject over one particular reference but nobody took any notice of me at the time. What the honourable senator was quoting, I believe, was what the Prime Minister said in regard to financial help for small business. Somebody made some comments about the trading banks. I do not have the names of the honourable senators concerned written down but I made notes as they made their comments. It was pointed out that the trading banks, despite the way in which people on the Opposition side abuse them from time to time, are the major lenders to primary producers, and have been traditionally so for a very long time. They ought to be, and I believe are, in the best position to judge the financial needs of the primary producers with whom they have done banking business for perhaps as long as primary industry has been m existence in Australia. I think it is appropriate, indeed sensible, that they should be participating quite directly in the activities of the rural bank. There are many other aspects of it, such as the way in which it has been involved with other lending institutions and with the Government itself as a shareholder. In short, it seems that an admirable institution has been put together. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I crave the indulgence of the Senate to have a number of documents incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I am seeking to do so due to the late arrival of the immigration report. I have spoken to the Government Whip, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> about the matter. I will identify the documents and then ask that they be incorporated in globo. The first document is a telegram concerning the case of a Uruguyuan citizen who is seeking political refugee status. The second document deals with a Chilean citizen. It involves simply a matter of the Latin American community in Sydney wanting parity with the over solicitous treatment accorded to South Vietnamese refugees. The third document concerns an article in the London <inline font-style="italic">Guardian.</inline> Apparently our immigration office in London was making one reference to a British migrant who was involved in a criminal activity and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> was saying something different. The fourth document concerns an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> about a deportation case involving a New Zealand migrant in relation to which I sought information on the current policy. The next document concerns details from the Portuguese community about the failure to have adequate Portuguese translators at the office of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney. The next document concerns a response to a question about why someone was deported without a particular member of Parliament and me being advised. </para>

			<para>Unfortunately <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gallardo</inline> is not eligible for sponsorship as an immediate family member and his occupation as an electric welder is not one which is currently in short supply.

			<para class="block">by our own Reporter </para>
			<para>A LEGAL impasse was reached last week when the Australian Government announced that it would not be party to a sentence imposed by a British court. </para>
			<para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Roy</inline>Rossiter, aged 37, last week admitted tampering with the brakes of a car belonging to the lover of his former wife. He was bound over for five years, and freed on condition that he fulfil his intention to emigrate to Australia within two months. </para>
			<para>The days of transportation ended in the last century,' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> McKellar, Australian Immigration Minister, told the Canberra Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr Rossiter</inline> is a person found guilty of a serious offence. I am not prepared to agree to migrant entry or extended temporary residence for somebody with a recent conviction for such a serious offence. ' </para>
			<para>Where this leaves <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rossiter</inline> was legally unclear. The consensus seemed to be that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rossiter</inline> tried in all good faith to get to Australia, but was refused entry, the courts would find it difficult to send him to prison. </para>
			<para>It was stressed at the Old Bailey last week that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rossiter</inline> was a menace only to his former wife and to those around her. He had not yet accepted that his marriage had ended, his defence counsel told the court. </para>
			<para>It was this which made the emigration 'sentence' so superficially attractive- even though there was no guarantee before the court that the Australian Government would show the same understanding. </para>
			<para>A job as a fitter had been arranged for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rossiter</inline> by relatives in Australia, and his first inquiries at Australia House last week gave no hint of the difficulties he now faces as a result of the Ministerial decision. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rossiter</inline> used his skills as a fitter to sever a brake fluid pipe on the car. Fortunately, the driver saw the brake fluid on the ground and decided not to drive the vehicle. </para>
			<para>No decision has been taken on whether the courts can or should resummon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rossiter</inline> for a new sentence. Judge Hines, Q.C., who imposed the sentence last week, said in court that he was 'taking an exceptional course, in the hope that your life in the future will be happier than it has been '. </para>
			<para>A Law Society spokesman could recall no precedent for the confusion, where the will of an English court has been frustrated, not by a foreign court, but by an executive decision by a foreign power which shares the same Head of State. </para>
			<para>There was some hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McKellar's</inline> statement to the Australian Parliament contained one loophole. He said he would not approve entry 'on the information available to me.' The implications of transportation have clearly damaged Australian pride. It is likely that the first legal efforts on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rossiter</inline> 's behalf will be to provide a great deal of further information to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McKellar,</inline> and then to stress that no implications of Botany Bay were ever intended. </para>

There will be a change after 10 December and Government senators will then be on the other side of the House. I want to voice those words of protest because this is supposed to be a democratic Parliament, yet we are forbidden the right to discuss important legislation which should have been discussed earlier in this session when we were doing nothing. Now we have slammed it through as though democracy had gone out the window. </para>

On behalf of Government senators I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> for your patience and courtesy in presiding over us for almost two years. I also thank my ministerial colleagues for the support they have given me over that period. I would especially like to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> who has carried an enormous amount of duty in the chamber while other Ministers have been engaged elsewhere. I thank my back bench colleagues for their tolerance of me and for their good temper over my sins of omission and commission. I thank them for the support they have given to me, to my ministerial colleagues and to the Government over the life of this Parliament. </para>
          <para>I thank the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> for his unfailing courtesy in this place. He has been a delight to work with. I also thank his <inline font-weight="bold">Deputy, Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, for his co-operation in the smooth running of the Parliament. I think that everybody in this Parliament is indeed grateful to the two Whips. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> 'Byrne, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> and all other distinguished ex-members of the Whips union know, this place will not work without a great deal of respect between the two Whips. They must trust each other, and in the life of this thirtieth Parliament I think we have seen whipping at it best. To my own Whip, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell,</inline> who is not here, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges, Senator Mcintosh, Senator Martin,</inline> and latterly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume,</inline> all of us express our gratitude. </para>
          <para>I also thank the Clerks for their usual efficiency in making certain that the mediaeval rituals of the Parliament are totally preserved and that we have been able to get through the business of the Senate. I believe that I speak for all of us when I thank <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for producing our speeches in written form in an intelligent and grammatical manner. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> has an enormously difficult task. Its officers work well, and I am amazed at the speed with which the 'pinks' come back to us and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report is produced the next morning. Our thanks go also to the staff of the Parliamentary Library for their unfailing assistance, and to the members of the Joint House Committee. </para>
          <para>One of our number is leaving voluntarily- our colleague and friend on this side. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall. We have had our set-to's in the past, but could I say that over the life of the thirtieth Parliament we on this side of the chamber could not have wished for a better colleague than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall.</inline> We wish him all the best in his election quest for Hawker. I conclude by wishing everybody a happy electioneering period. No doubt our paths will cross on the campaign trail. Whilst in the public arena no doubt we will be fighting for our respective causes with all the vigour which one ought to bring to promoting one's side of politics, I trust that when we meet m a private capacity on the campaign trail the normal, unfailing courtesies which exist between honourable senators will be observed. In this chamber, in spite of our political differences, there is almost no personal bitterness between honourable senators. I am quite certain that, as I meet my friends, if not political colleagues, from the other side on the campaign trail, that friendliness which prevails inside the chamber will prevail outside. I wish all honourable senators happy campaigning. </para>

We know that they are subjected to the same sorts of strains as we are in this place. I am sure we all appreciate what they have done. In those remarks I include the Clerks and yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> although you are one of our number. I cannot share some of the sentiments otherwise expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> I am quite sure that on 10 December the Australian people will make a judgment which will ensure that 1978 will not be the disaster which 1976 was and which 1977 has been. When we come back, of course, almost all of us will be here; but I am certain that after 1 July there will be some new faces, many of whom honourable senators now on the Government side will not find very welcome in the chamber. Then we may see some of the sorts of problems which existed here two years ago and then the smiles may be on the other side of the face. On behalf of the Opposition I express our best wishes to everybody during the Christmas break and our very best wishes for the success of the Australian Labor Party at the forthcoming election. </para>

I feel, honourable senators, that we are custodians pro tern of the system. Looking back over the time I have been in this chair through your grace and acceptance of me, it has become more and more emphasised to me in my thinking that we have an institution which we should and must maintain and are maintaining. It is the spirit of co-operation from every member of the chamber which has come through this place which I admire so greatly. Just as I do to you, honourable senators, I express appreciation to those splendid men and women who in all departments serve us so well. It will be very pleasing for me to convey the sentiments expressed to all those good folk to whom honourable senators have so kindly made reference. In particular I say personally that I am deeply grateful to the  Clerk  and his officers. Finally, I wish all honourable senators and their families a very happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. </para>

At today's prices the costs of these visits would be approaching $4m. By way of contrast Ministers in the present Government have completed a total of 79 visits involving 1,044 days spent overseas. Cost figures for these visits are not yet complete but their estimated total cost is around $ 1 , 050,000. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>There is no ambiguity or uncertainty as to the significance of the income tax reforms introduced by the Government. The decision announced in the 1977-78 Budget to introduce a standard rate system of taxation from 1 February 1978 will involve an estimated cost to revenue in 1977- 78 of $406m in addition to the cost of the second round of tax indexation that has applied since 1 July 1 977. In 1978- 79 the estimated cost to revenue of the new standard rate system will be $973m after allowing for the saving from halving the degree of indexation to take effect from 1 July that year. The decision to revise the income averaging provisions for primary producers, which was announced after the Budget, will have little impact on revenue this year but an estimated cost of $80m in 1978-79. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The Government is proceeding with all possible haste to remove any uncertainties which may exist concerning the introduction of a resources tax. Discussions have been held with representatives of the oil and uranium mining industries on the matter, and written submissions have also been received from many of the companies. A definitive statement will be made on this matter as soon as the Government has been able to consider the issues in the light of the views put by the companies. </para>
          <para>On external account, the Government's economic policies provide the basis for increasing confidence. For one thing, as Foreseen at the time of the Budget, the trade account has strengthened considerably in recent months. Secondly, the sharp deceleration in the rate of domestic cost and price inflation has been recently highlighted by the announcement of the September quarter Consumer Price Index. As these facts become more widely realised, and particularly as inflation is further reduced, a return to more usual levels of private capital inflow can be expected. In the meantime the Government has expanded its official overseas borrowing program to finance the period of temporary deficit. </para>

              <para>The revision of the primary producer averaging provisions is theonly relevant decision announced since the Budget.

            <para>The position is still much the same as outlined by my colleague, the honourable Evan Adermann, in his capacity as Minister Assisting, in the letter of 7 July. </para>
            <para>The Government's general position is to favour the reclamation and recycling of waste lubricating oil in preference to burning and dumping. In fact, such re-refining operations take place in both New South Wales and Western Australia and two companies have announced their intentions to commence operations in Melbourne. </para>
            <para>I understand the difficulties experienced by Leroc Oil Co. Pty relate to an inability to penetrate the market, combined with environmental factors. The latter is a responsibility of the State Government. </para>
            <para>Against this background, while the Government considers the matter important, it obviously has to be seen in perspective. The Government has this year had a number of more important fuel and energy matters under consideration and it has been necessary to give these priority in the allocation of staff resources. However, my Department now hopes to be able to finalise its report on the recycling question in the near future but it must be recognised that wider issues affecting other authorities, both Commonwealth and State, may well be involved. </para>

          <para>It is not possible to accurately estimate for 1977-78 the cost of paying unemployment beneficiaries during the first week of their unemployment. However, based on the number of grants of unemployment benefit in 1976-77 and the rates of benefit applicable from November 1977, it is estimated that the annual cost of the proposal would be about $50m. Additional costs would be involved if unemployment benefit became payable to all persons unemployed for seven days or less. There is no statistical data available from which to estimate this additional amount. </para>

            <para>I am advised that officers of the Department of Defence do not apply 2 per cent a month compounding or any other standard inflation formula in the costing of delayed projects; rather, project cost estimates are adjusted on an individual basis having regard to pricing information specific to each project. </para>
            <para>The initial response to the honourable senator's question made mention of a current inflation rate of 10.2 per cent that appeared to be moving down. That figure was, in fact, the inflation rate over the year to the June 1977 quarter, as measured by increases in the consumer price index excluding hospital and medical services. However, more recent information published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicates that the CPI increased by only 2 per cent for the September 1977 quarter. That was the third successive Quarter m which the rate of increase in consumer prices was less than 2.5 per cent. Taken together, those three quarters show an annual rate of increase in the CPI of 9. 1 per cent, indicating a significant reduction in the inflation rate. </para>

Following representations in December 1972, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the Hon.</inline> Douglas McClelland, the then Minister for the Media, reaffirmed earlier advice that television reception in Western District areas was grossly inadequate and non-existent. He further advised that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board planned to carry out engineering studies to determine the grade of services available and possible means which might be adopted to effect improvements. In November 1975, the then Minister for the Media, the <inline font-weight="bold">Hon Dr Moss</inline> Cass, informed the member for Wannon that preliminary field survey work had been completed by the Board and that final surveys would commence in December 1975. In the last 2 years the planning process for the provision of the badly needed television services in the Western District of Victoria has been progressed to a stage where definite procurement procedures have been set in train. </para>

              <para>and (2) The honourable senator has interpreted Section 63 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 incorrectly. Mining operations at Ranger will be carried on under the Atomic Energy Act which does not provide for payment of royalties. Section 63 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, however, provides for payment by the Crown into the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Accounts of amounts equivalent to royalties which would have been received if raining were carried out under the Northern Territory Mining Ordinance. The current level of such royalties in respect of Aboriginal reserves is 2 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent. </para>

          <para>The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act further provides that, if a higher rate of royalty is prescribed, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs may determine what proportion of the increase shall be paid into the Trust Account. In the case of Ranger where mining will be carried on under the Atomic Energy Act 1953, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides that the determination of amounts, higher than the royalty rate prescribed by section 63 (5) (a) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, will be made jointly by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister for National Resources. </para>

            <para>I am advised that the position is as follows: ( 1 ), (2) and (3) Mary Kathleen Uranium Limited (in the ownership of which the Commonwealth Government has a substantial equity) applies, on a voluntary basis, the 'Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores 1975' prepared by the Commonwealth Department of Health. </para>
            <para>This Code provides, inter alia, for medical examinations of employees to be undertaken during their employment, as well as both before that employment commences, and after it terminates. In the case of those employees employed on duties involving prescribed levels of radiation exposure, such medical examinations during employment must take place at least once a year, or more frequently as determined by a medical practitioner, who also determines the extent of the examination. </para>
            <para>No special medical tests are carried out by the Queensland Railways on its employees engaged in the carriage of uranium oxide by rail from Mary Kathleen. The method of packaging and transporting the material accords with the requirements in the 'Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials' issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: (1), (2) and (3) No comprehensive statistics are maintained on applications to remit funds overseas. To minimise delays in processing foreign exchange transactions, the Reserve Bank has delegated authority to banks, as agents of the Reserve Bank for exchange control purposes, to approve applications for most types of current payments overseas without reference to the Reserve Bank, provided they conform with exchange control policy. Approvals issued by banks for certain types of transactions such as documentary payments for imports conforming with exchange control policy do not need to be reported to the Reserve Bank. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, the Reserve Bank informs me that, during September, approvals were granted for withdrawal of capital totalling $ 101m, of which twenty-four applications totalling $67m were for amounts in excess of $ 1 m. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: ( 1 ), (2 ) and ( 3 ) During my term as Minister for Defence, I have announced the acquisition of a number of defence equipment items ranging from light trucks for Army, CI 30 aircraft for Air Force, to patrol craft for the RAN. On all such occasions I have sought and have been assured that in selecting an equipment, full consideration has been given, not only, to costs but also to such factors as performance, support and industry aspects of competing proposals. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In this, I am conscious that recommendations to Government on the selection of an equipment for the Services are based on a complex interaction of these factors. In some instances, an initially higher cost solution may be recommended because of long-term benefits for defence industry in Australia, or perhaps because of expected lower operating and maintenance costs during the life of the equipment </para>
          <para>In relation to the cost aspects of an equipment acquisition, the Five Year Rolling Program by its very nature ensures that my Department continually reviews its existing and forward expenditure commitments in the light of financial guidance provided by the Government. Such reviews and the selection process just described are aimed at achieving value for money in its broadest sense. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans ' Affairs. I preface the question by saying that no doubt the Minister recognises the importance which returned soldiers place on any fringe benefits which may be associated with any pension that they receive. This question relates to such fringe benefits. Could the cut-off level of fringe benefits be adjusted as pension rates increase, preferably with the cut-off level on a sliding scale and not fixed arbitrarily as at present? Also, could arrangements be made so that war disability pensions are not regarded as income when assessing eligibility for fringe benefits? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government appreciates the problems some pensioners face because of their ineligibility for fringe benefits. However, not only many Repatriation pensioners but also many recipients of Social Security pensions are faced with a similar situation. Any extension or indexation of the permissible income limits would, therefore, involve the Government in a great deal of additional expense, because of the many additional people who would become eligible. Further, unless the limits were abolished altogether, there would always be some pensioners who would fail to qualify. </para>
            <para>To exempt any individual Repatriation disability pension from the income limits, would also be inequitable unless the Government was also able to exempt all such pensions and other compensatory type payments received by other members of the community. </para>
            <para>To assist those people most in need, the Government decided in August 1976 to link pensions to the Consumer Price Index. Pensions were increased in November 1976 and May 1977 in line with increases in the Index. However, the Government's first priority is the reduction of inflation and, for this reason, there is a compelling need to contain the rate of increase in Government spending, and to defer any further action to mitigate the effect of the income test in respect of eligibility for fringe benefits. You will appreciate that pensioners will benefit, as will all Australians, from the stabilisation of prices which is implied by a reduction in inflation. </para>
