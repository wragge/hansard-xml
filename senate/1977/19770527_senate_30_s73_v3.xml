            <para>- The Senate will appreciate that yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> indicated to the Senate that he himself had no source of knowledge from the transcripts of the Premiers Conference and was seeking those transcripts. I take it that he is today quoting from the transcripts of the Premiers Conference. I should inform the Senate that last night I wrote to him- I trust he has received my letter- saying that inadvertently I had thought that the transcripts were made public after a time but I had discovered that they were not. Nevertheless, I furnished him with a detailed statement of the April Premiers Conference as prepared by Treasury officials, showing in fact what had been decided and indicating what was unanimous and what were the fields of conflict. In the first place, I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> was quoting from the Premiers Conference transcripts. It is vital for this Senate to know whether this is so, he having confessed yesterday that he did not have such access. If he did quote from the transcripts of the Premiers Conference then I say to him and to this Senate that he is quoting entirely selectively. What might be quotations- I neither affirm nor deny that any of them were correct- are part of a journey of dialogue. The only thing that matters is the collective decision making and its unanimity or otherwise. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Having said that, I now say to the Senate that the April Conference reached a number of vital decisions on both the completion of stage 1 of federalism and the commencement and evolution of stage 2.I repeat that in the four or five Premiers Conferences that preceded the one about which we are talking there was a unanimity of agreement in the unfolding of federalism, the like of which had not been seen in Premiers Conferences in years gone by. I repeat that as a result of the introduction of federalism the States have gained great benefits. I now want to pose to the Senate a rhetorical question for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> before I answer his 2 remaining questions. I take it that in his continuous 1 6 months attack on federalism and on the system of federalism- despite the unanimity of the Premiers- what he is saying to the Senate is that the Labor Party not only rejects the policy of federalism but also, if elected to power, would return to the tax reimbursement uniform taxation that it in fact had in government, that it rejects tax sharing and that it favours tax reimbursement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and his Party cannot have it both ways. What he should do is to stand and say what he is saying by inference- that he is advocating returning to a system that all States have rejected; he is advocating giving to the States substantially less untied money and giving to local governments substantially less tax revenue supplement and tying them down. Let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> stand and be counted. What is the Labor Party&#39;s policy? Is he in fact saying he rejects federalism? Let him tell the people of Australia and let him tell the Premiers and local governments in Australia that if his Party were in power it would return to the bad old days of Whitlam centralism. We will not abandon tax sharing in the second stage. If the honourable senator had read the document which I gave him he would have got the complete answer to his question today. The document said that the Commonwealth was not seeking to force on the States additional surcharges or the ability to make rebates. They can do so if they desire and we will simply bring in the unilateral mechanism to enable them to do so. There is no need for alternatives because the simple fact is that by any measure at all the States and the local government organisations are immensely better off than they were under Whitlam &#39;s centralism. I repeat that in the face of denials, what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and his Labor Party are now saying is that they reject the great reforms of federalism and they have a platform which is a return to Whitlam &#39;s destructive centralism which crippled the States and local government. </para>

              <para>-Senator Wriedt &#39;s incapacity to study the documents, except selectively, defies description. He must know that 2 StatesVictoria and Western Australia- have indicated in general terms their acceptance of the principle of stage 2 and indeed that Western Australia has indicated its intention of implementing stage 2. So it is quite wrong to say that the proposals are not acceptable. In fact, stage 1 was wholly acceptable to the States with the one question as to the nature of the independent body to undertake the relativities. As to the question of acceptability, it is simply-and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> will continue to misrepresent this-that every State in Australia, Labor-led or otherwise, has asked the Commonwealth over the years for access to 2 things. One is greater access to a growth tax, untied, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> the Labor Premier in South Australia, has said that the only solution is to tie the tax revenue of the States to personal income tax by a fixed percentage of revenue. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has forgotten that. He now claims that this is an unacceptable policy. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Every State Premier-Labor, Liberal or Country Party- has said that the States cannot survive unless they have a wider access to a wider range of taxes. That is being provided for them under our proposals, so the answer is no, it is not true to say that what the Commonwealth is doing is unacceptable by any measure at all. The success of what the Commonwealth is doing has been overwhelming compared with the destructive conditions and policies of the Whitlam Government. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that it would be of considerable help to any stranded motorist always to be within reasonable distance of a telephone. No doubt he is also aware that I realise that all the highways cannot possibly have emergency telephones installed along them, but in some areas such as in Tasmania between Hobart and Kingston the cost would be minimal. I ask: In view of the profit made by Telecom Australia could it be requested to examine the installation of emergency telephones along the highway that I have mentioned and the establishment of a committee to develop a policy on the installation of telephones in some areas even though there is no prospect of commercial revenue sufficient to pay for such installations? </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I preface the question by referring to the Government&#39;s recently announced decision to allocate only $2m in the 1977-78 Budget although $30m was recommended by the interdepartmental working party on Aboriginal unemployment to help alleviate Aboriginal unemployment in the country. Is it not true that this small amount, which is less than 7 per cent of the recommended allocation, will do very little to solve the problem of high unemployment amongst Aborigines? I remind the Minister that it is quoted as being as high as 90 per cent in some areas. On what grounds did the Government refuse to allocate the $ 15m that was recommended to be spent this year? Does the statement yesterday by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in which he urged top level businessmen to employ Aborigines in a bid to reduce unemployment, indicate that this Government, under its federalism approach to governing, has now abdicated its responsibility to the Aboriginal people of this country and, as with everything else, is leaving it all to so-called private enterprise? </para>

            <para>- I was asked a question about the allocation of $2m for Aboriginal unemployment schemes. The money that has been made available by the Federal Government will do a great deal towards assisting Aborigines to gain employment. The statement of the Minister yesterday snowed the attention that has been paid by the Government to methods by which the Government can improve employment opportunities for Aborigines throughout Australia. The amount that has been made available by the Government is $2m and the Government believes that this sum will be helpful in enhancing employment opportunities. I believe a serious study of the Minister&#39;s statement yesterday will show the intention of the Government with regard to the assistance that it will give to Aborigines in devising work opportunities for them. </para>

I note also another comment by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline> to the Bankers Association that this is a very good thing to do. It will begin to flow through effectively fairly soon. It seems to me that this is a very sensible regulating pattern on the part of the Government as the housing industry was in need of a certain amount of extra stimulation. I think the stimulation was given in a very wise form. I expect that it will expand employment. It also will be very useful in the overall scene of activity well beyond housing and housing construction. Two things that are very important in the Australian economic scene are housing activity and general manufacturing activity. They tend to be interrelated but, equally, they tend to have some separations. They also tend to relate to other things. </para>

It arises, in part, from a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> yesterday concerning South African sportsmen. Is it not a fact that the Government signed the United Nations resolution No. 316F which includes individual sportsmen as well as teams? Is it not the case that the Government understood its meaning and how it should be implemented prior to agreeing to this resolution? Is it not a fact that although Tony Greig has lived in England for some 14 years, the 5 South Africans named for the Packer circus all play in the South African Currie Cup, which excludes black South Africans and whose spectators are segregated? Is it not the Government&#39;s policy to isolate South African sportsmen and teams from international sport? Will the Leader of the Government in the Senate reaffirm this policy? </para>

            <para>- I recall the question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> asked me recently about legal representation before repatriation appeal tribunals or before the projected administrative appeal tribunal panels which the Government will be implementing in due course. The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose, in his report which was tabled in Parliament on 19 February 1976, advocated that legal representation should be available. However, when the Returned Services League sent its comments to the then Minister for Repatriation in May 1976, it was opposed to that recommendation of the judge. Furthermore, the Australian Services Council, which represents 1 1 important veterans organisations, in its comments on this recommendation informed the Government of its opposition to the proposal. </para>

          <para class="block">Jesop refers. I have had no further representations from the RSL or the Australian Services Council on the matter. Whether I will receive any is a matter for those organisations to decide in their own time. Naturally if I receive any such representations they will be given the closest consideration and discussed further with the organisations. However, the fact is that the Government policy on this matter has been determined taking into account the long consideration that had been given to these recommendations of the Toose report and the official comments which have been made to the Government by these organisations. The proposals for the administrative appeal tribunal hearings provide that legal representation will be available if a panel is chaired by a presidential member of the tribunal and he agrees to legal representation before him on that hearing. </para>

Would the Minister agree that this silence on the part of Premier Court is an indication of his nonsupport for Australian Assistance Plan decisions? Would she agree also that this is a further indication of a breakdown in Federal-State relations? </para>

            <para>- I am not aware whether today, following the answer given, any indication has been given by the Western Australian Government with regard to any future plans it may have for a replacement of the Australian Assistance Plan. The last knowledge that I had of this matter indicated that no reply had been received. However, a meeting of State Ministers is taking place in Canberra today. I believe the Australian Assistance Plan is one item on the agenda. Later today I may have an indication from the Western Australian Government as to any plans which it has for a replacement of the Plan. I would not agree that any decision taken by the Western Australian Government is a breakdown in Federal-State relationships, because at the time of the introduction of the Budget last year the Federal Government stated that it would fund the Plan for one year, which concludes on 30 June this year, to enable any State which wished to do so either to continue the Plan in its present form or to make alternative arrangements. It is precisely in the nature of CommonwealthState relationships that a State government will make its own determination on this matter. I have no knowledge at the moment of the Western Australian Government&#39;s plan but that may be revealed later today. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry, by referring to figures supplied to me by the Australian Wool Corporation. These figures show that the cost of moving wool from the sheep&#39;s back to an overseas woollen mill has risen from 46.9c per kilogram greasy in November 1973 to 74c in March 1976. An index of prices paid by farmers, using 1972-73 as a base of 100, shows that for the December 1976 quarter wages were 2 10, services/overheads 213, equipment/supplies 191, and market expenses 175, giving an average of 203. These figures graphically illustrate the problems being faced by this great industry. What hope can we give wool producers, particularly those who are unable to diversify into other areas of production? </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator was good enough to tell me that he wanted to have answers to this question. In the short time available I have done my best to put together some information.  His  question illustrates quite clearly that in 5 years the total costs to the industry have doubled. That is the first point to establish. From that one can see clearly the problems of primary producers in general caused by the very severe cost increases over the last 5 years. These have resulted in a transfer of resources from primary producers to other parts of the population, a decline in the living standards of primary producers and an expansion in the living standards of many people who are not in the primary industries. Equally, I think it is well known to all of us- we should observe it again- that farmers are subject to prices determined by overseas markets. They do not have their incomes indexed, as other workers do. They have to meet the increased costs of their inputs, which they tend to meet rather more in isolation than others do. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government has a number of priorities, as is well known, to deal with the economic circumstances. First and foremost, we want to get the rate of inflation down. That is the principal key to overcoming this problem. The problem will not be overcome quickly; it will not be overcome overnight. There are areas of specific assistance. I have been able to identify some of them in the short time available. They include: the relaxation of the requirements for farmers to receive unemployment benefit, the new rural adjustment scheme, the income equalisation deposits scheme, and the devaluations in November 1976 to assist the sales of primary products. Attention is being given to the establishment of a national rural bank, which I think the honourable senator knows is under study. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the wool industry. The Government raised the floor price for wool for 1 976-77 by some 14 per cent to a whole clip average figure of 234c per kilogram clean. Following the devaluation of the Australian dollar last November, the Government decided that the floor price should be subject to full compensatory adjustment. This decision raised the floor price to 284c per kilogram and the Government announced that the floor would remain at not less than that level throughout the whole of 1977-78. The question of the costs of handling wool has always been of considerable interest to me. As a government we believe there is scope for changes in handling the Australian wool clip directed towards producing cost savings and having those savings passed on to the growers. As a result, in March last the Australian Wool Corporation was authorised to operate a scheme of limited direct purchases up to 1 50 000 bales of wool from growers on a one year trial basis. The Corporation will arrange for the wool to be handled, transported and packed using a variety of modern methods and demonstrating the cost economies which are possible. There is also a substantial amount of research into cost saving methods of wool production and handling. Some of these efforts are beginning to show promising results. </para>
          <para>I conclude by saying that some years ago 1 was involved in looking at the number of times a bale of wool was handled from the time it left the back of the shearing shed until it was in the hands of users in a consuming country. It was astounding. It was really unbelievably stupid. In this whole area there must be room for a great improvement. </para>

Did he hear on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> this morning the result of a survey of industry? Did he hear a spokesman whose name I cannot recall say that the survey, involving I think 700 companies, showed that 71 per cent of companies surveyed had no prospects of increasing employment over the next 12 months? Is it a fact that the spokesman said that the Government is placing too much emphasis on reducing inflation at the expense of increasing consumption? Will the Minister table in the Senate details of the amounts which this Government has made available in the form of grants to the rural sector this year as distinct from the loans to the Australian Wool Corporation implemented by the Labor Government so that we can determine just how much this Government in fact is allocating to the rural sector in view of the downturn in market conditions for that sector? </para>

If I remember correctly there was comment by a group of people calling themselves Westaff who are engaged in looking for people to work or placing people in jobs. Some of the observations I heard interested me greatly. What these people said in essence is that there has not been much improvement yet in the employment scene. They said that the Government was overconcentrating its intentions on inflation and had no other positive proposals for improvement. We hear from people these sorts of proposals to spend more money, to overcome inflation, to reduce tax and to decrease the deficit. </para>

              <para>-I did not say that. Let me go on with my reply and try to help. I was talking about the Westaff company or group which looks for jobs for people or places people in jobs or engages them for employers. That establishes a clear point. I am saying that these people saidthis is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> said, and I am repeating what he said- that from their experience they saw little improvement in employment at this stage. I think that is correct. They then said that there was an overconcentration on inflation by the Government. On that I do not agree. I am entitled to take that position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> also asked me whether I could table in the Senate some comparative figures on rural assistance given by this Government and by the preceding Government. Certainly I will try to do so, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> does not have to try to help me. I can help myself quite well, thank you. </para>

            <para>-Of course we agree that everybody must have the greatest possible access to information. That is why the Government is pressing on with legislation in 2 areas; firstly, for proper archives legislation and, secondly, for a freedom of information Act. We hope that that legislation will be introduced for debate and consideration by the Parliament during the Budget session. That is how we will bring about most of the matters to which the honourable senator has referred. We will also introduce proper rules in relation to the cataloguing and storage of classified information. They will provide for access in relation to a range of matters, including what might be called old information in the archival sense and new information in a current sense. Such access will be made possible under a freedom of information Act. We are actively pursuing these matters. Therefore  I  suggest that what the honourable senator has heard is basically supposition and speculation and not in accordance with the facts as  I  know them. </para>

            <para class="block">A summary of State and local government 1976-77 entitlements under the income tax sharing arrangements is at attachment A. </para>
            <para class="block">Personal income tax sharing: States </para>
            <para>The Conference had before it reports by Commonwealth and State officers on Stage I and Stage II of the tax sharing arrangements. Most of the discussion centred on the issues discussed in these reports. </para>
            <para class="italic">
              <inline font-style="italic">Stage I</inline>
            </para>
            <para>The majority of the issues arising in connection with Stage I were settled at the April and June 1976 Premiers&#39; Conferences, thus enabling Stage I to be applied from the beginning of 1976-77. </para>
            <para>Under Stage I the States are entitled to 33.6 per cent of total personal income tax (excluding the Medibank levy) collected by the Commonwealth during the year. </para>
            <para>The States&#39; share for 1976-77 was estimated at the time of the Budget to be $3,7 16.2m; this is 20 per cent more than the financial assistance grants for the previous year. </para>
            <para>Although Stage I is in operation there are a few issues remaining to be settled. These were referred by the Premiers&#39; Conference to Commonwealth and State Treasury officers who had earlier made reports to the April and June 1976 Conferences. </para>
            <para>The April 1977 Premiers&#39; Conference discussed five main matters concerning Stage I, of which three (the first three matters discussed below) were dealt with in the Officers&#39; Report. </para>
            <para>The first matter concerned techniques to meet possible cash flow problems faced by the State to the extent that a deficit may arise in its budget because the State&#39;s Stage I entitlement in respect of a year falls short of the Commonwealth Budget estimate of its entitlement. The States and the Commonwealth agreed on the scheme unanimously recommended by State and Commonwealth officers, which is for the States, within Loan Council arrangements, to have access to Treasury Bills against which they would, except in extreme cases, be expected to lodge counterpart deposits with the Reserve Bank. </para>
            <para>The second matter concerns the review of relativities between all States of their Stage I entitlements. There were three aspects to be considered; the nature of the review body constituted to make recommendations, the guidelines for the review body, and the timing of the review. </para>
            <para>At earlier Premiers&#39; Conferences it had been agreed that there would be a periodic review of relativities and that advice in relation to this review would be sought from an independent review body. </para>
            <para>At the recent Conference some Premiers pressed for a specially constituted outside group to conduct the review. One did not object to the Grants Commission carrying out the review although preferring an outside group. Another Premier supported the Commonwealth view that the Grants Commission should conduct the review. The Prime Minister undertook that the Commonwealth would give further consideration to this matter. </para>
            <para>The States and the Commonwealth have now agreed that the review body&#39;s guidelines should be expressed in relatively broad terms to give the review body the maximum flexibility in carrying out its work and agreed that the guidelines should be along the following lines: </para>
            <list type="lowerroman">
              <item label="(i)">
                <para>The basic purpose is to review the percentage relationships between the States&#39; respective per capita entitlements under Stage 1 of the personal income tax sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and State Governments and to make any recommendations for changes in those relationships considered appropriate. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(ii)">
                <para>The review should be on the basis of the principle that each State should be able to provide State Government services of a recurrent kind of the same standard as other States without imposing higher rates of taxes or charges: differences in revenue raising capacities and in the relative costs of providing comparable government services should be taken into account. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(iii)">
                <para>The review is to include an examination of the existing relativities, of the factors which have influenced them and of any relevant changes which have occurred in the period since those relativities were established. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para class="block">It was agreed that the States and the Commonwealth would each have the right to argue before the review body any matters which a State or the Commonwealth regarded as relevant to the review. </para>
            <para>As to timing, it was agreed that the review should be commenced as soon as possible and that the review body&#39;s report should be considered at a further Premiers &#39; Conference. </para>
            <para>The third matter discussed at the Conference in relation to Stage 1 was the arrangements to govern the provision of information by the Commonwealth to the States, and for consultation, as necessary, between the Commonwealth and the States, in relation to Commonwealth budget decisions as they might affect the States &#39;entitlements. While there was a useful exchange of views agreement was not reached and the Conference referred this matter back to State and Commonwealth officers for further examination. </para>
            <para>The fourth matter concerned the points of agreement in relation to the tax sharing arrangements a copy which is at attachment B to this paper and which is recorded in the Budget paper: </para>
            <para>Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities 1976-77&#39;. Following some discussion (principally at the initiative of the Premier of New South Wales), officers were requested to consult with a view to a possible need for clarification of some of these points. </para>
            <para>Lastly in regard to Stage 1, the meeting noted that, given the per capita system of allocating the States&#39; entitlements, changes to the estimated populations of the States as determined by the Australian Statistician under the tax sharing legislation may result in changes in a State&#39;s percentage and absolute share though not to its per capita entitlement. </para>
            <para>There had been a recent revision of population estimates by the Australian Statistician and this had resulted in changes in the estimated entitlements of the individual States, although the total entitlement of the States as a whole was not affected by the revision of population estimates. In particular the Premier of Tasmania had drawn attention to the above impact on his State&#39;s entitlement of the revised population figures. </para>
            <para>Officers are to examine and report to Government urgently on the implications of the revision of population figures. </para>
            <para class="italic">
              <inline font-style="italic">Stage II</inline>
            </para>
            <para>There was some progress in the discussion of the arrangements for the establishment of Stage II of the tax sharing whereby the States will be enabled at their own discretion to increase their revenues from income tax or reduce them by making a rebate to residents of the State. </para>
            <para>A Working Party of Commonwealth and State Treasury, taxation and legal officers was established following the April 1976 Conference to advise on the introduction of Stage </para>
            <para>The April Conference had before it the Report of this Working Party. </para>
            <para>The report canvassed some fundamental aspects of possible arrangements, including several which raised important and complex legal and policy questions. </para>
            <para>The Conference was in broad agreement with the recommendations of the Working Party as to the objectives to be pursued in developing detailed arrangements for Stage II: </para>
            <list type="lowerroman">
              <item label="(i)">

                <para>the arrangements should be such as to avoid creating avenues for tax avoidance or evasion. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para class="block">When discussing possible legislative and administrative arrangements, the Commonwealth representatives stressed that no State would be forced to enter into Stage 2 arrangements but, for the benefit of those States that did so choose and to avoid technical problems, the Commonwealth had suggested that it and all States co-operate to prepare complementary or &#39;interlocking&#39; legislation. This proposal was not agreed to by all States. </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth emphasised that it wanted to do its part by introducing enabling legislation as soon as possible, thus providing each State with the option of proceeding to raise or lower income tax within its own borders if it chose. The States could within an enabling framework of legislation make their own decisions, in their own time in accordance with their own priorities, whether or not to utilise the Stage 2 tax sharing arrangements. The arrangements would enable the States to vary their Stage 2 revenues from personal income tax at their own discretion. </para>
            <para>Commonwealth officers and officers of the Victorian and Western Australian Governments, are to have discussions regarding the Commonwealth legislation to be drafted. A good deal of work has already been done by Commonwealth officers in preparation for these discussions. </para>
            <para class="block">Local Government </para>
            <para>There was an exchange of views regarding the position of local government. A number of Premiers spoke appreciatively of the effect of the Commonwealth Government&#39;s new tax sharing policy towards local government but some pointed out that financial problems still confronted many local government authorities. It was noted that on present best estimates local government authorities could receive in 1977-78 some $168.1 million as their share of net personal income tax collections, i.e. about 20 per cent more than in 1976-77. </para>
            <para class="block">Advisory Council for Intergovernmental Relations </para>
            <para>It was agreed that the first meeting of the Council would be held in Hobart in early May. </para>
            <para>The Conference also approved the following items for reference to the Council for examination and report: </para>
            <para>An examination of the appropriate long-term relationships between Commonwealth, State and local government. </para>
            <para>A study of the costs and benefits of an interchange of personnel between the three spheres of government, and recommendations for selected implementation of a staff exchange program. </para>
            <para class="block">Administrative and Financial Arrangements for Health and </para>
            <para class="block">Welfare Programs: </para>
            <para class="block">The Bailey and Holmes Reports </para>
            <para>The Bailey and Holmes Reports (on co-ordination in Welfare and Health and on Care of the Aged and Infirm respectively) were tabled in Parliament on 17 February 1977 and the Prime Minister then announced the setting-up of a follow-up group of Commonwealth officers concerning the implementation of this part of the Federalism Policy. </para>
            <para>It was agreed at the Conference that the Bailey and Holmes Reports should be the subject of Commonwealth/ State discussions at officer level and on a no-commitment basis. These discussions should lead to further reports to Government within the next few months. </para>
            <para class="block">Share Funding in Education </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth proposed discussions between Commonwealth and State officers with a view to their reporting on possible: means of improving arrangements for the provision of policy advice to the Commonwealth in this area including through making the Education Commission more responsive to differential local needs among the States; improvement in the delineation of the respective functions of the Commonwealth and the States in this area; and changes to the basis of cost sharing in particular areas of education (particularly the tertiary area) but within a context where the present overall balance of cost sharing of education expenditures between the Commonwealth and the States was preserved. </para>
            <para class="block">All Premiers agreed to such discussions on a no-commitment basis. The discussions are to be preceded by a meeting shortly between Commonwealth and State Education Ministers that will, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> consider terms of reference for officers. </para>
            <para class="block">Housing Including the Housing Inquiry </para>
            <para>The Conference discussed possible new arrangements to replace the present Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, and there are to be further discussions at Ministerial level. </para>
            <para>In March 1977 the Commonwealth proposed the setting up of an independent inquiry into housing costs. </para>
            <para>At the Conference, the Commonwealth proposed that Commonwealth and State officers meet to discuss the terms of reference for this inquiry and the composition of the body to undertake it. Officers&#39; proposals will initially be submitted to the next meeting of Commonwealth and State Housing Ministers. </para>
            <para>The Conference agreed to the proposal to set up the inquiry and to an officers&#39; meeting to discuss terms of reference. </para>
            <para class="block">Road Funds </para>
            <para>The Premiers were critical of the overall level of roads assistance announced for 1977-78 and of the particular allocation by the Commonwealth among the various road categories. </para>
            <para>In responding the Commonwealth Minister for Transport mentioned: the budgetary and economic problems facing the Commonwealth; the flexibility allowed the States in proposing reallocation of Commonwealth grants between road categories, and the freedom with which they can shift their own road funds around; that the Prime Minister would shortly be writing to the Premier of Western Australia to attempt to resolve the State&#39;s problems on quota expenditures from its own sources. </para>
            <para class="block">One Premier raised the question of the treatment of pay-roll tax under the roads arrangements. The Commonwealth accepted that pay-roll tax should be treated as eligible expenditure from Commonwealth funds and as matching expenditure from States&#39; funds. Commonwealth legislation is to be amended accordingly. </para>
            <para class="block">Urban and Regional Development Programs </para>
            <para>There was discussion concerning the need for continued funding of these programs having regard to the social benefits which they generate and their important contribution to maintenance of activity in the construction sector. The Commonwealth noted these points but said that decisions on these programs would have to be made in the total budgetary context. </para>

It relates to the vast energy field of the north west shelf, the development of which is at present under negotiation between the Government and Woodside-Burmah Oil NL. Is the Minister aware that in his address to the annual general meeting of WoodsideBurmah Oil NL this year the  Chairman  stated that, if the company was refused permission to export 6.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year, development of the field would be delayed at least 7 years and possibly forever? Does the Minister feel that a just and equitable result can be obtained from these negotiations while they are being conducted in such a climate of blatant blackmail? Is the Minister convinced that the  Chairman  of Woodside-Burmah Oil NL has the power to carry out his threat to deny the energy benefits of the north west shelf to the people of Australia if his demands are not met? </para>

Donaldson, the  Chairman  of that company, which he circulated certainly to all honourable senators from Western Australia. I found a great deal of interest in that report. As to the particular matter to which the honourable senator refers, as I understand it there are no problems between the joint venturers and the Commonwealth Government as to the level of what may be exported. The honourable senator ought to recall that all the negotiations are being carried out by the Western Australian Government with the joint venturers. As I understand the position, there are very few matters in which the Commonwealth Government has been involved which are still unresolved. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I refer to the so-called settlement of the General MotorsHolden&#39;s Pty Ltd dispute. It has been reported that one of the terms of the settlement was that employees could take their long service leave and retire at the age of 55 years. I ask: Does this not mean in effect that vehicle builders working for GM-H will be retiring at 55 on unemployment benefit at the expense of the Australian taxpayer? It is reported also that workers being transferred from one plant to another would be compensated in excess of the present legal requirements, and the figure suggested is about $28 a week. Will the Minister find out for us what that is all about in relation to a company threatening to sack 600 people because of a slump in sales? </para>

It refers to the work force statistics released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I ask: Is the Minister aware that, according to the ABS survey, 33.9 per cent of young people aged 15 to 19 had been unemployed for some period during 1976? Is the Minister also aware that approximately 40 per cent of all unemployed are young people? In view of the fact that current Government schemes established to redress this problem are inadequate compared with the magnitude of the number of young unemployed, will the Government consider job creating schemes for limiting youth unemployment which have been adopted m nearly all member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development? </para>

The Government has been most concerned about youth unemployment and has undertaken in this area some major and highly successful initiatives which have had a significant impact in reducing the level of unemployment. Nevertheless, it is a matter which is of continuing concern to the Government. I shall refer the question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations who, I am sure, will be very interested in it and will provide a more detailed reply in the near future. </para>

The honourable senator was good enough to take up this matter with me during the week. I was very worried about it so I did chase it up. I have been told this morning that a working party will be set up almost immediately to deal with the spread and the control of the infestation. I am told that the party will consist of representatives from both the Commonwealth and the States. It will hold its first meeting in Sydney next Wednesday. I am told also that the spotted aphid is spreading rapidly through Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria and is now being established in South Australia. Experts in the field believe that the pest has not yet reached the limit of its spread and they are very concerned by reports of any new infestation. I have been asked to request anybody who hears of any spread of the infestation to areas beyond those that I have defined to let the Minister for Primary Industry know. </para>

            <para>- A very extensive outflow of material does function through the Department. Millions of leaflets are published, display posters are used, radio is used as are the citizens&#39; advice bureaus, senior citizens&#39; centres and other such places. These are all ways in which the Government disseminates material and information relating to pensioner benefits and other programs of the Department. I am always concerned to see that this is as effective as it should be. We are always looking at new ways of doing this. Recently, we have been using radio in a way that we believe is of interest as well as being informative. We are constantly reviewing our information section so as to reach more people with information. We are indebted to voluntary agencies and to many other outlets such as local government to assist us in this way. It is our objective to have information as widely disseminated as possible. Any suggestions as to other ways in which this can be achieved would be seriously considered by the Department&#39;s information section. The Government does already produce material in several languages and it has the support of migrant groups in this dissemination of information. In as many ways as possible we endeavour to see that the information does reach the people. </para>

In view of the vast over supply of potatoes in Victoria this year, is the Minister aware that in January there was an import of 164 568 kilograms of dehydrated potato, equal to more than 1000 tonnes of fresh equivalent, into Victoria at a value of 65c a kilogram? Can the Minister advise who imported this product and how it compares with the Australian product in price and quality? Will the Minister ensure that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs is aware of this position when considering the Industries Assistance Commission submission on the potato industry and the effects that the import of dehydrated potatoes has on the price structure for Australian growers and processors alike. </para>

            <para>- I have to declare a personal interest in this matter. I used to be a potato grower myself at one time. I was in Victoria last year in the area of Ballarat when this matter was being discussed. Apparently, one firm is importing a considerable quantity of processed potatoes and dehydrated potatoes from, I believe, the United States. I think the honourable senator&#39;s suggestion is a good one. I shall take it up to see that the Industries Assistance Commission take this into account because the potato crop is of great importance, particularly to Queensland - </para>

            <para>-I will agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> that fire brigades provide essential and emergency services. Apart from that I have not sufficient information or knowledge to agree with any of the other matters on which he seeks my agreement. However, I do appreciate that this could be a serious matter and I will refer it to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and endeavour to have it resolved as soon as possible. </para>

            <para>-My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the decision of General Motors-Holden&#39;s Pty Ltd announced yesterday to shelve the sackings of 600 employees. Is the Minister aware of the statement yesterday by South Australian Premier Dunstan in which he said: &#39;The Federal Government must now play its part by reducing sales tax on motor vehicles&#39;? Does the Minister agree that such irresponsible statements will only serve to depress car sales as evidenced by past experience due to people holding back in anticipation of a tax cut? Is he aware that such statements have caused and are causing considerable dismay to motor vehicle dealers and manufacturers? In view of this, will the Minister urgently request a further clear statement from the Treasurer as to the future sales tax on motor vehicles? </para>

            <para>- I have not seen what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> said but I do not mind commenting on this matter because it is a source of satisfaction to me to discover that General-Motors Holden &#39;s and the union, in joint discussions, have reached a situation which overcomes the problem, a fact which we all knew. Without wishing to make great noises, I have been involved quite a lot in these areas. I want to say a couple of other things that bear on what the honourable senator said in his question. There is an Automative Industry Advisory Panel. It is a widely based body which contains manufacturers, importers, consumers, motorist associations, people from the unions and people from both sides of the Parliament. It takes a fairly broad and balanced view of the whole industry. At the meeting to discuss the GMH problem and the total industry, we were concerned about the overall impression that was being created by speculation about sales tax. Everybody concerned in the discussion took the view that such speculation is most unwise and draws the market down. </para>

In addition, I have talked to the major motor vehicle manufacturers of Australia and they have made the same comment. Speculation on sales tax by uninformed people is drawing down the market and should stop. I shall talk to the Treasurer about this matter. </para>

No doubt the Minister is aware of the latest report released by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd which insists that the national economic recovery depends largely on recovery in the State of New South Wales because of its huge consumer market and heavy industry. In the light of such comments, will the Government give favourable consideration to granting additional funds to New South Wales for the purpose of public investment to promote economic recovery? </para>

            <para>- The first condition of any such question should have been for the honourable senator to satisfy himself that the New South Wales Government had handled and spent its existing funds prudently and towards reemployment. The honourable senator will know that New South Wales, in the course of this financial year, has been able not only to balance its Budget but also to elect to make tax reductions rather than to employ funds for reemployment. That was a value judgment made by the Wran Government. What the honourable senator is saying is that the Wran Government should be freed from its responsibilities. The honourable senator will be aware also of published data which suggests that the Wran Government at this time has substantial surpluses of funds. The first thing for the Wran Government to do is to direct the priorities of its expenditure and the availability of its surpluses to re-employment. It is a noteworthy thing that the New South Wales State Labor Government has a worsened condition of unemployment and nothing has been done which suggests that in the immediate or longer term future there will be any alleviation from it. If there are funds to be directed, let the Wran Government publish, for those interested to observe, what has happened to its promise that, I think, $30m- the figure may be wrong- was to be made available and earmarked above the Budget in that category for special employment purposes. I understand that the people of New South Wales have no clear picture of any such program. </para>

            <para>-I inform the Senate that in considering the reference by the Senate to the Committee concerning the &#39;continuing oversight of Australian science policy, and the direction, priorities, efficacy and ultimate application of Australian research and development efforts&#39;, the Committee is of the opinion that an inquiry, within this framework, into industrial research and development would be both valuable and timely at this juncture. This view can be supported by an examination of various reports such as the <inline font-style="italic">Background Report on Science and Technology in Australia</inline> prepared in March 1974 by the Department of Science; the <inline font-style="italic">OECD Examiners Report on Science and Technology in Australia</inline> presented in 1974; and, more recently, the report of the Interim Australian Science and Technology Council to the Prime Minister, tabled earlier this year. All these reports point to the need for an assessment of Australian industrial research and development requirements, together with a reappraisal of the arrangements for their promotion and application. The Committee has accordingly resolved to conduct an inquiry into industrial research and development, paying particular regard to the matters set out in its terms of reference, that is to say a comparison with other countries of recent trends and expenditures in Australia; and examination of Federal assistance granted to Australian research and development activities. </para>

The Opposition emphasises that as a matter of principle it opposes strenuously the sitting of Senate committees or joint committees when the Senate is sitting. Because of the urgency of the matter under consideration by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, we agreed to accept the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. It was for that reason, and that reason only, on this occasion. We are given to understand that if at any time the Senate does not agree to its members of a committee sitting on the committee while the Senate is sitting, members of the House of Representatives on that committee will sit on it. That was the impression given to us. We think that is not the right thing and that there should always be an insistence that if there is a meeting of a joint committee while the Senate is sitting, and the Senate does not agree to the sitting of the committee taking place while the Senate is sitting, House of Representatives members of the committee should not sit on the committee. </para>

              <para>-I am aware of the disinclination of the Senate to accord permission for committees to sit when the Senate is sitting. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland on that general attitude. There is an anomaly in that the House of Representatives Standing Orders permit committees of that House to sit while the House is sitting. I assure the Senate that when the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has not concluded its business before the Senate sits I have terminated the conduct of the business. Members of the House of Representatives wishing to continue a discussion have done so on an informal basis and there has been no formality about any of their proceedings. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para>Having said that, I go on to make the further observation that with the growth of committees that is developing in the Parliament these joint committees must come under some pretty stringent survey. Unless they do we may have to abolish joint committees. In addition, I think it is fair that I should comment on an observation I made by way of interjection yesterday afternoon when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> was speaking. I drew attention by way of interjection, quite disorderly no doubt, to the fact that there are over 70 committees sitting in this Parliament. One of the reasons that we have difficulty in obtaining quorums in the Senate, and I assume in the other place, is that members of Parliament are involved constantly in what in essence are illegal sittings of committees. I terminate my remarks by reminding the Senate that the subject matter of sittings of committees of this Parliament should be examined by the Senate itself at some future date. </para>

          <para>This Bill provides for the raising of loan monies amounting to $3m for ware service land settlement in the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. </para>
          <para>It has been the Government&#39;s custom to introduce a fresh Bill each year or so to seek parliamentary approval for these funds. It is anticipated that the borrowing authority provided by the existing Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Act will be exhausted by 30 June 1977 and accordingly a further $3m is sought. As honourable senators are aware, the Commonwealth is responsible for the provision of the whole of the capital monies required for the Scheme in these three States. </para>
          <para>The money will, of course, be appropriated in the annual Budget in the ordinary way and the year&#39;s appropriation will represent the sum of the requirements of the three States concerned for these particular purposes. At the present time, South Australia requires about half of the year&#39;s appropriation, Western Australia about one-third and Tasmania the balance. </para>
          <para>As has been stated in previous years when similar Bills were introduced to Parliament, the bulk of this money is required to make advances to settlers to provide adequate working capital to cover current working expenses, the purchase of stock and capital funds for replacement of plant. A very small allocation ($10,000) may be required to meet costs, classified broadly as development, relating to fees expected to be incurred in finalising some surveys and in a drainage study in progress at Loxton in South Australia. </para>
          <para>Settlers were not required to possess capital resources of their own as a condition of entry to the War Service Land Settlement Scheme. Because of this, their ability to withstand the effects of adverse seasonal conditions or the severe cost/price squeeze to which some have been exposed, by the accumulation of financial reserves and working capital, is greatly reduced. The great majority of settlers are, in fact, viable. However, much publicity has been given to the plight of a small number of settlers on Kangaroo Island who are in financial difficulties and nonviable. However, they are the exception. The Government is introducing this legislation for the purpose of assisting those settlers in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania considered viable but suffering from the disabilities outlined above. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          </para>
          <para>This Bill has two purposes- to amend the National Roads Act and the Roads Grants Act by providing an additional $3.2m Commonwealth financial assistance to the State of Western Australia for road works in the current financial year; and to amend these two Acts and the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act and the Transport (Planning and Research) Act by making provision for State expenditure on payroll tax to be eligible funding under each of these Acts. </para>
          <para>The proposed increase in financial assistance to Western Australia is necessary to ensure that no State receives less financial assistance for roads than in the previous years. The extra amount of $3.2m will bring the total road funds allocated to Western Australia for the year 1976-77 to $58.8m, this being the amount received by that State in 1975-76. Consequent upon this Bill the National Roads Act and Roads Grants Act will provide for a total allocation to the States in 1976-77 of $436.7m after allowing for the additional funds provided for in the Bill. </para>
          <para>As honourable senators are aware the Government has consistently acted to ensure that the needs of local government are provided for and the proposed allocations, adopted after consultation with the State Government, will assist local government by providing funds for the improvement of the rural road system in Western Australia. The Senate will be aware that there have been a number of queries regarding the eligibility of payroll tax as State funding under these Acts and the Government has decided to clarify the situation by the proposed amendment. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the Bill which comprises four pans. Part I sets out the usual preliminary information; Part II (clause 3 to clause 6) relates to the National Roads Act; Part III (clause 7 to clause 1 1 ) relates to the Roads Grants Act and Pan IV (clause 12) to the payroll tax provisions. The allocations to the different road categories are set out in the detailed schedules included in clause 6 in respect of national roads and export roads and in clause 1 1 in respect of categories for the roads grant Act categories. The Bill provides for the additional amount set out in the schedules to be added to the 1976-77 appropriations. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>States Grants (Advanced Education Assistance) Amendment  Bill 1977 </para>
          <para>The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the States Grants (Advanced Education) Act 1976 and the States Grants (Advanced Education Assistance) Act 1976 to provide, in accordance with the established policy and procedural arrangements, supplementary grants totalling $15,612,080 to cover cost increases which have occurred since the 1976 and 1977 programs in respect of colleges of advanced education were adopted. The supplementary grants being provided for the 1976 program comprise $2,834,000 for recurrent expenditure and $1,489,380 for capital expenditure. </para>
          <para>In the case of the 1 977 program, the amounts of cost supplementation being provided for in the Bill comprises $7,661,000 for recurrent expenditure and $3,627,700 for capital expenditure and are based on indices to take account of increases in costs up to December 1976. Adjustments for subsequent cost movements will be required as the relevant indices become available. As the amendments included in the Bill affect the programs detailed in the schedules to the Acts, the opportunity has been taken to include in the revised schedules a number of intra-program transfers of funds which have been approved under the provisions of the Acts. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>
          <para>States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment  Bill 1977 </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the States Grants (Schools) Act 1972, the States Grants (Schools) Act 1976 and the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1976 to adjust grants to the States for government and non-government schools. The amended schedules will finalise the adjustment of 1976 grants in respect of cost increases to December 1976 and adjust grants for 1977 to December 1976 prices. The funds appropriated will provide for an increase of $3.3m over the allocations in the existing Acts covering the 1976 program. The adjustment of grants for the 1977 program in respect of cost increases involves an additional appropriation of $ 10.9m. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>
          <para>States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1977 </para>
          <para>This Bill amends the States Grants (Technical and Further Education) Act 1974 and the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1976 to adjust the approved programs of grants to the States for technical and further education, to provide for cost supplementation to December 1976 price levels. The Bill maintains the real value of grants approved by the Government in the light of known variations in costs since adjustments were made in the Budget sittings last year. This Bill completes the cost supplementation process for the States Grants (Technical and Further Education) Act 1974. The additional amount provided is $0.686m. It also adjusts retrospectively the amounts available within the various schedules in the Act to take account of determinations made by the Minister administering the Act in accordance with sections 16 and 24 of the Act. These determinations were taken to meet the wishes of the States in adjusting the flow of funds available under the various schedules of the Act to suit the particular expenditure needs of the States. An additional $2. 762m is being provided for the 1977 program. Further amendments to the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1976 will be necessary as information becomes available on movements in costs during 1977.I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>
          <para>States Grants (Universities Assistance) Amendment Bill 1977 </para>
          <para>This Bill amends the States Grants (Universities) Act 1976 and the States Grants (Universities Assistance) Act 1976 to adjust the approved programs of grants to State universities for the years 1976 and 1977 respectively. The Bill maintains the real value of grants approved by the Government in the light of known variations in costs since adjustments were made in the Budget sittings last year. The additional amounts to be paid to the States have been calculated on the basis of cost levels for the December quarter 1976 for operating expenses and December 1976 for building expenditure. The additional amounts for 1976 total $7.3m of which $5.3m is for operating expenditure and $2m for building projects. In respect of the year 1977 an additional $ 15.9m is provided of which $ 15.6m is for operating expenditure and $300,000 for building projects. </para>
          <para>Further amendments to the States Grants (Universities) Act 1976, in respect of grants for building projects, and to the States Grants (Universities Assistance) Act 1976 will be required as information becomes available on movements in costs during 1977.I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- Last night the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> gave an explanation about some of the questions that I had raised in respect of division 270.4.09, which relates to Aboriginal Study Grants. I wish to refer again to the table on page 14 of the report presented by Estimates Committee C. That table was referred to last night. I do not yet have my copy of yesterday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> but I think the Minister said that the figures in that table referred to the number of students receiving the study grants at the end of each particular year. The table is entitled: &#39;Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme- Numbers in training each year since inception of scheme (total number at some time during year)&#39;. My first question is this: Does the reference to the total number at some time during the year indicate the number of students for that year as at the end of December? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A further query I have relates to the explanatory notes which the Estimates Committee had in front of it when considering the estimates for the Department of Education. In part the explanatory notes say that the original appropriation for 1976-77, $1.5m, was lower than the expenditure in 1975-76, $ 1.72m. It would have required restrictions to be imposed in 1977 on either the number of students or benefits. I ask the Minister whether a policy decision had been made, before the appropriation for 1976-77, that there would be fewer students or lesser benefits for that year. If that did happen, was a subsequent policy decision made to reverse that decision? </para>

            <para>- As to the first question, yes, I am advised that it relates to the December figure. I think the honourable senator will find that that was the information I stated last night. As to the second question, there was no policy decision that there would be fewer students. There was an estimation of how many students there would be. It is very hard to estimate the number of students, bearing in mind that social and economic conditions and individual decisions of people are involved in making these determinations. What happened was that when it was discovered that the demand was bigger than the budgetary allocation provided for, a short term device employing the Tertiary Education Allowance Scheme was used and a longer term device to obtain more money was used. This is regarded as a very valuable scheme. There is no way by which any government ever has or ever can put an open ended amount of money on any line in the Budget. But in this case we have been able to resolve the matter by providing places for those who have come forward even though the demand over the period has exceeded our own estimates. </para>

            <para>- I know that this matter has been resolved and that apparently the students who applied and who were eligible for a grant under the scheme have received one. Those who were placed on the Tertiary Education Allowances Scheme as a temporary measure have now been taken off it. But let me go back to the explanation that was given in the explanatory notes. It was said that the original appropriation for 1976-77 of $1.5m was lower than the expenditure in 1975-76 of $1. 72m and would have required restrictions to be imposed in 1977 on either the number of students or benefits. Can we take it from what the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> has just said that the estimate of students that was used for providing the funds available under this appropriation was less for 1976-77 than for 1975- 76. If that is the case, I think that this is a sound explanation because when the number of students who applied for the grant was noted and when it was found that the Budget appropriation was not sufficient, extra funds were made available. But was it the case that it was estimated that there would be fewer students in 1976- 77. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me put the second question that I have. I think that the Minister will be able to explain the matters quite clearly. As one who is not too sure of how government finances are made available when there is a shortfall, as happened in this case, may I ask: In respect of those students who were placed on the Tertiary Education Allowances Scheme because sufficient funds were not available, how has money now been made available to place those students on the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme and payments made retrospective? </para>

            <para>- Let me say in answer to the first question, as to what was the attitude of mind in arriving at the figure, that I think that 2 streams of thought were involved. There was a general appreciation of the likely numbers coming forward and, equally, a Budget which in every sense had restraints. But our aim was to meet the demands if we could. I stress that the key thing in this is that it is never thoroughly clear with Aboriginal students what the demand will be. The second part of the honourable senator&#39;s question asks where we got the money from. It turned out that there were surplus funds in the Aboriginal Secondary Educational Grants Scheme, ABSEG, without there being any need for us to restrict ABSEG. So we used those funds. I suppose it could be said that, on the one hand, there was an underestimation of numbers or, on the other hand, there was an overestimation of numbers, even though the ABSEG numbers are moving up each year. </para>

          <para>Aboriginal people make decisions to undertake studies from time to time for a variety of reasons. We can only do our best to meet their needs. If we can we try to have flexibility of policy. I think the expedients we used happily have reached the right conclusion. I think the honourable senator acknowledges that. Whether one could have had greater perception at the time of budgeting or whether also one had in one&#39;s mind some sense of the ordinary restraints is a subjective judgment. But the expedients worked, as it turned out. </para>

            <para>- I take the opportunity of this debate of the Estimates to ask the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> a question that I have been asking for a number of months. It relates to the Great Barrier Reef and the research into the problems the Barrier Reef area faces that a variety of committees have considered to be necessary. I ask the Minister: What research has been undertaken under the estimates for his Department to meet the problems of the Barrier Reef, with specific relationship with pollution from the mainland, over-fishing of the passage between the mainland and the Barrier Reef, and the general ravages inflicted on the Barrier Reef by shell collectors and spear fishermen. I list all the problems now because, although the Minister may not be able to answer these questions now, he may be able to do so at a later stage. I think it is wise that the matter should be raised in the Senate at this stage. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I go from the general to a particular matter and refer to the starfish infestation of the Great Barrier Reef. What progress has been made in this respect; what research moneys have been made available; what assessments of the problem has the Minister received; and when can he provide us with a further statement on this problem? I mention another problem faced by the Great Barrier Reef, although I do not think it concerns the Department of Science as much as possibly the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. In spite of recommendations by a number of committeessome Senate committees and some joint committees of the Parliament- a renewed case for the need to drill the Great Barrier Reef seems to be emerging. I have received a letter from the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> but, if what he says in the letter is correct, this problem does concern the Department of Science. I shall read part of the letter I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline> in response to a question I asked about speculation on oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. The second paragraph reads as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>You will be aware that the previous government banned oil drilling in the Barrier Reef area pending research into possible effects of oil on the ecosystem of the Reef. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">My view at the time of the previous Government- it is still my view- is that the previous Government banned oil drilling in the Barrier Reef area and the ban was not dependent upon research into the possible effects of oil on the ecosystem of the Reef. Oil drilling of the Great Barrier Reef, which is now the responsibility of the Great Barrier Reef Authority, was prohibited under the policy of the previous Government. I was of the opinion that it was the policy of the present Government as well. If, however, the ban is dependent upon research into the effect of oil on the ecosystem of the Reef then one must ask whether any research is being undertaken into the effects of oil on the ecosystem of the Reef and, if so, whether the Department of Science is involved in this research. </para>
          <para>My view is that research may be necessary to discover what effects oil spills would have on the continental shelf. I am not saying we ought not to be engaged in that research; what I am saying is that the future of the Barrier Reef ought not to be dependent on that research. I thought the Barrier Reef area was excluded from the problem of oil spills and oil drilling. I should like the Minister for Science to take up this matter. I raise it because I think that, if there is a renewed interest in drilling the Great Barrier Reef, the organisations which took such an interest in this matter, those who strongly opposed oil drilling in this area and succeeded in having a prohibition applied, ought now to take a renewed interest in the matter. I repeat that although it may not be possible for the Minister to answer the various questions I have asked, I still believe it necessary to place the questions on record at this stage. </para>

            <para>- As the honourable senator will realise, the general problems relating to the Great Barrier Reef do not fall totally within the area of science. The honourable senator mentioned pollution, overfishing of the area and the ravages of shellfish collectors. On several occasions he has expressed his interest in future research into the effects of the starfish. That has been a matter of concern to him over a number of years. All those matters certainly do not fall within the responsibility of the Department of Science. As was suggested by the honourable senator, it may be as well for me to look carefully and at his questions and, so far as I am able, bring forward a co-ordinated response in relation to the general requirement for research into many aspects of that part of Queensland. The honourable senator will know that the Queensland Government has prime responsibility in nearly all the areas he mentioned. The Federal Government in a variety of ways has taken a further interest in matters such as those that were mentioned by the honourable senator, including the crown of thorns starfish. I am unable to say whether the situation is as outlined by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman).</inline> My understanding is that research is going on at the present time into the effect of oil on marine life within the Reef area. My understanding is that the prime work is being done in the State area in Queensland. The Federal Government&#39;s interest, of course, has flowed from funding some of the bodies, as I recall it, which were mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> Obviously any information in this area gained by the Institute of Marine Science at Townsville will flow through to my Department. It is not my Department&#39;s prime responsibility to be looking at the effect of oil slick on the Great Barrier Reef itself. The </para>

              <para>-No. It would be as a result of the submerged lands case that some responsibility is placed on the Commonwealth in these areas. However, I am unable to comment on whether the Government has made a final decision with regard to oil drilling which was banned by the previous Government. I am not able to state exactly what the situation is at the moment because the matter is not within my portfolio or related to these estimates. </para>

            <para>- I must persist with this because I do believe that the Minister is not aware of the responsibility that the Commonwealth Government now has. He is still of the opinion that the prime responsibility for the Great Barrier Reef rests with Queensland. I would have thought that because of the legislation which was passed and which was upheld by the High Court the prime responsibility rested with the Australian Government. It is not a matter for the State to determine what research will be carried out and what will be the effects flowing from that research. I believe it is the responsibility of the Australian Government. I know that 2 departments are involved. If the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development has been carrying out research, surely it would be carrying out that research with the assistance of the Minister&#39;s Department. It would be quite unacceptable if the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development set up a whole area of scientific research without the cooperation and full involvement of the Minister&#39;s Department. That is the question that I am putting to him. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me make this point clear. As far as the Opposition is concerned because of the legislation for which the Labor Government was responsible, the responsibility for the Great Barrier Reef rests with the Australian Government. The Australian Government has appointed an authority and it has also appointed a consultative committee. I do not doubt that the Department of Science is represented on that consultative committee. I would like to challenge what the Minister has said. The prime responsibility is not that of the State. The prime responsibility lies with the Commonwealth Government and for that reason the Minister has a prime responsibility in this area. </para>

            <para>- I seek information from the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> on a different matter. I am conscious of the massive reservoir of scientific know-how that he has in the Department that he controls but I am concerned with the dissemination of that information. In July a biannual meeting of the State Ministers responsible for wild life conservation and the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> will be held. Numerous papers are prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Frith</inline> and his colleagues on a wide variety of marsupials and bird life. Are those reports compulsory reading for State Conservation Ministers? They certainly should be, in view of the utterances that some of them make. I say that seriously. When they meet in July, will their officers be supplied with some of these in-depth studies that have been made by the Minister&#39;s officers? </para>

          <para>The second point I want to raise deals with scientific research. We now have a Minister for Productivity. I should like to refer to the wider field of noise- construction workers using jackhammers and that sort of thing. When decibel readings of the noise of such equipment are made is any research carried out by officers of the Minister&#39;s Department? If it is, is the information fed back to the Department of Productivity and to the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations? I give the Committee a particular illustration. Many honourable senators are aware of the problems in the Northern Territory when people use jackhammers- dust in the air and potential silicosis and even, in the case of asbestos workers, the possibility of lung cancer. Is pure industrial research carried out by officers of the Minister&#39;s Department or are these problems deemed to be medical problems to be studied by officers of the Commonwealth Department of Health? </para>

However, I am of the view that for the past 12 months at least the information that has flowed into the media from CSIRO about its activities has been greater than previously. It has been my responsibility to see that information from the many divisions of CSIRO is made available to the public. I believe that this is happening and has happened in greatly increased volume over the past 12 months. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> has a suggestion as to how the information that flows from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Frith</inline> and his Division of Wildlife Research could be circulated more widely, I would be pleased to hear from him.

          <para>Several instrumentalities are carrying out research into the problem of noise. It is of immense importance. The CSIRO, despite the light resources it has at the moment, has allocated people to this study. They even go into industry and attempt to identify the original sources of noise in high revolution machinery which may be objectionable to those working in the area or those nearby. It has been brought to my attention that after such studies have been carried out it has been possible to reduce the noise greatly to the benefit of the environment. The National Standards Commission funds a number of bodies which take unto themselves the requirement of setting standards for noise. There are some groups of people involved in industry who voluntarily, with some assistance in their secretarial work, attempt to assist in this research field, so establishing for the Australian Government some standard relating to the decibel level that we are able to stand within the community. So in respect of the 2 areas that the honourable senator mentioned, he can be assured that research is being done. I will attempt to get more information and supply it to him. </para>

There may be such a paper. There is no comment from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> I am curious to know whether there are any such papers that I could study. Perhaps the FED&#38;FA and other unions that cover overhead crane drivers could use them in future arbitration award hearings. I think some research has been done on the noise in boiler shops and places like that where the noise goes up from the shop floor but not on decibel readings for crane drivers working say, 50 feet or 70 feet above the floor. Perhaps the Minister&#39;s officers can tell me whether there are any papers in existence on that type of research. </para>

              <para>-Thank you. Perhaps I could commence with an apology. I raise these matters at the insistence of my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> who is unable to be in the Senate this morning. I wish to direct attention to the figures which are disclosed at page 1 7 of the report of Senate Estimates Committee E. I think it is an appendix arising from a letter from the Department of the Northern Territory to the Secretary of the Committee. On page 5 of the letter certain figures are given as to the approved strength and the actual strength of the Northern Territory Police Force. The approved establishment is shown as 468, the approved ceiling as 448 and the actual strength as at 30 April 1977 as 438. So the force is under strength and having regard to the crime rate in the Territory I ask the Minister whether some action can be taken to bring the force up to strength. </para>

            <para>- I am advised that a paper has been circulated- this is on page 1 7- in the form of a letter from the Minister for the Northern Territory to the Secretary of Estimates Committee E. As the honourable senator has indicated, it is quite a lengthy letter which dealt with many things. It dealt with the strength of the Northern Territory Police Force. I agree that the force is under strength at the present time. I am advised that 22 police trainees have graduated in recent times, that is, since this letter was forwarded, and this would boost the strength of the force. My recollection of the evidence that was given to Estimates Committee E is to the effect that there was difficulty in recruiting suitable people for the force. It is an excellent force and because of the standards which are required it has not always been possible for the administration to keep the force at full strength. </para>

            <para>- There are 2 matters on which I would like an explanation. One is the payment of workers&#39; compensation under subdivision 2.05.I am much concerned with the increased appropriations which are sought each year for workers&#39; compensation. I would like to know whether anything has been done within the Department of Construction for the purpose of trying to avoid accidents rather than the Parliament appropriating each year increased amounts of money because of the number of accidents that have happened. In the Budget the appropriation for workers compensation is $135,000. An extra $55,000 is sought so obviously there was a shortfall of the estimated requirements up to June. This Department is apparently paying out about $190,000 a year in workers&#39; compensation. I think many of the accidents that happen at work and which justify the payment of workers&#39; compensation are avoidable. I very much doubt that all safety precautions are taken on construction jobs for employees within this Department. What is the reason for the additional appropriation of $55,000 which is being sought? Has there been an increase in the number of accidents above that which was anticipated at Budget time? Expenditure for the year 1975-76 was $125,000 on workers compensation. It is nearly $200,000 today. This is a big increase. I wonder whether some accidents could be avoided with more housekeeping on job sites and more care being taken to protect employees. I would also like to know the additional expenditure for furniture and fittings supplied to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for which there was no appropriation in the last Budget. </para>

            <para>-My understanding is that this matter of compensation was raised originally at the estimates committee hearing. I think it was decided there that if one looked at the figure, it would be realised that the Department of Construction, with its very large body of employees, had an excellent safety record and had a low application rate for workers compensation. One must recognise that some the awards of a court in relation to compensation for individual people may be extremely high. The honourable senator would know that the requirement for employers to insure those employees engaged in the construction industry means that they must pay one of the highest insurance premium levels because of the very great risks associated with working in that type of industry. My recollection is that either at the last estimates committee hearing or at the one previous to it, officers of the Department of Construction described the committee that had been set up and the way in which it attempted to reduce the incidence of accidents on all work which is now within the purview of the Department. I think I would be correct in saying that the transcript of evidence of the estimates committee either for this year or for the previous year would show that. I can only say that I am unable to comment on the amount of $55,000. If that is the figure, I can only suggest to the honourable senator that in view of the very large area of employment of this Department, it appears to me, at least, to be a very low figure. The honourable senator can be assured that this Department has a specific committee whose work is related to the reduction of incidence of injury to employees of the Department. </para>

            <para>- I accept the Minister&#39;s reply concerning furniture and fittings for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I would greatly appreciate the information at some future date. I want to point out that the Department of Construction does not have a large force on construction sites. It has a large work force employed mostly in the clerical or supervisory area which attracts a low risk insurance premium. The forces on construction sites mainly are provided by contractors and are not covered by this appropriation as these contractors supply their own workers compensation. The Department has a maintenance force in the field of construction but there has been a reduction in staff in that area. Whether their overall record is good or bad, with a reduced work force at this time in this area of risk on construction sites- that is, the overall work force- the point is that there is a big increase over the appropriation for 1 975-76. This seems to me to indicate some lack of safety precautions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have taken up with the Minister the question of the operation of the Department in Adelaide where there seemed to be a club system of promotion. The most efficient construction expert, the most efficient tradesman, the one with the greatest ability to organise is not, of necessity, obtaining promotion. Promotion seems to be given to someone in the group favoured by the management in Adelaide. Is this a cause? Is the reduced manpower in the maintenance area today one cause? Is it due to the fact that there is not a gang, a group, which seems to give some protection, or is it due to the fact that the individual working on his own today is not supplied with sufficient scaffolding or has less time to clean up a job? The main cause of injury on construction sites is the rubbish that is left hanging around the job. Is this a cause? In a period in which there has been a reduction in staff there has been an increase in compensation. I want to find out why this is so. It is no use saying that the Department has a good safety record. The record is getting bad if compensation payments are increasing at a time when the staff is being reduced. </para>

            <para>- In my opinion one of the great benefits of the system of estimates committees which has been developed by the Senate is the ability of senators to come along to an estimates committee- in this case Estimates Committee E under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright-</inline> and ask the most intensive and direct questions, through the Minister, of the officer who is most appropriate to answer that question. At Estimates Committee E, when the Department of Construction was being examined, it probably would have been possible to obtain a direct answer to the direct question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> He has raised matters such as higher compensation payments this year whilst there is a reduction in staff. I would need to check my answer but my understanding is that the Department is responsible for a very large work force. The figure in my mind is of the order of 1 2 000. </para>

              <para>- I know of the honourable senator&#39;s interest in this matter. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> as a former Minister for Works, would agree that at one stage the figure was 17 000, if I remember correctly. That figure depends on whether there is day labour or contract labour. The senator mentioned that on many large jobs, where the role of the staff of the Department of Construction is purely supervisory, there is not a great number of staff engaged in actual construction. Nevertheless, the day labour force requires compensation cover by the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- With the expert advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> I am able to answer the question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> asks. With regard to what is the normal level of compensation, obviously it would be agreed that in no year could one predict that the figure required for compensation will be at a particular level or whether it should be extremely high to cover compensation for such things as loss of life or loss of limb. One accident may require very high compensation compared with that for a thousand other accidents. I remember the question about rubbish on sites being raised at the estimates committee. It would be my view that this Government Department is perhaps more alert of the need to keep sites clean, whether for efficiency of access or for the ideal of keeping the accident rate as low as possible, than many private firms are. I have heard the honourable senator ask questions in this place relating to South Australia. He has some knowledge of what the Department does there. If there is anything particularly relating to that State which he would wish me to take up  with the Minister on studying the request in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard I</inline> will do so. </para>

              <para>- I bow to your wisdom, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman.</inline> I have not a lot to contribute on the question which I thought was quite appropriate because it asked whether the Commonwealth&#39;s main maintenance and construction authority had responsibility for the maintenance of the roof of Parliament House. I think instructions to that authority would come from within Parliament House.

These matters were dealt with by Estimates Committee E on 3 May 1977.I refer the honourable senator, perhaps without taking up too much time of the Committee, to pages 238 and 239 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. The matter of the payments under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act is dealt with in questions by Committee members and in answers by officers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> queried the matter of furniture and fittings for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. That matter was raised and answered on page 239. </para>

              <para>- I take the opportunity to make a comment in the Committee stage because I believe honourable senators are allowed some latitude in their remarks. There is a major leak in Parliament House. It is only rain coming in it is not a leak of information about which I am concerned at present. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> might be able to get some information before we finish consideration of this appropriation. </para>

          <para>During the last fortnight&#39;s recess rain poured in on the Senate side firstly through the roof into <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button&#39;s</inline> office. When that office soaked up as much as it could, the water came down the wall into my office. When I returned to Parliament House my office was like a musty old dungeon. In the course of trying to get the resultant odour out of my office by drying out the carpet, the carpenters who work in the building on a permanent basis had to remove the windows which were stuck and would not go up and down. I find from talking to the carpenters that they have great difficulty in getting equipment and parts to do any work around Parliament House. There is a whole chain of procedures to go through including the writing of orders and dockets. They should have some latitude if a part such as nails, screws or items of that nature are required so as to enable them to carry out their work expeditiously. They ought to be able to get these parts immediately without having to wait a week. I have a cracked window pane in my office. I understand that new glass cannot be obtained for some days and probably will not be available until next week. Therefore, it is patched up with sticky tape. This is not the way to run a parliament house. In my view it is an example of penny pinching. I think that whoever is responsible ought immediately to take steps to rectify the situation so that people working in the carpenters&#39; shop here have the necessary authority to be able to get the equipment they need immediately it is required. </para>

            <para>-  The reason I thought the responsibility would be with the Department of Construction is that in the report of the Committee mention is made of the expenditure involved in updating the Speaker&#39;s suite. Quite a bit ofrenovation was carried out there. I thought that, if the Department of Construction has responsibility for making the Speaker&#39;s suite more livable, surely the Department is responsible for making the offices of the members of this Parliament more livable. </para>

            <para>-  Taking up this matter, I point out that the responsibility for all repairs and maintenance to Parliament House is vested in the  Speaker  and the  President.  I do not know that those who from time to time occupy the positions of  Speaker  and  President  have a great knowledge of the building trade, so they call on some agency for the purpose of doing repairs. The maintenance staff in the House comprises I believe painters, electricians and carpenters. Anything of a major alteration or maintenance character is carried out by the Department of Construction. That is the authority which attends mainly to the maintenance and any additional construction in Parliament House. The  Speaker  and the  President  are clients of the Department. </para>

          <para>Many difficulties are involved with respect to Parliament House. There will not be a solution to the problems arising from the flat type roof because of its age. Whether it can be completely reroofed or re-flushed or whether the joints will hold the flushing I do not know. Ever since I have been here we have had the problem of a leaking roof. I think we can attribute this problem to the flat type roof. It is not only the roof but the whole of Parliament House which needs examination. Parliament House has been assessed as one of the greatest fire hazards in Canberra. Whether we will go up in smoke I do not know. The floorboards down the passageways, which are in 1 2 foot joints from joist to joist, are full of services cables. Electricity cables are everywhere and continual repairs are being carried out. The Department of Construction admits that the fire dangers in Parliament House are terrific. It may be that the water from the leaks will help to quench a fire if a fire occurs. We are living daily in unsatisfactory conditions with very little hope of solution. </para>
          <para>We are told that in 1988 we might get another Parliament House. Let us hope that the doors to this Parliament House are open so that we can escape if the need arises. Parliament House has been neglected. The Department of Construction possibly does have a responsibility when it lets a contract for certain work and the workmanship maybe is unsatisfactory. There is a lot to consider, including the age of the building and, I think, the preparedness of the Parliament to authorise massive repairs and maintenance to the House. It was built for a temporary purpose. Now there is demolition of the building inside. </para>

            <para>- First I seek from the Minister information as to whether this sum includes any money for restocking the Molonglo River with trout, having regard to the joint New South WalesCommonwealth project that is rehabilitating or stabilising the outflow of tailings into that river from the Captains Flat mining shaft. Secondly, as the Minister would know, successive Ministers for the Capital Territory visualised the gradual absorption of private land in the Gudgenby Creek national park or, in broader terms, the catchment area. I do not expect an answer off the cuff now. Could I have a table showing the current acreages of Australian Capital Territory land designated as national parks and park reserves, with particular reference to any land reverting to the Crown? Thirdly, some of the earlier industrial projects visualised for Jervis Bay were not proceeded with, such as the steel works and a few other things. I have not been there recently. Are any holes in the ground left from those projects? Who is responsible for filling them? They are the 3 matters in which I am interested. </para>

            <para>- I doubt whether I could add very much detail to the 3 questions raised by the honourable senator. They are matters on which I shall have to seek written advice for him. I am sure he would require that. The Estimates Committee system is a wonderful system by which we are able to bring from a department the person who is directly responsible for the putting of estimates to a government to adopt. He knows the projects. He knows the work. Through the Minister, he is available to answer directly particular questions. I recognise the difficulty that some members have in attending committee meetings to ask questions when other committees are sitting. The method that we have instituted gives us an opportunity to deal efficiently with the estimates and to get full information at first hand. However, within a few days I shall get this answer for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>-  I wish to say a few words on this matter because I am concerned at the Minister&#39;s remarks on this occasion and on a previous occasion when we were discussing the estimates for the Department of Construction. The establishment of the wonderful system of Estimates Committees was opposed by the Opposition because we had some doubts about taking from the Committee of the Whole the right to ask the questions that we did ask before the Estimates Committees came into operation. We were assured that questions could be asked in the Committee of the Whole. Those who did not attend Estimates Committee meetings or could not attend them had the right to ask questions in the Committee of the Whole. The Estimates Committee system was never intended to be a substitute for the Committee of the Whole. Now we are told that the departmental officers who can supply the information attend the Estimates Committees but not the Committee of the Whole. The Committee of the Whole is now taking a secondary role to the Estimates Committees, contrary to what was promised at the time of their establishment. That was never intended. That should not apply. The Committee of the Whole is the major place where these things should be discussed. Because more intimate answers can be obtained at the Estimates Committees they have continued. While they are an established fact at present, they should not seek to impose themselves upon the Committee of the Whole. The right to ask questions and get an answer remains with the Committee of the Whole. </para>

              <para>- I relate my remarks to the answer given by the Minister, although he clarified it after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> spoke. Great difficulties are imposed on senators who attend diligently committees to which they are appointed. I was appointed a member of Estimates Committee A. Senators appointed to a committee are unable to attend other committees to ask questions. A view seems to be developing in this place that if in the Committee of the Whole a senator asks questions to get answers to matters which were dealt with by committees which he was unable to attend, he is holding up the business of the Committee of the Whole. I do not take very kindly to those charges being laid against senators. Senators who attend diligently the Estimates Committee to which they have been appointed are prevented from attending other committees. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> said yesterday that he did not seek appointment to any committee because he wanted to flit from one to another, pursuing points of interest here and there. That is not good enough, in my view. A senator must be strong and attach himself to one or two committees and carry out the work he is elected to do. If a senator does that and wants to pursue other avenues at other committees, surely he should not be upbraided for asking questions in the Committee of the Whole about matters discussed by other committees. Surely a senator should not be told that he is holding up the work of the Committee of the Whole. I reserve my right to ask questions in the Committee of the Whole. </para>

            <para>- I take up the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> because I think it is an important one. While I recognise that the Minister has agreed with the general complaint, I remind him, as I remind you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman,</inline> of the discussions held in this chamber in relation to the setting up of the Estimates Committees. Quite a broad section of senators felt that the main forum for discussion of the business of the Parliament and the expenditure of the Government was the Committee of the Whole. We were divided in that view. Those who supported the setting up of the Estimates Committees felt that those committees could play a very valuable role. Others disagreed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> was one. He had his reasons. He advanced his reasons today. Most of us agree that an honourable senator it entitled to receive information during the sitting of the Committee of the Whole even if it is a repetition of what might have been supplied to an Estimates Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and other honourable senators have pointed out that it is impossible for senators to apply themselves to all the committees. Most senators have a number of interests. I had to direct myself to one committee, but I was interested in 3 subjects being considered by 3 different committees. Everybody would agree that nowadays the Senate is involved more in committee work. All of us are involved in committees of the Parliament and party committees. Consequently, it is impossible to keep track of all the replies which are recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Sometimes replies are not adequate. </para>

          <para>When the Estimates Committees were set up originally at the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson was Leader of the Government in the Senate everybody agreed that no honourable senator should be inhibited in discussing points in the Committee of the Whole even though the details sough may have been provided to an Estimates Committee. It would be a bad thing if we took the view that because a matter was partly answered before the Estimates Committees the  Chairman  of the Committee of the Whole directed that it could not be followed up. We want to keep this place broadly advised about the workings of all committees. I hope that the initial arrangements agreed upon when we set up these committees are adhered to. At one time there was a move to disband the Estimates Committees. I hope that they continue on the original basis. </para>

            <para>-  I have been prompted to enter this discussion by the thoughtless remarks recently made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline> He seemed to accuse me of flitting from committee to committee and implied that that was not good enough; that I ought to be elected to one committee, do my job on that committee, and then perhaps raise other matters in the Committee of the Whole. It was only out of deference to the Australian Labor Party that I did not put my name forward for nomination to any of the committees, because had I done so, under standing orders, I would have taken one of its places on a committee. </para>

I wonder whether in serving the Free Polish Government in Exile this man, in terms of the Act as it is drawn, qualifies for a benefit. I wonder whether Nelson&#39;s blind eye cannot be turned, in repatriation matters at any rate, to many of the claims that are made.

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Cavanagh</inline>has raised an individual case involving a rather complicated set of facts. He raised a number of problems as to eligibility for various types of pension. Probably I should not endeavour to answer the matter raised in the Committee of the Whole without conducting a full investigation into all the details. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has already given us enough information to allow the matter to be fully investigated. Perhaps he might like to give in writing supplementary information to that which he has already given or perhaps he might like to see me about the matter. However, he has given sufficient in his remarks to enable me to say that he has raised the problem of eligibility for the service pension of people who served in allied forces during the war. That matter has been the subject of quite a lot of discussion in the last year or more. I recently answered some questions in the Senate in relation to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> in particular asked me some questions about it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Broadly, the position is that eligibility for the service pension was extended by the Labor Government to those who served in the forces of Commonwealth countries; but it has not been extended to those who served with allied forces generally. A good deal of argument and many submissions have been put up to the effect that it should be so extended. If that were done it would comprehend a person such as the man mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> who served under British command but as part of the Polish Air Force. Other Polish forces served under British command. </para>

              <para>-The best known were those who served in Tobruk. I have said that the Government is sympathetic to the claims made by those people. In fact, it is the policy of the Liberal and National Country parties to consider extending eligibility for the service pension to include those people. I am looking at the matter again in the Budget context. At this stage no decision has been made or can be made. Of course, the major problem is to keep government expenditure under restraint. One of the problems is that it is very difficult to ascertain the cost to revenue of such an extension. </para>

          <para>As regards the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> it would appear that consideration has to be given to the question of whether the former Polish airman received a disability pension from the British Government. The British Government does pay a pension for disability, but not a service pension. I understand from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> said that this man suffered some disability. It may be that he had been receiving a disability pension. However, that is something that we would have to check out in detail. </para>
          <para>The only other point that occurs to me in relation to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has said is that the gentleman apparently is not eligible under the means test for an age pension because his wife is working. Of course, the service pension also is subject to a means test, almost the same means test that is applied to the age pension. It would be unlikely, therefore, that he would be eligible to receive a service pension if he were not eligible to receive the age pension on the ground of means. </para>

          <para class="block">Veterans&#39; Affairs. Apparently he decided to terminate the payment of the pension after determining that this man does not qualify. So whoever was paying the pension, obviously it was being paid through the Department of Veterans&#39; Affairs. I do not know whether the Department was acting as an agent for the British Government or whether the pension was granted by the Australian Government, and I do not think the man concerned knows who was actually paying it. However, a pension was paid. The Minister has just suggested in his reply and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Marshall</inline> suggested in his letter that the Act provides for the payment of the pension only to citizens of a dominion of the British Crown. Therefore the judgment was made on the basis of the Australian Act. If that was the justification for refusing to continue to pay the pension, it looks as though the payment was made by Australia. However, the Department would have records to show that. </para>
          <para>I wish to clear up the matter. The Department of Social Security has determined that he is not entitled to an age pension because he is not yet 65 years of age. His inability to work would qualify him to receive an invalid pension but the payment of that pension is subject to a means test. He can receive an invalid pension only if his wife gives up work. As he said, he is not destitute at the present time. His occupation was an aircraft welder, for which one has to have high qualifications in the welding field. He has said also that he has always been highly paid in his work. For the first time he does not have an income of his own and he has to ask his wife for the money to buy a packet of cigarettes. That is a humiliating experience for a man who has provided for his family all his life. I can do no more than ask the Minister to examine the details of the matter that I have read into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

I ask him whether there is any problem in processing the pension applications lodged with his Department and whether, when an application is granted, he has sufficient staff to enable him to notify other departments that a pension has been granted by the Department of Veterans&#39; Affairs and thus prevent from happening what occurred in relation to a case that has been brought to my attention.

          <para>This situation has been brought about because the Department of Veterans&#39; Affairs did not notify the Department of Social Security in time to stop the payment of these cheques. It might not be all the fault of the Minister&#39;s Department. No doubt some fault lies with the Department of Social Security which may be running into troubles with staff ceilings. I would like the Minister to say whether his Department is having any problems in that area. In conclusion, I hope that the Department of Social Security will take the same action as that mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and will waive any claims for the recovery of money that has been overpaid through no fault of the pensioner. </para>

On the clerical and administrative side, the Department has a staff of something like 3500 people in the various regional offices in Australia. So some mistakes are bound to occur. These are rectified as well and as quickly as is possible. The honourable senator asked whether staff ceilings are causing any trouble in this regard. It has not been brought to my attention that there is any problem in the Department as a result ofstaff ceilings. </para>

              <para>-I am talking about the administrative and clerical side with which the question is concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> mentions the hospitals. Pockets of difficulty have been created in implementing some of the changes associated with staff ceilings. They have not been major difficulties. We have been able to rearrange the staff and move them from places where there have been more than enough to p laces where there has been a temporary prob- lem. There was some industrial problem at the end of last year with the Hospital Employees Federation but that was resolved and I am not aware of any further difficulties which have occurred. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>As to the general question of staff ceilings, this is a matter to which the Government attaches the highest importance and priority. The Government has said that where any pockets of difficulties arise these will be considered and, if really necessary, changes can be made in individual ceilings in a particular area. No major problem of that kind has arisen in my Department but, as I have said, where some minor difficulties have arisen in one place or another these have been attended to as quickly as possible. However, it must be understood that with a very large staffing as there is throughout the repatriation institutions- I think that in excess of 7000 people are employed in those institutions around Australiasome problems naturally arise. The Department of Veterans &#39; Affairs has escaped very lightly as far as staff ceilings are concerned. Of course, that is due to the recognition by the Government of the most important and direct services in the health and welfare field, particularly in the institutions, rendered by the Department. </para>

            <para>- I refer to page 28 of the report of Estimates Committee F which contains a letter from the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street,</inline> to me concerning the long drawn out proceedings in regard to award breaches by James Richardson Pty Ltd which holds a concession at the Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. I have traversed this matter in the second reading debate but I want to relate my remarks to the appeasement policy that has been followed in trying to reach agreement with the Commonwealth Arbitration Inspectorate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland has spoken about the laxity in presenting up to date reports, and that structure can be applied in the case of the report of the Commonwealth Arbitration Inspectorate for the period 1 July 1 975 to 30 June 1 976. The Inspectorate, drawing attention to government policy, said: </para>

            <para>In December 1975 the Government decided that the more rigorous award enforcement policy introduced by the former Government in 1973 should be reviewed in the light of the experience gained by the Inspectorate in applying that policy. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It went on to say that the outcome of the review was unknown at 30 June 1976. That was the case when this report was completed. To sum up, I think that the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> and I have been under duress as we received a letter from the solicitors for James Richardson Pty Ltd claiming that we were unfair. It was late last year that this matter was first ventilated. I would like to know when an answer will be received on it. The Commonwealth Arbitration Inspectorate report contains a hall of fame setting out the names of people who have been prosecuted. This firm has not been prosecuted. I believe, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> believes, that we should get around the table and try to reach agreement. </para>
          <para>In my mind it is inconceivable that the matter was discussed with the company late last year, and it is now the fifth month of 1977, and we are no further advanced. In the meantime the nomadic female workers from the company have scattered all over Australia and it will be an insurmountable task to provide them with their back pay. I would like the Minister to indicate whether the Government will act as Bismark did and adopt a tougher policy in the future because its policy of being fair and talking to these people in this case has cost the taxpayer 78-man weeks in going through the time sheets. Surely we should be able to computerise the time sheets for the last 3 years. These facts simply cry out for a tougher policy towards firms like James Richardson Pty Ltd. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> like me, was stunned by the easy going manner in which this firm has been handled. </para>

              <para>- So it is a substantial claim. As honourable senators will realise, the compilation of records is taking the Department quite a long time. I therefore respectfully ask the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> whether he will discuss with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations whether the claims of those employees have been determined and whether there have been breaches. It would appear that in some respects there have been breaches and that in other respects things are being determined. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I refer also to a matter which has been raised with the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs before, that is, the general services provided by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. I am not just talking about the counter services provided by the Commonwealth Employment Service, but about all that Department&#39;s activities. As the Minister would know, that Department&#39;s activities have been widely extended these days into areas including youth programs, increased apprenticeship coverage and things like that. This raises the question of whether existing staff is sufficient to provide the services. We know that we have a very serious unemployment problem. We know that because of representations made by the unions and honourable senators efforts have been made to encourage the introduction of programs for apprentices, youth community groups and, of equal importance, the establishment of services for unemployed people who have applied for jobs to provide co-ordination between those who are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service and employer groups to enable those unemployed people to secure jobs which are available on the labour market. </para>
          <para>The Senate will recall that over a period of 12 months honourable senators here, including myself, have raised from time to time with the Minister the question of staff ceilings, particularly in respect of this Department. As a result of representations from the Public Service unions and, I would hope, as a result of our representations, an examination was made. An inquiry is obtaining. But I understand that there has been a temporary addition to the staff of some 300 persons. I understand from the staff associations that there are still problems in the areas I have mentioned. The matter <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> has raised encourages me to think that additional staff might still be needed in the Department to carry out all its activities, as well as in all its agencies which are located at places approved by the Department. In the general situation of unemployment I should hope that a review would be made of the agencies to see whether they are a satisfactory substitute for permanent offices. </para>
          <para>I should like to know from the Minister whether, as a result of representations from the staff associations, agreement has been reached concerning the staffing of all departments. I know an inquiry is continuing. I should like to be informed whether that inquiry covers the matters I have raised. A number of employer organisations in my State have added their criticisms to those I have mentioned. It would appear that there is a need for adequate staff for first stage consultations by officers of the Department. There is a need also for adequate training staff. There is a need for improvement in all areas servicing the employment and labour market. I hope the Minister can inform me whether the Norgard inquiry is inquiring into these matters. </para>

            <para>- To save the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs from having to reply twice. I should like to add to a postscript to my earlier submissions. The matter that is worrying <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> and myself is that we received written information from the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> indicating that his departmental officers said that they were unaware of the failure by James Richardson Company Pty Ltd to observe an award. With respect, I should like to see more liaison between the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and the Commonwealth Arbitration Inspectorate so that the Department would know the track record of a tenderer who was up for review. I say this for another reason. As recently as last week I had a discussion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brian</inline> O&#39;Neill, the senior officer of the New South Wales Branch of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Union. It would appear, unfortunately, that James Richardson Company Pty Ltd is like the Bourbons of old- it has never forgotten anything and it has never learned anything. </para>

          <para>We all know that not so long ago when we had that very difficult air traffic controllers dispute in the aviation industry a lot of unions and government departments showed commendable restraint by not enlarging that dispute; but in its typically bucaneer style, James Richardson Company Pty Ltd within a day of that dispute commencing, was trying to have everybody stood down. I think it ill behoves a firm to do that when a reasonable means of getting out of things was being sought. </para>

              <para>-I shall tell the honourable senator why. In the first instance, this company has duped people for $25,000. Secondly, the honourable senator and I and everyone else in this chamber as taxpayers are having to pay for the inspectors to do a job which would not be necessary and therefore would not cost the taxpayers money if that company were taken to court and prosecuted. The name of that company would then appear on the back of the Arbitration Inspectorate report, where it ought to appear. All I am saying is that this company has made a mistake. The honourable senator who interjected believes in penalty clauses, so he should agree that James Richardson Company Pty Ltd ought not to have its tender renewed. </para>

            <para>- I wish to make a brief inquiry and comment in relation to sub-division 3.10, dealing with the Regional Employment Development scheme. I note that the additional amount appropriated is $120,000. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I should be grateful for an indication from the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs of what that additional appropriation relates to. I want to express some general concern about the question of the Regional Employment Development scheme in the light of the Government&#39;s election promise of December 1975 that the Scheme, which the Labor Government in the Budget of 1975 had announced would be phased out, would be restored by this Government. </para>
          <para>I notice that the Minister is frowning. There is no need to frown. That was an election promise made by this Government in 1975. It was made by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> and supported by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> as part of a 7-point plan to deal with the question of unemployment in Australia. It followed from a comment which was made by the then Leader of the Opposition about unemployment being a most unsatisfactory method of&#34; dealing with industrial relations problems and a repudiation by the Liberal Party of the suggestion that unemployment would ever be used as a method of trying to solve both economic and industrial relations problems. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> then went on to promise that the reintroduction of the Regional Employment Development scheme would be part of a 7-point plan to deal with unemployment in Australia. The Minister will probably recall that it was a part of the package which was going to reduce unemployment by 200 000 within 12 months. In the light of problems of that sort I am concerned to find out whether the additional appropriation of $ 1 20,000 is seen in some way as a fulfilment of those election promises or for what other purpose that additional amount is being appropriated. I would also be grateful for any comment the Minister has to make about the Government&#39;s current attitude towards the RED scheme, as it was called. </para>

              <para>-That is so, but after some of the comments that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> made today about James Richardson Pty Limited, I do not suppose that the Committee will be surprised to learn that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> received a letter from the solicitors of James Richardson Pty Limited which was rather critical of the approach that he has taken to this matter. The fact is that James Richardson Pty Limited claims that it has not made under award payments. It claims that it had an accountant go through its books to check on the allegations that were made. The accountant has given that company a clean bill of health on the matter. I have not had a look at those letters that I, as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> received. I think that is broadly what they say, subject to further detailed examination. That being the case, of course, the inspectorate is then left with the task of proving the case against that company. That is where the problem has arisen. As far as I can see the inspectorate is getting no cooperation. The inspectorate&#39;s request to obtain information was met with the answer that the company had asked an independent accountant to examine its books and so on. That is what has led now to this very lengthy investigation by the officers of the inspectorate. </para>

That is why the officers are seeking to get calculators with a view to expediting the task. That letter was written on 5 May. Perhaps the matter has progressed a little further; I do not know. That is my explanation of the problems. I do not know what else can be done. James Richardson Pty Limited is denying any liability. The case has to be proved. I was also rather surprised to hear a suggestion that the Department of Transport should be taking any action against James Richardson Pty Limited and convicting it by refusing to give it a concession before it has in fact been proved to be guilty. </para>

I suppose that the only criticism that can be levelled is one that has been levelled, namely, that there is a long delay but, as I have indicated and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> has recognised, the delay is due to the very great difficulty in going through all these records when the company is simply sitting back and saying: &#39;You prove your case&#39;.

          <para>I turn now to staffing arrangements. The Norgard inquiry was given a very wide brief to look at all aspects of the Commonwealth Employment Service. I understand that it certainly would cover agents as well as permanent staff. The inquiry is at an advanced stage although the Minister has not as yet received a report. Today I have made inquiries of the Minister about the matter. He expects to receive <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norgard</inline> &#39;s report quite soon but he cannot give a specific date. Staff requirements are certainly a matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norgard</inline> has examined. He has already given interim advice to the Government on which the Government acted in increasing the ceilings in the CES by 300, although a large proportion of those appointments are to be in Sydney. I understand that all the youth employment schemes are in fact administered by the CES. It may well be that in the final report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norgard</inline> further matters will be raised which the Government will have to consider. </para>
          <para>As I said earlier in relation to staff ceilings, the Government has always said that where problems are clearly established in a particular department as a result of ceilings the matter will be looked at again. The fact that we have increased already the numbers in the CES by 300 indicates that we are in fact doing what we said we would do in these matters. </para>

            <para>- I want to make 2 further observations. When this matter was first raised by me last spring I did not pluck a figure out of the air. The figure came from a written response by the Department which said that $25,000 was outstanding. I know that in Public Service responses there is generally a conservative answer. The fact that the Department committed itself to a figure of $25,000 was a fair indication to the union and to me that something was wrong. I take it a little bit further. It is unfortunate that relations in this area were not helped because of some internal union conflict. I think the employer was able to play, to a degree anyway, the Victorian Secretary Maher against the New South Wales officers which was not good for unionism, nor was it good for the whole of the industry. It was not as though I plucked this figure out of the air and said $25,000 was owed. This figure was given by the Department. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> said about the delay and the accountants, it becomes almost a James Bond novel because we know 2 different accountants were employed. There have been stories that one of the accountants left because his conscience was such that he felt the law was being broken. I do not know whether that is right, but it is something to look at. The other matter is much more serious. As far as the 78 man weeks are concerned, I think that if the Commonwealth Arbitration Inspectorate had had access instantly to time sheets for the 3 years it could have completed the inquiry, but my information is that time sheets had to be sent from Sydney to Melbourne in dribs and drabs so that the whole thing has been prolonged. </para>
          <para>My final point- and I want this clear in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> mind- is that there is nothing vindictive about whose tender is accepted. I say respectfully that a tender should be held up until the firm is given a clean bill of health because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> would know as an advocate of senators having certain watch-dog responsibilities that in the United States there is much closer supervision by senators on committees over tenders for government contracts. They have to meet minimum industrial labour codes. As a matter of fact, the rural workers of the United States are not strongly organised. I am talking about certain areas in California. The only protection they have is in the codes which the United States Senate polices to ensure that the code on minimum wages is observed. We are not suggesting bonuses or anything like that. We are suggesting that the minimum award rates should apply. I want to see justice done and I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> does too. </para>

              <para>-Of course it is right. You cannot deny it. The fact is that the record shows the last Labor Government took more action against employers for breaches of awards than at any other time in the history of the Inspectorate. What concerns both of us I think, and I suggest should concern the Minister, is that there is the possibility that the Inspectorate will be able to check time books week by week. That is the Inspectorate&#39;s job and that is what it often does. I cannot understand why the ordinary processes of the Inspectorate were not used from the time when the claim was first made by the union and the employees. That is the position I put to you. I cannot understand why the matter has been so complex as to warrant a 78 man weeks investigation. So I am raising what seems to be an important need to strengthen the Inspectorate in respect of the processes which are available to it. I asked this question earlier: Is the delay and procrastination due to a lack of staff? I hope that the Minister in considering the matter further will look at that question. If the circumstances are as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> and I consider them to be, because originally the Department said it considered that people had been underpaid by $25,000, surely when it comes to proper accounting of government money there should be some consideration by the Department in respect of the establishment. To me that seems eminently sensible. </para>

            <para>- I hesitated to rise because I was waiting for the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> to respond to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> but obviously he is not going to respond. My question deals actually with 2 departments. I refer firstly to the Department of Social Security. Although we are not discussing the additional estimates for that Department this matter is interwoven. I refer to the registration of school leavers for the unemployment benefit. It is well known that before a person can qualify for the unemployment benefit he must go to the Commonwealth Employment Service and fill in a registration form. I understand that the Director-General of the Department of Social Security has issued a statement today but as yet it has not been tabled in the Parliament so I am not aware of what it contains. I am concerned about the answer given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> because the Government&#39;s policy, which was announced, prevented school leavers going to CES offices and registering for the unemployment benefit. I would like the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs, who is in charge of the matter before the chamber, to inform me at what time the direction was given to Commonwealth Employment Offices, regional offices and the central offices in the capital cities. On what date were they instructed to advise school leavers that the Department could not accept registration from them for unemployment benefits until after the school leaving period had expired and the students had all gone back to school? That is the first question I want to ask. I may follow it up with another one later, depending on the answer that is given. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other matter that I want to query concerns the Youth Employment Scheme which comes under the jurisdiction of this Department. I am reliably informed that officers of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations have spent a considerable amount of time conducting surveys in country and suburban areas to ascertain the need to put this scheme into operation. We now find that the Government has frozen funds for this scheme as from late April. I want some clarification of that point. A great amount of time and money has been expended in going around and talking to local councils and service clubs to find out what they have been able to do, on a voluntary basis and on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, to try to put this youth scheme into operation. After all the data has been compiled and requests made for certain projects to put this scheme into operation, we find now that the Government has frozen funds. It has created quite an embarrassing situation for a lot of the service clubs. They are very worried, so much so that we find in the <inline font-style="italic">Murray Valley Standard</inline> of 1 9 May the headline &#39; Youth Scheme criticised&#39;. This was because of a debate in a Murray Bridge District Council meeting. The <inline font-style="italic">Murray Valley Standard hid</inline> this to say: </para>

          <para>I agree with him in that respect in view of the fact that the Government got the service clubs to act as its agents on a voluntary basis and, then, when they found work for the youth to be engaged in, we find that there is no money to carry out the schemes.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, Councillor Mason was referring to the regional office in Murray Bridge. For those honourable senators who do not know, the person who was running the agency at $50 a week was none other than Councillor Mason. That, of course, is why he is very critical. But I disagree with him violently in saying that there was no need to open a regional office in Murray Bridge. When the Labor Party was in government I was the person who made strong representations to the then Minister for Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> to open a regional office in Murray Bridge. This office has done a wonderful job for the unemployed people of the district and also for people who want to change their vocation and obtain some guidance on the jobs that are available. When Councillor Mason, who is an estate agent, was running the agency all that one could do was to go in and register for employment. There was no counselling because he would not have had time to give it, even if he was qualified which he is not. </para>
          <para>I dispute his claim that agencies gave a better service. Many years ago agencies in country towns were run, in the main, by the clerk of the local district council. In the town of Murray Bridge, where I live, this function was transferred to Councillor Mason who is now being very critical of the fact that there is a full-time officer and staff there with a suite of offices. The only reason I can think of for why he is criticising the office is that he has lost the $50 a week. The office has been a great benefit to the town. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norgard,</inline> in his inquiry, will not advise the Government that it should close down some of these regional offices and again open district agencies and hand them over to people like Councillor Mason who can give only a very small portion of their time to looking after the welfare of the people who are in need of unemployment benefits. I refer particularly to young school leavers who want some vocational guidance as to the type of job they should enter into in accordance with the educational qualifications that they have. I hope that the Minister has taken note of the couple of questions that I have asked him and that he can give me an answer. </para>

            <para>- The matter I want to raise concerns a question I asked during an Estimates Committees hearing towards the end of April. One of the answers that I was given appears on page 29 of the report of the Estimates Committee F to the Senate. The question that I asked on that occasion concerned the application and payment of an allowance under the Relocation Assistance Scheme. I do not want to go fully into the issue again because it was put forward fully during an adjournment debate in this place about 3 weeks ago. Since that time I have not received any reply from the Department as to how the Scheme should apply, how it is applying and if there will be any correction to it unless, of course, there has been a reply since yesterday. During the Estimates Committee hearing I asked whether a person relocating to take up part-time employment would be eligible for assistance under the Relocation Assistance Scheme. The reply that was given was: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations has been administering the Relocation Assistance Scheme on the basis that persons seeking to move to a new location to take up less than full-time employment have not been eligible. As the Government&#39;s decision is not explicit on the matter the Department is seeking a definite ruling and will inform the senator when the issue has been clarified. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is nearly 4 weeks since I asked this question during the Estimates Committee hearing. It seems to me that there is a fairly clear interpretation of the application of the Relocation Assistance Scheme. To me the Scheme is explicit inasmuch as such people are entitled to payment. It does not need to be full-time employment provided it is work on a permanent basis and the worker is not an itinerant worker or seasonal worker. The case that I raised on the adjournment debate some 3 weeks ago was fully covered. The individual concerned had been unemployed for 5 months, was sharing accommodation with his brother-in-law and was living with his wife and 4 children in one room. He had a permanent job to go to. It was not a part-time job, or a seasonal job, nor was he an itinerant worker. He was told by an officer of one of the regional offices on applying for the benefits available under the Relocation Assistance Scheme that he was not entitled to it. </para>
          <para>The full discussion on this matter concerning the events before, after, and in the meantime appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of that debate. It seems to me now, 4 weeks since this matter was raised before the Estimates Committee, that the </para>
          <para class="block">Department still does not know whether he was entitled to a payment under the Relocation Assistance Scheme. Because the Parliament probably will go into the winter recess after next week, it is possible that we might not get the answer to this question until well into the Budget session. I would like to know how many other unemployed persons who are genuinely seeking employment and who have obtained employment do not have the finance to transport their families and belongings to the location of that employment? The Assistant Director of the Commonwealth Employment Service could not advise me at the time I raised the matter with him some 3 or 4 weeks ago. The officer who told the unemployed person that he was not entitled to the assistance told me that the reason the unemployed person was not paid was that he did not have a definite job to go to. The officer told the unemployed person one story and he told me another. When I challenged him and said that he had already told conflicting stories regarding why the unemployed person was not entitled to any relocation assistance, he accepted that he had informed the unemployed person that he would not be paid because he was not going to full time employment. </para>
          <para>The conditions of the relocation assistance scheme do not specify that employment has to be full time. As I mentioned in the debate, the employee had a permanent job to go to which would give him 3 or 4 days work a week. Because the job did not entail working 5 days a week he was deprived of getting the assistance that would have enabled him to start the job. As a result of that mistake as I think it was by officers of the Department the man was left on unemployment benefits for a further 8 weeks. As a family man with 4 children he was being paid $107 a week unemployment benefits. It would have cost the Department only $ 1 84.50 to transport him and his family and belongings to the place of permanent employment. I hope that I can get an answer to this matter before Parliament rises probably next Friday for the winter recess. If it is to be left in limbo other people in similar circumstances will not know their entitlements. </para>
          <para>I do not think it is good enough. The Government introduced the relocation scheme some time in November 1976, I think, and seven or eight months afterwards it still does not know how to apply the scheme. In this case the Government pretends to be giving assistance and trying to help unemployed people find employment in other areas, but when an application is received the Government makes up an excuse and denies the person the right to assistance. I think this should have been sorted out when the scheme was introduced late last year. We should not have to wait seven or eight months. The matter has been raised on two or three occasions and we still do not have a decision. It is for those reasons that I raise these matters today in the hope that I will get this information before Friday of next week. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but it is an important factor in answering the honourable senator&#39;s question. In point of fact the Commonwealth Employment Service seeks to assist people to obtain employment. It was just as prepared and anxious to obtain work for school leavers as for anybody else. No instructions at all were given not to accept registration for employment. It would not be in any way within its charter to take a line of that kind. I well remember at the end of the Budget session when the question of payment of the unemployment benefit to school leavers was a live issue <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> I think- I am not quite sure- asked me specifically whether a school leaver who sought to register for employment could do so. The answer I gave is the best answer I have ever given. It was yes, and nothing else. That is and always has been the position. </para>

              <para>- It was only Victoria. The scheme has proved to be highly successful. There have already been 116 approvals. Some 14 000 young people have been provided with some worthwhile activity under the scheme. The fact of the matter is that money in a sense has not been frozen for the scheme. The projects that have been approved are continuing and the funds are available for them. In this financial year no further funds are available for new schemes. The question of the funding of new schemes is a question for the next Budget and will be of course part of the Budget discussions. </para>

          <para>The matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron is fully set out at page 29 of the Estimates Committee&#39;s report. Unfortunately there is yet no decision on this question. It will be referred to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street).</inline> It is a matter of policy whether the relocation assistance scheme was intended to apply to people other than those obtaining full time employment. I will draw to the attention of the Minister&#39;s Department the fact that the honourable senator has pressed strongly for a decision to be given by the end of next week. I agree that the earlier a decision can be made the better. I should point out that the 236 people who already have been assisted under the relocation assistance scheme have been clearly eligible as they were seeking assistance for relocation for full time work. The case raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron is the only one that has been raised in relation to part time work. It is an important matter which has to be resolved. I will draw the Minister&#39;s attention to the concern that has been expressed in the Committee on the matter. </para>
          <para>Finally I will deal with the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> I know that he did not ask me to respond in detail to the points he made. He referred to the Government&#39;s proposal for an Industrial Relations Bureau which is the subject of debate in another place today. He seemed to suggest that the legislation was aimed at employees only. The fact of the matter is that the Industrial Relations Bureau has been and always was designed to provide for the observance of industrial laws by employers and employees. It is now, under the new arrangements which have come about as the result of discussions between the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and leaders of trade unions, to take over the powers, no more or no less of the Commonwealth Arbitration Inspectorate. Those powers have always been available in relation to breaches of awards whether by employers or employees. </para>

          <para>Accordingly he makes application for social security benefits. I believe that the Director-General of the Department of Social Security decides by a number of criteria whether unemployment benefits will be paid. One is the work criteria, whether the applicant has taken reasonable steps to obtain employment. The only instrumentality which has a record of what an applicant has done to find employment is the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. Does it decide whether the applicant has taken reasonable steps to find employment, or does it report to the Department of Social Security? If it reports to the Department of Social Security, does it state that in its opinion the applicant has taken reasonable steps to find employment? </para>

            <para>- I wish to follow up the Minister&#39;s answer to me that no instructions were given to officers of his Department to refuse any person the right to register for employment. I find that statement very strange. We have been arguing about this matter for some weeks now. How could any person qualify for unemployment benefit if he was not allowed to register for employment? How could a person prove that he was unemployed? The Minister said that there were no instructions. We know that many school leavers were told that they could not register for employment, to qualify for unemployment benefit, until after the school vacation. We had to tell people who came to our office to insist on registering. Some were registered; some were not. How could school leavers prove that they wanted to register? Because of the publicity given to the fact that no employment benefit would be paid if they could not find a job, some did not register. This is the question which I would like answered. </para>

          <para class="block">Murray Bridge and addressed by the local member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giles,</inline> who called on the local service clubs to help the Government to find projects on which the youth could be employed. He said that the Government would fund the projects. Officers from the Department were sent to this town and to other towns to talk to the service clubs, to find out the projects which the Department could fund. When the organisations went to the trouble of getting all the data, compiling it and giving it to the Department, there was insufficient money. When the Government has not the money, it cannot approve the projects. </para>
          <para>Can the Minister give any undertaking that the applications now in the hands of the Department that cannot be proceeded with because of the lack of funds will be given priority if and when money is available? We know that the funds are exhausted. The Minister said that there can be no funds until the Budget. The applicants might find themselves in the same situation as that in which many elderly citizens&#39; organisations found themselves. I refer to one case which I raised in this Parliament. The organisation had been funded for architects&#39; fees to build an elderly citizens&#39; home. Then the organisation could not go on with it because the Government reneged. It altered its program from a yearly program to a 3- yearly program. Will the same situation apply to the youth employment scheme? These are the questions that service clubs and local government bodies want answered. They have used a lot of their time, particularly local councils, and the time of paid employees. Ratepayers&#39; money has been used to get all the data required by the Department to try to overcome unemployment among the youth. The fact that the Government contemplated that scheme is an admission of a grave problem in relation to youth unemployment in Australia. </para>

As to the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> I do not know that I can add to what I have said already.

The Government cannot be responsible for wrong advice that people give. Before the end of the Budget session I answered perfectly clearly a question on the matter. The other matter with which he persists is the question of the community youth support scheme. In view of the way in which he has put the matter, I make it quite clear that funds for approved schemes have not run out and are not frozen. Those schemes are continuing. The question of funding new schemes will be a matter for the forthcoming Budget. These schemes are determined on their merits. I cannot give any further undertakings. </para>

            <para>- I want to correct one thing said by way of interjection to the Minister a few moments ago. It relates to a question which I asked a few days ago about 20 schemes which, according to a newspaper article, are awaiting funding. I said by way of interjection that all of them were in Victoria. I do not think that is right. The matter goes further than that. I want to correct that statement because I think that 20 new schemes are proposed. I hope money will be made available quickly for these schemes because they are the result of voluntary efforts by other people. The fact that they may not start does not mean that action cannot be taken. We will not be able to spend money before the beginning of the next financial year. I hope they will be got under way quickly because they are the result of excellent voluntary efforts by organisations. </para>

            <para>- I want to clear up a misunderstanding on the part of the Minister about my remarks. I hope I did not say that I told people that they were unable to register and advised them not to register. I think the Minister said that I advised them not to register. When school leavers spoke to me I advised them to register. On Tuesday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> said that it was government policy that unemployment benefit would not be paid to school leavers. The question which I posed to the Minister was this: How could they qualify for unemployment benefit if they did not register in the first place? There was a clear statement by the Minister for Social Security that they would not be paid. Many school leavers did not endeavour to register because of government policy. Now we have the decision of the High Court. I hope the Minister will table today the statement which has been put out by the Director-General of the Department of Social Security on his interpretation of the High Court judgment. Many children would not have endeavoured to register because of announced government policy. Until we read the statement we do not know the outcome for those who were successful in registering. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister said that no instructions were given to his officers to refuse registration to any person, irrespective of age. That is something which I will have to pursue further because I was under impression that those instructions were given. I was under the impression that school leavers were told that they could not register and it was useless their going into the offices. Departmental officers have told me that. I will not name them, but I will check the matter out further. If officers told people that, I am sure they did not do it off their own bat. They must have had a direction from some person of higher authority. This matter is of great concern to me. </para>
          <para>The other answer the Minister gave was that the youth employment schemes going ahead had been authorised. I would like to know the cut-off point for authorisation. I want to ascertain whether officers of the Department were still interviewing organisations such as I have mentionedlocal councils and service clubs- seeking particulars for applications for funding, after the cut-off point for authorisation. I am of a different opinion from the Minister because of what I have been told by some people in the Department. Perhaps the Minister can tell me when the cut-off was actually notified to the officers of the Department, particularly those in South Australia. That is a crucial point to me. </para>

            <para>- I cannot provide any further information to the Committee about the community youth scheme. The fact that there may have been a cut-off of funds for new projects does not mean that it is not worth people&#39;s while looking at new projects. New projects may well be approved if further funds can be made available for them. The mere fact that there are no funds at the moment for new projects is no reason why new projects should not be considered. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline>keeps raising the question of school leavers registering for unemployment benefits. I think he devalues Australian youth very greatly by the implication of his remarks. He asks how they could get unemployment benefit if they did not register. Of course they could not unless they registered, passed the work test and could not get employment. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and the Committee how serious school leavers are about getting employment if they did not register simply because they could not get unemployment benefit. I would have thought that those who genuinely wanted employment would have registered. </para>

              <para>-I did not say that at all. I asked how they could qualify to receive unemployment benefit when they could not obtain a job if first they were not allowed to register for employment. That is the whole crux of the argument I have been putting forward. In many cases they were not allowed to register. This is the whole crux of the argument that has been going on in this Parliament for many weeks past. It is no good the Minister trying to blame me for misrepresenting the youth of the country or trying to put a wrong interpretation on the desires of the youth of this country by saying that they do not want a job and that all they want to do is register so that they can get the unemployment benefit. Of course the kids want to work. The Government admits that there is a grave crisis in youth unemployment. Otherwise it would not have set up these schemes about which I have been asking the Minister. </para>

          <para>When the Minister says that so many projects have been approved and so many have not been approved but might be approved, it is an admission by the Government that there is a crisis in youth unemployment. Of course most of the kids want a job. There might be some young people who do not want to work, but there are plenty of others who do not want to work. I can name many in the blue blood area or the silk department who have never done a day&#39;s work in their life. Nobody criticises those people. All the Government wants to criticise is the legitimate unemployed youth of the country, who of course want a job. The Minister cannot blame the majority for the deeds of the minority. I hope that I have put the record straight. </para>

            <para>- I want to get one point straight about the Brisbane area. I take a great objection to the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> implying that young people leaving school did not register for unemployment benefit because they showed no real interest. They were discouraged from registering. In many cases that came to my notice in the early weeks they were turned away from the counters at the Commonwealth Employment Service offices. They were told that they could not register. They were told that it was of no use for them to register. Many hundreds of young people were misled in this way. Now they will be disadvantaged in making any approach for some compensation for non-payment of unemployment benefit during the school vacation. I make a plea to the Minister. There was no lack of initiative on the part of the youngsters. They were discouraged by statements being made in this place. They were being discouraged by officers at the counters of the various Commonwealth Employment Service offices. So please let there be no slur on the youngsters. They were entitled to register. They were being given wrong information. They were declared not to be school leavers. They were to be judged not to be school leavers until the end of the vacation period. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I find this whole exercise quite immoral. The Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> for whom we have a great respect, is in a very difficult situation because the Government has not had the guts to advise the Department of Social Security that it was wrong in the first place and that it should correct the wrong. I would say that the Minister has revealed in her answers that she has been going against her better judgment. It is my impression that it has been quite unfair for her to be forced into the situation in which she finds herself. Why does the Government not admit that it was wrong, and why is it not prepared to pay out the $5m or $6m that it should be paying out to these people and their families? </para>

            <para>- I have not been following this debate because I have been at a committee meeting, but when I came into the chamber and heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> I felt duty bound to make some statement on the matters they raised. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges&#39;</inline> remarks about what happened in Brisbane in the early pan of this year, in particular in January. There was a great deal of confusion amongst the young people at the time about whether they could register. This happened not only in Brisbane but in the provincial cities I visited in January. Young people came to my office complaining that they had been to an office of the Commonwealth Employment Service in Brisbane and had been allowed to register for employment but had not been allowed to fill in a form to claim unemployment benefit. At that stage there was confusion about whether the case to be heard by the High Court would be successful or not. Young people were not allowed to fill out a form to claim for unemployment benefit before the school vacation ended. A lot of them contended that they should be allowed the opportunity to fill out a claim for unemployment benefit. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Of course, normally claims for unemployment benefit are filled out at the offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service, which acts as an agent for the Department of Social Security. The forms are sent to the Department. But these young people were not even provided with a form. They were not allowed to fill out a form at the office of the Commonwealth Employment Service. I believe that this was not the policy of the Government but there was confusion within the offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service. When I insisted through the relevant person in Brisbane that they be allowed to fill out a form and they went back they were given a form to fill out to claim the unemployment benefit. I presume the forms were then forwarded to the Department of Social Security. </para>
          <para>I raise this matter because it is important to understand that whilst there may have been a policy directive or a policy that was understood, that youngsters could fill out forms and that a decision would be made subsequently with regard to their unemployment benefit entitlement, some people within the Department were not getting that message or were quite confused about it. At this stage I raise another matter which I have not raised before because I have had it resolved quite successfully. I presume that the matter will not occur again. It gives an illustration of how mistakes can be made by departmental officersmistakes which probably never come to the Minister&#39;s attention- which disadvantage people who are seeking benefits. </para>

              <para>-I hope that it will not happen again. However, I think it is important to point out that these things have happened. My attention was drawn to the case of a man who had been attending an office of the Commonwealth Employment Service in the near Brisbane area. He was a person for whom it was difficult to find employment- we know that there are many such people- but he was genuinely looking for work.  His  unemployment benefit was terminated. When we tried to find out why it had been terminated, it transpired that the reason was that he had been removed from the register of the Commonwealth Employment Service of those who were unemployed. He had been taken off the list of those unemployed and the Commonwealth Employment Service just refused to register him any longer. That situation was not acceptable, and certainly the Queensland State Director in Brisbane said that it was not acceptable. The man was put back on the register. If any decision is to be made as to whether such a person should continue to receive the unemployment benefit it should be done through the Department of Social Security and not the Commonwealth Employment Service. </para>

            <para>- I wish to draw the attention of the Committee to division 166.2.03, Consultants&#39; fees, $11,000. That item raises a unique point of principle and it is illustrated by the actual transaction for which the appropriation provides. I believe it gives a wrong direction to the whole thrust of Commonwealth employment. It concerns the situation in which the First Parliamentary Counsel, who is a statutory officer, resigned prematurely and then was party to a contract for re-engagement as a consultant for 3 years, such contract terminable on a month&#39;s notice, with a right of private practice, and an expectation of a 4-day working week. He was receiving a salary of approximately $37,000 or $39,000, plus $2,000 in allowances. Subject to some adjustment, the remuneration for the consultancy, allowing for a 15 per cent loading, was about $35,000. That can be compared with the previous remuneration of $39,000. I take those figures from an answer provided on page 1 97 of the transcript of evidence given before Estimates Committee F. That figure, together with the superannuation payment, would give the officer a very much enhanced total emolument, by reason of retirement, of accrual of superannuation and continuance of employment with the Commonwealth. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Under the Parliamentary Counsel Act it is specifically provided that no re-engagement of the Parliamentary Counsel, First or Second, shall be undertaken which will extend his office beyond the date on which he attains 65 years of age. How that comes into the transaction, I do not quite know, but I point it out because involved in this case is the payment of accrued superannuation on retirement as well as re-engagement on an individual contract. This leads to all sorts of loopholes, I suggest, in relation to the ordinary security of engagement, performance and promotion within the Public Service. This is an illustration of advantage accruing to an individual by reason of the generous superannuation provisions applicable on premature retirement and when the retiree is then engaged by individual contract to the detriment, I submit, of the Public Service. </para>
          <para>I believe it is a matter to which we should call attention because of its anomalous situation. I believe that it is so anomalous that in more ample circumstances I would query the appropriateness of its inclusion in a Bill which is not amendable and the purpose of which is to provide finances for ordinary annual services. I believe it is so unique a provision, although it pertains to current service by way of consultancy- it provides an office for a retired servant- that I doubt whether it is appropriately included in those appropriations which pertain to ordinary annual services. I wish to quote just one very brief passage from the Fifth Edition of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Odgers&#39;</inline><inline font-style="italic">Australian Senate Practice.</inline> On page 375 of his book <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Odgers</inline> quotes the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Isaac</inline> Isaacs in giving an illustration of what is not an ordinary annual service in the Federation debates. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Isaacs</inline> later became Chief Justice Isaacs and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Supposing that some compensation were being paid to a discharged public servant. That would not come within the ordinary annual services. ... It would not be a payment for services rendered in the future, but for services in the past. We all know that in connection with the ordinary annual Appropriation Bills questions arise that make it very difficult to say what is and what is not an ordinary annual service. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The appropriation under this item is not exactly compensation for past service. By reason of the superannuation element of that part of the appropriation which provides for payment for past service, and by reason of the compensation for that established superannuation, an individual contract for consultancy could put into the whole structure a thrust whereby service has to be guaranteed for everybody who is willing to be recruited to it and work according to the remuneration provided, with the ultimate accrual of superannuation. I think that this is a remarkable situation where the processes, by reason of insight, have been so manipulated that private advantage has accrued and public detriment has resulted in the sense that I have mentioned. I bring it to the attention of the Committee, as I did to the Estimates Committee, for an exchange of views. </para>

            <para>- I previously drew the attention of honourable senators to the report from Estimates Committee F in which certain comments were made. For purposes of continuity and simplicity it may be as well if I refer again to those comments which were made in the report to the Senate a few days ago. The Committee said: </para>

          <para class="block">That is the one to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has referred-   . . on which the Committee sought additional information, members were informed that the former First Parliamentary Counsel after retiring before the age of 65 years had been re-engaged under a written agreement for a period of 3 years from 8 February 1977 as a consultant to assist in the drafting of the legislative program at a daily remuneration of $134.96 for each day worked based on a Level 4, Second Division salary in the Commonwealth Public Service, plus a loading of 1 5 per cent in lieu of recreation leave, sick leave and public holidays. Approval for the re-engagement of the former First Parliamentary Counsel as a consultant had been obtained from the Public Service Board and the Treasurer. </para>
          <para class="block">I pause there to point out that some correspondence was provided to the Committee, which is attached as an annexure, both about this matter and about the other matter that was raised by the Committee and that has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> before the Estimates Committee and here. That relates to certain payments to judges. We will deal with that a little later. The report goes on to say: </para>

            <para>As a general principle, the Committee considers that a public servant who has retired of his own volition before reaching the compulsory retiring age of 65 years and thereby became entitled to superannuation should not be engaged as a consultant at a fee which taken together with the superannuation entitlement provides a higher net income for similar work to that which would have been carried out had the public servant remained in the Public Service until reaching the normal retiring age of 65 years. Members of the Committee fear that such a practice could, if not controlled, become the subject of widespread abuse and be used as a device to obtain an income advantage and also to overcome the restriction imposed on departmental staff ceilings by the Government. The Committee does not suggest that the present case falls into either of those categories but merely demonstrates the possibilities of abuse. </para>
            <para>Should the necessity arise for such a consultant to be engaged by a department the Committee firmly believes that any agreement entered into ought not provide a loading for recreational leave, sick leave and public holidays. The consultant should only be remunerated for the task for which he was engaged. </para>

            <para>- There was very lengthy discussion in the Estimates Committee on this matter and lengthy explanations were given by departmental officers at the Committee, all of which appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the proceedings of the Committee. The only matter that has occurred since, on which I think I need comment, is the report of Estimates Committee F which devoted a great deal of attention to this item. I think that about half the report is devoted to it. I simply inform the Committee that the comments of Estimates Committee F in relation to this matter have been given serious consideration, as they deserve and as any committee report deserves, by me in the first place, by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> whom I represent, and by officers of his Department with whom I have discussed the matter. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I say at the outset that the Government would have been very sorry to have lost entirely the services of such a distinguished public servant as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Comans,</inline> the former First Parliamentary Counsel. Honourable senators who are interested might like to have a look at the proceedings in another place- reported at page 105 and succeeding pages of the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 16 February 1977- when the Attorney-General reported to the House of Representatives the retirement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Comans.</inline> Very high tributes were paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Comans.</inline> I do not think that anybody is reflecting on him in any way. Although my close association with him after I joined the Government was short I would certainly like to be associated with those tributes. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Comans</inline> wished to retire, the Attorney-General was most anxious to retain as much of his valuable assistance as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Comans</inline> was determined to retire. He was fully entitled to retire. This is the next point that should be made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred to premature retirement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was obviously thinking of retirement at 65. Whether that is a common age for retirement or not I do not know, but a public servant is entitled to retire, and has rights under superannuation, from the age of 60. Therefore it is not correct to say that there was any premature retirement. He was perfectly entitled to retire. He had all his rights to retire. He had them under Acts which have been the subject of a great deal of discussion and debate in this Parliament in recent years. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Comans</inline> retired, as when anybody else retireseven when we retire on the somewhat lesser pensions than perhaps senior public servants receive- he had certain rights and was entitled to earn income in other ways. </para>

              <para>- That is another matter and that is the honourable senator&#39;s opinion. The fact of the matter is that when people retire they have their rights and they may earn other income. The question raised here- it is a very narrow question indeed- is whether a public servant who retires should be re-engaged as a consultant doing the same work as he was doing when he was in his permanent position. I find this a difficult objection to understand. I read very closely the views expressed by the Estimates Committee and the arguments that have been advanced. I note that the Estimates Committee in its report mentioned retiring before the age of 65 years. It seems to be implied that if a person retired at the age of 65 years the Committee would not object to his being re-engaged as a consultant. I do not know whether that is what is intended. </para>

            <para>Prior to the recent appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr C.</inline> K. Comans, Q.C., as a Consultant to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, there have been a number of recent examples of the employment of retired former top Public Servants as Consultants and the Operations Division of the Public Service Board has responsibility for the examining of proposals of this nature. The Board applies such tests as the needs evidenced in the particular case for the work to be done and the scarcity of the skills provided by the former officer under consideration for the consultancy. </para>
            <para>Some recent examples of Consultants include <inline font-weight="bold">Mr F.</inline> Grey, formerly Public Service Inspector, Sydney, as the initial Commissioner of the Northern Territory Public Service; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr B.</inline> Fleming, formerly of the Treasury, for a review of financial institutions with which the Commonwealth is involved in loan activities; a former officer of the Department of National Resources was employed on the preparation of a revised study of overseas accounting directions; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> Collings, formerly a Commissioner of the Public Service Board, gave short term assistance to the Bland Committee and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland himself, as a former Permanent Head, was retained as a Consultant to review the operations of the Public Service generally. </para>
            <para>It is apparent that whilst there are not a large number of these types of cases, the consultancy arrangements made in respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Comans</inline> were not an isolated instance of the employment of a former senior Public Servant as a Consultant. </para>

              <para>- The Committee expresses concern that this could lead to widespread abuse and be used as a device to obtain income advantage and also to overcome the restriction imposed upon departmental staff ceilings by the Government. The Committee does not suggest the present case falls into either of those categories. There are some other matters which I shall mention later. As far as the suggested abuses are concerned, I am not sure whether it would be an abuse by the Government or by the officer concerned. </para>

              <para>-I might just finish what I was saying. As far as the Government is concerned, the strictest possible rules are applied in the engagement of consultants. If there is concern that consultants may be used to overcome staff restrictions, I think that would not be possible because under the rules applying to the engagement of consultants Public Service Board approval and, in certain cases, the approval of the Treasurer has to be obtained. I seek leave to table and to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a copy of the rules for the engagement of consultants. </para>

          <para>The Committee also raised the matter of the fee that is paid to consultants. It is said that the fee should not provide a loading for recreation leave, sick leave and public holidays and that the consultant should be remunerated only for the task for which he was engaged. The fee <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Comans</inline> is being paid is only for the task for which he was engaged. The only question is how much that fee should be. The fee of $134.96 a day that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Comans</inline> is being paid was arrived at in the manner explained to the Committee and it did have these loadings added to it. I suggest to the Committee that the proper way of looking at this issue is to ask not so much how the fee was arrived at but whether it is a fair fee for the work that is being done. A number of lawyers are present in the Committee this afternoon. Surely none of them would challenge the payment of $134.96 a day as being an improper fee for a man of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Comans</inline> &#39; eminence as a lawyer and in his special field as a Queen&#39;s Counsel. I have some details of fees being charged by counsel at present. The current Supreme Court scale in New South Wales provides for a fee on brief to senior counsel of $375 to $525 a day and refreshers of $250 to $350 a day. That is just for the ordinary run of the mill counsel fees. </para>

            <para>-I have been muttering by way of interjection so I had better make my interjections aloud. Briefly, the abuses that have been creeping into the system are as I shall indicate. We pay substantial pensions by way of superannuation to public servants and members of the Defence Force. They make a decision to retire from the Defence Force or from the Public Service and go onto superannuation. No one is arguing about their right to do that. However, it becomes questionable and undesirable when members who have resigned on full pensions then seek and obtain employment in government agencies and government corporations at substantial remuneration. Within this Parliament we possibly have people who are on full defence pensions and who are also engaged either as research assistants or secretaries to committees and receive substantial salaries. My point is that if they are going to come back into government service either directly or indirectly the pension which they then receive as a result of their government employment should be reduced to prevent the abuses that are now starting to creep in. Not only in this particular case should this question be raised. The matter, having been raised, ought to be taken further. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We ought to be now looking at the situation where people retire early according to their entitlement, receive substantial government pensions and then add to this government pension by employment within the government itself or a government agency. What they do in private enterprise is their own business. If they come back into the government there should be some sort of limitation, as there was in the past, as I recall. If a person receiving a government pension came back into government service his pension was reduced to 50 per cent. Because of the apparent abuse of the system it may be necessary for the Government to reconsider and go back to the old formula. That is all I am saying. There seem to be people now on a pension of some $15,000 or $16,000 a year coming back into government employment, either directly or indirectly, and receiving another $16,000 or $ 1 7,000 a year. They are in a far better economic position if they retire early and take advantage of the situation. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACK (Victoria) (3.57)- I intrude into the debate merely to make an observation in the context of the argument advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> when he referred to members of the defence forces. Members of the defence forces are not in the same situation as the average run of government employee. They are in a special category. Let me give the Committee an illustration to make the matter clear. I am not referring in any way to any person who is employed or attached to a parliamentary committee. A naval officer, for example, who is fixed in the promotion zone at the rank of a lieutenant-commander, which has an age relationship in peace time, has the option of either being forcibly retired at the age of 45 or retiring voluntarily at the age of 41 or 42, realising that he is embedded in a promotion zone and he cannot go any further as the result of confidential reports on him which he has signed. </para>
          <para>He opts at that age, when he still has an earning capacity, to take the benefits that accrue to him from the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Fund and then seek to pursue further an incomeearning career. If at that stage he happens, for reasons that are proper to the Parliament, to be employed, for example, in the House of Representatives secretariat in a certain area, that is not analogous to the problem we are discussing at the moment. I merely rise at this juncture to make clear to the Committee that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges&#39;</inline> argument is not valid in the context of defence force members who retire at a certain age. </para>

              <para>-But they know what is going to happen. Perhaps they are in the highest zone of promotion and they cannot go any further. Constant confidential reports are made on these officers and no confidential report, as I recollect, is made on a defence officer unless the officer has seen the report and has signed it. He knows quite clearly, probably, at the age of 41 that he is embedded in a promotion zone above which he cannot rise. This is quite appropriate. It enables him to go out into the civil field and begin to apply such energies and talents as he possesses to augment his pension rights. I do not think that the analogy is a fair one in this context. </para>

Somebody in receipt of an income of-to use an easy figure- $20,000 a year as a senior public servant- not so senior these days at that rate-could at the age of 60 opt to resign from the Public Service; be entitled to superannuation which, we will say, is a minimum of $10,000 a year; be re-engaged as a consultant to do the same work for the remaining 5 years for which he would normally have worked; and be in receipt of a total income of about $30,000 for doing the work for which, if he had stayed in the Public Service, he would have been paid $20,000 a year. That is the point which I am endeavouring to explain to the Minister for his benefit. The point was misunderstood by him. If the Minister&#39;s attention has been distracted, I will restate it. </para>

              <para>- I was trying to explain the importance of the point which the Minister appeared not to understand -retirement before the compulsory retiring age of 65. Someone can be financially much better off by retiring early and going back into the same job. If they go back after they have reached 65 years of age, we are not worried about that. We are not worried about somebody who retires before 60 years of age and is therefore not entitled to the superannuation entitlements which become available during his optional period from 60 to 65 years of age. That is why it was important to make reference to somebody who retires before reaching the compulsory retiring age of 65, becomes entitled to superannuation, and is then reengaged at a fee equivalent to the income he would have received had he stayed on the job, over and above which he is receiving superannuation as a result of his having elected to retire. That was the point that was being made. I think it is both clear and valid. I would have hoped that we might have obtained a response from the Minister indicating that it has been taken up with the Public Service Board. </para>

            <para>- I should like to say something on this matter. Although I do not agree with some of the remarks that have been made, certainly I agree with the latter remarks that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has made. It is important that the point is raised. It is important that it be taken into account when re-engaging people as consultants. I do disagree with some of the things that have been said today about this. In the first place I deal with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has said. He apparently would consider it suitable if someone retired early and was re-engaged in private enterprise, that it could use the services of such a person. Of course, that person might be earning more than he was before he retired, having retired as he was entitled to do, and receiving the income in retirement that he is entitled to receive. Apparently that is all right for private enterprise but it is no good for a government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In my opinion, that is not a sound argument. In fact, if a government desires to re-engage as consultants people who have retired, as they are entitled to do, then it ought to do so. I cite the example to which the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> referred today. The examination which a committee of this Parliament carried out in regard to national compensation benefitted greatly from the services of someone who was engaged as a consultant. As has been pointed out, consultants are appointed at fees which very often are much less than would have been paid to someone who went to the Bar and received high fees to which senior counsel are entitled. </para>
          <para>We could also take the example of retired judges. Both here and in the States they are reengaged to carry out inquiries and other work or to take such employment as with the Press Council. I have examples in mind. There is no reason why their services should not be used. There is no reason why if the result of that is that their incomes are higher in that period of retirement than it was before they retired, this should be regarded as in any way undesirable. They are entitled to their payment by way of superannuation. If they choose to earn more and to continue to work, they are entitled to do that. Whilst I am in disagreement with the Estimates Committee on this matter, I am not saying that other points raised by the Committee are not of considerable substance. I believe that so far as this matter is concerned we have had the argument. We have decided that people can retire from the Public Service between the ages of 60 and 65 years. That has been long since decided. In recent years we have debated the terms under which they can retire. I believe that where senior public servants are able to come back and act in consultancy positions, part time or full time, and earn additional fees, the most that can be saidand this is what the Committee does say- is that there may be the possibilities of abuse, but I do not believe they are high. I believe that if in fact the Public Service Board and the Government are concerned and are aware of this fact, the probabilities are not great at all. They are just possibilities of some abuse because somebody does this work just to earn extra money. </para>
          <para>Taking in view the type of people who are likely to come back to the Service as consultants, I think abuse is unlikely. I think there is every reason the Commonwealth Government should be able to gain the benefit of the knowledge of these public servants who have retired and should have them working in the same area as they worked in before they retired. Why should they just come back to work in some other area in which they are not specialists and in which they are of not much advantage to the Government? For this reason I do not agree with the basic point which the Committee makes on this aspect. I believe there is no more than a mere possibility of abuse. At the same time I think it is desirable that the matter should be well in the Government&#39;s mind and the Board&#39;s mind so that the possibility does not ever become a probability. </para>

            <para>- I would like to turn briefly to another matter and to add my remarks to those that are contained in the report of the Committee on division 1 70. 1 and division 172.1. Division 170 relates to salaries and payments in the nature of salary in lieu of long leave and unremunerated periods of service as Acting Chief Justice. This refers to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> McTiernan on his retirement from the Bench. Division 172 relates to a similar payment to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Spicer of $40,500 on his retirement from the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The Committee has made some remarks on this but I would like to add a few of my own. When the matter came before the Committee I was not at first particularly disturbed by it because I had always assumed that judges whose daily task is the interpretation of the most abstruse niceties of laws purporting to confer rights and privileges on others would have exercised the utmost punctilio in ensuring that any rights or privileges enjoyed by members of that same court would have a firm statutory base. For that reason I did not think at first that any questions should be asked about it, but to his great credit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> made no such assumptions and it was due to his probing that the fact was elicited that the payment of these sums in relation to the High Court had no statutory basis other than their inclusion in an Appropriation Bill; and in relation to other Federal judges the only basis for payment was a decision made by Federal Cabinet in 1 967 which I would suggest is not a sufficient basis for such a payment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would like to make it clear at the outset that I am not attacking the proposition that judges who work at the tempo and with the application of High Court judges are not entitled to such a benefit. Any man who has practised law knows that High Court judges earn their keep. Not only do they have to deal with the most difficult matters and a great work load, but they are also compelledand this is not the case with the judges of State courts- to move from city to city for the convenience largely of the practitioners in the various cities. I do not for one moment suggest that they are not entitled at the end of their period of service on the Bench to the sort of benefit that they have been getting. But I was astonished and, as I say, it was due to the assiduous probing of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that this matter was elicited, to find that there is no statutory basis for such payments. It has just grown up as a custom and at the end of their service or when a judge dies in service it has become the custom to make such payments to them or to the widow. </para>
          <para>Another matter disturbed members of the Committee in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> McTiernan, and that was the amount that was paid to him- a neat $50,000. On examination of the various officials who were acquainted with the facts it emerged that the way the sum of $50,000 was computed was to allow a yearly salary of $47,500 and to add to that an amount to compensate <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> McTiernan for the periods in which he acted as Chief Justice in the absence of the Chief Justice himself. There was no basis for that payment either. The correct amount, for the periods during which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> had acted in that position, came to something like $4,782. So the correct amount on those computations should have been a couple of thousand dollars more than he was actually paid, leading to, I think, a strongly based suspicion that the reason he was given $50,000 was just to make it a nice round sum. Justification was later found in the form of these periods when he had acted in a higher position. Although I am not suggesting there is anything improper in it and I am not suggesting that a puisne judge who acts as Chief Justice is not entitled to some compensation for the added responsibility involved, it was sloppy and a careless way of going about such a task. </para>
          <para>Once again the Committee was of the view that if such payments are to be made, both for long service leave and for acting in a higher position, they should have a firm statutory basis and not be left merely to the discretion of the judges themselves, no matter how worthy they may be of such remuneration. I would like an assurance from the Minister in charge of this matter that the recommendation of the Committee will be seriously considered by the Government and that the matter will be put on a proper basis for the future. </para>

            <para>-We are dealing with an additional appropriation of $50,000 for payment to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> McTiernan. It is expressed in the particulars of proposed additional expenditure as &#39;payments in lieu of long leave and unremunerated periods of service as Acting Chief Justice&#39;. We are dealing also with the additional appropriation of $40,500 shown in the particulars as &#39;Chief Judge- Payment in lieu of long leave&#39;. I take the view that it is cardinal to the principle of the independence of the judges that their emoluments are stated in statute passed through the Parliament and that they are paid not one cent more nor one cent less than their statutory entitlement. In no other way can we insist or guarantee that the judges will be independent of the executive neither upon their appointment, during their service nor on their termination of service. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is not proper for any Executive to pay one cent more or to seek to deny them one cent of their statutory emolument. For instance, if you are going to have differences between the standing of people appropriate for appointment, are you then going to offer a bonus to a gentleman who will take his seat on the court? Are you going to make a favourable trip available or some payment for leave not provided by law after the conclusion of an arduous case; or on retirement whether the discussions begin before or after the decision is made as to the amount? What Executive has the right, the temerity to offer a judge anything other than his statutory entitlement? </para>
          <para>I refer to the former High Court Judge, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> McTiernan. At the time of his retirement his salary was $47,500 a year, plus a statutory allowance. On retirement the Judges Pension Act provided that he immediately had accruing to him a pension at the rate of, I think, 60 per cent of that salary. Had long service leave been taken salary would have accrued during that year and been taxed at the rate of $47,500. Had it not been taken and some provision for deferral been applied between the termination of salary and the commencement of pension, there would have been a period of said long service leave taxed at the appropriate level of remuneration. Long service leave is based solely upon a Cabinet decision, which has been referred to from time to time but which has no force in law at all. As a result of that Cabinet decision long service leave is to be taken every 10 years. If not taken, at retirement or death it will be recompensated in one year&#39;s salary. There is no statutory entitlement to it. The indirect effect of deferring the leave is that one becomes entitled to a capital sum- I have invited honourable senators to correct me- taxed only to the extent of 5 per cent. That is taxed at the same time as the taxpayer is paying either the salary or pension. </para>
          <para>I may be well and truly behind the times. I listened though to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> who said that senior counsel are being paid $750 a day. If he implies, as he has done, that they are getting fees of that sort day in and day out, it is an enormous imposition on the public. It is an outrageous illustration of why this Parliament can never allow legel aid to accrue until it takes control of professional fees. If judges are to receive, by Executive action, a capital sum in lieu of long service leave and are not to be subject to the ordinary idea that after a certain period of service they are entitled to some leave on taxed salary, I protest. I think this situation does great damage to the judiciary. </para>
          <para>The vice of it can be illustrated in this way. The last Chief Justice who retired 2 years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Kirby, by a mere gratuitous act of the Executive, was given twice the annual salary just as an act of grace. The $2,500 that is added to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> McTiernan&#39;s long service leave at the equivalent of a year&#39;s salary, is called <inline font-style="italic">ex-gratia.</inline> I have looked at the reply of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> which is contained in the proceedings of the estimates committee. Much of it gives me satisfaction. It is a recognition, I think, of the imperative need to consider this position urgently. But I am not satisfied with the very close language used when the Attorney-General said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I wish to make it quite clear that the decision to make this payment was not made until after the resignation, which is dated 5 September, had been delivered. It would be wrong to suggest that the payment was agreed to prior to or in order to induce his retirement. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I make no implication whatsoever except to say that I note that what is referred to is &#39;decision&#39; and &#39;agreement&#39;. There is no denial that references or discussions or anticipations were referred to or fostered before retirement. I make no insinuation but one must be particularly careful in this regard because the law would never be where it is in its independence and security and respect unless judges refused anything that was not their lawful entitlement, either on assumption of office, performance of office or quitting or office. Otherwise, the inferences are not palatable. </para>
          <para>I conclude by saying that I always thought that even before a judge ascended the bench it was the cardinal principle of the legal profession that from a client whom you have served you receive nothing more and, only out of your own individual grace, less than the professional fee you charge. I remember a distinguished chief justice of the High Court who, in practice, in 1921, by tradition having performed notable national service for the Wool Board had delivered to him a cheque for &#163;10,000. He returned it saying: &#39;It is a principle of our profession that we do not accept <inline font-style="italic">ex-gratia</inline> payments from clients&#39;. He was following in the tradition of Murray before he became Lord Mansfield who told his celebrated </para>
          <para>Duchess client exactly the same thing. He was a true son of the weatherbeaten Orkney Isles. </para>
          <para>I raise this matter with the utmost reluctance but the utmost firmness. I insist, so far as I have any energy, that it will be fully recognised that when special legislation is introduced I will fight to the utmost to prevent a salary being turned into a pension overnight and, in the mystery of the midnight, a long service capital payment being given which should be a salary for the period of service. </para>

I thought it was only fair to the committee to be able to say exactly what the views were as formed on the matter.

          <para class="block">I have discussed this matter further with the Attorney-General. I emphasised to him the strong views of the Committee. I emphasise that the Attorney-General agrees with the views that have been expressed by the Committee. I hope I may be permitted a personal view although I am representing the Attorney-General in this matter. I also agree with the views of the Committee. So that there can be no doubt about it, I now quote from page 3 of the report: </para>

            <para>In no circumstances should such payments to Justices of the High Court and Judges of the various Federal Courts be seen to be dependent upon a favourable Government decision, but rather upon statutory authority. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Attorney-General and I fully agree with that statement. The question is: What can be done about it? The Attorney-General has said that he will be giving it early consideration. He has some amendments in mind on the Judges Pensions Act for introduction in the Budget session. He will be putting them forward with the amendments he already has in hand for consideration by the Cabinet. I cannot give any greater undertaking than that. As honourable senators know, the matter must be determined by the Government and indeed by other processes in this chamber. I need say no more. The fact is that that is the most the Attorney-General and I could do in relation to this matter. I can only conclude by expressing the earnest hope of all those associated that this very vexed important matter can be resolved hopefully in the Budget session but certainly as soon as possible. </para>

            <para>- I wish to raise a matter relating to the Department of the Northern Territory. I refer to page 2 of the report of Estimates Committee E which deals with loan  encouragement to primary producers. The particular matter to which I refer is the critical state of the beef industry in the Northern Territory caused by the depressed state of the market and the termination of the freight subsidy scheme which assisted producers to get their stock to market. This was disclosed in the report. I do not want to take up the time of the Committee of the Whole. The plight of the beef industry in Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, is generally well known at the moment. That industry is one of the Territory&#39;s major industries. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a report on the Northern Territory pastoral industry. This report has been shown to the Minister who is in charge of the Bill and to the Opposition Whip. No objection has been raised. The report sets out in detail the present situation of the beef industry in the Territory. I ask the Minister to give some consideration to the restoration of the freight subsidy scheme as a measure to assist this industry. </para>

          <para>This is an increase of some 688 000 head (62 per cent) over the population of 4 years ago, brought about by inability to sell cattle and the good seasons. While these figures indicate a large surplus of cattle that should go to the abattoirs, it is cautionary to note that many of these cattle are unbranded and not readily mustered. </para>
