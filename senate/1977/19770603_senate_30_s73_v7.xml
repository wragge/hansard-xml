            <para>- by leave- I seek to convey the thoughts of the members of the National Country Party on this sad occasion. The National Country Party has lost a long-term stalwart and one of its most distinguished elders with the death yesterday of Edgar Wylie Prowse.  His  passing afflicts me and my parliamentary colleagues with a deep sense of bereavement. Edgar was a close friend of mine and a colleague and my thoughts of him would hold no reserve as to his morality, his capacity and his excellence of performance while he was a senator. I admired, too, his many other qualities- his unmistakable honesty, his wisdom and sincerity, his quiet but marked sense of humour and the strength he drew from his Christian beliefs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse</inline>died in the role to which he was born- as a son of the soil- having worked on his farm the day before his death. He gave a lifetime of service to the people of Western Australia in farming organisations, in local government and in politics. The wide experience and expert knowledge he had gained as a Bachelor of Agricultural Science and as a working farmer enabled him to discharge his duties in each of those spheres with great authority and competence. In 1974 the Western Australian Branch of the Country Party rewarded him with life membership. He had been its Vice-President in 1 956-57 and its  President  from 1 958 to 1 962. </para>
          <para>He was elected to the Senate in 1961 and served this chamber and his State with distinction in a variety of roles before ill health forced his retirement in 1973. He was  Chairman  of Committees for the last two of his 12 years of Senate service.  His  knowledge and understanding of problems which from time to time confronted the rural industries were frequently demonstrated in the Senate. I well remember his quickly seeing the core of the problem or the fault in a piece of legislation that others had missed. In that context alone his insight resulted in service of inestimable value to many Australians, particularly primary producers. He was a sound advocate of the Senate and its place in the parliamentary scene. I would like to quote the following brief passage from the last speech he made in the Senate chamber: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Great and proper concern has been expressed I think, Tor the Senate as part of the Commonwealth structure. 1 agree that we should not by inadvertence or eagerness, in any way denigrate the status, significance and role of the Senate. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Throughout the time I knew Edgar Prowse, he was supported by a wonderful woman in his wife, Lucy. The stability of his home was a contributing factor to the high standards he brought to this place. His family will know that his life and service stand as a monument. His wife, son and daughters have our deep sympathy in their bereavement. </para>

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I  ask: Has he seen the statement made by the 5 members of the Jackson Committeea statement which 1 understand was released last night- including its <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr Carnegie,</inline> of Conzinc Rio Tinto of Australia, in which they have added to criticism of the White Paper on manufacturing which was brought down recently by the Government? This criticism adds to that expressed by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Farmers Federation. Will the Government now admit that the White Paper does not recognise the need for structural change, that it fails to give guidelines on exchange rate and foreign investment policy and that it fails to detail the social implications of industry and industrial relations? In view of the fact that the Parliament is almost in recess, are we to assume that manufacturing industry in Australia will have to wait another 3 months before knowing precisely what are the Government 's intentions in respect of this sector? </para>

            <para>- I have not seen the statement to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has referred. Looking at the program for the Senate today, I doubt whether I will be able to have much time during the day to study the statement, but I shall certainly do so as soon as I can. I agree that the members of the Jackson Committee who apparently made that statement-I take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> 's word for it that they did- have valuable views on and great knowledge of the subject. As regards the other parts of the question, the White Paper which was tabled by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week represents a major achievement by the Government- a major exercise by the Government- over a long period in which it has given great weight and consideration to the views of all the interested groups and manifold areas concerned with this vitally important sector of Australian economic life. The Government certainly does not admit for one moment that there has been any failure in the exercise; indeed, it would claim that the exercise has made a valuable contribution to future policies and the consideration of policies in relation to this matter. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I refer to an item in the AM program yesterday on the Government's proposal for the establishment of a Human Rights Commission. The Australian Broadcasting Commission announcer introduced the particular segment by saying: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Australia does not have a Bill of Human Rights and an attempt by the Labor Government to have the UN Human Rights Charter written into Federal legislation was defeated by the Opposition Parties in the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">In fact, the Bill that the Labor Government introduced was never brought forward for debate in this chamber and lapsed when Parliament was prorogued early in 1974 for the Royal Visit. This inaccuracy was drawn to the attention of the ABC by me yesterday, but no correction has been made. I was advised this morning by the producer of the program that he regarded the matter as a technicality. I ask: Will the Minister draw this matter to the attention of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and seek an explanation as to the circumstances in which a mis-statement of fact is regarded by the Commission as a technicality? </para>

            <para>-I shall certainly draw the attention of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to the facts as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney.</inline> In fact, I shall invite him to draw the matter to the attention of the ABC itself. It is quite clear that any body in the communications field, particularly one that is given a statutory obligation to be independent and therefore to be objective in its reporting, should be scrupulously accurate in its statements. I think it is fair to say that the <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program is one that is very widely listened to and that therefore people could be forgiven for using it as a basis for forming their judgments. It can be a very useful public commentary provided that it sticks to the terms of the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to objectivity. I think therefore that those who handle the program must be scrupulous in this regard. It is clear that this was no technicality and that that judgment must be regarded as incorrect. However unwittingly, and I put that on it as such, it was a wrong statement. The fact is that the Bill was not defeated. The fact is that by a judgment of the then Labor Government it was elected to let the Bill lapse. On that basis I shall bring the matter to the attention of my colleague and ask him to draw it to the attention of the Commission itself. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question by reminding the Leader of the Government in the Senate that last week he indicated that he would endeavour to set aside sufficient time this week for debate to take place on the nuclear safeguards statement and on the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry second report. Because of the amount of legislation to be dealt with today, will the Minister agree that there is now insufficient time available for the Senate this week to enable such a debate to take place in this chamber? Because the subject is of such national importance, will the Minister assure the Senate that the Government will set aside time early in the Budget session for such a debate to take place? </para>

            <para>-I notice that one honourable senator opposite suggests that we should debate this matter next Monday. I do not think there would be a great deal of enthusiasm for that suggestion. I recall discussing this matter with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. Subject to nothing extraordinary intervening, it would be my intention to set aside Government business on the first Thursday of the Budget session to debate these matters. If the Opposition wanted to continue after 6 p.m. that day it might wish to surrender general business so that we can debate this matter till 10.30 that night. I think we ought to worry about those details in the first week back. But as I said, my present intention is for this matter to be debated on the Thursday of the first sitting week. </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. The Victorian Government, according to today's Press, was yesterday urged to sell land and to use the money for housing purposes. Such a suggestion prompts me to ask: Would the Government consider having an investigation instituted to test the question in depth and in particular to establish the level to which extensive public sector purchase of land has contributed to the degree of increase in the price of residential land and to test the economics of the whole theory of vast advance purchases of land? </para>

            <para>-The question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline> is of great significance in terms of the home ownership capacity of the ordinary Australian family. It is doubly important because in recent years the cost of serviced land has. moved from about 25 per cent of the overall cost of a house to 40 per cent or even 50 per cent. It could be said that serviced land costs are really now the dominant part of the overall cost of a house. There have been a number of tests of government intervention by way of government land development and government housing alongside the free enterprise system, government land banks and land banks. From my former knowledge of this matter there is no indication at all that the public sector intervention has in any way done anything to provide a cheaper form of serviced land or a cheaper type of house. In fact some of the evidence is to the contrary. </para>

              <para>-In due course and at another time I would be happy to give figures of land development costs in Adelaide- the cost of serviced land and the competing costs of the private sector in land development. In some States difficulty has been experienced in selling government owned serviced land in competition with the ordinary free market. I think that has been the general picture around Australia. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>My understanding is that the Government is to set up an inquiry into the cost of land, land servicing and general home building. This is a matter of profound importance because so much is involved in terms of" holding charges, in terms of delays in getting permits at State and local government level and in terms of the duress that is implied by authorities. Another consideration is the shelving by semi-governmental authorities of their responsibilities and forcing on to the developers of the land jobs such as the installation of mains and pumping stations on the perimeters. Because it is such a complex matter, it is not one that can be answered in the compass of the question. I would hope that the Government inquiry would reveal the facts which are vital to the matter of home ownership in Australia. </para>

The question refers to the future of the Woomera rocket range. The Minister might have seen a Press report yesterday that one of the subjects for discussion between the Prime Minister and his group and United Kingdom authorities was to be whether the Woomera rocket range might be activated again. My second question refers to my recent question which the Minister will recall about Service trials which were to be held at Woomera and the report that they were being held in May. I ask the Minister whether he can provide any information in respect of the first question. As to the second question, can he say whether those trials have been completed?

              <para>- If by interjection <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> says it is not an unqualified blessing, that may well be so. What I was proceeding to say was that in the administration it will be enormously complex to make value judgments on the whole situation of licensing and the general supervision of citizen band radios. So, really, the announcement itself simply triggers off a whole host of other matters. As to the specifics in the question, I am not clear of the circumstances under which the confiscations occurred and I would be hesitant to make any statement because of any legal proceedings or the implications of those proceedings in respect of breaches of the existing law; but to the extent that the question raises what seems to me to be an important point and has some aspect of equity, I will bring it to the attention of my colleague to see what can be done. </para>

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister for Science. The Minister may recall a question I asked him recently about fishing surveys in the waters around the east coast of Tasmania and the north-east region of Tasmania, and the reported catches which gave encouragement to the belief that this area had excellent potential for further development of commercial fishing. Can the Minister say what survey work is currently going on in that region? What are the results so far of the survey? Will the programs being undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other interested agencies, government or otherwise, be continued? </para>

          <para class="block">CSIRO. My understanding is that from 1949 the CSIRO Division of Fisheries and Oceanography undertook studies of various fish such as pilchards, shark, barracouta and fishes of the continental slope such as gemfish, deep sea trevally and ling in the vicinity of Tasmania. In 1975 the CSIRO chartered a small trawler, the <inline font-style="italic">Courageous,</inline> which began operations in November of that year and for a vessel of this size, which is about 28 metres, the <inline font-style="italic">Courageous</inline> has been equipped with the most modern electronic fish finding and fish counting equipment and technology available in the world. </para>
          <para>It has been doing this work in Tasmanian and South Australian waters as well as in Western Australian waters. I think that at the moment it is in Northern Territory waters. The primary mission of the <inline font-style="italic">Courageous</inline> in its period in Tasmanian waters was to assess the size, movement and potential yield of the jack mackerel stock in south-eastern Australian waters. While attending to this mission, a considerable amount of time has been spent in working-up exercises, most of which will be completed after the vessel has been refitted, which will be done next August. </para>
          <para>The jack mackerel studies and working-up exercises are viewed as a part of a project concerned more with the resources of south-eastern Australian waters than with those of the Tasmanian waters alone. Nevertheless, the work has involved a great deal of research in the vicinity of Tasmania during the 18 months for which the vessel has been in operation. There has been a total of 1 1 5 mid-water trawls and 34 bottom trawls in the various areas around Tasmania. There have been no bottom trawls on the west coast of Tasmania because of the adverse sea conditions which make it extremely hazardous to deploy the gear. The mid-water trawls are providing information on the abundance and distribution of mackerel. They are showing that there is an abundance of light fish suitable for fish meal and possibly suitable for fish silage. After its refit in August the <inline font-style="italic">Courageous</inline> will continue the studies of jack mackerel until some time in 1978, when this will be completed. Subsequently the vessel probably will be assigned to missions off other parts of the Australian coast. </para>

            <para>-If gas is to go on to the export market, I fail to see why it need be piped right across Australia, processed in Sydney and then exported. For the life of me, I cannot see why it cannot be processed in Western Australia and then exported. This proposal strikes me as some sort of interesting pipe dream of some people in New South Wales in order to gain for themselves a benefit which rightly belongs to Western Australians. As to the other question which the honourable senator asks, I think it was answered the other day, although not necessarily by me. There are some problems about costing these pipelines across Australia. I have a belief at the moment that a lot is being talked about the whole subject in the public area without there being much knowledge of it. </para>

            <para>- The information that I have in regard to this matter is that 355 members of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union employed by Consolidated Meat Holdings Ltd at Wodonga recently went on strike in support of a log of claims for improved wages and conditions. The strike ended on Wednesday, 1 June, and the workers were to have resumed duty the following day. However, because the union has not or will not guarantee that the production levels at the meatworks will be maintained, the management of Consolidated Meat Holdings Ltd has refused to re-engage the workers and has closed down the works. It is understood that for some time the Victorian branch of the AMIEU has been involved in rolling strikes within the meat industry over a 19-point log of claims which includes demands for a $20 a week wage increase and a 9-day working fortnight. It is also understood that the union has refused to take the log of claims to arbitration. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In view of this, there is some doubt as to whether the men are now unemployed as a result of direct industrial action or whether, as some sources indicate, Consolidated Meat Holdings Ltd has closed down for purely economic reasons. If that were the case it is quite likely that the recent industrial disruptions in the meat industry have been a major contributing factor. Accordingly, it is not possible at this point to say whether the 355 men stood down as of 1 June can qualify for unemployment benefit. Inquiries are being made with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and as soon as further information is available a determination will be made with regard to their eligibility for unemployment benefit. I regard the matter as one of some urgency. I am closely in touch with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street,</inline> the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, to have his advice with regard to the industrial situation and whether the men are eligible for unemployment benefit under the Act. </para>

The Minister has made some statements and I draw from a transcript of an interview which he gave on the <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> program on 1 June. He said that when the applications were dealt with overseas not all the factors were taken into account. As soon as information came to him which added to the information that we already had he decided that it was not in the best interests of the Australian community for these people to visit Australia. He therefore gave instructions for them not to enter. He insisted that he believed that the action he had now taken was in the best interests of the Australian people. He went on to point out that there is a lot of public comment which gives a detrimental image to the Croatians who are living in Australia and said that the vast majority of people of Croatian origins in Australia are decent, law abiding, fine Australian people but in the past there have been some who have given the Croatian community as a whole a bad name. He emphasised that the Croatian community in Australia are worthwhile citizens but in the case with which we are dealing at the moment he felt that it was not in the best interests of the Australian people for the visas to be issued. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I am aware that questions have already been asked in the other place on this subject. My having explained that will perhaps prevent the Minister from giving me a 'No, no' answer. I ask: Will the Government conduct an inquiry into allegations made by the Western Australian newspaper proprietor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lang</inline> Hancock, that he was aware of the recommendations being made in the second Fox report and that he had contacted various Ministers about five of those recommendations before the report was presented? If not, why not, as the allegations raise serious questions about the security of all commission reports? If the answer is yes, what form will the inquiry take? Will <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hancock</inline> be called on to divulge his source of information, and the Ministers to produce the telexes that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hancock</inline> states he sent to them? Does the Minister not agree that it is intolerable that a person so closely involved in the very industry under inquiry should be able to make allegations of this nature without substantiation? </para>

            <para>-It seems a rather strange procedure that some person in the community can make an allegation, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hancock</inline> has done, and then the Government has to prove that his allegation is true. I should have thought that the onus would now rest on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hancock.</inline> If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hancock</inline> says he had information, then I think he ought to disclose what information he had and where he got it. I think that the onus fairly rests upon him to prove his statement and not on the Government to disprove the statement, which is really what the honourable senator is saying when she asks about an inquiry. We are getting into a rather nonsense area. If the honourable senator is worried about the telex, that telex hardly indicates any great knowledge. Has the honourable senator seen the telex? </para>

            <para>-I recall the question being asked. My friend and colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack, was kind enough to do some research on this matter in his inimitable fashion. Evidently, the history of the matter goes back to a remark by Queen Victoria about the Crimean War. I forget the exact phraseology but I will attempt to get it for the honourable senator. It has been a long-standing practice. It was introduced by a monarch in the last century. I think it is fair that the Australian Government, now that we have a Queen of Australia, should look at the matter to see what are the proper regulations and directions for the wearing of decorations by Australians in the late twentieth century. </para>

            <para>-My question, which is directed to the Minister for Education, refers to the guidelines for the 1978-1980 rolling triennium for education funding which the Minister has just released. The guidelines recommend that the Schools Commission cut spending on joint programs for services and development and special projects, which is the innovations program, by $4m. Is this drastic cut in the only program to which all schools, teachers and parents have access being made partly in order to provide for the amount of $2m the Government envisages being allocated in 1978 to schools in levels 1 and 2, the 2 top categories of non-government schools? Does this recommended reallocation of funds from a general program to the better off non-government schools signify an end to the policy of funding schools on the basis of need? </para>

            <para>- The Labor Opposition and therefore <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> must know that I will be bringing down the guidelines in approximately 30 minutes and that until then all copies of the guidelines that have been released have been embargoed. The situation is that they are not for use until that embargo expires. Therefore, by whatever method <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> may have achieved whatever information she has, she must know that her question is totally improper and is a complete disregard of a protocol long-standing in the Senate.

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which, I understand, Australia has signed but not yet ratified. As this important international covenant is essential to the Human Rights Commission Bill and as it expresses fundamental civil and political rights, including the right to equality in voting and representation, can the Minister say whether the covenant will be ratified in the near future? </para>

            <para>-I believe that whether the covenant will be ratified in the future is a matter which is still under consideration. As the honourable senator would know, my colleague the Attorney-General has introduced into the other place a Bill concerning this matter. I imagine that by the time the Bill reaches the Senate the Government will be in a better position to inform the honourable senator of its intentions. As the honourable senator will know, quite long negotiations have been conducted by the Attorney with the various States in an attempt to obtain joint Commonwealth-State cooperation in this matter. The Commonwealth has been reluctant to move without the full Federal-State co-operation. I think that by the time we return early in the Budget session this matter may begin to be resolved. Certainly there will be an opportunity during the debate on this Bill for the Government's intentions to be made more clear. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I ask: Is it true that orders to cut 43 staff from the Community and Social Welfare Branch of her Department in Victoria are still proceeding despite the Minister's allocation of 96 additional staff, and that staff members' demotions and removals will be implemented on this coming Monday, 6 June? Is it true that staff have refused to be shifted until the position is clarified by the Director? Finally, is it a fact that this will overload staff, including welfare staff remaining in the Branch, who are already overloaded with demands for their services because of the existing inordinately high levels of unemployment? </para>

            <para>- There have been a lot of questions in recent days regarding staff in my Department. I have announced increases to staff which have been approved by the Acting Prime Minister. I have stated also that the Director-General and the State Directors will meet next week with regard to allocations of staff within the Department. I have no further detailed information concerning any specific section in any office of the Department. I hope that the outcome of the discussions which the Director-General will hold next week will enable management of the Department to use the 9000-plus staff who are now in the Department to give an effective and efficient service to the people of Australia. I have asked the Director-General to give particular attention to the deployment of the staff in the best way in which they can be used to give the service which the Government believes the people of Australia should receive. Whatever decisions are taken with regard to any individual section will remain an outcome of the meeting next week. If any decision is taken that requires public announcement, that announcement will be made after those decisions have been taken. In the meantime, I have asked for this matter to be treated as a matter of urgency in order to have the Department functioning effectively and efficiently. I hope that this will be achieved shortly. </para>

What is the Government's attitude to building a levee bank to the north of the township of Katherine, Northern Territory, to protect the town from flooding by the Katherine River? What is the estimated cost and feasibility of the project, bearing in mind the cost of flood damage to the town, its community and industrial and residential development and the fact that more land in the town would be usable than is now considered possible? </para>

            <para>- I cannot answer directly the honourable senator's question relating to cost. My understanding of the background of the matter is that a report was prepared in about 1970 by the Mines and Water Resources Branch of the then Department of the Interior. That report detailed the susceptibility, extent, depth and frequency of flooding in Katherine. Levee protection of existing urban areas in Katherine was proposed in a report prepared in 1973 by an independent consultant. However, the risks involved in maintaining levees subject to high heads of water are considerable, and the Government will need to be assured of the safety of any such project before it proceeds. An investigation into the overall development of the Katherine River, including water supply, irrigation, recreation and flooding aspects, is currently being given priority by the Water Resources Branch of the Department. Possible variations of the alignment of the proposed levee are being covered in that study, and until the study is completed it is not possible to provide a cost estimate of the project. </para>

              <para>- Yes, a Freudian slip. I welcome these questions which show their rejection of federalism and their commitment to the old type Whitlam centralism which would rob the States of the money they are now getting. As I have been asked whether the so-called pipe dream has floated off, I want to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> because he has invited me to answer the question, and to the people of Australia that with almost every step of the whole of the federalism programs the Premiers have agreed willingly and unanimously. No Premier has ever queried the total amount that was given under the 33.6 per cent formula as being other than very generous, and no Premier has queried the equalisation arrangements applying to the distribution of funds. In fact, there remain only 2 matters of dispute between the Premiers. There is the question of the body that will do the review of relativities, and on this the Premiers hold different ideas. Is it strange therefore that when there is a dispute between the Premiers the Commonwealth may have to resolve the matter? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The second matter is that the Premiers have the opportunity, if they wish to take it, of either cutting taxes or of putting on a surcharge. Since the Premiers have been the greatest advocates of cutting taxation and we have given them an abundance of more revenue, do <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> and the Australian Labor Party say that they are opposed to giving the States a fixed percentage of growth revenue which the Labor Premier of South Australia said was vital to the survival of the States? Are they opposed to giving to the States this year substantially more than the Whitlam Government formula would have given them? If not, what are they opposed to, or are they merely just crying out? The simple fact is that when we ask them to say what they are opposed to they have no opposition. How can they oppose what the Premiers have said? How can they oppose giving more money to the States? How can they oppose giving more money to local government? </para>

              <para>- I repeat that the Labor Party has never said which one of these proposals it would oppose in government. Would it oppose the 33.6 per cent formula if it got back into government, God forbid? Would it reverse this formula? Let us listen to the answer. Because we have had some hundreds of questions from the Opposition condemning federalism, I ask honourable senators opposite now: If they got back in government would they reverse the Fraser Government's policy on federalism? There is the answer for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne-</inline> a total silence. Honourable senators opposite know that what we are doing is good for the Premiers. Not one honourable senator opposite has the guts to get up and say he would reverse this policy. It is good for the Premiers. </para>

              <para>-Senator Wriedt did not say that he was quoting from what was purported in a newspaper to be a statement from the Premiers Conference. He said that he was quoting from something which was an extract of the transcript of the Conference, or that is what he was implying. Is he in fact quoting from a document which he has no right to possess, or is he quoting from hearsay? </para>

The Minister may recall a question on notice which was asked by a member of the House of Representatives to which he answered in effect that the Grants Commission in its assessment of the special grant of $27m made to Queensland in 1974-75 included a component of $7,085,000 which represented the loss incurred by the Brisbane City Council's urban bus services. Is he aware that the Queensland Government has refused to remit the $7m to the Brisbane City Council, thus causing grave financial difficulties for the Council and having obvious harmful consequences for public transport in Brisbane. Can the Minister advise whether he or the Federal Government can take any action to ensure that the Federal funds made available for Brisbane City Council bus services can be passed on to that Council? </para>

            <para>-The authoritative figures published as to the operation of accounts at the end of March this year after 9 months ' operation show that New South Wales is approximately $1llm in surplus. That is substantially more than the surplus at this time last year. Therefore, New South Wales has a capacity of its own. I remind the honourable senator that the New South Wales Government, in common with a number of other State governments, when it put together its current Budget elected to give tax cuts, thus forgoing revenue rather than using the money which would otherwise have been available to pursue policies. When a government elects to do that, in its view tax cuts are more vital than the policies it proposes to implement. One can say only that New South Wales at that time was far more concerned to give tax cuts than to apply moneys to the improvement of government transport and the safety of those passengers who travel by rail in that State. This is a matter entirely for the State Government. No number of alibis will judge it. In any case, the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran,</inline> will have to explain to his own colleagues at a meeting of the Loan Council why he, more than anyone else, should get special relief. It will not be the Commonwealth but his own colleagues who will be judging his particular circumstances. </para>

              <para>-I do not know that. I think it would be highly desirable that they should. An intuitive judgment is made after a certain lapse of time that that should be done. I do not believe that, in the long term, these documents should not be made public. The Premiers themselves elect to hold the Premiers Conference in camera. That is a decision made by the Premiers in the Premiers Conference. Because of that decision, the transcript of proceedings becomes private. Therefore there is a protocol in that regard. I remind the honourable senator that if he looks at the 1975 debates he will find that what we said was that the documents concerned purported to be facsimiles of documents. In any case, we had available to us during the discussion documents which were said to be the documents concerned. In other words, we had available to us documents which were stated by the Government of the day to be the Executive Council documents. They were the fundamental documents on which the case rested. </para>

            <para>-Does the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs recollect that the definition of 'responsibility' put down by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Playford, the ex-Premier of South Australia, was to the effect that the function, art and responsibilities of a Premier at a Premiers Conference are to get the biggest slice of the most luscious part of the Commonwealth turkey? </para>

            <para>-I do not recollect that definition, but if we are describing what the Premiers Conference has been in the 30 years in which we have had uniform taxation, we could not get a better description. Since the advent of uniform taxation the Premiers Conference has ceased to be a dialogue in conference on co-operative issues or on national and State issues. It became simply a wrangle over the cut-up of the cake, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack has said. In fact, under the Whitlam Government it came to be a summoning to Canberra of the Premiers as whimpering schoolboys to be told what they would get and then to be sent away with a flea in their ear. That is precisely what it became. We are setting out to change all that. It will be noted from the silence of Labor Opposition senators that they do not intend to reverse the clock and that they have nothing really to criticise in what we are doing. </para>

            <para>-I have not seen the Press report. I certainly have not seen the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. If I had seen it, that would be a breach of privilege. I think every honourable senator would be interested to know how a report to be presented today is disclosed in this morning's newspapers. I would have thought that knowledge of the contents of the report would have been confined to members of the Committee. The position is rather interesting. All I can say is that naturally the Government will read the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence with interest. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> asks me a question concerning it during the Budget session after the Government has read the report, I may be able to indicate the Government 's view. </para>

            <para>-This interim report is tabled now because the Committee feels that the issues it raises should be brought before the Parliament at the earliest opportunity. Each of its chapters is self contained and embraces conclusions and recommendations related to the chapters now tabled. The balance of the report dealing primarily with the important electronics industry will be presented to the Parliament in the Budget sittings of Parliament in August. It is not proposed to move that the interim report be printed at this time as it is intended that the printing motion will be moved when all sections of the report are complete. Meanwhile copies of the interim report in its present form will be available for study by interested parties. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In conclusion, I commend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Harrier. D.S.C., M.P., and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop- Chairman</inline> and  Deputy Chairman  respectively of the Subcommitteeand their fellows for their efforts in bringing this report to the whole Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and, through that Committee, to the Parliament. To that statement I should like to add some observations for the interest of honourable senators that has been aroused by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges'</inline> question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> this morning. I have noted a general misunderstanding of this interim report in the newspapers. The conclusions are based upon 2 criteria which must be borne in mind. The first criterion is what we have described as a low level scenario defence of the situation and the second is a high level scenario of the defence situation. In other words, and more plainly, the Government must make strategic decisions in advance on defence preparations based upon those assessments. As a further explanation, because of the pressing business in the Senate yesterday I withheld this report. It was tabled in the House of Representatives. That explains why articles on the report appeared in the newspapers this morning. </para>

              <para>-Briefly, I want to support what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack has said. I want firstly to thank him, because he chairs the full Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, the  Chairman  of the Sub-committee and members of the Sub-committee who spent more than 12 months in their investigations and studies, the results of which are now in one document. Senators should note that for the first time there is in one document, with the exception of the material on the electronics industry, most of the relevant material upon which senators, the public and experts might be able to assess the question of what are appropriate industrial support needs. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>My personal general conclusion resulting from the recommendations and conclusions of the Committee is that there is an urgent need to do something about industrial support within Australia if we are to meet defence needs. The Committee made recommendations on matters with which we all have had experience. For example, honourable senators will recall that this matter has been frequently debated in the Senate. In 1970 during the debate on the Supply Bills a motion was passed relating to the urgent need to maintain a defence capacity. It is unfortunate that in recent years there has been a run down in the work load of staff, including professional staff, of the Government factories and private industry. The Committee put its mind to points of view which might correct that situation. </para>
          <para>Finally, I refer to the shipbuilding industry which also was mentioned in the report. I recommend to honourable senators and to the public generally that they study the conclusions and recommendations which have come from the Committee. It could well be, in the view of Committee members- this view was endorsed by the whole Committee- that the proposed package deal could be a solution to the problem in the shipbuilding industry and it might correct the very sad position in respect of Newcastle and Whyalla. </para>

            <para>- by leave- The list of appointees to these various bodies contains some very distinguished names in the academic and education areas. I am not familiar with all of them. On behalf of the Opposition I accept that the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> has considered very carefully all these appointments. They are very important because they will have an important influence on the determination of government policy on education in the years to come. As the Labor Party did not oppose this new structure, we wish it well. We feel certain that those persons who have been appointed will give to the Government their best advice on what is best for education. I do not wish to say any more on this particular matter at the moment. The further statement which the Minister will be putting down immediately contains the real essence of government policy in respect of education so I shall postpone my remarks until after that statement has been put down. </para>

            <para>-The Government has determined guidelines for 1978 and subsequent years of the 1978-80 rolling triennium within the context of its preparations for the 1977-78 Budget. In arriving at its decisions the Government has had to reconcile the aspirations at all levels of education with its policy of containing inflation, which necessarily involves restraint in public expenditure, and reducing the level of the deficit in the Commonwealth Budget. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It will be recalled that the previous government in 1975 reduced the total level of expenditure under the education commission's programs for 1976. This Government restored triennial planning on a rolling basis for 1977 and adopted levels of expenditure for that year which restored real growth to the education programs. It also established guidelines for each Commission for planning purposes only for the subsequent years of the rolling triennium 1978 and 1979. In accordance with the rolling triennium principle, the Government has now determined firm guidelines for 1978, to which the education commissions will be invited to respond in presenting their next reports. It has also provided indicative planning guidelines for the next stages of the rolling triennium, that is, for 1 979 and 1 980. </para>
          <para>The guidelines for 1978 which form part of this statement will establish base levels of expenditure for 1 978 at the same real level as for 1 977 in the case of universities, colleges of advanced education- subject to additional funds for non-government teachers colleges- and schools. For technical and further education the 1978 base level of expenditure will be 10 per cent higher in real terms than for 1 977. The guidelines provide for a total expenditure on the programs administered by the education commissions of $ 1.740.7m in 1978- expressed in December 1976 cost levels. The amount for each commission in 1 978 compared with 1 977 is: </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="073232197706032_18_0.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">These have been funded in a separate way previously. </para>
          <para>For 1978 the cost supplementation adjustments will be limited to the wages and salaries component in recurrent programs. There will no longer be cost supplementation for capital programs. This variation in the cost supplementation arrangements reflects in part the more favourable tendering climate for capital projects and also is seen as an incentive to the State authorities and institutions concerned to seek to achieve economies in their operations, while maintaining services to students. For the years 1979 and 1980 the planning guidelines provide for a real growth in the base programs of 2 per cent each year for the tertiary area as a whole and of 1 per cent each year for schools, together with continuation of the cost supplementation arrangements which are to apply during 1978. </para>
          <para>In arriving at its decisions, the Government has confirmed its intention to assist in maintaining education expenditure in the States at a high level. It has been mindful also of the special responsibility the States carry, especially for government schools and for TAFE, and of the significantly improved capacity of the States under the revised Commonwealth-State financial arrangements to contribute to these activities from their own resources. The Tertiary Education Commission and the Schools Commission are each asked to present their reports by the end of August. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the guidelines for the Tertiary Education Commission for the 1978-80 rolling triennium. The Tertiary Education Commission should prepare its recommendations for 1978 and subsequent years of the 1978-80 rolling triennium on the basis set out later. In accordance with the provisions of the Tertiary Education Commission Act, the Commission will have the overall responsibility for recommending programs for each of the sectors within these guidelines; the Commission's report will incorporate in full the reports of the Universities Council, the Advanced Education Council and the Technical and Further Education Council. For the year 1978 the Commission may exercise a degree of discretion in recommending the final allocation between recurrent and capital expenditure within the total funds determined for each sector. </para>
		  <para>UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES OF ADVANCED EDUCATION</para>
      <para>For universities and colleges the base funds allocated for 1978 will each be at the same level in real terms as the base allocation for 1977, subject to additional funds for non-government teachers colleges within the advanced education program as set out later. For 1978 the Government expects the university sector to maintain its intake of students at the present level. Intake for the colleges of advanced education sector should not exceed the level of 1 977. </para>
      <para>The Government is concerned about the implications of the serious imbalance between supply and demand for teachers that at present appears to be in prospect over the next decade. The Government wishes to have some advice from the Commission on its assessment of the situation together with advice on the available options for policy consideration in both the short and longer terms. The Commission should examine the findings of the working party of the Advanced Education Council on this subject when they become available. In particular, the Commission should explore with State and other authorities the scope for a reduction in preservice teacher education intakes. </para>
      <para>In deciding upon the levels of funding it will recommend for capital expenditure in 1978, the Government expects the Commission to review all projects, except those for which contractual building commitments have been entered into. If necessary, the Commission should review the timetable of commencements and progress of new projects under existing programs both for 1 977 and subsequently, so as to ensure that total capital expenditure in 1978 is contained within the total funds allocated. No new universities or colleges of advanced education are to be established within the triennium. </para>
      <para>It is the Government's intention to proceed with the development of the Australian Maritime College as quickly as resources permit. Within the allocations for the advanced education sector, it has placed an upper limit of $2m capital and $385,000 recurrent on the College's funds for 1978. It will be a matter for the Commission to advise on a program for the College, after having assessed proposals from the Interim Council of the College and in the context of the total requirements of advanced education. </para>
      <para>The Government intends to introduce a revised program of recurrent assistance to non-government teachers colleges to operate from the beginning of 1978. This is in recognition of the particular need for these colleges to contribute directly towards the preparation of teachers for the non-government schools. The provision of capital assistance for these colleges in future years is to be examined in greater detail by the Commission. An additional allocation of $3.08m for recurrent purposes is included in the total recurrent funds for the advanced education sector in 1978 for this purpose. This amount includes the transfer of $ 1 .2 1 m from the subsidy presently being provided by the Department of Education to certain non-government tertiary institutions. A separate statement will be issued with details of these new arrangements. </para>
	  <para>TECHNICAL AND FURTHER EDUCATION</para>
      <para>The allocation for technical and further education in the States in 1978 will be a base program representing an increase of 10 per cent in real terms over the base allocation for 1977. The Government asks the Commission to pay special attention to the requirements of this sector and to develop co-operative arrangements with the States for the allocation of resources in accordance with their degrees of need and on the understanding that the States will continue to discharge in full their own financial responsibilities in this area. </para>
	  <para>ALL TERTIARY EDUCATION</para>
      <para>In formulating its recommendations, the Commission should have regard to the overall provision of opportunities for tertiary education, including the greater rationalisation of the use of resources and the more extensive use of facilities throughout the year. The Commission should continue to examine in a rigorous way any proposal for the lengthening or upgrading of established courses and should comment on these issues in its report. </para>
      <para>The Commission is asked not to support the introduction of any new courses, or the expansion of existing courses, for basic nurse education within educational institutions. It is the Government's intention to establish a review of arrangements for nurse education after appropriate consultation with both health and education authorities. </para>
      <para class="block">Expenditure in 1978 </para>
      <para>The Government will provide the following base level of funds for 1 978: </para>
      <para class="block">
        <graphic href="073232197706032_20_1.jpg" />
      </para>
      <para>Cost supplementation will be maintained to the end of 1977 under existing arrangements. Supplementation of the 1978 program for cost increases during that year will be limited to increases in respect of the wages and salaries components of recurrent grants (including the fees reimbursement component in the technical and further education sector). </para>
      <para class="block">Expenditure in 1979 and 1980 </para>
      <para>For planning purposes, the base program level for 1979 for the 3 tertiary sectors taken together will be determined by adjusting fully the sum of the base amounts for 1978 for increases in relevant costs (wages and salaries, non-salary recurrent costs, and capital costs) during that year. The amount thus determined will be increased by 2 per cent and will be subject to the same revised cost supplementation arrangements which are to apply during 1978. A similar arrangement will apply for the year 1980 with the adjusted 1979 base program being increased by 2 per cent. </para>
      <para>The Commission is invited to plan for 1979 and 1 980 on this basis, particularly in relation to the allocation of resources among the 3 sectors, and having regard to the Government's wish to continue to give priority to the technical and further education sector. In addition, the Commission is free to undertake longer-term reviews. </para>
	  <para>SCHOOLS</para>
        <para>I turn now to the Schools Commission guidelines for 1978-80 rolling triennium. The Government asks the Schools Commission to make its recommendations for the 1978-80 rolling triennium on the basis I now set out. All sums are expressed in December 1976 cost levels. </para>
        <para class="block">Expenditure in 1978 </para>
        <para>The Government is providing grants totalling $57 lm in December 1976 cost levels as the base level for the programs of the Commission in the States during 1978. This program comprising $156.7m capital and $414.3m in recurrent, represents the same level in real terms as in 1 977. As in the past, the precise level of grants may be varied in accordance with the actual level of enrolments in non-government schools. The Commission may exercise some discretion in recommending the final allocation in 1978 between recurrent and capital expenditure. Cost supplementation will be maintained to the end of 1977 under existing arrangements. Supplementation of the 1978 program for cost increases during that year will be limited to increases in respect of the wages and salaries components of recurrent expenditure for both general and special purpose programs. The Government expects that States will continue to discharge their own financial responsibilities to government and non-government schools. The Government notes the significantly improved capacity of the States under the revised Commonwealth/ State financial arrangements to contribute to these activities from their own resources. </para>
        <para>The Government has indicated the following views on the allocations for particular programs. In drawing up its recommendations the Government expects that the Commission will make provision for the continuation of special purpose programs such as those for handicapped children, for migrants, for disadvantaged schoolsincluding those in country areas-and for children in institutions. In order to contribute some part of the additional funds required to meet the costs of other evolving programs, the Government suggests that the Commission seeks to achieve savings of the order of $4m on the joint programs for services and development and for special projects. Within the funds available under these guidelines, the Government expects the Commission to consult each State on the balance of expenditure between general recurrent and capital programs for government schools. In the case of recurrent funds for non-government schools the Government wishes the Commission to include in its recommendations provision for the additional cost of the previously announced policy of automatically linking grants to non-government schools to per pupil expenditures in government schools. The Government also wishes the Commission to make recommendations as a first step towards the implementation of the Government's policy of providing a basic per pupil grant to non-government schools equal to 20 per cent of running costs per pupil in government schools. The Government envisages an amount of $2m being allocated in 1978 to schools in Levels 1 and 2 for this purpose. The Government wishes the Commission to increase the capital program for non-government schools by $3m, specifically to assist building programs in newly expanding areas of population. In general recognition of this problem, the Government asks the Commission to draw it to the attention of the State Planning and Finance Committees in determining their priorities for the administration of the overall capital program. </para>
        <para class="block">Expenditure in 1979 and 1980 </para>
        <para>For planning purposes the base program for 1979 will be determined by adjusting fully the base amount for 1 978 for increases in relevant costs- wages and salaries, non-salary recurrent costs, building and equipment costs- during that year. The amount thus determined will be increased by one per cent and will be subject to the same revised cost supplementation arrangements which are to apply during 1978. A similar arrangement will apply for the year 1980 with the adjusted 1979 base program being increased by one per cent. The Commission is invited to plan for 1979 and 1980 on this basis. In addition, the Commission is free to undertake longer term reviews. I commend both statements to the Senate. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave- The Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> has put down a quite lengthy and detailed statement, the implications of which require a considerable degree of study. Even though he had the courtesy to provide me with a copy of the statement earlier, it has not been possible for me to make a complete analysis of it. One thing comes through very clearly, and that is that this is the first evidence and statement by this Government of its retreat from education. The situation is as simple as that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The very things which, for months, we have been saying would occur and which the Minister has denied repeatedly are now here in writing. The evidence is in the statement by the Government. Let me prove that point. When this Government came to office it claimed that it would protect education. It claimed that it would ensure the maintenance of the initiatives which we had taken over 3 years, on a scale never seen before in the history of this country, to lift education from the doldrums it had got into under 23 years of Liberal-Country Party government. This Government claimed that education would not be allowed to slide back, whether it was government schools, non-government schools or any other part of education. </para>
          <para>In the last few months we have said that this Government would retreat. Here is the evidence. Last year certain claims were made about the real growth which would occur in education over the so-called rolling triennium of this Government. It is a rolling triennium all right. It is rolling like a drunken man just about to fall over. The Minister said that there would be a 2 per cent increase in real terms for schools, a 2 per cent increase for universities and colleges of advanced education, and a 5 per cent increase for technical education. On so many occasions he said that there would be no retreat. On 4 November last year he stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I wish to emphasise that the Government has no intention of retreating from its undertaking to support real growth in the education programs on which the commissions make recommendations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I can remember the Minister coming into this chamber on 30 March of this year, during an urgency debate on education, and stating, with reference to the Australian Labor Party: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Last year its members made a lot of noise and uttered a lot of untrue statements and a lot of false scares and apprehensions around the place and all of them were proven wrong. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I ask the Minister: Who is wrong now? Is it the Opposition, or it the Government? He went on to state: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Day after day. day after day the Labor Party was peddling some new scare that there were going to be cuts, just as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> said here today, with not a tittle of reason, that there had been cuts in federal education spending. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Now what do we see? We see a freeze on funds and no real growth. The big retreat has started. Let every Premier, every State Education Minister, every State Treasurer, every parent organisation and every teacher organisation throughout Australia now know what is in store for them in the years ahead under the federalism policy of the Liberal Government. At no time was there ever any intention to maintain anything like the level of commitment of the Labor Government. </para>
          <para>For months we have had to listen to the Minister, who has had the gall to come into this chamber time after time and tell us how, under new federalism, the Liberal Government intended to maintain its commitment to the education system. What does he think the 2 per cent increase in real terms means to those government and non-government schools which have increased enrolments? It means virtually a freezing. Even those funds have been taken away from them. It is very difficult for me to quote precisely from the statement because it is fairly lengthy, but it is quite evident, as the Minister says, that there will no longer be cost supplementation for capital programs. Further on we find that capital programs are virtually finished. That is what it amounts to. It means at least a $35m reduction in the area where schools are still needed. If the States want to impose a double income tax and build the schools themselves, that is all right by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline></para>
          <para>This charade of a 10 per cent increase for technical education is designed to look good. To put the picture clear let me quote the figures again. We are dealing with 4 areas of educationuniversities, colleges of advanced education, technical and further education, and schools. In round figures the total expenditure will be $ 1,700m. The universities, colleges of advanced education and the schools, which constitute the major part, will receive about $ 1 ,600m. There is no increase for them. Their funds are frozen. So technical and further education will receive an extra 10 per cent, which amounts to a magnificent $9m out of $ 1,700m, and that is this Government's commitment to education. I am appalled. I know that it is late in the session and we want to get through our program today, but I am appalled to think that in view of all the stories we have heard over the past few months about how much this Government was prepared to maintain its commitment to, as the Minister used to call them, massive and exciting programs, there will be nobody in the States, in the education department, amongst the teachers and the parents, who will see anything exciting about this little exercise. </para>
          <para>Without delaying the Senate unduly, let me make a few comments about the future and what this document means. It shows without question that the future for education in this country under the Liberal Government is bleak. The States have been told that they must discharge their financial responsibilities. What does that mean? It means simply that more and more of the cost will be passed back to them. If those States are not able to provide the educational facilities which the children and the parents in those States are entitled to have, that is just too bad. We have listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> harping continually about how much better off the States are under the new federalism. He keeps talking about an extra $90m that they will receive this year under general revenue grants. </para>
          <para>Today at question time I asked him whether he would restate and commit himself- not that the commitments are worth anything, I supposeto the statement he made to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> last year that the Government would increase the total payments to the States as did the Labor Government, because education is vitally affected in this area of specific purpose payments. All the time he kept talking about this extra $90m under general revenue grants he was taking funds away with the other hand. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court, the Liberal Premier of Western Australia, fully aware of the situation said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We do not want to be mesmerised by the $90m because when sums are done that $90m is going to look mighty sick when all the other factors are taken into account. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is an accurate picture of the problem that they face. It is unfortunate, and perhaps deliberate, that this statement has been brought down on the last day of sitting, which is not the time to have a proper debate on it. I close by saying that this is a vindication of the warnings we have given as an Opposition. We have been told that we were deliberately scaremongering and trying to create an atmosphere of uncertainty throughout the education systems in Australia. Perhaps now that has been exposed for what it is. We were right. We knew it was going to happen because there is not the commitment on the part of this Government that it claims to have. I regret that education throughout this country can now look forward to a bleak future because the States will not be able to do the things they wish to do and to maintain their standards unless the </para>

            <para>-The purpose of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill is to establish the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and to set up the basis of the financing of the operations of the proposed new Corporation. As I am sure everyone in the Senate is aware, the meat industry of Australia has been suffering great difficulties in the last three or four years. That has been due to a number of factors, but essentially to the decline in the market returns for meat products, especially our overseas markets, and also to the very large increase in the supply of beef in the last few years. I indicate immediately that the Opposition will not oppose the Bill, although it will move some amendments in the Committee stage. I suppose an observation that should be made relates to the time the Government has taken to bring forward this legislation. It will be recalled that under the Labor Government there was a restructuring of 3 marketing authorities involving the wool industry, the dairy industry and the apple and pear industry. It would be fair to say that during that time a certain pattern of restructuring was established. This Corporation appears to follow that pattern, and therefore we support the concept behind it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One of the most contentious issues affecting the producer is the question of producer representation on the Corporation. During the time of the Labor Government, as Minister for Agriculture I had the responsibility of piloting through these new reforms. I can well recall the objections which were raised by producer organisations to the possibility of them not having majority representation on the marketing authorities. But after persuasion and discussion the producer groups came to accept the fact that it would be better if the personnel on the corporations were people more expert- I think that is a fair word to use- in the marketing of their products; that it would be to the benefit of producers to ensure that those people on the corporations could do the best job for the meat industry and other primary industries. That certainly applied in respect to the wool industry. Exactly the same approach was taken when we restructured the old apple and pear board and then the dairy board. Again, there were discussions about representation. But really no problems arose by that time because the new boards, with the new expertise appointed to them- men of very great ability- had demonstrated the value of that form of restructuring. </para>
          <para>I do not know what has happened in the meantime but obviously something has gone basically wrong. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> the Minister for Primary Industry, and this Government are putting up, as I read it, a Corporation of almost identical structure to that which the Labor Government proposed but there is now an uproar throughout the whole of the rural sector about it. Only yesterday we saw about 1 500 producers at a demonstration outside Parliament House. They produced a petition concerning producer control which was presented in the Senate this morning. I do not know what the Minister or the Government has done to these people to stir them up in this manner. I do not know whether they have been ignored, whether there has not been sufficient consultation or whether there has not been sufficient explanation. I do not know what the position is but it does not say much for the sort of liaison that exists between this Government and the rural people. There is no point in imposing something on anybody. Certainly, it is not possible to impose something on farmers; they do not take it. If I understand what has occurred. I can only come to the conclusion that the Minister has not taken very much trouble to talk with the rural people and to help them to understand that the intentions of the Government in introducing this legislation are for their own benefit. </para>
          <para>There are a couple of matters which I will refer to briefly now before we reach the Committee stage. I refer firstly to the restrictions which are being placed on the Corporation. A reading of the Bill gives the impression that the Minister wants to maintain some sort of control over the day to day commercial activities of the Corporation. I do not know why the Minister would want to do that. If he were convinced in his mind that he would be appointing competent people to the Corporation, the last thing he ought to do or should want to do is to tell them how to run the Corporation. But there is no doubt that the clause referring to that matter suggests that that is the case. I notice from the petition presented to the Senate this morning that, in fact, the producers are making that very point. I think that they are entitled to make the point. </para>
          <para>The same comment applies in regard to the restrictions placed on the Corporation in <inline font-style="italic">respect</inline> of trade within Australia. The Government, for some reason or other, is saying that the Corporation cannot do that. Why should not it do so? The bulk of our meat production is marketed in Australia. Is the Corporation being restricted because this will influence some of the very powerful friends that pay large amounts of money to the Liberal and National Country parties? Is it that the Government does not want to see their activities interfered with? That is the only reason I can see for the Government being prepared to hamstring the Corporation. If it is to be a body which can act in the commercial market, it ought to be able to make a commercial judgment as to whether it should involve itself in certain trading activities. I would have thought that advocates of the free enterprise system would support that principle but it appears that it does not apply in relation to a government trading body. Unless the corporation, as the producers themselves have pointed out in their petition, is allowed to make those commercial judgments in its own right, obviously it will not achieve the progress which it should achieve. That will be to the detriment to the industry as a whole. Although the Opposition is not opposing the legislation, it will move amendments at the Committee stage. I will confine my further remarks until we reach that stage. </para>

            <para>- Due to the restriction on time allowed for this debate, I will confine my remarks to what I consider to be the pertinent points in the Bills. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> made what was for him a rather loose speech. It definitely was not up to his normal standards. I intend to refer to 3 matters which he discussed. He talked about the protest yesterday as if it is some rather unique function that has happened only since this Government returned to office. He has a very short memory. If he lent his mind to the matter no doubt he would recall the tremendous amount of protest all over Australia from the rural section during the region of the Labor Government. He talks about ministerial control and attempts to assert that this new Bill allows the Minister to impose more control. In fact, as I will demonstrate later, the Minister will be exerting less control over the direct functions of the new corporation. He referred also rather loosely to the lack of control over trade within Australia. He, above all, should know that this Government has no power whatsoever to legislate in that area. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There has been general dissatisfaction with the present Meat Board in 2 areas. The first is the lack of communication between producers and the Board itself. I agree with that criticism. I think that it is quite a valid criticism to make. The second general criticism is that meat prices are too low. I suggest that that is quite an unfair criticism of the present Meat Board. Australia is the largest exporter of meat in the world. The percentage of meat that is exported is growing. The numbers of cattle in Australia are growing alarmingly. An Australian marketing board cannot be expected to have more than a slight influence on the price that we receive overseas. There was general agreement that the present Meat Board needs to be changed. In passing I would like to pay tribute to the present Board. There are many fine people on that Board. They have done their very best within the restrictions placed upon them and limited by the terms of reference under which they have to operate. They have done a first-class job. In particular I wish to pay tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Paddy</inline> Dempster of Western Australia, a grower-member, who has been on that Board for many years. </para>
          <para>Leading up to the introduction of this legislation, there were many months of consultations with grower organisations and with other interested groups. In fact, the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has stated that something like 200 representations were made to him. Together with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Archer, who both strongly support this legislation, I am a member of the Government Parties back bench rural committee. The committee received about the same number of representations as the Minister received. It is rather interesting, in the light of the protest yesterday, to consider the 2 things that the producers say that they want. Firstly, they want the Board to appoint their nominees to the Board. They have that now. Secondly, they want a majority membership of the Board. They have that now. Yet they say that the present Board is not functioning properly. </para>
          <para>Briefly, I intend to underline some of the differences between the new corporation and the present Board. The new corporation is to have much wider powers, particularly over livestock exports. I will come back to that later. It will have the power to act independently of the Ministerthis underlines the statement which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt-</inline> within guidelines established by the Corporation in consultation with the Minister. So provided it works within those guidelines it is quite entitled to act completely independently of ministerial control. The Corporation has much wider trading powers, and these will be assisted by its right to borrow money. The only restriction on its power to borrow money is that any borrowing must be approved by the Treasurer, and that is a reasonable restriction. It also will have much wider powers over the control of shipping, and this too is quite important. </para>
          <para>The present Board has a membership of ten, comprising 6 producers, 2 representatives of processors and 2 of exporters. The new Corporation is designed to have a membership of nine, comprising 4 producer representatives, one representative of processors and exporters, one Government nominee, 2 people with special qualifications and one <inline font-weight="bold">chairman. Senator Wriedt</inline> pointed out that its structure is identical with the structure of the Australian Wool Corporation which is recognised by all wool growers as contributing a great deal to the wool industry. </para>
          <para>One very important feature of this legislation is the formation of consultative groups which will play a large role in communications between growers, exporters, manufacturers and the Corporation. It will advise the Corporation on day to day problems in the industry. Another quite important role will be to nominate new members of the Corporation. The Minister has the right to select names from a panel submitted by the producer consultative group. The formation of the consultative groups will be carried out by regulation in the short term, but it is expected that this will be confirmed by legislation at a later date. I urge the Minister to consider having Western Australia represented by 3 members on the consultative groups and make a special plea that one of the grower representatives on the Corporation should be from Western Australia. The meat industry in Western Australia has some unique problems. It is a vast State, and there are different problems in different parts of the State. For instance, the Kimberleys in the north has different problems from those of the great southern area where the bulk of the cattle are found. The great southern area has mostly mixed farming. Many farmers in this area run only cattle, but the majority have a mixture of cattle and other stock. Western Australia supplies just on 75 per cent of live sheep exports, and for this reason alone it should have ample representation on the Corporation and on the consultative groups. </para>
          <para>The formation of the consultative groups is still being hotly debated, but I recommend very strongly to the grower organisations that they bend their minds to this problem. The method of election or appointment has still not been decided, and I think it is terribly important that it be determined. It has been suggested by the Minister that the Producer Consultative Group be elected by a poll of producers. I ask the Minister to reconsider that suggestion, for 3 reasons. Firstly, the cost of establishing a list of producers and of voting is astronomical. Secondly, the timing will create problems because it is recognised in the legislation that the two Consultative Groups have to be formed and be functioning before the Corporation can be formed. The other reason is a little more difficult to explain. In Australia we have a very strong, well organised group of producer organisations. If the organisations were entitled to nominate members to the consultative group they could be used as a forum to communicate with growers. </para>
          <para>In summary I recommend that the Minister should give thought to the possibility of using the present organisations as a forum to nominate members to the consultative group. I have seen this process in action in New Zealand. Members of the meat board and the wool board in New Zealand are elected in this way. It can probably be described as an electoral college system. It works very well there. It must be remembered that New Zealand has only one grower organisation. If the Minister and the Government persevere with the election of the consultative group several criteria must be considered. First of all, we must not have this consultative group elected, for instance, by Victorian dairy farmers, Western </para>
          <para>Australian wheat producers and Queensland sugar producers. This would happen if every person who is connected with the raising of cows or sheep had a vote for this consultative group. 1 am saying that the minimum stock numbers requirement must be sufficiently high to make sure that the genuine meat producers elect their own consultative group. I strongly recommend multiple voting for this group so that the meat producers themselves are the people who elect their own consultative group. </para>
          <para>In the brief time left to me in this debate I urge the new Corporation, when it is formed, to proceed with all haste in the implementation of meat classification. This will be a important function of the Corporation. It will improve the knowledge of the producers. It will tell them exactly the sort of stock that the consumer requires. Another important function of this new Corporation will be to try to reduce costs. Costs are one of the greatest problems in the whole of the rural area. A reduction in inflation will help overcome those problems. If the Corporation can initiate moves to reduce the handling costs- the slaughter costs, the processing costs and the freight costs- it will contribute a great deal to the industry. I also urge the Corporation, when dealing with the subject of live sheep exports, to consult with the State governments and with the State Ministers for Agriculture. We have reached, after painful negotiations, an understanding with the various unions involved in Western Australia regarding this important trade. I urge the new Corporation, when it becomes functional, to take cognisance of and consult very closely with State governments on this matter. I wish the new Corporation well. </para>

            <para>- Again I wish to place on record a protest about the indecent haste with which this Government has introduced this legislation and about the way in which it is forcing the legislation through the chamber. The major Bill in the 4 Bills that are being dealt with at the moment is the one concerning the establishment of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. This matter has provoked an enormous amount of criticism of the Government in general and of the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> in particular from beef producers, and meat producers generally, over the last  6  or  8  months. While some of this criticism is perhaps harsh, it is a well known fact that the present Minister for Primary Industry is one of the most slothful and indolent of all the Ministers in this slothful </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Government. For that reason at least the criticism which has been heaped upon him- the demands for Sinclair to resign, to get out- is certainly well deserved. </para>
          <para>It reflects, of course, on the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that he should have allowed this situation to continue. The Minister for Primary Industry was clearly not applying himself to the job for which he is responsible. The Minister for Primary Industry has been talking about establishing this Corporation since October last year. On Friday of last week the Bill finally appeared in the House of Representatives. In an attempt to get the Minister off the hook, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S.</inline> A. J. Fletcher the  President  of the National Country Party in Western Australia is playing the Country Party's old game of blaming its Liberal Party allies for everything that is unpopular and everything that goes wrong. I cannot understand how members of the Liberal Party continue to tolerate this treachery by their minority so-called coalition allies. The  President  of the National Country Party in Western Australia said that the Federal Government's controversial decisions should be blamed on Federal Liberal members of Parliament. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fletcher,</inline> people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> who preceded me in this debate are the people to blame for the inadequacies of this Bill which a Country Party Minister for Primary Industry has introduced. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fletcher</inline> said:   . . producers should recognise who were the real villains. </para>
          <para class="block">He went on to identify the real villains as the 4 Western Australian Liberal Party members of the backbench rural committee. </para>

              <para>- An honourable senator has asked me to say something in detail about the Bill. All of my remarks are highly relevant to the Bill. I would like to mention one other point. As well as the humbugs, charlatans and poseurs of the Country Party, there are some so-called independent or rebellious senators in the Liberal Party who have been muttering, albeit not quite so openly or so brazenly as the Country Party, about their alleged opposition to the legislation and their sympathy with the producer groups who have been pressing for changes. There is one particular so-called rebel or rebellious Liberal Party senator who has been giving a sympathetic hearing in private to the producer groups who have been complaining. I want to place on record that that particular pseudorebellious Liberal, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin,</inline> has ducked out of the Senate today- </para>

          <para>Let me read part of the legislation to the Senate to demonstrate the slothful way in which it has been prepared and is being presented. It is an insult to the Parliament. Clause 6, which is to be found in Part II of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Bill, reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is established by this section a Corporation by the name of the Australian <inline font-style="italic">M-eat</inline> and Live-stock Corporation. </para>

          <para class="block">So, it is reasonably clear to this stage that the Corporation Bill will be established and that its members will be nominated by, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> a producer consultative group. That begs the question: What is the producer consultative group? Clause 41, which is to be found in Part VI of the Bill, reads: </para>

          <para>There suddenly everything stops. We do not have the faintest idea of the manner in which these consultative groups, these components of the Meat and Live-stock Corporation, will be elected. The voting entitlement of the persons who form these consultative groups is not stated; their method of election is not stated. So, we are given no idea whatsoever about these matters. The Corporation itself will comprise members of these consultative groups, plus a government employee. Their names will be submitted by the consultative groups, which exist in name only. They just do not exist in reality; they exist only because this Bill asserts that they exist. I suppose that eventually even the present Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> might get around to doing something to establish these groups. What will be the voting entitlement? How will the elections for the consultative groups be conducted? Surely any government which wished to retain any shred of credibility would have worked these matters out and made a clear statement before having the audacity to introduce such a bill into the Parliament. </para>
          <para>The Opposition will press these questions again at the Committee stage. If the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> sees fit to answer the questions- that would be a substantial improvement on his preformance over the last few days- I ask him, in fact, I challenge him to tell us, before this so-called House of review passes yet another Bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives only last Thursday, who will be entitled to vote and what will be the method of election.

Again I sympathise with them in the acute embarrassment inflicted upon them by their treacherous National Country Party colleagues who say: 'Do not blame the National Country Party Minister for Primary Industry for this dreadful Bill; blame the Liberal Party in general, and in particular the 4 Western Australian Liberal Party back benchers on the Rural CommitteeSenator Thomas, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bungey, Mr Hyde</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Drummond</inline> '. I wish to dissociate myself from the libel of those 4 people committed by the  President  of the National Country Party in Western Australia. Whatever deficiencies those 4 people may have, they all have a far better grasp of this matter, and of every other matter, than any National Country Party politician I can name off the cuff. Certainly, they have devoted more attention to this matter and have a far better grasp of it than has the Minister for Primary Industry. </para>

Either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> should be replaced as Minister for Primary Industry- sacked as Minister for Primary Industry- as producer groups all over Australia have been demanding for several months, or at least he should be sacked as Leader of the House. The record demonstrates so clearly that, however well he may be performing as Leader of the House- I think he is quite skilful in that position- he is not discharging adequately his duties as Minister for Primary Industry. The final responsibility for that untenable situation clearly rests with the Prime Minister himself. </para>

            <para>- I support the Bills. Because of the need for brevity in what we say on this occasion, I shall not spend much time talking about the most recent contribution from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh.</inline> Perhaps I will spend one minute on it- and maybe even that is more than it deserves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> seems to be intent on suggesting that there is a rift in the coalition and that the division may be seen clearly in what happened during the development of this legislation. I emphasise that the legislation that is before us today is the result of the combined Parties and the combined </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Government committee. It is the result of examination by the joint Party room. It has the approval of both those bodies. There is no indication at all, and never has been, that there is any sort of problem relating to it that is referable to the Parties comprising this Government. </para>
          <para>As usual <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> seems to take objection to the Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> in the performance of his duties in this Parliament. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is capable of looking after himself, even against the attacks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh.</inline> He certainly would be one of the most highly regarded members of the Government in this country so there is really no need for me to say more than that in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair. Senator Walsh</inline> asked, among other things: 'Who will be entitled to vote? Why is this not written into the legislation?' Of course the formation of the consultative group is still being discussed and there is still a measure of disunity among the industry organisations. When the final decision is made on who shall vote and how, it will be written into the Act. I think that is a proper and responsible attitude to take. </para>
          <para>This legislation is the result of a long and continuing period, running into a considerable number of months, of discussions between the organisations, their representatives and this Government, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> in particular. The situation has about it a measure of irony because in the course of those months there was an insistence that there was a real urgency to bring this Corporation into operation. Indeed from time to time the Minister has been accused of procrastination. Yet now that the legislation has been finalised-not that it cannot be improved in the passage of time; most pieces of legislation can be improved in the passage of time- and it has been brought to fruition before this session ends, the criticism, only in some quarters now, is that it has been done too quickly. It is pretty difficult when first we are accused of procrastinating, and then when the goods are produced it is suggested that we have produced them too quickly. One of the problems that has been inherent in this whole procedure and one of the unfortunate circumstances is that there has been present real and distinguishable disunity among the producer organisations. I hope that in the course of the next few months there will be a much greater measure of unity because the ultimate survival of every individual in the rural industry is dependent on unity between the organisations that represent them. </para>
          <para>The purpose of this legislation is to form a corporation to take the place of the Australian Meat Board. There was an urgency in the request from most of the producer organisations around Australia that this should be a matter of high priority. The corporation that has been produced is, I believe, a proper and responsible compromise and a base upon which can be built the ultimate solutions of an industry in Australia which has been suffering extremely bad times in recent years. Of course we have to recognise that the mere establishment of this corporation, even though it may be- and I believe it will be- an extremely effective body, will not of itself be the solution to the massive problems that confront the Australian beef industry. </para>
          <para>Statutory control in Australia is nothing new in the marketing of beef or meat for export. It has existed since 1935, with the exception, of the years 1943-46. There was a restructuring of the Meat Board in 1946 and 1964 and some minor changes took place in 1 969. Statutory control has been part and parcel of the export of beef in this country for all those years. </para>
          <para>The industry has come through some extraordinarily difficult years. What happened in those years in some sense reminds us of the disastrous wool situation which in 1 970 led to the establishment of the Australian Wool Commission which was the prelude to the Australian Wool Corporation. The Corporation was virtually the saviour of the wool industry of this country. As a result of those disastrous times, vast numbers of Australian producers sought to save themselvesand who would not do this- by moving from a wool industry into a beef industry that looked more hopeful. They did so at extreme cost. We saw them selling their sheep at about 50c a head and purchasing cattle at $ 1 20 a head. These were the sorts of circumstances that resulted in the wrong sort of country being used in the cattle industry. In many instances this added to the difficulties. The difficulties were added to by sources outside the control of this country. In 1973 and 1974 there was a cattle boom and it was followed by a tragic slump. This was associated with the loss of the United Kingdom market upon its entry into the European Economic Community. This slump was added to by the problem of the energy crisis around the world which denied some of our major markets sufficient funds to enter into the market for beef cattle. These are the sorts of tragic and, in some measure, uncontrollable factors that have created the problems in the beef industry and which are the reason for the state the industry is in today. </para>
          <para>This Corporation is the first realistic attempt to give us a structural base from which the industry may climb into new markets, into new methods and into new presentation. I believe it is an effective and proper base. I believe that when the great mass of Australian producers sit down and divorce themselves from emotionalism and look at the thing from a realistic and reasonable point of view, they will agree that it is a proper and useful base. </para>
          <para>In the confines of a minute or two, may I just refer to the composition of the Corporation. This is almost the only point on which there is much real disunity at this time. Indeed, the composition of the Corporation has been accepted by a very significant number of producer organisations. As time goes by, I am sure that the Corporation's performance will gain it a far wider acceptance. Four members out of the 9 members of the Corporation are to be producers. This at least is a very significant involvement. It is a 45 per cent involvement, if put in statistical terms. But it is more than that because within the legislation there is a provision which states that there will be no quorum of the Corporation unless a producer is present. So this is another area in which there is a real measure of producer control. </para>
          <para>Basically, I believe it is important that there be maximum involvement but it has to be within a structure that recognises that the beef industry and the meat industry are vertically integrated industries. One cannot look totally at the base, at the beginning, at the production of livestock in terms other than as it relates to ultimate consumption. There has to be recognition of this sort of progress. This sort of structure, whilst giving the producer a very significant involvement, in fact by far the most significant involvement, also recognises the importance of the exporter, the importance of the man with special qualifications. Surely- I believe most reasonable producers would agree with me- in the long term the survival and the development of this industry is basically dependent on the expertise that represents and promotes it. </para>
          <para>I believe that this legislation does not give undue control to the Minister. In fact, he will have less control over the new Corporation than he has had over the Australian Meat Board. In certain areas it is essential to have some measure of control. In every area of control the Minister has to realise that whatever control he exerts is published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> and published in the annual report of the Corporation. This means that the measure of responsibility that lies with the Minister is quite enormous. It seems strange to me that one could think that Ministers are so unrealistic that they would not recognise that responsibility. We hope and believe that this Corporation will represent a responsible compromise in a situation that has to be remedied. It represents a proper base. The efficacy of this Corporation will depend largely now upon the industry getting behind it. Any legislation in the last resort is effective only insofar as it is recognised and promoted by the people it is meant to defend. I support the Corporation and the Bills that are being considered cognately in this debate. </para>

            <para>- It has often been said that farmers as a group are conservative. I believe that to be a truism. It has been said of farmers in the industry in which I was engaged for years that one could push them face down in the mud and they would not kick but once one put one 's foot on the back of their necks they might start to do something. I think that is a truism also. The great debate relative to the beef industry that has been carried on around the Commonwealth in recent times has shown that when conditions are bad, given the right leadership and the right circumstances, Australian farmers can become very militant. That is the situation as I have perceived it in recent months. In all the rural areas to which one has been able to go groups of farmers are talking politics, being prepared to put their jobs on the line, to shoot stock and to take actions that they have never taken in years past to bring to the attention of this Parliament and the people of Australia the dire circumstances in which they and their industry find themselves at this point of time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Make no mistake, there is a need for a vigorous, dynamic meat and livestock corporation to take some control and to play some role in the marketing and exporting of Australian meat. Whether the Corporation that will be established under this Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill will be dynamic enough perhaps only time will tell. For myself, I am somewhat sceptical. I am particularly perturbed by the amount of control the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> is contemplating exercising over the Corporation. Surely to goodness any Minister should act as we saw the previous Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> act when he established corporations. He had confidence in the men he appointed to those corporations and from then on played a hands off policy. That is the way it should be. If there are not sufficient people in Australia to control and run a corporation of this size and type then all Australians should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. I believe the men are there and the Minister should get out of the field and leave it to the people who know something about it. </para>
          <para>One of the things that has concerned me for a number of years has been the control of our meat industry by exporters. The supplement that has been presented with the Australian Meat Board report each year lists some 248 companies with licences to export meat. 1 think that that is a luxury that the livestock industry could well do without. There are 248 companies which have export licences. I have explained to the Senate on other occasions the situation that prevails when an overseas company wishes to buy meat in Australia and the role that such companies play. They play one of these 248 exporting companies off against another and knock down the prices- in the same way as the Japanese knocked down prices for our minerals prior to Rex Connor becoming a Minister in the Labor Government. The end result is a depleted price which is reflected in the saleyards in the following week, month or 12 months. The farmers of Australia are the losers. As far as I am concerned, there is no requirement for 248 companies to have licences to export meat. I hope that the Bill will give to the Corporation sufficient teeth to allow it to go alone if required. 1 hope that it will not be subject to pressures from overseas buyers but will act in the interests of the Australian beef producer. </para>
          <para>I should like briefly to deal with one other matter. If one message is coming through very loud and very clear in the rural areas of Australia at the present time, it is the feelings of the livestock producers vis-a-vis the auction system. It is easy as a member of Parliament to become somewhat alienated from one's traditional environment. I have to admit that about 3 months ago I visited my local sale yards for the first time in about 3 years. All of a sudden, I realised what a lucky dip, what a raffle, the auction system is. I sat there for a couple of hours and watched cattle of the same style, the same type and the same conformation go through the selling yards and saw the price vary from $40 to $50 a head. I was made painfully aware of the loss the producers are suffering because of the way in which the saleyards are run. It is something at which everybody, I think, should look. If they realised the way that cattle are handled under the current auction system in Australia, they would realise that there is a great loss to this community. Cattle are prodded, poked, belted, chased, dogged, flogged and knocked down. I am sure that if the same treatment was given to pet dogs or to pet cats the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals would come down with a very heavy hand on the people involved. </para>

I believe that the next lead that should be taken by the cattle producers of Australia is to get away from the auction system and to establish some form of classification for meat. They should take action similar to action taken by their counterparts in New Zealand which has been successful for years. </para>

            <para>- I regret that having taken 12 months to put my story together I will have to deliver it in 10 minutes. I am rather disappointed. I should like to raise a couple of points with respect to this legislation. No witness which the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce interviewed said at any stage that the Government should keep out of the area of control of the meat industry. No one said that controls were not necessary. I am not upset by the degree of authority that has been vested in the Minister in this legislation in the areas specified. I should like to draw attention to a table that was produced in the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I seek leave to have this table incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

              <para>- It appeared in the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 3 1 May 1977. In view of the way that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> complained about the powers of the Minister, I was rather surprised to find that in the amendments that he circulated it is proposed that a new clause 9A would give about five times more power to the Minister than presently proposed.

              <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was talking about various provisions of the Bill. The next one on which I should like to comment concerns the numerical strength of the bodies to comprise the membership of the Corporation. I fully support the proposal to have 4 producer representatives. I believe that there is ample security and safety in the Bill for the producers. I must say that I believe that if the producers are represented by 4 of the 9 members and they are unable to sway one more member to gain a majority, I would have to think that the proposition they were putting forward may lack some strength in itself. I can honestly say that I believe that to change the Bill in this respect at this stage would not give the producer members any more strength and that I think it would only weaken the potential to have another man with more expertise on the Corporation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I have endeavoured to judge all the schemes that have been raised with me by various people from sections of the community who have shown an interest in the Bill on the basis of whether they are likely to bring more money in the system for the producers. Of all the schemes that I have heard put forward on representation, the directions of the Minister for Primary Industry and so on, I have not seen one that would tend to make any more money available to the industry. I think the best advice I can give to the people who are concerned about the Bill is that they should bear in mind that such schemes must produce more money before they would be an improvement. With the Corporation being set up in the way in which it is proposed it is certainly going to throw a lot more responsibility on the producer to ensure that they get the people on whom they can count on the Corporation. </para>
          <para>It has been said in the past that the members of the Australian Meat Board have not reported back satisfactorily and so on. I do not blame any particular group for this. I know that it is a fact and I know that this is the opportunity to change the situation. The quality of the people elected to the Corporation will be of paramount importance. But I cannot see how it would have made any difference to a lot of the fundamental issues that were raised in the past if there had been 4, 6 or 66 producer members of the Australian Meat Board. If representation by a majority of producer members would fix it we would not be here today discussing the Bill. It gets back to a matter of expertise and having the best people possible. I am particularly grateful to the Minister for including the appeal provisions as to both licensing and trading in clauses 12 (4) and 13 (4). I have had very strenuous representations from my home State on this matter. The group which did this work is to be congratulated on the presentation it made and the fact that we have been able to have these clauses included in the Bill. I regard them as being most valuable inclusions. </para>
          <para>Classification is being talked about. I should like to say that classification is to me a most necessary tool in the marketing of meat, but I suggest that people should not pin all their hopes on it solving their problems. There is no way that classification will either solve the problems or add one dollar to meat marketing in Australia. It will rearrange the meat marketing and in the longer term it will certainly improve the situation. I noticed that one of the leaders of the farming community- I think he was from Victoriastated the other day that meat classification would solve all the ills. It certainly would not and I would not like it to be thought that at any stage it would be likely to do so. </para>
          <para>The marketing of meat is where the real issue arises. This is where the expertise is particularly needed. In this regard I saw a comment by one of our major customer countries, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> a few weeks ago, that I thought was an absolute classic in careful marketing. I would like to refer to it at this stage. The Japanese Ambassador was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of 7 May as saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I cannot say and do not even know whether the coming quota will be the same, more or less than the previous one. But the tonnage will definitely fall within one of these 3 options. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Our biggest hope for the future lies in Japan, even having regard to that sort of inscrutable comment. I think that probably the biggest single task that I see before the proposed Corporation is the need to get more co-operation between the Japanese Government and the Japanese industry. If we can get a better inlet into Japan at a reasonable marketable price I think that many of the other problems that we see today will suddenly disappear. </para>
          <para>I would like to deal with a couple of other matters very quickly. One is disease eradication. We are considering disease eradication legislation cognately with other meat industry legislation. I do not think the way in which we are dealing with this group of Bills does justice to the disease eradication Bills. I cannot stress too strongly or place too highly the importance of disease eradication. I do not think enough is being done in this area by the States and by the Federal Government. I do not think that the producers sufficiently understand the significance of the problem. I urge the Government to expand the disease eradication program in every way possible and to try to achieve a disease free situation by about 1 98 1 or 1 982 at the latest. The longer disease is not eradicated the more expensive this problem will become. It is horrible to think of the advantage other cattle producing countries will have in a market situation if we do not eliminate the risk of disease. I ask the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> and the Government to think very seriously about this matter and to take the necessary action. </para>
          <para>Another matter I raise concerns livestock exports. I believe that currently meat is our fifth largest export earner and that export income from livestock is still very small. We need countries to develop a taste for meat, and we can meet that demand by exporting livestock. A very excellent investigation recently completed by the Department of Overseas Trade sets out the position. I would have liked to have referred to some figures from this work but time does not permit me to do so. This is an area on which I believe the <inline font-style="italic">o</inline> new Corporation could spend a great deal of time. I believe that we could go a long way towards improving the position if the producers of Australia considered exporting livestock as an alternative to selling meat. Of course, we would need to get a little co-operation from men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr 0</inline> 'Toole in Melbourne. </para>
          <para>I thank the Tasmanian producers and processors for the relationship that I have been able to establish with them over the last 12 months. Representatives of both the Tasmanian Farmers Federation and the Tasmanian Farmers, Stockowners and Orchardists Association have been terrifically co-operative. I appreciate the manner in which we have been able to have regular discussions. The Meat Exporters Association of Tasmania has also been very cooperative. I am proud to say that I know of no other State that could compare with Tasmania in the co-operation that exists between sections of the industry. They have all worked together. They have met together. Recently they even formed a consortium to achieve better shipping arrangements into Tasmania. Action of this sort has done wonders for the producers. As a result Tasmanian livestock producers have received the highest prices this year of any State in Australia. </para>
          <para>In conclusion I would ask 2 questions of the Minister for Veterans Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> for consideration. I asked these questions of the Minister for Primary Industry earlier. I now formally ask them in this place. First, would the Minister be prepared to place the points in question under some sort of surveillance or reconsideration in 12 months time so that we can then see whether any problem has arisen in any of the heated areas? Secondly, would the Minister preclude nominations of people with special qualifications if they came from either producer or processor representatives or would they be acceptable if their special qualifications were good enough? </para>

We know, as - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> pointed out, that the first opportunity members of the Opposition had to look at the legislation was on Thursday of last week when it was introduced in the other place. I note &lt;nhat when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> was speaking he did refer to the fact that the joint coalition Parties had given long and serious consideration to the legislation.

But as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair's</inline> office has confirmed, not one of those members knew until Wednesday of last week what were the contents of the legislation. My complaint and the complaint of other members of the Opposition has been that we did not have time. I had to rush around here last Friday to get some copies of the legislation to send it out to the people who were interested in it so that I could get their reaction and some comment. But it was impossible to do this because if we sent the information out over the weekend we could not get a response before it was debated in the House of Representatives. </para>

              <para>- They are very disenchanted, as I will mention later. In conversation with them, they expressed their utmost disgust that this legislation should be railroaded through this Parliament when they were not aware of the contents of the legislation. They were most bitter about it. I think the Labor Party would have won a lot of friends amongst these people. I was able to point out to them that the Labor Party's resources committee was not able to consider the legislation until we called a special meeting on Monday at 10 a.m. to have a look at the legislation. So much for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> saying that long and careful consideration had been given to the legislation! If he is correct in what he says, I must say that communications between the Country Party and the people who normally vote Country Party in New South Wales are sadly lacking because none of those people who were at Parliament House yesterday had any communications or had had any discussions with their Country Party representatives in both Houses of this Parliament as to what the legislation was all about. We now find that because these organisations have not been given the opportunity to study the legislation they have said that they are contemplating taking legal action against the legislation when it is passed. I have no doubt that they will. In the same article by Michael Byrnes it is also reported: </para>

          <para>If honourable senators opposite who have some misgivings about the legislation are sincere in their efforts to have it deferred, I suggest that all they need to do is to vote for the Opposition's first amendment to the Bill, as that automatically defers the legislation because we know that the House of Representatives is not sitting. The legislation automatically will be deferred until the Budget session. That will give the primary producers, particularly the beef producers, ample time to have consultations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> in an effort to resolve some of their problems. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline> when speaking to this legislation was very critical of one of the amendments which will be moved by the Opposition during the Committee stage. He referred to new clause 9A which the Opposition is proposing to have inserted in the Bill. It reads as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Minister may give directions to the Corporation concerning the performance of the functions and the exercise of the powers and the Corporation shall comply with those directions. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline>went on to say that if that amendment was agreed to we would be giving the Minister some outlandish powers, that he would be able to do all sorts of things with the legislation. I want to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline> that the clause we are suggesting is exactly the same as section 1 8( 1 ) of the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act of 1974 which was approved by the National Country Party. What we are proposing, that in day to day matters the Corporation can act without first going to the Minister for approval, applies to the Wheat Board. In objecting to this amendment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline> is doing the very opposite of what the producers want. As the Bill stands, the Corporation members will first have to go to the Minister before they can take any action. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer's</inline> argument mean that the Liberal and National Country Parties now want to change the wheat industry stabilisation legislation as well? I doubt very much that they do, because an amendment to the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act was assented to on 3 May last year and there was no provision in that amendment to delete section 18(1) of the Act. On the one hand Liberal and National Country Party senators opposite, and particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer,</inline> have no complaints about that particular clause being in the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act, yet when it is put forward as an amendment to tidy up this piece of slip-shod legislation, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> referred to it, they say in criticism that we are giving undue power to the Minister. Quite the reverse will be the case. </para>
          <para>I do not intend to speak for much longer but I want to refer to one thing, that is, the attitude taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> some months ago, an attitude which was quite opposite to the attitude he takes towards the trade union movement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 7 March as saying that he wanted the cattlemen to withhold their stock from market to boost prices. Under a Canberra dateline it says: </para>

          <para class="block">This is always a danger when primary produce has to be marketed under an auction system. The importance and the necessity of having some orderly marketing system of beef in this country is so evident. Until we get it, not only the graziers who produce beef but also the graziers who produce fat lambs will have to run the gauntlet of groups of people getting together in the auction yard and buying as a cartel, with one man buying for the lot and then splitting up the spoils after the auction. This is why the farmers will always be at a disadvantage until we get a proper system of marketing of their produce. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It has been claimed by this person that one of the people engaged in these massive mark-ups of prices in Japan is a ranch owner near Brisbane. We as members of Parliament and the beef industry itself ought to be making some very extensive inquiries to find out who this person is. I do not know who he is, but in the interests of the beef producers of this nation we ought to be looking at the matter and trying to find out who he is. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Yokota</inline> has pointed out, there is a massive mark-up in beef prices between the point of sale before the cattle are processed in Australia and the time when the meat goes over the counter in the butchers ' shops in Japan to the consumers. If that continues, how are we going to assist the beef industry in this country when our commodities overseas are so dear? It has often been said by honourable senators opposite that the greatest problem faced by primary producers in this country is the high wage cost involved in producing any commodity. In view of that article, nobody could claim that the Australian work force is responsible for increasing the price of beef by 15 times between its sale in Australia and its sale in Japan. There are people who do not do any work except with their brains who are manipulating the market, and as a result the beef producer in Australia is suffering. </para>
          <para>If this Bill is amended in the way the Opposition wishes it to be amended, the industry itself will have some control over its own product. It is for that reason that I say to honourable senators opposite that it is very important that they agree to the amendments we have put <inline font-style="italic">forward.</inline> If they do agree to them, I venture to say that they will save a lot of problems for their Country Party colleagues, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> might be one of them. They will save many problems in the pre-selection ballots that will take place because the beef producers who came to Canberra yesterday are most emphatic that action will be taken if the Government does not move now to protect their interests. Honourable senators opposite always claim that they protect their interests. I say to them that here is an opportunity to do so. If honourable senators opposite support the amendment moved by the Opposition they will be showing clearly by their actions that they support the interests of the beef producers of this country. </para>

          <para>It is most unfortunate in these very bad times for the beef industry that there is so much disunity. Unity should be the order of the day. A united industry could come to the Government and say: 'This is what we want because it will get us out of our trouble'. Unfortunately, this has not happened. We have had faction fighting ever since the introduction of the legislation was suggested and it has been almost impossible to sort out the morass. I congratulate the Minister and those responsible for bringing in this Bill for at least being able to get something that is supported by most of the producers and which at least deals with the problems that the beef producers have put to the Government. The present situation is not unusual. This case has a parallel with the wool industry. The history of the matter goes back to 1 95 1 when we tried to institute marketing reform in the wool indistry. The faction fighting in the industry prevented that from taking place for 20 years. Eventually it was forced on the industry and now the Australian Wool Corporation is acting in the interests of the wool industry. We do not hear much criticism of the Corporation these days. It is doing its job. </para>
          <para>The interesting point is that 2 people can take most of the credit for getting the wool industry out of its problems. One of them was a paint salesman. I do not want to denigrate <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Vines but that is what he was before he came to the wool industry. The other man, Alf Maiden, was a public servant. They were not wool producers. The fact is that they applied themselves. They had the expertise. They were brilliant people. They applied themselves to doing something for the industry. They were not fettered in their actions by having to report back to a multitude of people who were not <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with the facts but who had all the ideas in the world. These 2 gentlemen did not have to face the situation that if they did not do what certain people wanted they would get the sack. No organisation can run on that basis. </para>
          <para>It is regrettable that the wool producers, having accepted marketing reform and the floor price scheme, are paying 5 per cent of their gross returns a year into the scheme at a time when they can ill afford it. Had they accepted the scheme prior to 1 95 1 the additional tax paid in that year would have financed the whole scheme, not to mention the losses that have occurred in the interim period. This is the problem that we have today with this particular legislation. This Bill is not as controversial as has been made out by a lot of people. It is just an excuse for the warring factions within the industry to try to gain control of the rank and file. The interesting thing, of course, concerning all the requirements that have been made publicly throughout the Press and elsewhere about what they want to do to Sinclair, what they want to do to this Bill, is that when we talk to those leaders quietly and say, All right, let us get down to basic facts', they say, No, there is not very much difference between us'. But, of course, they have lit the fires back in the bush in order to try to get the support of the rank and file of their organisations. Consequently, they must appear publicly to be out in front leading. </para>

              <para>- I have had a great deal of experience with primary industry organisations. Once we get these things finalised the dust settles and everything is all right again. To give honourable senators a typical example of the emotional outbursts that have been made, I have received-as, I would say, many other members and senators concerned with the beef industry in the various States have received- letters from rank and file people, members of our respective parties, from back in the bush, not from Canberra or from union leaders. They have been writing us letters and telling us how serious the position is. One can almost read between the lines that the difference between prosperity and ruin depends on one person on the Meat Corporation. In other words, if there are 4 members on the Meat Corporation, the producers will be faced with ruin; if there are five members, everything will be all right. This, of course, is what the leaders of some organisations have told these people. This is the big issue. They say that there must be producer control. But when we talk to those particular leaders here in Canberra, they change ground. They say: 'Oh, no. That is not the problem now. We do not want producer control '. But they forget to tell the boys back in the bush. This is the silly situation in which we find ourselves. </para>

          <para>The Government has done a lot of ground work on this matter. It has been going on for 12 months. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> said: 'The producers do not know what is going on.' Every producer organisation months ago was given an outline of what the Bill may contain so that they could send back their reports or criticise it or do what they liked to it. This has been going on for 6 months. That is why all the protests were held last week and the week before. The Cattlemen's Union representatives have come here saying that they want producer control of the Board. They say that the corporation that the Government is putting forward does not have producer control. They have all known the intent of the Bill for months. Probably if the Government had not told them what was in the Bill there would not be all the shemozzle that is going on now, but the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has been determined to try to get some sort of unity within the industry. After all, it is the industry which must eventually live with the legislation. It is in their interests and therefore they should know what is best for them. </para>
          <para>All that the Government has been trying to do for 12 months is to find out exactly what the industry believes is best for it. As I said before, this has happened to nearly every primary producing organisation or industry in which we have had to try to introduce marketing reform. All I can say, in the limited time that is available- it is unfortunate that on important legislation such as this we are limited in time- is that the sooner we pass this legislation and get on with the job of looking after the interests of the producers and let the warring factions go back to the bush and fight it out in the scrub, the better it will be for this nation and particularly for the beef producers. The next step I would like to see is that once this corporation is set up and it can handle those particular areas where there is Federal responsibility, the Commonwealth should then take a lead in endeavouring to get the States to agree on some form of classification. We can then have some form of minimum price arrangement or encourage some sort of minimum price so that we do not have this situation which occurs today where there is an over-supply of beef. When there is an over-supply of beef in the auction system, the producer is the one who will always suffer. We do not need minimum price provisions when there is an undersupply because the demand is there. If there is an undersupply, the price will go up. That is the situation at the moment. Because of the auction system which the producers have always wanted to retain we have this problem. I think that the sooner we pass this legislation after the 18 months it has taken to get it to this stage the better. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I thank Opposition senators and other honourable senators who have spoken for their support of this legislation and for the great economy in the length of speeches. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> hit the nail on the head when he said a few minutes ago that the main thing to do was to get the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation on the statute book, get it working and not spend time in this Parliament debating it further. There has been criticism of the Government by some Opposition speakers for the haste with which this Bill is being put through the Senate today. The fact is that the Government has had under review this whole question of meat marketing for 12 months. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> circulated in September last year his first proposals for reform which ultimately led to this legislation. He and certainly the Party committee on this side of the chamber have received and considered a great many submissionsI think the Minister received about 200- and there has been ample opportunity for consideration of the views of others on this legislation. </para>

              <para>asked me 2 questions which I would like to answer before I close this debate. He asked whether the Minister would reconsider the contentious issues in this legislation in, say, 12 months time. The Government, the Minister and the Department of Primary Industry will at all times be keeping the operation of this new Corporation and its associated bodies under surveillance. That is their responsibility, and it is one which this Government will certainly discharge. The Minister has said already that he will consider amendments to some areas of the legislation, particularly concerning consultative groups. He has circulated proposals for the constitution of and election to consultative groups. They are now being debated and there may be subsequent legislation in regard to those matters. However, I fully expect the Minister to be prepared to consider amendments to any aspect of the legislation which may in operation seem desirable. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline>also asked me whether the Minister would accept nominations from producers or processors for the positions on the Corporation for members with special qualifications. The legislation requires the Minister to consult with producer and processor groups before making these appointments and the appointment of the  Chairman.  The Minister already has said, and I say on his behalf today, that he is prepared to accept nominations for these positions from producer and processor groups. I hope that these Bills can now have a speedy passage. </para>

Perhaps the easiest way to deal with them would be to take the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Bill first as there are amendments to be moved to it and then to take the other 5 Bills together.

          <para class="block">The essential difference between the amendment and the clause as it appears in the Bill is that under the amendment the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation would be able to extend its activities within Australia as distinct from being restricted only to export activities. This matter was debated during the second reading stage by honourable senators on the Opposition side. We believe, as was indicated then, that the Corporation should be given this power. It is wrong and quite false to suggest that the Corporation should be restricted in its commercial judgment. It is imperative that if the Corporation is to be successful in its trading activities, it ought to be able to make this commercial judgment and not be inhibited by the clause as it stands now. </para>

          <para class="block">The principle is the same as I have just indicated. I might say, in response to the reply of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> on the previous amendment, that it is simple to say that we cannot take this action because the States will not let us. The whole purpose of so much of the activities of marketing, especially with the revamping and restructuring of these marketing boards in Australia, is to give a lead at the national level and let the national aspects of the industries prevail. Therefore, the Federal Government ought to give that lead. Simply because these amendments may be written into the Bill does not mean that the States would never agree to co-operate. I do not believe that. Irrespective of the political colour of individual State governments, if they could see that by allowing the Corporation to trade within Australia the industry would benefit in that it would stimulate markets or consumption or new products, I am sure they would accept a Commonwealth statutory body taking such action. I suspect, as I said earlier, that certain private interests in the meat industry do not want this provision written in, simply because they are afraid that a little more competition from a Commonwealth statutory organisation would not be to their liking. I suggest that this is the real reason for the Government rejecting it. </para>

            <para>- The Government is <inline font-style="italic">not prepared to</inline> accept this amendment. As I understand it, its effect would be that the Corporation is charged with the responsibility of acting in accordance with ordinary commercial practice. The Bill recognises that in certain circumstances there may be some special arrangements which the Corporation wished to enter into. Usually this would involve agreements with other governments or government trading corporations. Some of the terms of these agreements may be outside ordinary commercial practice but for which there may be justification. In that case, the Minister's approval is required and that is the purpose of this clause. </para>

          <para class="block">As we have indicated before, we agree that final authority should be with the Minister. Our argument is not with that final power but with the manner in which the power is exercised. This proposed new clause does not mean that a Minister would interfere with the daily commercial judgments of the Corporation in relation to every contract that it entered into or every initiative that it took, but it does- and quite rightly- give the Minister final authority to protect the interests of the Commonwealth in matters involving policy, financial commitments which the Commonwealth may have entered into, underwriting of borrowings and so on. We do not argue with that. We believe that this is the proper way in which the Minister's direction should be expressed in the Bill and not as it appears, and as it has already been accepted, in clause 4. So I assume that the Minister intends to reject this one as well. </para>

              <para>- The primary producers want a Corporation which is independent of ministerial direction. Indeed, I thought that the Opposition was criticising the fact that there is too much ministerial control. It is really an argument about how much ministerial control there should be. The Bill has been drawn up in such a way as to limit ministerial control to certain specific cases:We have already seen a notable example of that in a previous clause which the Committee has agreed to. Indeed, it is rather surprising to find the clause which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> now proposes in the terms that it is, because it would mean- although he says it is to operate only in a very general way- that the Minister could give directions to the Corporation in regard to matters of commercial practice. Yet the Opposition and others have complained about the way in which the provision in regard to ministerial power has been worded in the clause which we debated previously. That provision limits the Minister's powers to deal only with those occasions when the Corporation might want to operate outside ordinary commercial practice. So it seems to me that the proposal which now seeks to insert this clause is really a contradiction; it is certainly a contradiction of the whole basis of the Minister's relations with the Corporation, which has been adopted by the Government and which is included in the provisions of this Bill. Accordingly,, the Government is opposed to the amendment. </para>

          <para class="block">This amendment clarifies further the point I was making earlier. Clause 14 deals with contracts for the shipment of meat and livestock. Contrary to what the Minister has just said in answer to the previous amendment, the distinction is that the amendment I have just moved seeks to give the  Minister overriding power which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> quite rightly pointed out, is identical to the ministerial power that is contained in the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren's</inline> question was a good one: If such power is not suitable in this legislation, why does it remain in the wheat industry legislation?

              <para>-Perhaps we will get one later. What we in the Opposition are concerned about is that the Minister should not exercise ministerial interference with the commercial activities of the Corporation. This is what leads me to suspect that the Minister's handling of this whole matter has been very poor, to say the least. There is no reason why the producers in the meat industry should be as stirred up as they are about ministerial control. People in other major rural industries have been subjected to similar legislation and they have accepted the benefits that have flowed to them. But, all of a sudden, we have a near revolution by meat producers in this country because of the way this legislation has been handled. We are not suggesting for one moment that the Minister ought to be able to interfere. If the Minister appoints the right peoplenot hacks of the National Country Party or any other party- to the Corporation, he need have no fears about them exercising their own commercial judgment; but obviously that is not what is intended. In conformity with previous amendments, I move my amendment to this clause. </para>

            <para>- The Government is undertaking a review of Australia's overseas cargo shipping legislation. The power conferred by clause 14 has been included in this legislation pursuant to that review and its likely outcome. The Government believes that various marketing authorities which are entering into freight contracts for the carriage of commodities overseas should not be competing with one another but that there should be a rationalisation of their arrangements and that there should be arrangements with the shipping lines to ensure that as far as possible the most effective use of space on the ships for all types of commodity exports is obtained. It is for the purpose of that general oversight of these export arrangements, in the interests of trying to minimise freight costs, that this power is included. This power will be exercised by the Minister in consultation and co-operation with the Minister for Transport. For those reasons the Government cannot accept this amendment. </para>

            <para>-The main purpose of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill it to alter the Health Insurance Act to prevent or to attempt to prevent the abuses of the Health insurance system in this country as a result of the excessive use of pathology services and fraudulent claims by a few pathologists. Incidentally, the Bill also increases the penalties for the so-called kick-back system being used by some unscrupulous pathology laboratories. The Government and the Opposition both agree that the level of increased use of pathology services and the associated abuse has been alarming. Despite the limitations in benefits paid for pathology tests last year, there has been little change in this increase in expenditure on this item. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The situation in pathology is not the same as in other sections of medicine, with the exception of radiology, because the tests done by pathologists are ordered by other doctors. The pathologist himself rarely, if ever, has any contact with the patient directly. I believe that the argument we often hear in this place and outside this place about the delicate doctor-patient relationship which can only be maintained by the fee for service system just does not apply to pathology. The patient has no way of knowing what tests have been done and why those tests have been done. The whole connection is a doctor to doctor one and the patient cannot be blamed for any overuse and abuse of the pathology system. </para>
          <para>The situation in regard to pathology and the problem we face in this country- it is also faced in other countries- is a complex one. I believe it is a combination of over-use and abuse. The background to over-use of pathology tests and pathology facilities is a multifaceted one. Medicine has become more scientific and the facilities of science which are used by doctors have become more readily available to all doctors in the community. The tedious, time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive tests and methods of biochemistry and haematology which were used in the past have been replaced by kits and multi-channel analysers which can do many thousands of tests as easily as they can do one test. </para>
          <para>This sort of modern increase in efficiency and facilities does not only apply to pathology, as I shall show later. There is a tendency, and it has been apparent for some time, to do a barrage of tests without thinking rather than to do a select number of tests based on probabilities and on clinical findings in medicine. It is my belief that this tendency has been aggravated by the type of medical education we have today and which we have had for some years. It is scientifically orientated; it is test orientated. It is done in general by a hand-picked upper group of people from our education system in which, in my opinion, scientific methods and values are sometimes overemphasised and the personal approach, the clinical approach, is frequently under-emphasised. </para>
          <para>Students do all their training in teaching hospitals. Most doctors do a couple of years after-training in teaching hospitals where tests are done not always to detect disease but as part of a routine, or sometimes, and quite properly, even as part of scientific investigations. I am not suggesting there is anything improper about this but it does create a tendency for people to become very reliant on tests of all types, particularly in pathology. This sort of approach to medicine has been facilitated by those modern methods of analysis which have been of enormous benefit to mankind. But they have made life very difficult for some of the health insurance people and those who fund health care in any country- in fact, that is all of us. </para>
          <para>I might add, the computerised, impersonal approach is intruding into other fields. The so-called CAT scanner- the computerised axial tomogram scanner- which is a radiological tool of enormous benefit to mankind and of great value both to doctors and patients, is now being introduced into Australia. Of course, it has been used in the United States for some time. There it has been the subject of much controversy because of the ease with which it can be abused and over-used. One reads articles in the New England Journal of Medicine which refer to CAT fever, the excessive use of this important diagnostic tool. One reads that a general practice in Sydney has ordered one of those scanners to be installed in the practice. The equipment costs some $750,000. One wonders about a general practice having a specialised tool like this and whether it is not the prelude to the problems that have been experienced in that very field in America. I believe, therefore, that it may be very difficult for the Government to avoid passing legislation like this in other areas, particularly in radiology, in the future. </para>
          <para>The problem of abuse is simpler. Unhappily, there are a few avaricious people involved in medical practice and associated with medical practitioners, as there are in every other field of endeavour. These people set up rackets and schemes to rip off the consumers, the taxpayers and the health funds. These rackets in general consist of charging for tests that in fact are not done, performing tests that are not ordered or. by various means, ordering tests that are unnecessary. They consist also of paying kickbacks to doctors who therefore are encouraged to use those services or, more frequently, over-use those services. All sorts of methods of kickbacks to various medical practices have been detected, such as cash payments, <inline font-style="italic">overseas</inline> trips, fur coats, payments to staff, supply of goods or services to staff and even automobiles. Also, some peoplebusinessmen, entrepreneurs and doctors- set up health studios and multi-screening services and lure patients to their organisations, which are paid for by the medical health insurance systems. These people are crooks. They are dishonest. They have abused the system for many yearsbefore the advent of Medibank and probably before the advent of any health insurance. They should be charged and penalised as any other dishonest people are. They are doing more than just taking advantage of the system. </para>
          <para>My concern, and the Opposition's concern, about the changes invoked by this legislation is that they may not be as successful as the Government expects. No matter what arguments there may be for fee for service in other areas of medicine, I do not believe those arguments apply in pathology. Abuse in the pathology system is easy. It is so open to abuse because of a lack of knowledge of what is going on by the patient. In fact, a patient frequently just has blood taken at a doctor's surgery, it is sent off in a bottle to a pathologist and that is as much contact as the patient has with the pathology laboratory. </para>

              <para>-I certainly would. I realise, as I think everyone in the medical profession realises, that this sort of thing has to come. I think I agree with the Government, although I am not certain, that the abolition of bulk billing which is proposed in this legislation for everyone except pensioners who are eligible for bulk billing could well cut down over-use and some abuse in the field of pathological testing. But I have no evidence for that and I do not believe the Government has any such evidence, although I believe it wishes it did have. We might be able to obtain some evidence when comparisons between those health funds which bulk bill and those which do not are available from the figures produced by the health funds. I think it is of some concern that we do not have the figures yet. I realise that the Government had to act before those figures were available, but I believe that they should be available now. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It was interesting to note that in the debate in this chamber last year when the changes were made to Medibank I predicted that the private funds would not be able to produce figures of their membership and their transactions by April this year, as was hoped. From my knowledge and from the knowledge of others, their methods of accounting and their methods of filing in the past have been such that we believe it would be a great job for them to produce these figures. As the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> said, these figures were supposed to be available in April. They are not here in May. He believes they will be available about August. I hope that when the figures come out we may have some idea of what difference the abolition of bulk billing makes to pathology. </para>
          <para>I hope the Government does not intend to abolish bulk billing in other areas. In other areas of pathology bulk billing has been of some advantage to many people. The tendency in pathology has not been for pathologists to charge people before the tests were done. I believe the abolition of bulk billing in other areas may be of disadvantage to patients and certainly would be of great disadvantage so far as administrative costs to the various health funds are concerned. I hope that the additional administrative costs which the abolition of bulk billing will undoubtedly cause to Medibank and those health insurance funds which do bulk bill, are outweighed and counterbalanced by the gains from the prevention of over-use which the Government hopes will result from this legislation. </para>
          <para>There is only one matter contained in the Bill which I want to deal with in detail. I will deal with it now rather than take up time during the Committee stage. I refer to the problem that the committees of review which will examine excessive services will face, even with the new provisions related to procedural measures for requesting and performing pathological tests which are being introduced. I am aware that lawyers and parliamentary draftsmen need to use language in Bills which is, in general, obscure to mere mortals like myself and most other people in the Parliament. The definition of 'excessive services ' given at page 1 3 of this Bill seems to me to be so broad as to be almost ludicrous, especially when, so far as I can see, the investigations may take place as a rule more than two or three years after the service has been performed. The Bill states:   a reference to excessive services is a reference to professional services, being services in respect of which medical benefit has become or may become payable . . . </para>
          <para>I understand that. It continues:  that are not reasonably necessary Tor the adequate medical care of the patient concerned . . . </para>
          <para class="block">What 'reasonably necessary' means and what is adequate medical care would seem to most of us, I suggest, to be difficult to define. It would be difficult to define if the investigation was being conducted after the event-after the patient has either recovered or not recovered. I suppose it is difficult to make strict definitions in areas like this. How services will be proved to be excessive on that sort of definition is, I suggest, very difficult. </para>
          <para>Medical costs in this country and every other country are presenting problems. They are high; they are increasing; they are escalating. New techniques, computerised methods and the more efficient methodology used in medicine today have not had the effect of decreasing costs as they have in almost all other fields of endeavour. The medical profession traditionally has been conservative and has been reluctant to have anything to do with investigations or any efforts by government to control medical costs or to create more economic efficiency in their profession. I am pleased because I believe that this attitude is changing. The profession certainly is more willing to look at new ideas of control, regulation and economic rationality and their effect, with the exception, I suppose, of the General Practitioners' Society in Australia. Most other practitioner groups are willing to look at the situation. They realise that they cannot go on in the way in which they are going at present. </para>
          <para>As I said before, I have some doubts about the effectiveness of this legislation because I believe that the lurk merchants in pathology still will be able to get around this sort of legislation. I believe that they will be able to do that because the fee for service situation does not work in an area like pathology when the person who is being paid to do tests-the pathologist- in fact does not do the tests, although he is responsible for the results. The situation has changed so much from the days when it was a very personalised service, when it was a very personal thing for the pathologist or the technicians immediately below him to do the tests. I believe that the system provided for by this Bill may make it a little more difficult for people to abuse the system and to over use the system, but I do not believe the patients will be able to regulate their own pathology tests any more than they can now. They will still not understand the nature of the tests and the necessity or otherwise for those tests. </para>
          <para>We do not oppose this legislation because we realise that something has to be done. We have grave doubts about how effective the legislation will be in achieving its aim, but it is better than nothing under the present circumstances. I believe that a combination of control or regulation, if you like, by government and restraint by the profession will be necessary in the future to alter the situation. I do not believe that legislation of this type will work while we have in pathology the system of fee for service for the most minor tests. In fact, the most minor tests are done by machines, although the pathologist who is paid for doing the tests is responsible for those machines. We support the legislation, with the doubts that I have expressed about its effectiveness. </para>

I hope that what I have to say will be taken into consideration by the committee of inquiry which is to be set up and which is referred to in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle).</inline> The Minister said: </para>

            <para>At present the Health Insurance Act provides for the establishment of medical services committees of inquiry, consisting of S medical practitioners, whose function it is to inquire into references to them by the Minister concerning the possible rendering of excessive professional services which attract medical benefits payable by Medibank. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I want to refer to that. I hope that when the inquiry is under way it will take into consideration what I have to say here, as has been referred to me by a doctor friend of mine. </para>
          <para>He wrote to me pointing out a problem experienced by a lady who is well known to him. He has set out the details. For reasons that will be obvious to everybody, I shall not mention the name of the lady in question. The doctor wrote to me about this lady, who developed a gall bladder complaint. She attended a local general practitioner who is a former  President  of the Australian Medical Association in South Australia and who happened to be a Liberal Party candidate for a short time. The doctor ordered an X-ray examination of the gall bladder. On receiving the X-ray films he told the lady that he wished to refer her to a particular surgeon, whom he named. She replied that she wished to be referred to the Flinders Medical Centre. The doctor told her that if she wanted to go there she would have to make her own arrangements, but  he gave her the name of a person to telephone at the Flinders Medical Centre. </para>
          <para>The lady rang the Centre and was told that she could have an appointment 2 weeks later. It is scarcely surprising that she was not given an earlier appointment. If a patient contacted a surgeon without any referral from a general practitioner, either by letter or a telephone call, the surgeon could hardly be expected to regard the matter as urgent. This lady felt so unwell that she went back to the doctor and surrendered, saying that in view of the delay at Flinders she was prepared to be referred to the surgeon of the doctor's choice, whereupon the doctor wrote a letter of referral to the private surgeon, contacted him by telephone and arranged a prompt consultation, following which she was admitted to hospital as a private patient and operated on. My doctor friend goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The concept of freedom of choice seems to have a remarkable meaning for some people. Apparently it means that you have a choice of specialist, provided you choose the same specialist as the one which the GP chooses for you. There could not have been a greater contrast between the doctor's attitude when the patient made her own choice and when she accepted the doctor's choice. If she was prepared to go to a particular doctor, the GP was prepared to do his professional duty, which was to ensure that his patient received the prompt specialist treatment which she needed. However, if the patient exercised her choice and chose going to the new Flinders Medical Centre as a public patient, the doctor was prepared neither to write nor to telephone. Whether the patient was seen in one week, one month or one year was of no interest to him at all; in other words, he refused to act in the interests of his patient's health. </para>
            <para>It is utterly despicable that a doctor should so intimidate a patient for political purposes. It is nothing less than a shameful dereliction of professional duty. </para>
            <para>The final irony was that the patient not only received an account which exceeded the medical benefit by $75, but also was charged for two additional consultations which were supposed to be covered by the operation fee. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The doctor commented on the lady's attitude and said that she:   . . does not dispute the right of the surgeon to charge what he sees fit, provided that patients have a choice of going elsewhere if they wish, rather than being blackmailed into going to a particular specialist. </para>
          <para>Of course not all doctors behave in this way. If a person wants to enter hospital as a public patient, probably most doctors will ensure that their patient gets prompt treatment if it is needed. But it is remarkable that the people who bleat loudest about freedom of choice will uphold that freedom only if a person chooses to be a private patient. </para>
          <para>I read quite recently of a doctor in a NSW country hospital who was about to operate on a child. The child had been given an anaesthetic when the doctor discovered that the patient was a Medibank patient, not a private patient; whereupon the child was woken up without the operation being performed. The doctor in this case was disciplined by the local hospital board, which barred him from future use of the hospital. </para>
          <para>I believe that this is the same son of thing as the Adelaide case which I have just described. There should be some protection for patients in this situation. </para>
          <para>In the first place there should be some sanction against doctors who wilfully neglect their duty. One of the fundamental features of Medibank is the guaranteed right to hospital treatment free of charge and free of means test. I question whether Medibank should make any benefits payable to any doctor who tries to deprive a patient of that right. And when a doctor, in denying that right, takes action deliberately detrimental to his patient's health, surely stronger sanctions are justified. </para>
          <para>Secondly, Medibank should employ consumer advocates who will advise and help people to get their rights under Medibank: that they are not forced to have expensive private treatment, or forced to pay cash in advance for consultations, or any other of the pressure tactics of the practitioners of market-place medicine. </para>
          <para>It is high time that the hypocrites who profess to uphold private practice in the 'interests of patients' were exposed, lt is quite obvious that where the interests of the doctor and of the patient are in conflict, some doctors will neglect those of the patient. </para>
          <para class="block">I am pleased to see that the legislation introduced by the Government - </para>

            <para>-The Government thanks the Opposition for its support on this legislation. I will refer to the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> the thoughtful comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> who spoke on behalf of the Opposition. As is understood, this Bill is one which was considered to be necessary because of the need for restraint on increasing medical benefits expenditure on pathology services. We recognise this to be a problem throughout the world but the expenditure figures in Australia led the Government to consider that it was essential to do something to control this expenditure. When we were looking at the figures for the half year in December 1974 we found that the figure was $22m whereas for the half year ended in 1976 the expenditure had risen to $53m. There are other matters in the Bill to which reference has not been made. These matters refer to increased penalties applying in relation to offences and other health program grants. The Government is grateful to the Opposition for its support in the speedy passage of this legislation at this stage of the session. </para>

            <para>- I am interested in 2 matters. I would like to say a few words on them. I notice that in clause 3 of the Bill the definition of 'approved pathology practitioner' is amended to include the Commonwealth. This has been an injustice for many years in my State. Private pathologists have had to compete against Commonwealth Health Laboratories in Hobart and Launceston which have provided these services completely free of charge. This resulted in the private pathologists in those States charging the medical benefit return only and as this in itself was lower than the refund in many of the mainland States, the injustice was multiplied. The position has now been corrected and the Commonwealth Health Laboratories must now charge a fee for service. So, there will be fair competition between the Laboratories and the private practitioners. This is a great step forward. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second matter to which I refer relates to proposed sub-section 4B (2). The Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> in her second reading speech, foreshadowed a new schedule of fees for pathology services. This is the first step in equalising the schedules of medical fees throughout Australia. As the schedules stand at present, the schedule fees in the smaller States are far lower than the schedule fees in the larger States. As the Medibank levy is a national levy and is the same for taxpayers in each State, it is a great injustice that patients in my State of Tasmania receive back from the national levy far less benefit than the patients in the larger States receive. I shall give 2 examples. The first example relates to a pathology service which is a sedimentation rate. The pathologist's schedule fee in New South Wales is $5.50 and the benefit to the patient is $4.70. The Tasmanian schedule fee is $3.50 and the benefit to the patient is $3. So, honourable senators can see how much less patients receive from the national levy. </para>

              <para>- They do not get exactly the same, as the honourable senator knows only too well. The cost of providing the service in pathology practice in Tasmania is far greater than that in the larger <inline font-style="italic">States.</inline> In Tasmania pathologists still have to have all the expensive equipment. It has to be available. But the quantity of services is so much less. This adds to the cost of each service. There is the same discrepancy in regard to most of the other specialist medical fees. For another medical service the schedule fee for the whole of New South Wales- that is country areas as well as the cities- is $ 1 60 and the benefit is $155. In Tasmania the specialist is allowed to charge as his schedule fee $1 10 and the patient gets back only $105. The benefit is $50 less. The same service with a general practitioner in New South Wales costs $120 and the benefit is $115. In Tasmania the fee is $95 and the benefit is $90. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There is no justification for these discrepancies, where in a smaller State the specialist schedule fee not only is less than the general practitioner fee but also is less than the benefit the patient of a general practitioner receives in respect of his schedule fee in the larger States. I ask honourable senators to remember that this situation applies to all country areas in New South Wales as well as to the capital city. The result is that specialists in the smaller States are charging more than the schedule fee and the patient who is paying the national Medibank levy has to pay the extra amount out of his own pocket. I am pleased to see that the Government has recognised these anomalies, even though this is only the first step in the equalisation process. </para>

            <para>- I wish to take a minute to comment on the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters.</inline> I have always agreed with her that it seems quite inequitable that fees in Tasmania should be so much lower than those on the mainland. I believe that the best and fairest solution to this problem is an upward movement in some fees in Tasmania and a downward movement in the outrageous fees charged in New South Wales and Victoria. This may give us some justice. But 1 would not like to give anyone the impression that I believe that Tasmanian fees should rise to the levels that exist in the large mainland cities. </para>

            <para>- I simply wish to follow up what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> has said. One point in this Bill which has not been recognised is that the recommendations came from a working party which included representatives of the medical profession, of pathologists and of governments. In fact, there is a general downward movement of fees in recognition of the structure that is associated with pathology. While there is an equalisation for Tasmania and other States, there is a reduction in the general fee level payable to pathologists. I think the medical profession can be proud that it has been able to co-operate with Government to work out a new structure and a new scale and to look at something which represents a slight downward movement in the overall fee levels. </para>

            <para>- in reply- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> referred to clause 3 and stated that it now includes the Commonwealth as an approved pathology provider. She mentioned the charging of fees and fair competition. I want to make it clear that I am unable to comment on that matter, as the charging of fees is a matter for Budget consideration by the Government. I just make that point at this stage. With regard to the other matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> which has some interest not only for Tasmania but also for other States, it is necessary to say, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> reminded us, that it was a working party which provided the background for the Government's decisions in these matters. The existing schedule fees contained components for overhead costs, appropriate when a lower number of pathology services were requested at the one time. The base period for the overhead component had been 1969. Since 1969 more pathology tests were requested for a patient at the one time, so the unit fee per test had to be reduced to bring the overheads component back to a reasonable level. This was particularly important in New South Wales where the increase in number of tests requested for a patient on the one occasion had increased more than in the other States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On the basis of claims for pathology services paid by Medibank in September 1976. statistics were obtained of the services requested for individual patients on the one occasion, and a total value of the medical benefits involved computed. In addition, the number of relative value units under the new pathology schedule, which was Appendix A of the report, was also computed. The amount of medical benefits in each State was then divided by the number of relative value units for that State to obtain an average amount of money per relative value unit. In conjunction with information obtained from several private pathology practices in several States the working party agreed to minimising the reduction in the States such as Western Australia and Tasmania and a large reduction for New South Wales. The figures finally adopted were adopted as a fair and reasonable basis for this purpose as the pathologists were not able so far to produce information relevant to the Department's approach of parity of practice costs and net incomes. However, the Royal College of Pathologists has been aware of this problem for several years, because of requests received from the Fees Bureau of the Australian Medical Association, and is currently pursuing the collection of such information from members of the College in each State. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to note the reductions made on a State by State basis and the reduction of disparity between the States. I have two short tables, the first of which shows the relationship of return to pathologists under proposed new schedule fees as compared with previous schedule fees, and the second showing the relativity as between the States of return to pathologists under proposed new schedule fees as compared with previous schedule fees. I seek leave to have those 2 tables incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para>-The Opposition does not oppose either of these Bills, and we have been totally consistent about that. We have not opposed on 2 previous occasions Bills which were designed to achieve a similar purpose, that is, to put off the proposals to resolve finally the problems of the stevedoring industry according to the Government's intentions. The effect of the main Bill is to extend the operation of the Stevedoring Industry Act until 1 January next year. The history of the matter is to some degree set out in the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> and includes an outline of the various conferences and discussions which have taken place, particularly the important conferences under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Robinson of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In indicating that the Opposition supports the Bills, I should say that there are one or two matters relating to the continued extension of this legislation which are of concern to employees of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. This is the third time since it was first decided that the Authority would be disposed of that the staff of the Authority have been faced with an extension of the life of the Authority. The staff have been inconvenienced considerably through the severe uncertainty relating to the closing date, and accordingly they are particularly concerned about a number of claims. One of those claims relates to increased severance payment of an extra week. A severance agreement has already been negotiated between the Government and the Authority's staff, but with the further extension and the inconvenience created thereby the staff now believe that they have the basis for a claim for a further week's payment, and I advise the Government that that is their attitude and intention regarding the matter. Furthermore, what remains of the staff of the Authority is being required to move between various ports to bridge gaps as they appear through retirement and as people leave to take over the jobs in other areas when the opportunity arises. </para>
          <para>The other matter of concern to the staff of the Authority is the question of the incentive bonus. </para>
          <para class="block">Since last November a bonus at the rate of 5 per cent has operated as a retention attraction for the Authority's staff. Those remaining on the staff of the Authority now seek an increase in this bonus as the basis for remaining with the Authority until the time for which the legislation is extended expires, and for whatever period the Authority is required to remain in existence and carry out its duties. The staff pointed out that the basis of calculation of the severance payment is different from that on which furlough entitlement is calculated. For furlough entitlement the Authority's staff can count as service all service with all other government departments and statutory authorities, not just service with the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. However, for the purpose of calculating severance pay, service is confined to service with the Authority. Again, that is a matter of concern to the staff. I have referred the Senate to these matters so that they are on the record of the Parliament, having regard to the fact that this is the third time these provisions have been extended by legislation of this kind, frequently in circumstances such as today in the dying hours of a session of the Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> those are the matters which I wish to record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and of which I wish to inform the Senate. Apart from them, we do not offer substantive opposition to this legislation at this time. </para>

            <para>-The circumstances that give rise to the request for extension of time in this matter are very regrettable. It should have been brought to a solution before June of last year, much less remain unresolved in June of this year and drag on. lt should be noted that despite massive redundancy arranged in the industry to provide for the setting up of some new arrangement idle time is still occurring in the industry and for the first 10 months of the year it cost $ 1 3m. I think that the grand total for last year was $14m and the previous highest total was $8m. But I rose to point out two facts which do not lead one to think that the solution of the matter is very clear yet. We have had placed before us what is called the Kirby report. It is the report upon a conference of the interested parties that was conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Kirby in order to examine certain conditions of new proposals. I want to draw attention to one specific matter in the report which demands urgent consideration. It is stated on page 70 of the report: </para>

The result is that instead of employment being weekly employment, it is weekly employment at the instance of the employee but it is lifetime employment that is not capable of being terminated by the employer until the employee is aged 65 years. So the waterside workers have established, if they succeed in that claim, lifetime employment on the waterfront. </para>

          <para class="block">The cases referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> are not the golden handshake that he implies. Some of the men who are going out under this redundancy program are men in their early fifties, perhaps in their middle fifties. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that some of them have spent 20 or 30 years on the waterfront. Quite a lot of them have permanent limps from foot injuries. Others are missing a joint or two in their fingers. It is not as if these men are going into seclusion in a very easy life because the redundancy money involvedwith all deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright-</inline> is not that much when we consider some of the retirement programs of people higher up on the wage and salary scale. I think a nod is as good as a wink for the appropriate estimates committee to know what I am talking about. </para>
          <para>I want to emphasise the fact that attempts have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Robinson and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Kirby to try to take the heat out of the situation. Of course there must be an outlay of a fair expenditure of money for the phasing out of bodies from a work unit. But the fact of the matter is that ultimately, when that stage is reached, there will be a smaller work force. One of the great problems, no matter what our theories may be on this world in which we live, is that technical changes produce devices and units to take the place of the manual operatives. Governments then have the problem of finding alternative employment for them. It is true that many of these men in their middle or late fifties will take part time work. Some may not work. If they do not work, I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that if these men in their fifties have worked long hours to pay off a home and if they have given 30 years of their life in summer and winter, this is well and good. The point about this quite clearly is that it is a lesson in conciliation. As each year goes by containerisation requires fewer manual operatives. I say that the worker should share in that particular saving. </para>
          <para>The only other point I want to make to the Minister for Veteran's Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack),</inline> and it is important, concerns the liquor trades union which covers the staff in the Sydney waterfront canteens. Those canteens are now part of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. I have had verbal assurances, on and off, that whatever happens under this new structure, the jobs of those employed in the canteens will not be affected. I know it is sometimes a fragile area, but I would like some indication from the Minister that when discussions in relation to the dismantling of the old stevedoring authority come to fruition he will ensure that the job security of canteen employees is not affected. I know that my opponent, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> is aware of the efficiency and culinary ability of the chefs in at least one of these canteens. He knows that they have given good service. I would like an assurance from the Minister that the future employment of these people is not in jeopardy. </para>

            <para>-This Bill has been introduced for the purpose of providing funds to the States so that roadworks can be continued for the first 3 months of the next financial year. Later in this debate- I will not speak for very long- I want to point out that this is an area that could be further used to absorb the unemployed, the position of which, according to what I can find out from the latest figures, has not improved. The amount that has been allocated is one-quarter of that set out for the next financial year which is part of the next triennium. The Bill is a short one, and the Opposition does not oppose it. However we take this opportunity to offer some criticism of certain clauses of it. Perhaps the major criticism is that this Bill was not introduced until 31 May. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> is not even in Australia. Again, as I complained 2 days ago, the Opposition has not been given time in which to consider properly the Bill before having to discuss it in the Parliament. I hope that when the Budget session starts the Government will take some note of the fact that we have complained several times in this session about the short time given to consider Bills. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill provides only temporary financial arrangements for road funding. There is clear evidence now of the Government's continuing decision not to produce the sort of federal funding and initiate operations in the field of transport that we were told would happen when the Government was campaigning in 1975. I deal now with another fairly important point of criticism. It is obvious from the Bill and the telex advice sent to the States in the last few days setting out principles to be followed by the major road funding legislation to be introduced in the Budget session- I understand that will probably come in some time about September- that progressive concept of an integrated national transport budget has been abandoned. I do not know whether the Government will undertake further planning in regard to transport but quite obviously it has not done so to date. </para>
          <para>The Minister's announcement of 25 February this year indicated that $475m would be made available in 1977-78 to the States over the range of categories of road construction and maintenance. The amount of $1 18.5m provided in this Bill will meet the need for the first 3 months. This amount, as I have mentioned earlier, is a quarter of $475 m. Let me put into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the record the way the money is to be apportioned. New South Wales will get $38.45m; Victoria will get $24.725m; Queensland will get $25m; South Australia will get $ 10. lm; Western Australia will get $ 15.05m, and Tasmania will get $5.425m. The Commonwealth and States officers' committee has been established to develop arrangements for an integrated transport budget but under the Government nothing very worth while has happened in this regard. </para>
          <para>A second Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting was held in Hobart on 25 February this year to resume discussions on future road funding. While the Council was meeting was rather contemptuous on the part of the Minister and was done without the knowledge of the States- a statement setting out the details of the $475m was released. At the ATAC meeting in Hobart some considerable disquiet was expressed because the States felt that the action taken was rather insulting and that they ought to have been told about it. It appears that the Minister's decision was a unilateral one. He released that statement while the Council was still sitting. A third ATAC meeting was held to enable the States- this was a week later- to put a case for reconsideration of their claims and the amount of $475m announced by the Minister. But this meeting also broke up in some disarray. Obviously if the Minister is to take this sort of action it will not bring about harmonious relations with the States. Maybe we are getting used to seeing federalism introduced in a whole different number of categories. </para>
          <para>Let me briefly set out in the following terms, facts and figures the broader aspects of road expenditure. In Australia there are about 9 times as many miles of road per head of population as there are in the United Kingdom and 3 times as many as there are in the United States. In Australia there are about 2 2 ¼ times as many miles of railway tracks per head of population as there are in the United Kingdom and about twice as many as there are in the United States. The impact of this is highlighted when we recall that the population of the United States is about 15 times that of Australia. Hence the importance of ensuring that transport investment expenditure is used in a rational, responsible and efficient manner. We will not achieve this until such time as there is a national policy on transport. We do not appear to have anything faintly resembling it at the moment. More recently the need to ensure energy conservation further emphasised the need to have a national approach to transport, an approach that should and could be developed in a co-operative way with the States and by way of consultation. If we are to achieve this we need goodwill on the part of the Commonwealth Government and co-operation from the States. </para>
          <para>Transport services are responsible for approximately 27 per cent of our total energy consumption. Of that 27 per cent a major shareapproximately 56 per cent- is used by various forms of road transport. That refers to both commercial and private vehicles. Quite recently a Minister in this Government and a back bench supporter of the Government in the other place said that there ought to be energy conservation and that this was part and parcel of the whole transport program. In the Press release to which I referred earlier the Minister pointed out that the </para>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth appropriation for 1978-79 and for 1979-80 would be maintained at a real level at least equal to the $475m which was already announced for the next financial year. </para>
          <para>I do not know why the Government persists with burying its head in the sand and claiming that there is no inflation rate. Forward planning in a lot of areas, including transport, indicates that the Government will not make any provision for what the future will bring if the inflation rate continues to rise as it is at the moment or, at least, remains at a very high level. The reduction in real terms could be as high as 10 per cent and certainly not less than 7 per cent. That is looking into only the immediate future. If inflation continues to rise, as is likely, it could be as high as 1 6 per cent or 1 7 per cent. The States reacted with some political violence. One of the more conservative Premiers of Australia, not the Premier of my home State incidentally but the Premier of Western Australia, stated his reaction to the announcement about the allocation of $475 m. He accused the Federal Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> of juggling road figures and said that he had adopted a carping, critical attitude over road funds. For the benefit of honourable members on the other side of the chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> also said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is time that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> and some of the Western Australian Federal members of Parliament realised that Western Australia has urgent road needs and will continue to fight for more road funds, and fight hard. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The point I am making is that the States are less than satisfied. It is not a case of whingeing by State Premiers as somebody on the other side of the Chamber said the other day. </para>
          <para>The figures I quoted relating road and rail length in this country to its population highlight the need for a forward planned transport policy. The Labor Government previously recognised the importance of an integrated transport budget and the establishment of co-operative planning procedures. Whilst we do not oppose this legislation I feel that there are a number of points I ought to make in order to get the Government thinking, at least, that it can make more money available in the forthcoming financial year. I hope this will be taken into consideration when the Budget is planned. I have a few figures which deal with the number of unemployed persons. I understand that they are the latest figures available for comparison. In 1974-75, 248 064 people were unemployed- 4. 18 per cent of the work force. In 1975-76, 259 905 people were unemployed- 4.35 per cent of the work force. In 1976-77, 321 183 people were unemployed-5.2 per cent of the work force. This is an increase of approximately 63 000 people unemployed in the space of 12 months under this Government's policies. </para>
          <para>We were told in November 1975 that unemployment would be reduced immediately. It has not been reduced; it has continued to climb. I doubt if the 321 183 people who are now registered as unemployed would consider themselves a myth- a story which the Government has been attempting to create. Unemployment is not a myth. Because many aspects of road construction are labour intensive, it is an area of activity in which the unemployed could be absorbed if more money were made available. The latest figures indicate a drop in the rate of unemployment of only 0.6 per cent compared with the figures for the previous month. It must be sad for many people to see that sort of figure released at this time of the year. It compares dismally with the drop of 3.4 per cent in the unemployment rate in 1976 and 6.5 per cent in 1975, that being the largest drop in the unemployment rate of any year. The lowest unemployment figures were for May 1975, and that was the time when Labor was still in office. As I mentioned at the outset of this debate, the Labor Party does not oppose the Bill. </para>

            <para>- in reply- The State Grants (Roads Interim Assistance) Bill 1977 is purely an interim measure. Its aim is to provide finance for the first quarter of the financial year 1977-78 at the rate at which the money is earmarked for the year; that is, one quarter of $475m, or $1 18.75m. The Bill simply provides a bridging device in finance, pending the introduction in the Budget session- presumably in September- of a very comprehensive piece of legislation dealing not only with the year 1977-78 but also with the triennium and foreshadowing the whole pattern of government spending in the various categories. Therefore the legislation is to be viewed in that light. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government, since returning to office, has concentrated its full attention to holding discussions with the States through the Australian Transport Advisory Council, consistent with the federalism approach. The States have been allowed full opportunity to comment on these matters, and Parliament will have a major opportunity to debate them in September. So that the Parliament will understand the level of funds provided, I point out that in the triennium 1974-75 to 1976-77 an amount of $ 1,233m was spent. The Commonwealth Government, for the 3 years 1977-78 to 1979-80, envisages spending, in real terms, $ 1,425m at least. The ATAC Press release contained mention of the proposed allocation of $475m, and the State Ministers were advised by letter handed to them at the same time that their proposals would be discussed. In fact, the proposals they put forward were taken up by the Minister and looked at firmly. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline>commented on the idea of integrated transport legislation and said that it has not been introduced.

In fact, the new legislation to be introduced in September will contain provision for co-operative planning by the States, which will be available for adoption by the States if they so wish. I commend the legislation to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. It deals mainly with procedural and administrative matters. It repeals the Defence Service Homes Corporation Act 1976. It also provides for amendments to the Defence Services Homes Act 1 9 1 8 to enable the defence service homes scheme to be administered under the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The Bill provides that the staff employed under the Defence Service Homes Corporation Act will be employed under the Public Service Act. Until this Bill becomes an Act of the Parliament, of course, the Corporation's staff will be employed as statutory authority staff. A Defence Service Homes Trust Account is to be established for the payment of the Corporation's capital and interest payments. It will be subject to government audit. The Corporation's administrative funding will be appropriated through the Department of Veterans ' Affairs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I suggest that it is a pity that a Bill of this nature, along with a number of others, has to be dealt with so expeditiously this afternoon. Normally, this Bill would have given the Parliament an opportunity to debate a very controversial matter- the provision of defence service homes. Because this Bill is only a procedural or machinery Bill, as I have said, the Opposition does not oppose it. Therefore we give it a speedy passage. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition opposes this legislation. It is my intention to move the following amendment at the end of my speech in this second reading debate: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>At end of motion, add- but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for (a) the establishment of an independent statutory Legal Aid Commission to finance, co-ordinate and provide legal assistance in Australia, and (b) the provision of such funds as are necessary to meet the needs of legal aid in Australia '. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is now a quarter to five on the day on which this parliamentary sessional period is scheduled to end, and at this stage the Government brings before the Senate very important legislation such as this. I have foreshadowed an amendment in a particular form, but at the outset I indicate the Opposition's strongest objection to the abuse of the Parliament by bringing most important legislation of this kind before us at this stage. This is not the first time that has happened this week. For weeks and weeks at the beginning of this year the Senate debated such things as the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. People even had a second go in the Address-in-Reply debate to fill in time so that the Senate could continue working and feel relevant. But at this time on this day an important piece of legislation is being brought on for debate, just as yesterday a very important piece of legislation relating to trade practices was brought on for debate and the day before a very important piece of legislation relating to conciliation and arbitration was brought on in this way. All these are matters of vital concern in fields in which this Parliament could be said to have achieved something positive, whether or not we like the particular legislation once it is passed. All that legislation is being rushed through in the course of this week. </para>
          <para>I refer the Senate to an editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of yesterday referring to the specific Bill now before us. It is headed: 'Blitzkrieg Legislation '. The editorial deals with the provisions of this important legal aid Bill. The second part of the editorial is headed: 'Senate needs to act'. During this year we have heard a lot from so-called rebellious senators on the other side of the chamber- rebellious about apples and pears, pretty insignificant referenda and things of that kind. But today for the first time the Senate has been called on by a major newspaper to act in respect of a particular piece of legislation. I wish to read the section of that editorial headed: 'Senate needs to act'. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Some of the 'safeguards' proposed in the Bill are less than convincing: former Federal public servants are not guaranteed equal rights within the State commissions and the criteria for their read mission to the Commonwealth Service seem unnecessarily narrow. In fairness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> has vowed on a number of occasions to seek the States' cooperation in providing such safeguards. On the other hand, his approaches so far to Western Australia, one of the two States to legislate to set up a local commission, have met with a lack of any meaningful response. </para>
            <para>Questions of honest dealing and courtesy aside, there are many points on which the Bill can be faulted. A strong case cun bc made that legal aid is to a sufficiently large extent a welfare, as distinct from a narrowly legal, issue that the preponderance of lawyers on the proposed commission is inappropriate. Moreover, the Australian Government Lawyers Association is on strong ground when it protests at the destruction of a national career structure for lawyers with a commitment to legal aid. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The editorial then goes on to deal with some further issues in the Bill. Then it states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Given the Government's commitment to its 'federalist' dogma, it is nevertheless difficult to understand why the Government is unwilling to entertain the intelligent compromise suggested by the unions- and accepted by the South Australian Attorney-General-to staff the autonomous State commissions from the Federal Public Service, so retaining the advantages of a unified career structure. A strong case can be made that legal-aid authorities should be enabled to stand back from the local interests of State legal establishments. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> by contrast, advocates a system calculated to subjugate Commonwealth-financed legal aid to just those establishments. Too many questions are raised by the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill to permit its passage at this time. If the Senate is in any shape or form - </para>

          </quote>
          <para>The word 'form' probably refers to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan-</inline> the 'House of Review' it proclaims itself, it will defer action on the measure at least until the Budget session. </para>
          <para>I read that portion of the editorial because it relates to many of the matters which concern the Opposition in relation to this legislation. The editorial is quite consistent with the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> then shadow Attorney-General, when the Labor Government introduced the Legal Aid Bill in October 1975. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> said this: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The Opposition believes that a joint committee of both Houses should consider the important legal, social and constitutional issues involved. </para>
            <para>It is time . . . that we acted as a Parliament on a matter like this. It is time that we legislated on the basis of an inquiry into the important issues involved. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Admittedly this Government's Bill is more of a dismantling kind than the sort of legislation which was being discussed in October 1975. But there are still very important issues involved which are of concern to thousands of recipients of legal aid throughout this country, to people working in legal aid and to organisations such as that representing the officers employed by the Australian Legal Aid Office. </para>
          <para>One point made by the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> editorial to which I have referred was that the question of legal aid involves important questions of social issues and important questions of welfare in addition to narrow legal questions. The Bill before the Senate suggests a Commission which one anticipates would be staffed, according to the arrangements for appointment and so on, largely by members of the legal profession. I should like to make a point about the relevant clause in the Bill. The Opposition would like to see included in that clause of the Bill some reference to the interests of other than one representative of the Australian Council of Social Services, to the interests of consumers, as it were, of legal aid. We also want to see included on the Commission some representation from lawyers who are experienced in legal aid and who, if I may use an old-fashioned term, are 'dedicated' in the field of legal aid. There are plenty of those about as a result of the activities which arose from the establishment of legal aid services by the Labor Government in the last months of its period of office. </para>
          <para>We think that there are too many important issues of that kind which cannot be dealt with adequately in the time available to this Senate. We think that those issues should be stood over and considered in the redrafting of the proposed legislation which is suggested in the amendment I foreshadowed. There are two or three points in our proposed amendment. They establish, in a sense, the essence of our criticisms of the Bill. The first point is that the Bill should provide for the establishment of an independent statutory legal aid commission to finance, co-ordinate and provide legal assistance in Australia. The second point is that the Bill should provide for the provision of funds by the Commonwealth Government as are necessary to meet the needs of legal aid in Australia. Those essential criteria are missing from this legislation. We regard them as fundamental to the development of legal aid as an aspect of welfare services in this country because we happen to believe that access to lawyers in many senses is as important to citizens of this country as access to doctors, though perhaps not as pressing from time to time. But in terms of fundamental rights and in terms of fundamental concepts of equality of opportunity and so on, we believe that access to legal aid is as important as access to medical services. </para>
          <para>Today many honourable senators will have received telegrams from bodies such as the Australian Conservation Foundation asking that amendments be introduced in relation to this legislation so that legal aid will be available to participants in environmental law issues. I believe that nobody in the Senate has had time to consider that aspect of this legislation. It might be thought by a Minister who is mindful of those questions that they are matters which should be considered by a committee of this Senate or which should be reconsidered by the Government. We know, of course, that the Government has made certain arrangements with the States. Some of the States are probably satisfied with those arrangements; others are not. Nonetheless, we regard it as an abdication of the responsibility of this Parliament to consider this matter adequately, having regard to the time and the date on which this legislation was introduced into the Senate. </para>
          <para>The Bill establishes a commission but gives no guarantee in relation to its independence. It certainly gives no guarantees in relation to the level of funding which will be available and which will be channelled through the Commission. The Legal Aid Commission will be given power to make recommendations to the Attorney-General concerning the provision of legal assistance in Commonwealth matters. From our point of view there is some difficulty in the use of words 'in Commonwealth matters'. Under the provisions of this Bill, it might well be that a person would be turned away and denied legal aid because he was not applying for legal aid in relation to proceedings under Federal law. Because of the sheer inadequacy of the legislation and the lack of time in which to study it all sorts of possibilities could be pointed out. </para>
          <para>I again want to emphasise the point, which was referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> editorial, that legal aid should not be seen just as part of the legal system but as part of the welfare system within a democratic society. We have no time to consider those issues here today. But, as I said before, the implicit conclusion which one can draw from the wording of the Bill is that the Commission will be dominated by legal practitioners. We suspect that the Government wants to avoid the Bill being subjected to public scrutiny. The public certainly would demand extensive and substantial amendments to it because the public sees legal aid not as a narrow legal issue but, to a very large extent, as a welfare issue. </para>
          <para>Following the quite recent announcement by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> of his intentions regarding this legislation, Professor Sackville, who was commissioned by the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty to prepare a paper on the provision of legal services, issued a Press release in which he criticised the Bill in the following terms, amongst others: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Bill politicises the service because the Commission's role, in effect, is limited to making recommendations to the Attorney-General, who retains final authority in relation to the funding of State legal aid commissions and the coordination of their activities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission has no power to grant funds directly to legal aid bodies. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That raises the question of what happens to bodies like the Fitzroy Legal Aid Service in Victoria, which is one of the most highly successful legal aid services in this country, I believe. We are concerned also about the fact that there could be an uneven level of delivery of legal aid services to Australian citizens because of the input, if one can put it in those terms, of State governments into their respective legal aid commissions. It is quite possible that if some State governments in terms of their welfare considerations were to give priority to legal aid and others did not we would arrive at a situation in which a built-in inequality of rights in relation to the capacity of people to obtain legal aid would operate throughout the Commonwealth. We believe that the Commission's lack of independence in regard to this will continue to contribute to the politicisation of legal aid. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General, in pursuing his Government's new brand of federalism, knows that the Government might eventually have to limit the real amounts of money that are made available by this Parliament for legal aid. That would be an abandonment of a commitment which this Parliament, without much dissent, accepted during the period of the Labor Government. Coupled with this, we believe that the Attorney-General wants to limit the effectiveness of the service. On reading the Bill, that seems to us to be the likely result. The legislation, of course, is a long way from what the then Opposition wanted when the original legislation was introduced and, in particular, is a long way from what the present Attorney-General wanted when he said on 9 April 1 975: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the Liberal-National Country Party Opposition-  takes the view that legal aid services should be provided in the most efficient, accountable and accessible form to those in need of it. </para>
          <para class="block">In April 1 975 the shadow Attorney-General, in discussing questions of legal aid, included a needs criterion in his speech when he said that legal aid should be provided in the most accessible form to those in need of it. That sort of criterion is completely lacking from this legislation. </para>

              <para>-Senator Wright, I would not assume otherwise. I know you are always here unless it is unavoidable. I began by saying that the Opposition was extremely concerned that important legislation such as this should be brought into the Parliament at the deathknock All sorts of community bodies are concerned about this legislation, and there should be an opportunity for public discussion of it. The LiberalNational Country Party Opposition in 1 975 saw fit to delay this legislation and suggested that it be referred to a joint committee of this Parliament because the issues involved were so important. The <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> yesterday called on the Senate to act to stop this son of behaviour of government rushing through important legislation on the last day of the sitting. </para>

            <para>-The Senate is debating a Bill to establish a Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission. This legislation is the first step towards putting legal aid on a sound and broad permanent base, embracing all the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. I should like brieflybecause of the time factor- to dismiss at once the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> because the worst thing it would do would be to postpone this desirable reform to establish legal aid on a comprehensive basis throughout the whole of the Commonwealth. It is an indication of the concern of the Government that legal aid should be adequate and available to the under-privileged people in the community and that it should be an efficient and comprehensive scheme. There will, of course, be a need for the close co-operation and active interest of the States. Legislation will have to be passed by each State Parliament to make the scheme fully effective. The States claim, not without some justification, that if we are to have an integrated scheme, a State legal aid commission set up by State legislation should control the day to day running of the system in each State. This Government, for its part, recognises this fact, which is consistent with its federalism policy. Of course, the Commonwealth has a limited field of operation, being restricted to legal aid in the Federal area. There is a firm commitment by the Commonwealth to provide funds for the provision of a State-type legal aid commission in the Federal area. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> is to be congratulated on his initiative in submitting this Bill. It is an indication of the Government's commitment both financially and in the area in which Federal legal aid is already provided through the Australian Legal Aid Office. It is estimated that the expenditure on legal aid services this financial year, excluding Aboriginal legal aid, which we all know is dealt with separately, will amount to $ 17.95m. As the Attorney-General pointed out in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives, that represents an increase of 43 per cent over and above the amount expended in the previous year. I think that the expenditure increase not only shows the concern of this Government in this area but also is a complete answer to those critics of the Government who are suggesting that in some way legal aid is to be terminated or disbanded by this Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. </para>
          <para>I turn now briefly to consider the scheme of the legislation and what it is designed to do. It is intended that each State commission will take over the existing legal aid offices and any State or law society scheme in that State. In my own State of Victoria the Law Institute of Victoria and the Bar Council have been active in supporting the Legal Aid Committee, which is a lawyers' scheme in that State. The legislation provides for the Commonwealth and each State to enter into a formal agreement under the terms of which the Commonwealth will provide funds for the provision of aid in the Federal area by the State legal aid commissions. The Attorney-General set out the complete framework of the Act in his second reading speech. I shall not do that again. He also stated that 2 States- Western Australia and South Australia- have already passed legislation in regard to this matter. </para>
          <para>Some concern has been expressed by the Australian Government Lawyers Association as to the future of its members following the passage of this Bill. Basically, the legislation preserves the right of the present employees of the Australian Legal Aid Office to salary, leave and superannuation entitlements. In general, the arrangements for their transfer to State and Territorial commissions will be on the basis of terms and conditions of service no less favourable than those that they presently enjoy. Indeed, I think it is true to say that this Bill goes as far as it can. There will be a legal agreement between the Commonwealth and each State which will set out the terms and conditions and will deal with the rights of the officers. The Commonwealth's financial commitment will not be forthcoming under the agreement if the position of the officers is not preserved. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General is seeking to have included in the State legislation provisions which will allow the legal aid commissions to make suitable reciprocal arrangements with each other for the transfer of staff. Similar provisions will be included in the ordinances of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. So as far as possible the promotion and career rights of the officers will be preserved. In the meantime, pending the adoption of legislation in each State and the provision of ordinances in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, there will be no change in the status or conditions of employment of the officers presently employed in the ALAO system. The Government is concerned to ensure that the rights of the officers are fully safeguarded. If the scheme is to operate with complete efficiency and to give services to the underprivileged of Australia, integration of the system with an overall supervisory Commonwealth commission and commissions set up under legislation in each State and the Territories is a vital necessity. As a practising lawyer for the last 30 years, I welcome the initiative of the Commonwealth Government in submitting this legislation to the Parliament and I commend the legislation to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">In the last few months a significant group of Government senators have made many dramatic and much publicised statements regarding the role of the Senate in our political system. They have stressed, for particular purposes, the role of the Senate as the House of review. They claimed during the recent referendums campaign that the independence of the Senate in its role as a House of review and other roles was being eroded by the referendum proposals put forward by the Government. It repeated the claim that the Senate is a States' House, it is different from the House of Representatives, it has a difficult role to play and that that role must not be tampered with or eroded in any way. It would seem that these statements, which were made by this significant group of Government senators, were in fact hollow and hypocritical. I make that claim because I would say that far from being a House of review the Senate in the last couple of weeks has not even been a mere duplication of the House of Representatives. The Senate has had less, not more, time to debate and consider the controversial and complex legislation that has come before it. </para>
          <para>The failure of the Senate to be able to act as a House of review or even a House in which reasonable debate can take place is clearly exemplified in the Government's handling of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill that is .before us. It has been introduced, as my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> pointed out, in the final stages of this session. It has been introduced with totally inadequate time being made available for discussion. It has been introduced in such an unsatisfactory form that the Opposition has had to move an amendment that it be withdrawn and redrafted. </para>
          <para>The legislation before us has 2 main functions. One is to disband the Australian Legal Office and the national legal aid service with the hope, not even the guarantee, that it will be replaced by 6 State and 2 territorial legal aid commissions. The second function of the Bill is to set up a legal aid commission which, to quote again from the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> editorial of yesterday 'will be nothing more than a watchdog advisory panel for the Attorney-General'. Why is it that the Government is not prepared to subject this legislation to public scrutiny. As has been pointed out, in 1975 when the Labor Government introduced a legal aid commission Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> who is now the Attorney-General, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard,</inline> who is now the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, asked that Labor's legal aid Bill be referred to a select committee. Why then will not the Government members and Government supporters allow the same consideration of their own Bill which has been introduced so speedily and in such unsatisfactory form? </para>
          <para>There are other questions I would like to put to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> who represents the Attorney-General in this place. How will the poor and needy get legal aid after the passage of this Bill which it appears the Government is determined to railroad through today? After this Bill is forced through, what will happen? Legal aid, according to this Bill, will be administered by State and territorial commissions. But as of now, as we debate this legislation now, there is no State or territorial commission. There is no functioning State legal aid commission in any State. There is no territorial commission in either of the Territories. </para>
          <para>Although Western Australia has passed legislation to set up a legal aid commission, that commission has not yet been established. Although I understand that the Attorney-General of Western Australia has been negotiating with the Federal Attorney-General for financial arrangements in order to fund legal aid through the West Australian State legal aid commission, no financial agreement has been reached. The same situation prevails in South Australia. It is now some months since the South Australian Parliament passed legislation to set up a South Australian legal aid commission. Yet, no financial arrangements have been made. There is no legal aid commission in South Australia. Queensland and Tasmania have not even begun negotiations. </para>
          <para>An ordinance has been drafted to set up a legal aid commission in the Australian Capital Territory. That ordinance is being discussed by interested members of the community and the legal profession. But again there are no funding arrangements. In the case of the Australian Capital Territory there is not even any executive or administrative body that could administer a territorial legal aid commission because we are still waiting on the Fraser Government to decide on the devolution of powers to a territorial assembly of the Australian Capital Territory. So the provision for legal aid to be administered through State and territorial commissions is premature. There are no such commissions; there are no funding arrangements. The passage of this Bill will mean nothing in terms of setting up, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> has claimed, a new system of funding and administering legal aid. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government Lawyers Association opposes the abolition of the national service. This is what will happen following the passage of this Bill. We on the Opposition side support the views of that Association in this matter. It seems to us highly unlikely that small separate legal salaried services in States and Territories will be able to attract lawyers of the same calibre as a national legal aid service has done. </para>

              <para>- Or of the dedication, as my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> points out. It seems to us too that there will be a reduction in expertise following the fragmentation of the national service. The kinds of cases that come before legal aid practitioners are of a special kind. They are usually cases in which the poor and the needy in our community are involved. A national service can evolve an expertise in those areas. But that expertise will be fragmented along with the administrative fragmentation of the legal aid services provided for in this legislation. Similarly, there will be a lack of mobility from State to State or from State to Territory for legal officers. At the moment, under a national scheme where a legal aid officer has a language specialty or expertise in a certain area, that officer could travel to Victoria from South Australia or to a Territory in order to participate in offering legal services where that specialty is needed. Such mobility is desirable; such mobility will be prevented by the setting up of 6 State and 2 Territorial services. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We also anticipate that there will be long delays in reaching agreements about the transfer of staff, although there is provision for the preservation of some rights of officers who are currently members of the national legal aid service. We anticipate that there will be delays and difficulties just as we anticipate very long delays in finally reaching financial agreements with the States and the Territories over funding matters. It seems to us that the ALAO is to be another victim of this Government's federalism policies and, more importantly, the people who are recipients of aid, the clients of the ALAO, are also to be the victims of federalism. </para>
          <para>At this stage I ask: What is the present Government's stance on legal aid? It was very clear under the Labor Government that there was a commitment to providing equality under the law; that there was a belief that equality under the law was an essential aspect of a democratic system. This same view is expressed by Ronald Sackville, the Commissioner who inquired into the law in relation to poverty and produced the report on legal aid. Commissioner Sackville said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Lawyers and laymen alike consider it unthinkable that the legal system should discriminate against a person simply because he is poor. Yet even on these  uncontentious  criteria the law has Tailed to accord equal treatment to all people and has therefore contributed to the perpetuation of poverty in Australia. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It was in order to break that cycle of the perpetuation of poverty in Australia by way of providing equal access to the law that the Australian Labor Government established an Australian Legal Aid Office and a national legal aid service. Now the whole system is to be radically altered. </para>
          <para>I draw to the attention of the Senate the principles of legal aid which were set out in the Sackville report. There were 9 principles which I believe would be uncontentious in theory amongst all honourable senators. Yet on each principle that is set out the legislation before us falls short. The first principle is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Legal aid agencies should provide a full range of services for individuals who require legal advice or assistance, but are unable to alford the fees of private practitioners. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>In commenting on that principle, I point out that the ALAO can provide advice to anyone who walks in off the street and asks for it. They may not need legal assistance; they may merely need advice. Private solicitors of course are not equipped to provide free advice in that fashion. As to the criterion of providing aid to those who are unable to afford the fees, we are very pessimistic about the lack of financial agreements in this Bill. There is no guarantee that funds for aid will be sufficient for all those who cannot afford fees. The second principle set out in the Sackville report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Legal aid schemes should seek to stimulate legal reforms in the interests of poor and disadvantaged groups in the community. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again I point out that there is no provision for law reform initiatives in the legislation before us. Certainly, the Commission may decide that it wants to do this; but it is not provided for in the functions set out in clause 6 of the Bill. I say, in passing, that a couple of the functions of the Commission set out in clause 6 of the Bill are ones which we in the Opposition are pleased to see and which we support. One such function is found in clause 6 (c) which states: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(c)">
              <para>to collect and publish statistics concerning the operation of schemes for the provision of legal assistance in Australia. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Another aspect is set out in sub-clause (h), which states: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(h)">
              <para>to advise the Attorney-General as to the educational programs that would be effective in promoting an understanding by the public, or by sections of the public that have special needs in this respect, of their rights, powers, privileges and duties under laws in force in Australia. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">We support both those functions; that is, the collecting of statistics and the mounting of public education campaigns. There is no provision for initiatives with regard to law reform. I contend that, with the breaking up of a national legal aid service, the likelihood of initiatives coming from legal aid lawyers is diminished. The third principle set out in the Sackville report is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Legal aid services should be readily accessible to all who need them and thus should be located not only in central city areas but within the communities they are intended to serve. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I say that national planning according to needs is much better done through a national service and that the Federal Government, in withdrawing from this national service, is abrogating a responsibility which it assumed on taking office. It seems to me to be less likely that 6 State and 2 territorial commissions will be able to plan the proper disposition of legal aid services so that all people have access to them. The fifth principle states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>While it is proper to conserve resources by imposing means tests and other eligibility requirements as well as contributions from applicants, these should be administered flexibly and in a manner that does not deter persons requiring legal aid from applying for assistance. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I comment here that there is no indication in the legislation before us that adequate funds will be available so that the means test can be realistic. I remind those honourable senators who seems to be preoccupied with some other matter at the moment that after the change of government the Attorney-General reduced the means test for eligibility for legal aid to a level well below the poverty line- something approximately $40 a week. Above that amount one was not entitled to legal aid. It is very clear that many people in our community who have an income of more than $40 a week certainly would need legal aid. Another principle relates to providing proper remuneration for private practitioners assisting legally aided persons. That can be done only if there are adequate funds. The eighth principle states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Legal aid agencies should be accountable to the community they serve and therefore members of local communities should participate in the administration of legal aid services to the maximum extent possible. </para>

          <para class="block">My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> has drawn attention already to the inadequacy of the composition of the membership of the Commission from this point of view. There is only one place on the Commission for a non-lawyer. We submit that there should be a much wider community representation. A person who works in and is dedicated to legal aid should be included on the Commission. This is different from a lawyer who takes some legal aid cases. This principle of requiring community involvement certainly is not embodied in the legislation before us. The ninth principle set out in the Sackville report is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In allocating public funds to legal aid schemes, account should be taken of the need to ensure that resources are used efficiently. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Surely the most efficient use of resources would be achieved by building up and expanding a national service, lt seems to me to be unavoidable that inefficiency will result from breaking a national scheme down into 6 State and 2 territorial schemes. We are totally dissatisfied with the legislation in its present form. We believe that recipients and potential recipients of legal aid are dissatisfied with it. We believe that the practitioners of legal aid in this country, those people who are dedicated to legal aid, also are dissatisfied with it.

            <para>- It is impossible in the few minutes available to me to make any detailed examination of this Bill or of the situation of legal aid, in which I have been closely interested for many years now. I am not to be taken as disagreeing with many of the things that have been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> and others about the extraordinary situation in which we are forced to rush through this Parliament a Bill of considerable importance such as this one. That is not new. Honourable senators will remember that it happened when the Whitlam Government was in power. We have not learned how to manage this situation. We have a lot of nonsense in the Address-in-Reply debate and other wasteful speeches early in the session and we finish up with important legislation causing a lot of trouble at the end. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That does not mean that it may not be necessaryI think it is necessary- to pass this Bill and I do not support the idea that it should be put back into the melting pot at this stage, as suggested by the amendment. Back in 1975 at a stage when I was handling the Bill in the Senate and we were about to move to send the Bill to a Senate committee, it is a pity that we did not take that opportunity. But that is spilt milk. We have been busy negotiating with some very lacklustre and backward States which have not pushed forward very quickly to co-operate with the Commonwealth in establishing a good and sufficient legal aid scheme. That has not been due to any lack of trying on the part of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. I say as a personal remark that I think a lot more might be done, and no doubt it is necessary now to bring these things to some sort of conclusion. </para>
          <para>The passage of this Bill gives a firm basis upon which the Attorney-General can proceed to negotiate to some conclusion with the States in obtaining a complete scheme. The delay, on the other hand, might not have been altogether too bad, because in 1975 there was among the private lawyers a great hatred of the Australian Legal Aid Office and those who were salaried officers of legal aid schemes. But I think there has been a great change in the attitude and a realisation that in any legal aid scheme that is any good there needs to be a substantial aspect of a salaried service. At least that is one thing that has come into the consciousness of the private lawyers of this country. They have realised that there is a great advantage in that. I hope that their motives are altogether pure. Sometimes they are not. Nonetheless, I think some wisdom has been gained in the period of delay. </para>
          <para>This Bill does not do as much as has been suggested by some honourable senators. It creates a supervising body. It creates a Commonwealth body which in the future will supervise for the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission the effect of legal aid and it will be able to advise the Attorney-General in the areas where it is good or bad. It also does something to protect the position of those officers who would go across to a State scheme. I think it is accepted that that is going to happen. Those powers which are now in this Bill are a useful basis upon which the Attorney can negotiate and endeavour to obtain proper conditions for those who have served the Commonwealth well in legal aid and who need to be protected, who need to have the right, if necessary, to go back into the Commonwealth Public Service. Although the Bill does not spell this out, I hope the mobility of these people will also be protected in the negotiations that go on with the States. Therefore I say that this Bill provides a base upon which negotiations with the States can be carried out and whereby particular schemes can be developed. </para>
          <para>I hope that in the negotiations that go on in the next few months there will be proper protection. I believe there will be a forceful determination to ensure that the schemes which operate in the States are not dominated by the private profession. The private profession should be well represented on them, but I hope that the schemes will not be dominated. I hope, for example, that if the Western Australian scheme is to gather in money from the Commonwealth and operate, it will not be dominated as it is at the moment, with the private profession in control. </para>

              <para>- No, it depends on negotiations. If those negotiations do not succeed we will be back here. I think every one realises that we may well be back later on with necessary alterations to this legislation when the negotiations with these very diverse States are all completed. It is important that we ensure that there is a salaried service component in the State schemes. That is something which can be achieved. I think it is important to realise that the Commonwealth has great responsibilities. About 80 per cent of the money now spent goes into Commonwealth areas of responsibility, mainly the family law area. Of course it is necessary that the continued influence of the Commonwealth is seen and that it has supervision of the State schemes to ensure that the money is not wasted but is used to the best effect. We must ensure that in the areas where the private profession can best be employed it is employed, and that in the areas where the salaried service can best carry out the duties it is engaged, so that no one group will dominate to the exclusion of the other. </para>

          <para>It is unfortunate that this Bill has been hurried and that there has been inadequate time to hear all the representations. Many representations have been made over the years, and we cannot alford to have the scheme continue in the way in which it has been operating for a long time. On balance, I think we should proceed with this Bill because it will provide a base from which the Attorney-General can negotiate proper schemes with the States and introduce proper schemes for the Territory. We will watch their development. I am sure we will take a continued interest in the question of legal aid and that we will see more of the matter in the future. For those reasons, I believe that it is important to pass the Bill and to have the operation brought to some sort of conclusion. If that is not done the States will say: What have you done? What is your basis? How can we negotiate from this?' I hope that by passing this Bill we will be able to get the States, some of which are quite slow, to come forward and put their own proposals on the line. In that way we will have a good scheme in operation but we must ourselves continue to maintain a close observation of it. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support the amendment moved by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> and to criticise the Government for prostituting the Parliament by the indecent haste with which this legislation has been brought to us for consideration. We can only assume that some of the haste has been caused because there are so many solicitors on the Government benches who will very shortly be out of a job and who perhaps will still be eligible for a job on one of the commissions. In the past we have seen a few Government senators with the courage of their convictions voting against their Government. I doubt that we will see them do it on this Bill. We have heard so much from honourable senators on the Government side about the role of the Senate and the independence of the Senate from the governing House. We have heard the Senate called a States' House, a House of review. I wish the Minister would tell me when Government senators have had a chance to review this piece of legislation, because I have not. I received it yesterday and endeavoured to read it today so that I could speak on it competently this afternoon. Honourable senators opposite have the opportunity to prove their independence. They have the capacity to support the Opposition's amendment but I doubt that they will accept that responsibility and take that action. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Time is getting on, but I want to devote the few minutes available to me to making a few points about Western Australia. One cannot help wondering whether the indecent haste with which we are considering this Bill has something to do with the State of Western Australia. I noticed in last night's <inline font-style="italic">Daily News</inline> that a summit conference of senior Western Australian and Federal Liberal politicians is to be held in that State on Monday. Presumably the Federal politicians want to be able to say: 'Look how successful we have been. We have passed the Legal Aid Commission Bill for you'. But the State Government in Western Australia has already legislated for a legal aid commission to operate from 1 July. In my opinion, even that is not sufficient reason for this Bill to be passed. I am sure that all honourable senators have received the same amount of material as I have. There is quite a stack behind me here and there is another stack in my office. I am sure that every member of this chamber has received material relating to this Bill and that none of it has been in favour of the Bill being passed in its present form. To prove that point, I intend to read a telegram which I am sure all honourable senators received from the Australian Legal Aid Office staff association in Western Australia: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The ALAO staff in Western Australia protests at the introduction of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill without prior consultation with ALAO staff or their industrial representatives: considers the introduction of the Bill to be a breach of the Attorney-General 's undertaking to the Parliament on 1 9 October 1976 - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">No one ever believed that the Attorney-General would keep his promise-  that the staff who join the Commission will have at least the same terms and conditions of service as they presently enjoy in the ALAO: reaffirms their intention to remain with the Australian Public Service and not to join the State Legal Aid </para>
          <para>Commission until legislation is passed guaranteeing (a) a career structure in the Commission: (b) that the staff who join the Commission will have the same terms and conditions particularly as to security of tenure as they enjoy under the Australian Public Service Act: and (c) have mobility of staff to transfer between State commissions: requests that the Bill be deferred to the next sitting of Parliament to enable the staff, their industrial representatives and others interested to properly consider the Bill and make submissions accordingly. </para>
          <para class="block">The telegram is signed by the Staff Association of the ALAO, Western Australia. This State Government has been openly encouraged by the Federal Government to commence the Commission's operation as from 1 July this year. This raises a few questions in my mind. For instance, I want to know how it will operate. Where are its premises to be located? What finance has it got or will it get, and how will that finance be given? Will that finance be in the form of a block grant which will enable a State Premier to refuse to pass it on for the very purpose for which it was intended, as the Queensland Premier has done with a block grant for the women's refuges? What protection will there be for the staff already employed at the Australian Legal Aid Office? What will happen to the backlog of applications and correspondence that is already held at that office? I ask that question because the present staffing arrangements in Western Australia are totally inadequate to meet the needs of the people who require legal aid. </para>
          <para>Late this afternoon I heard a rumour that there has been talk already about an appointment to the State Commission to get it underway as at 1 July in Western Australia. I do not know whether that rumour is based on fact or fiction. But the rumour has it that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> John Hale is to be appointed to head the Commission. I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> John Hale. He may be a very genuine person. He may have been involved in legal aid. I have not been able to find anything in the books in which I looked to indicate that he has been involved in the administering of legal aid. But I did find out that he was born in October 1905. If I can add up that makes him 71 years of age already. So it is obvious that the State Government does not intend it to be a long term appointment. The practice in Western Australia for the last 10 years or so has been that judges retire at 70 years of age. Having retired this judge once, apparently it is intended to bring him back again. I wonder how the scheme will operate with a commissioner of that age when 80 per cent of the cases being handled by the Australian Legal Aid Office in most States, and especially in Western Australia, are family law matters. Probably he will be shocked out of his mind at some of the terminology that is used these days. </para>
          <para>I want to know what the cost of running the separate legal aid commissions will be in comparison with the Australian Legal Aid Office that is operating already. I want to know whether the Commonwealth has reached an agreement already with the State of Western Australia in regard to the funding of the State legal aid commission. If so, I want to know what amount of funding is proposed as well as the terms of the funding. Perhaps the Minister might like to table the agreement so that at least we can look at it. </para>
          <para>I wish to comment on the amount of work that goes through the Australian Legal Aid Office. We would all acknowledge that Western Australia is one of the less populous States of Australia. But the Perth office alone receives between 300 and 400 letters a day, including legal aid applications and solicitors accounts. In addition, about 50 legal aid applications are handed in at the office by individuals. Will the Minister be increasing the staff of the ALAO to handle the backlog? Has there been an increase in applications in recent months and if so, how great is the increase? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> mentioned that there had been a 43 per cent increase in the cost of this operation. In fact, the Minister stated this in his second reading speech. I query whether that 43 per cent increase in expenditure related to back payments or whether there will be that percentage increase in the amount of money spent this year. My information is that the money was to pay for past accounts; that is all. There is no genuine increase. The commitment is still for $ 1 m a month and that is all. </para>
          <para>Because my time to speak in the debate has just about expired I seek leave to have a number of documents incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> If Government honourable senators are genuine in relation to this matter they will at least bother to read them. I seek leave to incorporate the following documents in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard:</inline> A further telegram from the Australian Legal Aid Office in Western Australia; an article from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 30 May 1977 under the heading 'Move on legal aid "a threat to standards" '; a copy of the article referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> earlier from the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of yesterday, Thursday, 2 June, the leading article headed 'Blitzkrieg legislation'; a telegram from the Tasmanian Conservation Trust Inc.; and 2 documents that have been received from the Australian Government Lawyers Association. </para>

            <para class="block">BLITZKRIEG LEGISLATION </para>
            <para>It is difficult to characterise the travesty of the parliamentary process that this week is attending the scheduled passage of the Government's Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill, but 'legislation by blitzkrieg' does not fall far short of the mark. The Bill itself, after several months of rather vague statements of intent and uncertain reassurances by the Attorney-General. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> was introduced only last Friday. Late yesterday it underwent its second reading in the House of Representatives. Today it is scheduled to go to the Senate: its sponsors yesterday expected that it would he the law of the land, or at worst awaiting the formality of Vice-Regal ratification, by tonight or. at the latest, tomorrow. Only sardonically could it be said that the Parliament is being given an opportunity to truly 'consider' the measure at all. Such a distortion of the legislative process is neither reassuring about the state of parliamentary democracy in this country nor a good augury of the practicality of the Bill itself. </para>
            <para>Such indecent haste, and its attendant denial of the parliamentary system in its most complete sense, is deplorable enough of itself. But the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill possesses features which individually demand proper and detailed consideration. The commission contemplated by the Bill is little more than a watchdog advisory panel for the Attorney-General. More importantly, the Bill proposes to dismantle the existing Australian Legal Aid Office, parcelling its operations out to new State commissions, in pursuance of the Government's vaunted 'new federalism', lt envisages the transfer to the State commissions of lawyers at present employed by the ALAO-a proposition which raises the entire question of" the Commonwealth's relationship with its employees, an issue which surely demands greater consideration than the Government's parsimonious allocation of time permits. </para>
            <para>The fact that the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations resolved recently to oppose the transfer of Commonwealth staff and functions to the States need not necessarily loom as a major factor in the Government's consideration of this topic. But that- and normal courtesywould suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> and his department might have permitted greater time than they have for proper consultation on the detailed provisions of the Bill. In particular, it appears that members of the existing ALAO have just cause to fear that their positions will not necessarily be protected on their transfer to the new Slate legal aid commissions. </para>
            <para class="block">Senate needs to act </para>
            <para>Some of the 'safeguards' proposed in the Bill are less than convincing: former Federal public servants are not guaranteed equal rights within the State commissions and the criteria for their readmission to the Commonwealth service seem unnecessarily narrow. In fairness. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> has vowed on a number of occasions to seek the States' cooperation in providing such safeguards. On the other hand, his approaches so far to Western Australia, one of the two States to legislate to set up a local commission, have met with a lack of any meaningful response. </para>
            <para>Questions of honest dealing and courtesy aside, there are many points on which the Bill can be faulted. A strong case can be made that legal aid is to a sufficiently large extent a welfare, as distinct from a narrowly legal, issue that the preponderance of lawyers on the proposed commission is inappropriate. Moreover, the Australian Government Lawyers Association is on strong ground when it protests at the destruction of a national career structure for lawyers with a commitment to legal aid. It is difficult to see how the delivery of such specialist services can be improved by shattering a single service into half a dozen or eight, any more than, for instance, the performance of the Royal Australian Air Force would be enhanced by its division between the States. </para>
            <para>Given the Government's commitment to its 'federalist' dogma, it is nevertheless difficult to understand why the Government is unwilling to entertain the intelligent compromise suggested by the unions- and accepted by the South Australian Attorney-General- to staff the autonomous State commissions from the Federal Public Service, so retaining the advantages of a unified career structure. A strong case can be made that legal-aid authorities should be enabled to stand back from the local interests of State legal establishments. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> by contrast, advocates a system calculated to subjugate Commonwealth-financed legal aid to just those establishments. Too many questions are raised by the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill to permit its passage at this time. If the Senate is in any shape or form the House of Review' it proclaims itself, it will defer action on the measure at least until the Budget session. </para>

            <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline></para>
            <para>On behalf of CAGEO we wish to confirm our strong opposition to the present intention of the Government to pass the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill through both Houses of Parliament this week, without sufficient time for adequate consideration of the measure by affected staff associations, welfare organisations and members of the public, and of course by Members of Parliament themselves. This legislation is of great importance to the future of legal aid services in Australia and provides the best opportunity for proper consideration of the implications of the proposed new legal aid scheme which your Government has initiated. </para>
            <para>We reiterate that we consider that it is unjustifiable for the Government to proceed with the passing of this legislation in its present form, both from the point of view of the public interest and in view of the fact that it does not meet your firm undertakings to ALAO officers, as the terms and conditions of employment which they would be offered after the takeover by the States should be at least as favourable as those which they presently enjoy. </para>
            <para>At the present time the Western Australian Legal Aid Commission Act remains in its original form notwithstanding the representations which we understand you have made to the Western Australian Government to have a number of important amendments made to it, such as the substantial changes to the means by which legal aid applications are considered and granted applications handled. You indicated that we could expect an indication that some favourable changes would be made to that legislation in approximately a fortnight's time. However, this is unacceptable as six months have already elapsed since you originally took these matters up with the Western Australian Attorney-General, and no change in the situation has occurred in that time. </para>
            <para>We also feel that it is most unsatisfactory and unacceptable for provisions concerning the protection of rights of ALAO officers who transfer to State Commissions to be dealt with in a hasty additional part to this Bill, instead of being covered by an amendment to the Officers' Rights Declaration Act which we understand the Government proposes to introduce and have passed by Parliament during the Budget Session. </para>
            <para>It may be that it will not be physically possible to pass any amendments to the present legislation if it is to pass through all stages this week. If this is so, it would re-enforce our argument that this legislation should be deferred to the Budget Session so that proper consideration can be given to it and adequate opportunity for the various issues involved to be identified and as far as possible resolved as a result of consultation and discussion. The fact that Western Australia is anxious for this legislation to be passed quickly is not in our view a sound basis for proceeding with the legislation, particularly as Western Australia has been so recalcitrant in making any commitment to amending its own hastily passed legislation. It can hardly be surprising that we view with reservations your assurance yesterday that amendments to the Western Australian legislation are likely to be agreed to shortly. Surely the Western Australian legislation should be amended first and the Commonwealth legislation passed afterwards, if there is to be any certainty that appropriate amendments will be made to the Western Australian legislation. Such amendments are of great importance to ALAO officers in Western Australia, and the rapid passage of this legislation in the absence of amending legislation is likely to increase the likelihood that ALAO officers in Western Australia will continue to refuse to join the W.A. Legal Aid Commission. </para>
            <para>As to the particular matters which we raised yesterday, we confirm the following: </para>
            <list type="decimal-dotted">
              <item label="1.">
                <para>We abide by our basic submission that a nationwide career structure in legal aid should be maintained: and that only by so doing can your undertakings as to the retention of terms and conditions of ALAO officers as favourable as those they have at present be carried out. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="2.">
                <para>We note that taking the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill and your Second Reading Speech together, you have in fact accepted the principle of what we have been saying. However, implementation of that principle is only effected in part by the legislation and the vital matter of retaining mobility for Legal Aid Officers in the different States and Territories is a matter for future negotiation between the Commonwealth and various States and Territories. The fact that this matter has not, apparently, been raised with the W.A. Government at this time gives rise to grave doubt as to whether such mobility, which should include equal access to vacant positions and portability of rights, will be implemented in part or even at all in the foreseeable future. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="3.">
                <para>In the context of the Government's determination to proceed with transferring ALAO officers, to the States, at the very minimum Section 21 (3) should be amended to provide for arrangements with a State to provide for equal accessability of 'eligible persons' to positions in State Commissions which become vacant, and for portability of all rights from one State Commission to another (including rights at State level). Clause 24 (2) (d) is too narrow and should be amended to encompass the recommendations referred to by the Joint Council in 1973 that not only diminution of advancement opportunities should be a condition for re-appointment in the Australian Public Service, but diminution in circumstances of employment should be a prescribed condition. The provision should be amended accordingly. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="4.">
                <para>Clause 24 ( 8 ) should be amended as it is too narrow in its scope. It should make reference to relevant experience which the officer has had, and in any event, should be altered so that the criteria mentioned arc not exclusive. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="5.">
                <para>As to the structure and functions of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission itself, CAGEO considers that it is too heavily weighted towards lawyers and did not guarantee adequate representation of persons who have expertise in welfare and consumer areas. Participation by such people in the Commission is vital if the priorities for the provision of legal aid services are to be properly assessed. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="6.">
                <para>The legislation should also set out the values underlying the provision of legal aid services which the Commission is intended to be guided by. We attach a copy of CAGEO's submission to the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly which includes a submission on this point on pages 22 and 23. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para>In addition to these matters we also note that Clause 6. which deals with the functions of the Commission, is unduly narrow in relation to the provision of legal aid services. Paragraph K refers to the determination of applications for the provision of legal or financial assistance by the Commonwealth in Commonwealth matters, but does not provide for the actual provision of such assistance. Furthermore, the determination of such applications is limited to matters in which the Commission is specifically authorised to do so by an Act and otherwise only by direction of the Attorney-General. This means that in most areas in which the ALO provides legal aid the Commission docs not have any authority to handle legal aid matters without a specific direction from the Attorney to do so. This is clearly most unsatisfactory. </para>
            <para>As indicated to you yesterday, these arc the matters that flow from our discussions with the Public Service Board. There are other matters which could be dealt with if adequate time is made available. </para>

We would hope that the Government would give the Members of the House of Representatives an opportunity to sit on that Committee, but, if it does not, then we call upon the Senate to refer the Bill to a Committee of the Senate for the detailed and careful consideration it warrants. </para>
            <para>The provision of legal aid services is a very complex matter. It cannot be dealt with properly by the Parliament in the space of one week. Indeed pans of the Government's legal aid package are not even before the Commonwealth Parliament. The Government's proposals rest heavily on State and Territorial legislation, much of which has not even been introduced. The Commonwealth Parliament should be given an opportunity to consider, by means of a Committee, the complete legal aid package. It should know what it is being asked to agree to. </para>

Therefore the Opposition wants the provisions of this Bill to be scrutinised by a Committee of both Houses of Parliament. </para>

            <para>AGLA respectfully agrees with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard's</inline> comments and notes that they are directly in point in the present situation. The Attorney-General. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> on behalf of the then Opposition and said: </para>
            <para>The Opposition takes the view that legal aid services should be provided in the most efficient, accountable and accessible form to those in need of it. For this purpose the Opposition believes that a joint Committee of both Houses should consider the important legal, social and constitutional issues involved. </para>
            <para>It is time, as the honourable member for Bennelong( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> ) said, that we acted like a Parliament on a matter like this. It is time that we legislated on the basis of an inquiry into the important issues involved. </para>
            <para class="block">Hansard 9 October 1975. </para>
            <para>AGLA calls for the kind of inquiry proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> in 1975. We note that to date, no such inquiry has been held. It is indeed time that Parliament acted like a Parliament and legislated on the basis of a proper inquiry. </para>
            <para>The inquiry proposed is even more urgent in view of the fact that evidence is mounting that the Government's proposals are not the most effective and the cheapest way to deal with the provision of Legal Aid services. An all-party Committee of the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly enquired into the Legal Aid legislation before the Assembly. It reported as follows at paragraph 1 5 of its report: </para>
            <para>This Committee is of the view that the Australian Legal Aid Office should be retained and given statutory responsibilities. </para>
            <para>This view, of course, runs completely counter to the Government's own proposals. Indeed these proposals do not entirely accord with what has been said on previous occasions by Liberal Party spokesmen. On 9 October 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> said: </para>
            <para>We do not believe that the problems of providing an effective legal aid service will be solved simply by leaving the matter to the States- not because we believe that the attempts made by the States over the years have not contained a great deal of merit and have not contributed a great deal to the provision of legal aid services, but the fact is that the Commonwealth has a direct constitutional legal responsibility in a number of areas. Therefore, it has a responsibilityto provide legal assistance to those persons who need assistance in respect of the operation of Federal law. </para>
            <para class="block">Hansard 9 October 1975. </para>
            <para>AGLA believes that this statement isentirely correct and that, according to its tenor, the Government's present proposals are of questionable value.

            <para>The Australian Government Lawyers Association strongly opposes the Commonwealth Government's plan to rush the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill through both Houses of Parliament before Parliament rises at the end of this week. The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill which was introduced into the House of Representatives only last Friday, is an extremely important piece of legislation as it will shape the future of legal aid services throughout the whole of Australia and thus demands careful consideration. </para>
            <para>The Bill has two main aims. The first is to establish a Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission which will be the cornerstone of the Commonwealth Government 's determination to dismantle the Australian Legal Aid Office as part of its new Federalism policy. A number of community welfare organisations, including ACOSS and its State affiliates, have consistently criticised the Commonwealth's decision to dismantle the ALAO. These organisations have repeatedly pointed out that the ALAO has established itself as the legal aid body in Australia : it is highly efficient and well organised : and draws strength from the fact that it operates on an Australia wide basis. The career structure which this provides ensures that the best lawyers are attracted and retained. The hiving off of ALAO staff to State commissions, in some cases comprising less than a dozen lawyers, can only result in a drastic reduction in the high standard of legal aid services currently provided to the community. </para>
            <para>AGLA takes the view that the proposed Commonwealth Commission could best be utilised as a statutory basis for existing ALAO operations. </para>
            <para>The second main aim of the legislation relates to the rights of ALAO legal and administrative staff whom it is proposed should be transferred to State and Territorial commissions. To quote from the Second Reading Speech of the Commonwealth Attorney-General. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> J. Ellicott. 'the Bill seeks to preserve (these) rights' but as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> admits on page 7 of his speech, this object cannot be achieved as the Bill does not deal with the career prospects of ALAO staff which, as previously pointed out. is an important factor contributing towards the current success of that Office. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> said. </para>
            <para>To meet the concern of A.L.A.O. staffabout their career prospects in legal aid. 1 am asking State Attorneys-General to include a provision in State legislation enabling Legal Aid Commissions to make reciprocal arrangements with each other for transfer of staff. Similar provision would be made in the A.C.T. and the N.T.' </para>
            <para>This represents a last minute change of heart by the Commonwealth Government as there is no provision for this in the W.A. or S.A. Acts, or in the draft A.C.T. Ordinance. In any event, there must be serious doubt whether all the States and the Commonwealth could arrive at a suitable arrangement in the near future, if at all. Yet ALAO staff in Western Australia will shortly be asked to forego their present legal entitlements to a viable career structure, guaranteed to them as Commonwealth public servants under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, in favour of this pious hope. </para>
            <para>The specific provisions of the Bill which 'seek' to preserve the rights of ALAO staff are extremely detailed and complex and the numerous cross references to provisions of the Public Service Act require that both pieces of legislation be read in conjunction to ascertain what is intended. This complexity is emphasised by the fact that out of the 2 1 pages of the Bill, which according to its title is designed to set up a Commonwealth Commission, 13 pages or almost 2/3 of the Bill are devoted to these arrangements. The Bill proposes to apply the Officers' Rights Declaration scheme to transferred ALAO staff notwithstanding that this approach was specifically rejected by CAGEO at its Bi-Ennial Conference earlier this month. </para>
            <para>Neither these complex provisions nor arrangements for transferability of staff between States would be necessary if the Commonwealth Government were to adopt the AGLA and CAGEO proposal that ALAO staff retain their Commonwealth Public Service status and be made available as required to the State commissions. South Australia, which is one of the only two States to have legislated for its own legal aid commission, has agreed to the proposal. Yet notwithstanding the obvious advantages and simplicity of this proposal the Commonwealth has steadfastly refused to embrace it. This refusal reveals the Bill for what it really is, an exercise in reducing the Commonwealth Public Service ceiling. However, no cost saving will accrue to the Commonwealth as the financial arrangements with the States will include subsidies to meet the salaries etc. of ALAO staff transferred to State commissions. </para>
            <para>A matter of immediate concern is the undue haste with which the Commonwealth Government proposes to enact this legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> foreshadowed the Commonwealth Commission nearly 7 months ago and now the Government proposes to push the Bill through the Parliament in only 7 days. Such precipitous action would deprive the public, Members of Parliament and ALAO staff of adequate opportunity to study the Bill. It also appears likely that some staff would not receive a copy of the Bill before it was enacted contrary to assurances given to the staff by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott.</inline> This action is also inconsistent with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> 's statement at page 6 of the Second Reading Speech that ALAO staff will not be asked to elect concerning transfer to a State or Territorial Commission until . . . staff are fully informed about the terms and conditions that will apply to them'. </para>
            <para>The early enactment of this legislation cannot be justified on the basis that either the W.A. or S.A. Commissions, or both, propose to commence operation on 1 July. Present information indicates that the need to finalise administrative arrangements will effectively preclude the Commission's opening their doors before August. In any event temporary arrangements could be made to deal with this matter. </para>
            <para>This statement has the support of ACOA, APSA, whose members are also employed in the Australian Legal Aid Office, and of the peak council, CAGEO. Arrangements are in hand for senior officials of AGLA and the other unions to meet with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> on Monday, 30 May to formally request deferral of the Bill to the Budget Session of Parliament. </para>

            <para>Professor Ronald Sackville, formerly Commissioner for Law and Poverty on the Australian Government Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, and <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Susan</inline> Armstrong, formerly Research Director of the Law and Poverty section of the Commission, today expressed serious concern about the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Bill which has been introduced into Parliament by the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott.</inline> They called for a reconsideration of the terms of the proposed legislation and for more time to allow discussion of the Bill's implications. </para>
            <para>The Bill sets out to dismantle the Australian Legal Aid Office, to hand over its functions to State Commissions, and to establish a Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission which would perform advisory functions in relation to legal aid. The first two objectives have long been part of the Fraser Government's new federalism policy. The Government has chosen to reject proposals for joint Commonwealth-State Commissions which would allow the Commonwealth to continue to play a direct role in the provision of legal aid. </para>
            <para>It is most regrettable that a national legal aid service should be sacrificed on the altar of the new federalism ideology, but it is probably too late in the day to persuade the Commonwealth to change its mind on this issue. Nevertheless, even accepting the policy of returning legal aid to the States, there are serious problems with the Bill which deserve further thought and warrant the Bill being subjected to more public debate than the Government's timetable now allows. </para>
            <para>Introduction of Commonwealth legislation at this stage is premature. Only Western Australia and South Australia have so far introduced legislation to establish State Commissions, and neither of these States has yet implemented the legislation or indicated that they have reached financial agreement with the Commonwealth. It is not yet clear that the remaining States will be willing to adopt the new federalism policy, nor is it clear what terms would be acceptable to them. </para>
            <para>The Act does nothing of itself to solve the funding problems of the States, which are being asked to take over the Commonwealth's responsibilities in legal aid without the Commonwealth stating publicly its plans for providing continued or adequate sources of finance for legal aid. </para>
            <para>The legislation will contribute to the continuing politicisation of legal aid. The Attorney-General in his second reading speech referred to the Government's policy of establishing a comprehensive legal aid scheme in Australia and of giving the Legal Aid Commission an advisory, co-ordinating and monitoring role. In fact the proposed role of the Commission is far too narrow, and the Commission lacks any significant measure of independence. </para>
            <para>The Commission's role is limited to making recommendations to the Attorney-General, who retains final authority in relation to the funding of State legal aid commissions and the co-ordination of their activities. The Commission has no power to grant funds directly to legal aid bodies; any recommendation will have to be approved and carried out by the Attorney-General of the day, who is of course subject to the usual political pressures. The Commission will therefore not act as a buffer between government and legal aid bodies, and its lack of independent authority will contribute to the continuing politicisation of legal aid in Australia. </para>
            <para>The Commission cannot perform any worthwhile coordinating role since it has no direct powers, and indeed there is nothing in the Bill to clarify how the Commonwealth intends to achieve its professed goal of co-ordinating of legal aid services. Another layer of government is hardly likely to contribute to the elimination of waste. There is no assurance in the Bill that a uniform standard of legal aid will be provided throughout Australia. </para>
            <para>The Commission will be excessively dominated by legal practitioners. It is now widely accepted that a broad range of interests and experience be represented on any legal aid commission. This is especially true of an advisory committee, where a detailed knowledge of legal practice is less important than an understanding of social welfare services, research techniques, and the needs of the consumers of legal aid. Yet there is no specific provision for the appointment of a non-lawyer to the Commission. The  Chairman,  the  Deputy Chairman,  and the Law Council nominee must all be lawyers. It is likely that the nominees of the Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General will be lawyers and that most will be practitioners. If that occurs the only representative able to put forward the consumer and social welfare perspective will be the single nominee of the Australian Council of Social Service. </para>
            <para>The Bill reflects a limited and unimaginative view of the role of legal aid. Far more thought should be given to the Commission's advisory functions. The drafting of the Bill shows a singular lack of imagination. </para>

              <item label="1.">
                <para>The Commission is directed to keep under review the extent of the need for legal assistance but legal assistance is defined in a limited way that does not expressly recognise the need for test cases or the importance of actions on behalf of disadvantaged groups. It has been repeatedly pointed out that legal aid, if it is to be effective, must conduct test cases and class actions where appropriate. </para>

                <para>The Commission is empowered, as requested by the Attorney-General, to report to him as to the provision of financial assistance to State legal aid commissions. Even apart from the limitation that the Attorney-General is not even bound to refer the question of financial assistance to the Commission notwithstanding the dependence of the States on federal support, the Commission is not directly required to consider the granting of assistance to voluntary legal services, such as the Fitzroy Legal Service, which have been performing extraordinarily valuable work. The Commission has power to advise on such other matters as it considers appropriate, but this is different from a duty to consider financial assistance to the voluntary services. The Bill does refer (in clause 6 (e)) to the possibility ofnonGovernment legal aid schemes receiving financial assistance from the Commonwealth, but the role of the Commission in this is not made clear. </para>

Furthermore the Commission itself is given no role in promoting community legal education, its role being limited to advising the Attorney-General. </para>

            <para>The legislation to establish a Commonwealth Commission to advise and co-ordinate State legal aid schemes is of crucial importance and will largely determine the nature of future legal aid development in Australia. </para>
            <para>The Bill now before Parliament is deficient in many fundamental aspects and adequate time should be allowed for a full consideration of its terms. The proposed A.C.T. Legal Aid Ordinance was permitted to lie on the table for a lengthy period to facilitate full public discussion. The same procedure should be adopted with this legislation, which has far greater implications at a national level. It should not be rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, and amendment where necessary. ' </para>

            <para>SUMMARY OF CAGEO'S SUBMISSION ON THE RETENTION OF A NATIONAL CAREER SERVICE IN LEGAL AID </para>
            <para>CAGEO's submission is that the Australia-wide career service to which officers of the Australian Legal Aid Office presently belong should be retained after the establishment of legal aid commissions in the States and Territories. The Council's proposal envisages the retention of an on-going Commonwealth career service in legal aid in which ALAO officers would remain in employment under the Commonwealth Public Service Act: for example, by employment within the proposed Commonwealth Commission. Officers in the service would work under the direction and control of the legal aid commissions established in the States and Territories. </para>
            <para>This proposal rests on four principal bases. </para>
            <para>Firstly it rests on the views expressed by the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott.</inline> in his initial public statement concerning legal aid made on 15 January 1976. The Attorney-General said then, in effect, that the public interest involves meeting the citizens' need for legal aid. and doing so efficiently and economically, partly through the work of salaried lawyers. </para>
            <para>CAGEO submits that salaried lawyers arc able to provide the most efficient and economical legal aid services in many situations but particularly in areas where there arc few or no readily accessible private practitioners. For their services to be efficient, however, career prospects of salaried lawyers and other general terms and conditions of their employment must be sufficiently attractive to encourage able professional and administrative personnel to apply to work in the legal aid field, and to continue to work there after they have gained experience in the work. </para>
            <para>This goal cannot, however, be achieved inhere is to he no Australia-wide career structure as there is at present in the ALAO whose officers are members of the Australian Public Service. If salaried officers are 'locked' into a small employment body such as the proposed commissions in Western Australia and South Australia arc likely to be. numbering between approximately thirty and forty officers each, those with ability and ambition are most unlikely to remain with it for more than a relatively shorttime, and the difficulty of attracting competent people to replace them is sure to be very considerable. </para>
            <para>In Tasmania, there are at present eight qualified lawyers working in the Australian Legal Aid Office. A majority of these lawyers were recruited from outside the State. This has been possible only because intending applicants for positions in the Office have known that after working for a time in the ALAO in Tasmania they could seek a transfer to a position in that Office elsewhere in Australia. If a national career service in legal aid is not maintained the salaried service in Tasmania will certainly run down rapidly and the present high standard of legal aid services which the ALAO is providing to the public is likely to disintegrate. </para>
            <para>The second basis for the proposal is the Attorney-General's frequent assurances to officers of the Australian Legal Aid Office that after the takeover of the ALAO by the States the officers would have terms and conditions of service at least as favourable as their present terms and conditions of service (as Australian public servants). One of the clearest examples of such assurances was the Attorney-General's statement in the House of Representatives on 19 October 1 976 in which he said: </para>
            <para>If any legal aid officers are listening tonight I want them to know that in the negotiations I am undertaking I am seeking to preserve the position of all salaried legal aid officers. So in the takeover by the States the situation clearly will be that those officers will be protected and will have at least the same conditions as they enjoy at the moment '. </para>
            <para>The terms and conditions of employment of officers of the legal aid commissions provided for in the State legislation which has been passed in two States ( Western Australia and South Australia) are left at large, being in the discretion of each commission though subject, in the case of South Australia, to the approval of the State Government, and Western Australia, to consultation with the State Public Service Board. This is clearly a very much inferior position to that under which ALAO officers are presently employed as Commonwealth public servants under the Commonwealth Public Service Act. </para>
            <para>This unsatisfactory situation would not be rectified by the proposed application of a revised Officers' Rights Declaration Act to ALAO officers who join the State commissions. The principal reasons for this being so are set out in CAGEO 's submission to the Attorney-General in relation to the proposed Legal Aid Ordinance for the A.C.T. and the Northern Territory. In essence these are- </para>
            <list type="decimal">
              <item label="(">
                <para>1 ) the application of the proposed form of the new ORD Act would, it is understood, depend upon the ALAO officers concerned being compulsorily transferred to State and Territory commissions. At present the ALAO officers are not subject to such compulsory transfer. They are entitled to a meaningful option as to whether or not they wish to transfer, particularly as they have been repeatedly assured that this option would bc given to them. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(2)">
                <para>to resign from the Australian Public Service and transfer to a State or Territory commission would involve a substantial loss of career opportunity and even if the application of the revised ORD Act through compulsory transfer were accepted. Officers to whom the Act applied would lose their present right of access to ALAO offices in other States and Territories- a right which is of considerable importance, as most ALAO officers would prefer to make their career in the nation-wide legal aid service rather than to seek employment in a Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(3)">
                <para>the opportunities for former ALAO officers to return to the Australian Public Service would be severely limited by virtue of the abolition of all the positions from which they had resigned and the generally tight employment situation in the Australian Public Service. Lawyers, particularly would almost certainly find career opportunities in the Australian Public Service minimal or non-existent. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(4)">
                <para>by transferring to a State or Territory Commission, ALAO officers would be leaving the Australian </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para>Government as their employer and accepting in substitution a small Commission a number of whose members (perhaps almost half or even a majority) may well have an unfavourable or at least restrictive view of the role of a salaried service in the legal aid area. In any event, the Commission would be likely to be less reliable than the Australian Government in relation to future terms and conditions of service and as the Ordinance presently stands, the staff of the Commission would have no direct say in the Commission's formulation of policy in this area. </para>
            <list type="decimal">
              <item label="(5)">
                <para>discussions with the Public Service Board have indicated that a number of particular present rights of individuals might not be able to be carried over to the new Commission e.g. seniority, maternity leave. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(6)">
                <para>taken as a whole, the proposals, which envisage the breakup of the present nation-wide legal aid service, and the retention of certain rights by existing officers cannot make up for the demise of that ongoing, broadly based service which involves permanency of employment. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para>The third basis of the submission is that the proposed compulsory transfer of Australian public servants to State commissions which will not be staffed by State public servants is without precedent in the history of the Commonwealth Public Service. On all previous occasions when transfers of Commonwealth public servants to the States has taken place, the transferred officers have been offered State public service rights. This is clearly not the situation in regard to ALAO officers. CAGEO submits that there is no justification for breaking this long standing and well founded practice. </para>
            <para>Fourthly, it is CAGEO s policy, as indicated in discussion with the Board, that current Commonwealth proposals should not operate so as to discriminate between ALAO officers (in relation to future terms and conditions of service ) simply because of their location in a State or Territory. For example, it is understood that staff taken over by the proposed A.C.T. Commission will continue to receive identical terms and conditions to those which they presently enjoy. Presumably this will also be the case in the Northern Territory. On the other hand, it is abundantly clear that the terms and conditions that will be accorded to staff of the West Australian and South Australian commissions will bc somewhat less than those which they presently enjoy. Indeed, there is likely to be a disparity between the terms and conditions accorded in each of those States and this trend is likely to be repeated in each of the other States assuming they adopt the Commonwealth proposal. In CAGEO's view the only equitable means of avoiding this blatant discrimination is for the Commonwealth to adopt the proposal contained in the first paragraph of this submission. </para>

            <para>-I yield to the exigencies of my colleagues' desires to have the proceedings abbreviated. Only because of recent events I rise to express my warm approval of this Bill as a constructive first step in a responsible way to begin the examination of the extent and the ambit of legal aid services, with legal aid to be distinguished significantly from medical aid. A reflection upon the confused situation of medical schemes ought to encourage us to introduce legal aid in a cautious and responsible manner. This Bill establishes a responsible commission to ascertain and keep  under review the extent of the need for legal assistance in Australia, in particular legal assistance in respect of Commonwealth matters, and to make recommendations to the Attorney-General to ensure the most effective, economical and desirable means of satisfying that need. The Bill in particular provides for the commission to establish rules of law not individual ideas of particular officers, some of whom in the Australian Legal Aid Office have shown themselves to be not only expert legal practitioners but also expert propagandists. This Bill is most important for requiring a consideration of the criteria to be applied in determining whether legal aid is to be granted to any particular person. I hope it will be on rules of law, not individual discretion. I support the Bill warmly. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry that the Opposition wants to delay the establishment of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission because, as is clear from the speeches that have been made in this debate about this commission, this will be a major step in putting the delivery of legal aid in Australia on a rational and firm basis. It is an operation which can be properly carried out only by co-operation with the Commonwealth and State governments. The suggestions that this Bill is in some way designed by the Commonwealth Government to disband legal aid programs are quite false. The commitment by this Government to legal aid and the support which it has given to it have been emphasised by the figures that have been quoted in this debate. In answer to a point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> raised, in the last financial year there were 45 700 matters committed to legal aid. In the present financial year it is anticipated that there will be between 48 000 and 49 000 matters committed. So it is not a matter of payments this year being past payments or anything of that sort. These commitments are growing commitments by this Government. I am sorry also that most of the opposition to this Bill, indeed it has been reflected in speeches made in this chamber by the Opposition, seems to be devoted more to a concern for the rights and careers of some of those who are taking part in the delivery of legal aid under the present system than to the concern and interests of the people who need legal aid and the clients of the system. 1 hope that this Bill will have a speedy passage. </para>

            <para>-I refer to clause 5, and in doing so state that I do not regard myself as being in the generic description of 'colleague' used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> when he said that he was speaking briefly in order to facilitate his colleagues. I was not included in that description, I hope. In clause 5 the constitution of the Commission is set out. It provides for a  chairman, deputy chairman,  2 commissioners nominated by the Attorney-General and 2 commissioners nominated by the Attorneys-General of the States in which legal aid commissions have been established. I will come to sub-clause (d ) in a moment. Clause 5 provides for a commissioner nominated by the Law Council of Australia and a commissioner nominated by the Australian Council of Social Service which, presumably, is intended to be the consumer representative. It appears to us, and wc would be grateful for some assurance from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> or some indication of the Government's view, that it is likely that all the commissioners other than the commissioner representing the Australian Council of Social Service will be lawyers, none of whom necessarily has had any experience, involvement or dedication in the field of legal aid. A lot of hopes have been expressed by senators such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> that this sort of thing will not happen, but there is nothing in the legislation to prevent it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would be very grateful for an indication of the Government's hopes or intentions, whatever the case may be, regarding the point I have raised. Certainly one imagines that the commissioner nominated by the Law Council will not necessarily fall into that category. I also ask the Minister to elaborate on sub-clause (d) which refers to the commissioners nominated by the States in which legal aid commissions have been established. That carries an important implication regarding this legislation. There may bc States in which legal aid commissions have not been established. This goes to the very point wc were trying to make in the second reading debate; that is, that it is undesirable that Australians be accorded unequal rights in relation to access to legal aid. That may be an area in which people such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> and I have hopes, but that is a weakness which we see in the legislation. I would be grateful for the Ministers comments on clause 5. </para>

          <para>- It will be remembered that I addressed the Committee's mind to proposed new section  45D.  I was saying that proposed new sub-sections (5) and (6) spawn out verbiage with regard to the remedies that are to be available where a union, or an organisation as it is called in the new subsection, is involved and then substitutes the union for individual liability. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> said in his close analysis of subparagraph (v) of proposed new sub-section (6), the draftsman even deems it necessary in a Bill of this character to explain what property is available in execution. I should have thought that that was a matter of ordinary legal procedure, and that if liability is imposed under this Bill it will be left to other Acts to say what the ambit of the leviable property is. In view of the time I pass over an analysis of those 2 proposed new subsections, neither of which is capable of any clear understanding. I think that they both have been drafted in a nightmare. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I turn now to the main reason for which 1 stand. The substantial purpose for which this clause was introduced has been defeated completely by drafting. The purpose of the clause as originally drafted was to prevent secondary boycotts. That meant that if a combination of persons were exerting economic pressure in the course of a dispute amongst themselves- it may be competition between tradesmen or unions in demarcation or a dispute between employees and their unions- they are entitled unfortunately in too coercive a way not only to withdraw their labour but also to boycott the job of their employer. Nobody would be entitled or would be permitted to go there without creating a general concerted strike. Primary boycott was never in issue, but when employees having a dispute with their union, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> instanced the other night, pull five or six levers from three or four allies against a neutral person and concert a boycott against the employer by reason of activating interference in a third person's business- stopping the supply of his goods- they are travelling quite outside the legitimate ambit of strike action. Therefore, secondary boycott was to be condemned by this section. In America secondary boycott was condemned by the Supreme Court in 1909. It was resurrected and legalised in 1 93 1 . </para>

            <para>-No we are not. It was outlawed by 1 948. It is still the law that secondary boycott is not permissible in America as an aid to primary strike action. Primary boycott is permissible but not secondary boycot and our legislation was directed to achieve that purpose. By the introduction of sub-section (3) we have granted to unions in the course of their dispute the right to invoke a secondary boycott. After saying in sub-section ( 1 ) that a person shall not engage in conduct that prevents supply of goods to a corporation- that is to the neutral third personwhich is for the purpose of and likely to have the effect of damaging his business, subsection (3) states: </para>

        <para>Sub-section (2) provides that if the dispute is a legitimate dispute over industrial conditions then the prohibition against secondary boycott ceases; that is, instead of imposing a restriction on secondary boycott the effect of this sub-section, in the case of union disputes, is to legalise secondary boycotts. </para>
        <para>The second point I make is this: I stand here to affirm that under this law, if it is passed, the purpose of the Government will be defeated. The common law would have provided a much more effective remedy. This provision cuts down the remedy that is already available at common law. The bedevilling effect of that law is that one has to examine the purpose of a dispute in which 100 people in 3 sections are involved and then consider the dominant purpose of the dispute. The case would be in the law courts for months and nobody knows what the decision would be. It is a fact that the common law procedures bedevil one from ever getting justice. That is why common law action in this field is thought to be ineffective. In the spawned excretions of subsection (1) and put out in sub-section (3) is all this reference to purpose and dominant purpose. I recall 2 cases in the House of Lords. The first is <inline font-style="italic">Sorrell</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Smith</inline> in <inline font-style="italic">1925 Appeal Cases,</inline> where it is stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A combination of two or more persons for the purpose of injuring a man in his trade is unlawful and, if it results in damage to him, is actionable. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It does not have to be substantial damage. If a person engages in a combination of common law and it is for the purpose of injuring a third person, damages flow. The report continues: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>If the real purpose of the combination is not to injure another, but to forward or defend the trade of those who enter into it, then no wrong is committed and no action will lie, although damage to another ensues, provided that the purpose is not effected by illegal means. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The other better known case to which I wish to refer is Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Company, Limited, which is situated on the islands in the North Sea, <inline font-style="italic">1942 Appeal Cases,</inline> at page 435. In that case, the Crofter Company and the Dockers Union joined together to prevent the exit and outflow of" competing yarn. Their purpose was to support their own interests and not to injure the competitor. The predominant purpose was to support their own interest. There was no action. Those are the principles involved. We have bedevilled the whole of this clause by reducing the efficacy of the common law remedy and, instead of providing a prohibition on secondary boycott, we are providing an extension for it. </para>

            <para>- Indeed. I said we would not have the same concern. We would be concerned all right but not so concerned. Before I vote on this very important and controversial piece of legislation, the consideration of which was put off from last night until the dying hours of this session I would like to know the answers to those matters that were raised. I would like to hear the Minister give a reply, for example, concerning the matter which I raised during the second reading debate, namely, whether the circumstances about which  I  spoke at that time would be covered by proposed section 45D and whether action mentioned under those circumstances would contravene the provisions of proposed section 45D. That is a most important matter and it is a matter in relation to which I seek an answer now. </para>

            <para>Has the Minister considered the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review which reported in 19S9 unanimously in favour of legislation to give the Commonwealth power over corporations, untrammelled by the limitations in the present Commonwealth power, which would enable a uniform companies Act and Federal legislation effectively controlling the securities industry?

            <para>The Joint Committee on Constitutional Review reported in 1 959 in the following terms: </para>
            <list type="decimal">
              <item label="(">
                <para>1 ) The Commonwealth Parliament should have power to make laws with respect to corporations. </para>

            <para>Since then the High Court decision in <inline font-style="italic">Strickland</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Rocla Concrete Pipes Limited</inline> in 197 1 has indicated that the existing power extends at least to the regulation of the trading activities of trading corporations. However, the full scope of the power remains to be finally determined by the High Court. </para>
            <para>In 1973 the first meeting of the Australian Constitutional Convention referred the question of amendment of the corporations power to its Standing Committee 'A' for consideration and report. The Committee is yet to report upon that reference. When the Committee's report is available, the Government will consider the Committee's views. In doing so, the Government will take into account the recommendations made by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Review in 1959. </para>
            <para>The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs announced in July last year the Government's attitude to the general approach the Commonwealth should take in the area of companies and securities industry regulation. </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth decided then that the responsible course of action was to seek the agreement of the States to an effective co-operative scheme rather than to legislate unilaterally. Such a solution would achieve both uniformity and the necessary degree of national regulation whilst, at the same time, preserving existing administrative structures at State level. An important element of the Commonwealth's approach is that it does not involve a formal reference of power by the States to the Commonwealth. </para>
            <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> informed the House on 17 March 1977, a provisional agreement has now been reached for adoption of a general framework for a co-operative CommonwealthState scheme for the regulation of the entire field of companies and the securities industry. Ministers discussed the matter further in Perth on 6 May last when considerable progress was made. Ministers are due to consider the matter again on 3 June next. </para>

I can assure the honourable senator that the Government is satisfied that stage 2 can be implemented to enable the collection of taxes or allowances of rebates imposed or allowed by any State that decides to impose a surcharge or grant a rebate of the kind for which the scheme provides. </para>

            <para>I refer to the announcement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders,</inline> Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, concerning the transfer of an officer who gave advice in his own free time to a member of Parliament. Did the Attorney-General authorise <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> to make this statement? On what grounds is it considered that the officer placed himself in conflict with his departmental duties? Does the Minister consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders'</inline> action infringes on the International Labour Organisation Convention No. 111? Will the Minister clarify the ambit of duty of departmental officers as it relates to their own time and will he indicate the guidelines which exist for public servants? Does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harders</inline> decision mean that public servants cannot engage in political activities outside their normal working hours? </para>

            <para>All programs sponsored by the Commonwealth Government in respect of Aboriginal affairs are designed to help Aboriginals overcome special disadvantages arising from their Aboriginality, including acts of racial discrimination. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs works closely on such matters with the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations, other Commonwealth and State Departments, and with influential community groups and will continue to do so in order to inform all members of the Australian community of their rights and obligations, whether they be informal or as set down in the Racial Discrimination Act, in respect of dealings with members of another race. </para>

Wharton) seeking his comments on Professor Larsen 's findings and on the general incidence of racial discrimination in Queensland so far as Aboriginals and Islanders are concerned. Officers of my Department's Townsville office also maintain close relations with the Townsville Consultative Committee established to encourage the development of inter-racial harmony in the area. </para>

I do not believe there are any Aboriginal Land Trusts in Queensland. For details of problems in relation to purchases by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission for Aboriginal communities in Queensland see reply to Senate Question No. 255. Aboriginal co-operatives, housing associations and other bodies have, in recent years, purchased a substantial number of blocks. It is not practicable to obtain details of all these purchases. </para>

The Company has advised my Department that as a result of research undertaken at Rockhampton in May 1976, which included consultation with the Rockhampton District Aboriginal and Islander Co-operative Society Ltd, provision has been made in the Company's acquisition program for the 1 977-78 financial year for the provision of a hostel for transient Aboriginals. It is intended that the hostel will cater for adults and families transient between areas such as Woorabinda, Duaringa and Rockhampton. Funds for the Company's program will depend upon Budget decisions. </para>
            <para>The Company has been requested to keep the abovementioned Society informed of the progress it makes towards fulfilling its objective of providing a hostel at Rockhampton. </para>

Furthermore in the light of background information and comment later provided to me by the ABC I did not subsequently consider that the matter warranted a full scale investigation.

            <para>I requested a review of the direct or bulk-billing arrangements to be completed around the end of May, if possible, and expect the report to be with me within a few days. The review is being undertaken by the Department of Health and the Health Insurance Commission. On receipt of the report the Government will consider what action, if any, should be taken. </para>
            <para>The honourable senator will be aware that the Government has accepted the Pathology Services Working Party recommendation that bulk-billing for pathology services be available only to eligible pensioners and their dependants. There are, of course, special considerations that apply to pathology services which generally do not apply to other medical services. The main difference is that in most clinical settings, the patient is aware of what transpired between himself and his doctor so that he can verify the services involved in the direct-billing form, but pathology tests in the vast majority of circumstances are undertaken on specimens, not on patients, so verification by the patient is not possible. </para>

        <para>The Standing Committees and the technical subcommittees of Councils of Commonwealth/State Ministers (Agriculture, Forestry, Water Resources, Nature Conservation, Fisheries, and the Environment) advise on research needs and co-ordination both in a general manner and in respect of particular problems. CSIRO, the Department of Primary Industry and the State Departments take these deliberations into account when formulating their research strategies. </para>
        <para>Rural Industry Research Funds are established for the following primary industries: wool, beef, sheep meat, chicken meat, pig, wheat, dairy, tobacco, honey, egg and dried vine fruits. The research funds are formed by a levy on production of the commodity in question supported usually by an equal contribution from the Commonwealth Government. The committees which administer the funds comprise representatives of primary producers, Commonwealth and State Governments and universities, and are usually set up under Commonwealth legislation. They provide an important means for joint consideration of the research needed to support their particular rural industry and influence the direction of research by providing or withholding research monies. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth Extension Services Grant (CESG) administered by the Department of Primary Industry, and the Rural Credits Development Fund ( RCDF) administered by the Reserve Bank, are two other important sources of funds for agricultural research. Monies from the CESG go solely to State Government Departments and monies from the RCDF go mainly, but not exclusively, to universities. The administering authorities influence the direction of research in a manner similar to the Rural Industry Research Fund Committees. </para>

            <para>The question has been interpreted as relating to the central organisation of the Department of the Treasury and not to other associated organisations, such as the Taxation Office and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, for which the Treasurer is the responsible Minister. Expenditure in respect of the Office of the Australian Government Actuary and Life Insurance Commissioner and the Office of the Insurance Commissioner is, however, met from the same Heads of Expenditure in the Appropriation Acts as the central organisation of the Department of the Treasury, and for that reason the following figures include allocations in respect of those Offices. It might also be noted that the following figures relate only to Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 1976-77 and do not include proposed additional appropriations contained in Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4 that are now before the Senate. </para>
            <para>Amounts of $18,593,300, $4,636,600, and $613,900 were appropriated by Appropriation Acts Nos I and 2 1976-77 (see Divisions 670/1,670/2, 670/2, and 963/1/03) for the Department of the Treasury for salaries; administrative expenses (excluding other services) and plant and equipment respectively. Following the abolition of the former Department of the Treasury on 7 December 1 976 and the allocation of former Treasury functions between the newly-created Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance, amounts of $5,857,600, $1,767,700, and $488,600 were withdrawn by administrative action from the appropriations for salaries, administrative expenses (excluding other services), and plant and equipment respectively. The 1976-77 appropriations available for salaries, administrative expenses (excluding other services) and plant and equipment are therefore $12,735,700, $2,868,900, and $125,300 respectively. </para>

            <para>An appropriate Budget deficit is not just a single number that remains appropriate however it comes about. As I explained in my Budget Speech the deficit in 1976-77, which is arrived at after forgoing revenue of not less than SI, 2 50m on account of personal tax indexation and the investment allowance, is very different in character and economic effects from the deficits in 1974-75 and 1975-76. The appropriateness of a deficit also depends on the methods used to finance it; an otherwise appropriate deficit financed largely through the printing presses would have serious implications for the money supply, inflation and the whole economic situation. </para>
            <para>The 1976-77 deficit has proved to be about what was needed in the conditions in which the Budget was framed. The economy is registering recovery at the rate we envisaged and at the same time considerable progress has been made in reducing inflation. </para>
            <para>The Government has already indicated that outlays will be contained to within zero real growth in the 1977-78 Budget and that, after allowing for the further large taxation reductions already announced, the deficit will be further reduced. A Budget within that broad framework is appropriate to current and prospective economic conditions. </para>

The statement indicated that the creation of a developmental lease was central to the proposals. I understand that the Queensland Government has not yet reached a decision on the proposals. </para>

            <para>Consideration has been given to issues raised by the proposal made by the Honourable Member for Hawker in the context of the question of a natural disaster insurance scheme. </para>
            <para>The Government recognises that the success of such a scheme- to which the government is committed in principlewill depend, in part, upon the formulation and pursuit of appropriate policies to mitigate the incidence of losses to property arising from natural hazards. This is one of the considerations which led to the proposal (outlined in the discussion paper on a proposed natural disaster insurance scheme released on 8 December 1976 by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) that a Mitigation Committee be established to advise on appropriate policies directed at improving natural hazard risks. </para>
            <para>While the preliminary work to establish the Committee is not yet completed, it is envisaged that the Committee will be drawing upon expertise from a variety of sources within Government and elsewhere that undertake research into matters such as land use planning and building codes. These are matters which touch upon significant responsibilities of the States and it will be important to see that the activities of the Committee are conducted in close liaison with relevant State authorities. </para>
            <para>It is envisaged that, as the question of a natural disaster insurance scheme is further considered by the Government examination will be given to the question whether, and if so what, action to facilitate improved co-ordination of research in this area on a continuing basis would be appropriate. </para>

              <para>I would refer the honourable senator to my statemen in the House of Representatives on 24 March 1977 concern ing the migration of East Timorese now in Portugal. In tha statement I mentioned that some 560 East Timores evacuees had applied for movement to Australia. It has since emerged from interviews that some of the persons applying were not in fact evacuees but have resided in Portugal foi some time. In addition, some of the applicants appear not te be seeking permanent settlement in Australia but rather : temporary location close to East Timor. </para>

          <para>Lump sum payments are made annually by the Department of Defence to the University of Melbourne for expenditure in the Physics and Aeronautical Science Departments of the RAAF Academy at Point Cook. In the current financial year the amounts concerned are $50,000 and SI 2,000 respectively. They fund a number of on-going research activities by University of Melbourne staff and civilian and RAAF officers of the Academy. Physics research mostly concerns the upper atmosphere; aeronautical science research involves wind-tunnel and communications experiments. </para>
          <para>Some dozens of research projects or activities are also carried on in the Faculty of Military Studies at the Royal Military College. </para>
          <para>Examples demonstrating the variety of the work in hand include a project entitled 'Italy in the Fiction of Henry James': research into the use of a low-temperature cryostat, operating at 0.005°K above absolute zero with applied fields up to 8 Tesla to study the anisotropy of radiations from oriented radioactive nuclei: and sedimentation and water quality studies in the Tuggeranong district of the A.C.T. and the impact of urban growth on these characteristics. lt would be impractical to cost each project as a separate component of the on-going educational programme of the Faculty. </para>
          <para>The Department of Defence also contributes financially to research activities in Universities or other post-secondary institutions not directly associated with the Defence Force. </para>
          <para>There are currently five such projects to which the total allocation of Defence funds over several years is $147,329. They involve research into the magnetic properties of the iron-chromium-cobalt alloy system, underwater target detection using sonar, analytical techniques for underwater detection signal processing, the prevention of deleterious changes in muscle during dehydration, and the causes and prevention of accidents. </para>
          <para>It would require Public Service effort and manpower at a cost disproportionate to the small total cost of all of the activities referred to above to identify, analyse and individually cost each in the great particularity explicit in the honourable senator's question.

          <para>No activities or projects of the kind described have been arranged by or come to the attention of the Australian Government Departments most likely to be concerned, viz. Defence, Education, Science and Foreign Affairs. It needs to be kept in mind that there are about 800 post-secondary institutions in Australia; I understand that neither the Department of Education nor the State Education Authorities routinely collect detailed information on research projects undertaken in all fields and disciplines and their sources of funds. I do not believe that the matter warrants my requesting the Minister for Education to authorise the effort and expense that would be required to conduct a survey of each of the 800 institutions. </para>

            <para>It has been estimated that income tax revenue would have been increased by some $ 1 92m if a marginal rate of 100 per cent had applied to taxable incomes over $20,000 in assessments of individual taxpayers that were included in the income tax statistics for the 1974-75 income year. It may be doubted, however, whether many taxpayers would have continued to derive taxable income in excess of $20,000 in that year if the marginal rate of 100 per cent had been applicable in the 1 974-75 income year. </para>

            <para>The Public Service Board provided a progress report of its views on seventy-eight recommendations of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration on 30 November 1976. A summary of the Board's comments was released to the media on 13 December and I have arranged for a copy of the press release to be sent to the honourable senator. In its press release the Board pointed out that in its ongoing consideration of the Commission's recommendations the Board will be having consultations with the peak councils of staff organisations and other bodies as appropriate. The Board also said that its examination of the recommendations indicated that implementation of many of the Commission 's recommendations would involve a substantial effort and progress on some recommendations would take time. Work is continuing on these recommendations and consultations with staff organisations are proceeding. </para>

          <para>It is presently estimated that eligible expenditure to be met by the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments under the arrangements will total around $6.6 million, of which $750,000 is expected to be expended in 1 976-77. The rate of expenditure in respect of relief measures arising out of this disaster has been influenced by difficulties of access to the area and shortages of certain types of labour and materials. </para>
          <para>Because of the nature of the natural disaster expenditure cost sharing arrangements it is impracticable to specify what proportion of total expenditures arising out of a particular disaster are met from State resources and what proportion from Commonwealth resources. However, in the case of Queensland it is presently estimated that the Commonwealth will reimburse in 1976-77 some SI 8.4 million out of total eligible disaster relief and restoration expenditures in that year of $20.4 million. </para>

            <para>I do not accept the simplistic proposition that there is no Australian energy policy. Quite simply expressed, the Government's policy is, as the statement of matters dealt with by my Department set out in the Administrative Arrangements Order of 22 December 1975 might indicate, to bring about the balanced development of Australia's resources having regard to future requirements. A more detailed statement would be an elaboration of this. I would be the first to agree, however, that there is an urgent need to define in detail an integrated long term approach to the realisation of this basic policy objective. </para>
            <para>The development of such an integrated approach is being actively pursued by the Government at the present time. Energy policy is, however, a complex subject requiring detailed and expert analysis, and is a task which the Government cannot, and will not, undertake in isolation. </para>
            <para>It is for this reason that I announced, on 10 February 1977, the establishment of a National Energy Advisory Committee, as foreshadowed in the coalition parties statement on Minerals and Energy Policy issued prior to the last elections. </para>
            <para>I will be looking to the Committee for advice on Australia's energy reserves and on factors likely to influence the pattern of energy supply and demand, and future costs, in Australia; the assessment of and development of our energy resources, and the economy of use of energy. </para>

            <para>Situations can arise in Offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service when it is necessary to communicate to another officer information of an adverse nature about a client at a time when the applicant concerned or other clients are present. It indicates to the receiving officer that something factual of an unfavourable nature is known about the applicant and that further inquiries need to be made. </para>
            <para>It was concern for the feelings of the client that prompted the introduction of the code many years ago. Its use in the circumstances I have mentioned has avoided embarrassment to clients. The term 'coded insults' is therefore quite out of keeping with the purpose of the code and the motivation behind its introduction and use. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) The honourable senator will be aware that dieback is a diseased condition of trees which can be associated with a number of factors including fire, soil moisture conditions, nutritional disorders, insect attack and fungal pathogens such as the root-rot disease Phytophthora cinnamomi. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>I am not aware of any concrete evidence to support a view that the incidence of dieback associated with disease is increasing in Victorian forests. An increased awareness of the diseased condition in recent years and improved detection have resulted in increasing number of reports on dieback occurrence. However some occurrences may not be recent developments but rather ones of long-standing duration. Consequently we are faced with a difficult problem of separating detection of existing dieback from spread of disease. </para>
          <para>The Victorian Forests Commission is paying close attention to the incidence of dieback and may be in a position to supply the honourable senator with some more specific information on the incidence of dieback in Victoria. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Development of the disease Phytophthora cinnamomi is commonly associated with man's activity. 1 am advised that there is no evidence that woodchipping or timber-felling is any more significant in promoting disease development than, for example, road construction, developments for tourism, house construction or any other activities which influence soil and moisture conditions. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The dieback condition has been studied by many organisations in Australia including most agricultural departments, all forestry authorities, CSIRO and many universities. Research has not yet produced practical control measures and, obviously, more research will be required before we can hope for any breakthrough. I should also point out that it is unlikely that the threat of dieback will ever be eliminated; research can aim only at control. </para>

            <para>In my reply of 5 October 1 976 1 indicated 1 would be meeting with members of the Social Security Appeals Tribunals. The meeting was held in Melbourne in November 1976. </para>
            <para>The major problem of delay was discussed with the object of formulating procedures and providing facilities so that the shortest possible time elapses between the making and the finalising of an appeal. Since the meeting, additional Tribunal members have been appointed. In short, every possible effort is being made to eliminate delays. </para>
            <para>The question of an independent review of decisions of the Department of Social Security has been under consideration for some time. As early as 2 1 September 1 976 I indicated in the Senate, in reply to a question from the Estimates Committee, that clients of the Department of Social Security should have the same access to an appeal mechanism as people dealing with other Acts of Parliament. I was referring to the implementation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and expressed the desire to ensure that a person would have the right to seek a review of a decision made under the Social Services Act by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal where that decision was not in accordance with a recommendation of a Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </para>
            <para>I expressed these views again at the meeting of Social Security Appeals Tribunal members and shortly afterwards I asked the Attorney-General to draft suitable regulations. As indicated in my press statement of 27 May 1977, officers of my Department and the Attorney-General 's Department are in the process of preparing the regulations. </para>
            <para>The rights of clients of the Department of Social Security have been of continuing concern to me and it will be seen that, as a result of the initiatives taken during 1976, people who have dealings with my Department will have access, when the proposed regulations become law, to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal whenever the Director-General does not uphold the recommendation of a Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </para>

              <para>1 )  and  (2)  I regret that it is not practicable to provide the information sought by the honourable senator. On the basis of the records kept it is not possible to separate the effects of the devaluation of the Australian dollar on  29  November  1 976  from the various other factors affecting overseas expenditures. One reason for this is that the value of the Australian dollar, in terms of the foreign currencies in which Australian Government payments are made, has varied since  29  November last. These variations have been due to decisions to change the link between the value of the Australian dollar and the trade-weighted 'basket' of currencies used to determine the exchange rate, and to the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the currencies in the 'basket' through the normal operation of the 'basket' system. It is also relevant that departments have been required, to the maximum extent practicable, to absorb cost increases through the achievement of further economies in their expenditures. </para>

Initially, trade in beef has been prejudiced by political decisions of governments in most countries which are major importers of Australian beef. These decisions were neither predictable nor to be expected when generally optimistic forecasts of future beef demand were made some years ago. </para>

            <para>I should add that over the years 1972 to 1974 Commonwealth funds for technical education were provided under the States Grants (Technical Training) Act 1971-1973 which operated on a financial year basis, and under the States Grants (Technical Training Fees Reimbursement) Act 1974, which operated for the first half of 1974. Consequently expenditure details for calendar years are not available prior to 1975. Details of actual payments made under these Acts during the relevant financial years are shown in Budget Paper No. 7: 'Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities'. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>When announcing the measures to replace tax rebates for children and students with increased family allowances in his comprehensive economic statement on 20 May 1976, the Treasurer said that one effect of the new system would be to bring about some redistribution of income within families. He pointed out that the family allowances would continue to be paid to the mother. He said this would mean that the takehome pay of many fathers would be reduced as a result of the withdrawal of the tax rebates, but that there would be no great effect on the overall position of families who had been able to take full advantage of the rebates. The measures would, on the other hand, greatly improve the position in respect of some 800 000 children in about 300 000 low income families paying little or no income tax. </para>
            <para>These include the children of widow and invalid pensioners, of workers close to the minimum wage or in intermittent employment, of self-employed people unable to earn an adequate income, and of many Aborigines, recently-arrived migrants and other disadvantaged groups. I commend the Treasurer's statement to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> as a source of detail on the matter. </para>

            <para>Yes. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act requires that the members of a land trust shall be appointed by the Minister on a nomination received in response to a request which may be made either to the land council for the area in which the trust is to hold land or. where the trust is to hold land in the area of an Aboriginal council, from that Aboriginal council. Because no councils have yet been established under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976. I have only requested nominations from the Land Councils. </para>

            <para>No. My Department does not determine eligibility for unemployment benefit; that is a matter for the Department of Social Security. My Department, through the Commonwealth Employment Service, reports to the Department of Social Security as to claimants' satisfaction or otherwise  or  the 'work test', which comprises the process of registering claimants for employment, seeking suitable employment for them, and determining whether they are prepared to accept offers of such work. </para>
            <para>Part of the guidelines under which CES applies the work test covers the possibility that persons may deliberately place themselves in situations where they will remain, or are likely to remain, unemployed in order to qualify for benefit. However, the application of this provision has not led my Department to any declaration of areas or prescription of qualifying periods of residence. </para>
