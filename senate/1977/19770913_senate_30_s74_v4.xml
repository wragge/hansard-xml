            <para>- I should like to say a few words on the sad announcement that you have made to the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> Not only was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Haylen</inline> a member of this Parliament for the Division  of  Parkes for  20  years from  1943  to  1963,  but proudly I state that he, his wife Sylvia and his sons, Ron and Wayne, were close personal friends  of  mine and of my family. Les Haylen was a distinguished member of the Australian Parliament. He was a distinguished member of the Australian Authors Society. He was a distinguished member of the Australian Journalists Association. He always fought strongly in this Parliament for the things that he felt were deeply Australian. He always believed in this country. I regarded him not only as an outstanding Labor man but also as a very great Australian. He was a great man. I am personally pleased that for many years I was closely associated with him in his work in this Parliament, in the Labor movement, and in the Australian community generally. The world is worse off for the passing of Les Haylen. </para>

            <para>-I should like to supplement the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. For many years there was a lack  of  Australian political novels. I commend to anybody the reading of the novel <inline font-style="italic">Blood Upon the Wattle '46,</inline> the author of which was Leslie Clement Haylen. It delved into the composition of people who aspired to the national Parliament. It was one of those novels whose characters had warts and all. Those who knew Les Haylen knew only too well that he could always debunk people if he thought they were too pompous. I know, as my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, said, that Les Haylen had a certain wit. He had another particular quality which I do not think too many people have. A person could be an adversary of Les Haylen 's at a political gathering. When he came out Les Haylen forgot it. He always wanted to be mates. I suppose that Henry Lawson's concept of mateship always rated very high with Les Haylen. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Far too often when people leave this Parliament they become a little sullen and dispirited and do not involve themselves in political campaigns as they should. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland would agree with me that in the vital national election campaigns in  1969, 1972, 1974  and  1975-I  think this is the nicest comment that I can personally apply to Les Haylen- Les Haylen did not feel it infra dig to be out on the street corners in the electorate of Evans where his family lived putting a point of view to the people on the kerbside. That epitomises to me political democracy. I think that is the nicest tribute I can pay to Leslie Clement Haylen. </para>

            <para>-I should like to associate myself with the expressions of sympathy and condolence to the wife and family of Leslie Haylen. During the years that Leslie Haylen was in this Parliament he always projected to me a picture of a man of great sincerity, an earthy man who knew the way the country should go. But of course, unfortunately, he did not remain in the Parliament long enough to participate while his party, our party, was in government. But in the advisory areas of our party Les Haylen was always highly respected. He was a man who had a great ability to express himself with humour and with earthiness. Perhaps I might recite to the Senate a very telling poem of his titled 'Inflation'. It went this way: </para>

          <para class="block">I put that on the record, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> because it indicates the attitude Les Haylen had towards events. There are a lot of telling lines in that poem. He was a man who came to grips with reality. He was a man who was very much loved by the members of his party. I know of the respect and admiration in which he was held by the party in New South Wales. I grieve with his wife and his family, who were so close to him, in their tremendous loss. I offer them my very deepest sympathy in their very sad loss. </para>

            <para>-I should like to be associated with the expressions of condolence that have been offered by members on this side of the House at the very sad passing of Les Haylen. I, like my colleagues, had been associated with him for more than a generation- some 25 years or more. I cannot match the eloquence, although my personal files show many poems of the calibre and capacities, of the poem that has been so ably presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Justin</inline> O 'Byrne. This is probably not the time to refer to those poems because they deal with some of the internal matters of the Parliament and of the party to which we belong, but they are rich in humour, they are rich in relevance and they are rich in the folklore of the development of the political and social movements of our country. Les Haylen, of course, epitomised the very rich experiences of the political life of our country. He was a journalist of great repute in the 1930s and 1940s before he came into this Parliament, and I think he brought into the Parliament a great sense of humour and wit as well as courage and conviction, which so often are lacking. I think that sometimes we forget the brighter side of life, the side of life that Les </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Haylen was always able to bring to a political debate or to some of the internal matters which affect the party to which be belonged. </para>
          <para>It is true that he served the people of Australia in this Parliament for a little more than 20 years, and they were difficult years from the Labor Party's point of view. Les was an innovator, an initiator, a goer, if I may use that expression. He wanted to see things changed; he was about social change. Yet he lived in a period when there was not a great deal of movement for the things in which he believed. Nevertheless, he never lost his faith or his belief that changes would be made. I think it is probably true to say that he was a casualty of the Vietnam war in the sense that it was because of the struggles of the 1960s that Les lost his seat in one of those pendulum swings that are notorious in Australian politics. He then sought to come back through the Senate, but because of the activities of the extreme Right in Australian politics, he failed to gain a place in this august chamber. I have no doubt that if he had succeeded he would have enlivened the proceedings and he might well have been a member of this chamber when he died had he been elected on that occasion in the mid-1960s. </para>
          <para>He was a prolific writer, as my colleagues have suggested. He was associated with the Australian Book Society because he believed in the principle that Australians should write about their experiences. He wrote many books, some of which were published by the Australian Book Society of which he was an honoured member. On one occasion I think my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland assisted in a function associated with that organisation, to which Les had given unstinting and unselfish service. It is getting to be something of a habit in this place in recent times to pay tribute to departed comrades of the Houses of Parliament, whether it be the House of Representatives or the Senate. I hope that we will not be required to speak of another of our late colleagues for a considerable period of time. The Parliament itself loses by the death of its distinguished members, and I am sure that we can put Les Haylen into the category of having been a distinguished member of the Opposition. In those circumstances, I am sure that we would want to pay our tribute to him. To his family, who lived with him in Summer Hill for a great number of years, I extend not only my own personal sympathies and condolences in their sad loss but also those of all members of the Parliament and certainly all members of my own party. I can only express the hope that the members of his family will draw some consolation from the  fact that the prestige which Les enjoyed in the Parliament has been recorded today in the expressions of condolence. </para>

            <para>-I certainly will pass that suggestion on to my colleague in the other place. I think most people throughout the world are horrified at the absolute slaughter which has happened in some parts of South East Asia in recent months. I have been asked a number of questions about this matter by honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. One of the problems in responding is the difficulty in getting any hard information out of those countries. What information has come out and has been authenticated has indicated that if not genocide certainly large-scale mass slaughter has taken place. I think the honourable senator's suggestion is a most valuable one. As I said, I will pass it on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </para>

Is the Minister aware that there is considerable speculation within the Australian community whether the Government intends introducing what has been referred to commonly by some Ministers as a super tax' or, in other terms, a resources tax? Can the Minister say when a determination will be made in this matter? If not, can he say what capacity there is within the Department of National Resources to be able to assess the damaging impact that continued speculation concerning the Government's intentions for a resources tax is having and will continue to have on potential investment in resource extractive industries? </para>

Therefore, I do not intend to add to such speculation.

I ask: Will students and individuals who lodged sums of money with AUS Travel be fully reimbursed, and when? What role has Qantas Airways Ltd played in the scheme of arrangement and, in particular, is Qantas forgoing any debts? Are the accounts of AUS Travel for the year ending 31 March 1977 required to be lodged at the Victorian Corporate Affairs Office?

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Missen</inline>asks four distinct questions with regard to the future of AUS Travel Service Pty Ltd and its ramifications. I have considerable information on the matter. The first question related to the reimbursement of students and individuals. I am informed that individuals who have lodged money with AUS Travel Service Pty Ltd will be reimbursed by either obtaining travel in accordance with their desires after the payment of a lawful surcharge or obtaining a refund in accordance with prescribed conditions and subject to the prescribed refund penalties. The second question was in regard to the role of Qantas Airways Ltd. I am advised that the role of Qantas in the scheme is no different from that of any other airline. Qantas agreed to participate in the scheme of arrangement on the same basis as all other airlines which were creditors of AUS Travel Service Pty Ltd. They were Thai Airways International, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, Singapore Airlines Ltd, Malasian Airline System, </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Scandinavian Airlines System and TransAustralia Airlines. All airline creditors have placed a moritorium on their current AUS Travel debt which is to be paid for in 16 quarterly instalments over the next four years with the payment of 25 per cent of the original debt being made in quarterly instalments in the fifth year on account ofinterest. </para>
          <para>In regard to the third question, I am advised that AUS Travel is an exempt proprietary company incorporated in Victoria. Under the Victorian companies legislation, an exempt proprietary company whose accounts have been audited for the financial year covered by the annual return is not required to file copies of its financial statement with the annual return. I am also informed that in the past the accounts of AUS Travel have been audited. </para>
          <para>As to the final question regarding the old management, I state that while the system of arrangement operates, the administrators appointed under the scheme are charged with the duty to manage the continuing operations of the company subject to the guidance of the committee of management appointed by the scheme creditors. The directors of the company have no powers of management during the operation of the scheme except as may be delegated to them by the administrators. When the scheme has been wholly effectuated, it will be terminated and the powers of management will revert to the directors of the company to be exercised in the normal manner in terms of the memorandum and articles of association. </para>

            <para>-I state very briefly: Yes, of course, I will. When this matter came to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges'</inline> attention, he asked some questions. He came to see me and I had the officers of the tourist branch of the Department do what they could to look into this matter as carefully as they could and I asked that they be as helpful as they possibly could be. I felt at the time that the airline companies who had in effect sold tickets had some responsibility towards collecting the money for those tickets and carrying the people who paid for the tickets. Basically, it seems to me that the situation now looks a lot tidier. I will certainly say to the people concerned that the honourable senator appreciates what they did to try to help. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Education. Recognising the Minister's undoubted talents in enabling him to maintain a favourable allocation for what has obviously been a careful and somewhat difficult Budget for his most important portfolio of education, will he again use those talents in the reconsideration of his statement concerning Commonwealth grants for schools to obtain from the Treasurer additional funds to add to the most desirable program of assistance for private schools rather than reducing the amounts previously available for services and development for special projects and for other purposes? </para>

            <para>-I will draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the substance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall's question. I think all honourable senators would like to see the level of funds maintained. In general terms, there has been a misunderstanding as to the overall picture of funding of education, the interpretation being related entirely to the money going directly to the States from the Schools Commission. When that is looked at there is a rigidity and there is some transfer of funds. If the honourable senator looks at the Schools Commission report, he will notice a very gratifying thing: In the last year the States have been able to increase the proportion that education receives from their total Budget from 28.4 per cent to 29.4 per cent. Education in that area will be largely for Government schools. I am happy to tell the honourable senator that the amount of one per cent above maintenance of effort means that through the tax sharing system predominantly, about an extra $75m will have gone to the States in the last year for primarily State Government schools. The idea that there is some cut back or rigidity is quite wrong. The honourable senator rightly draws attention to joint or shared programs. They are of concern because they contain innovations. They bring together the two streams of education. I will draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the question. </para>

I refer the Minister to the statement made yesterday by the  Chairman  of the Uranium Producers Forum, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mackay,</inline> that the present Government was drunk with power. That comment was made in relation to statements which have been made by Ministers of the Government concerning a proposed resources tax. My question is not related to speculation; it is related to current facts. I ask the Minister In view of the statement made by the  Deputy  Prime Minister expressing one view in relation to a resources tax and the statement made by the Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen,</inline> expressing another view in relation to a resources tax, what is the present policy of the Government in relation to a resources tax? Which of those two people is expressing the Government's policy? Is the Federal Minister or the Queensland Premier, in his interpretation of the views of the Prime Minister, expressing the correct view? To which resource commodities will the tax apply in accordance with present Government statements? </para>

That is the first thing I ought to say. Any interpretation that a Premier of a particular State wishes to put on any ministerial statement is not necessarily a correct interpretation.

              <para>- I remember very well, because as caretaker Minister I had to do some clearing up after the Whitlam Government, that this was a matter which for 3 years the Whitlam Government had looked at and done nothing about. That is heavily upon my mind. May I remind the Senate that the report of the Bureau of Transport Economics was brought down last year and made available to the public for public comment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> will agree that this is important. From recollection, in fact it put forward a scheme of development different from the one that had been foreshadowed previously. I understand that the Minister will be in a position very soon- I hope within immediate weeks -to make a statement. My brief has a notification regarding the Commonwealth Games. It says that the new international terminal complex is coping with current traffic; that it could readily handle additional traffic; and that subject to appropriate scheduling it would cope with increased passenger activity likely to result from the 1982 Commonwealth Games. I will pass the question of the honourable senator to my colleague, the Minister. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> has any further questions I will be happy to pass them on also. </para>

The Minister will recall that last week I asked whether she was aware of a shortage of cocaine in Australia's major hospitals. Is she aware that this was confirmed in a statement at the weekend by the Medical Superintendent of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, who said that unless the hospital received supplies within the next few days surgeons would have to resort to general anaesthetics, of course, with consequent added risk to the patient, for certain surgical procedures that are normally carried out by local anaesthetic using cocaine? The Superintendent also confirmed, as I have stated, that although this drug was not obtainable through government sources it appeared to be readily available on the illicit market, which in my view is an appalling state of affairs. Has the Minister discussed this with her colleague? If so, what is the Government doing to ensure that hospitals are provided with supplies of this important drug? </para>

            <para>- I did discuss the matter with the Minister for Health following the previous question. I am not aware of the particuars as stated with regard to the Royal Adelaide Hospital and its problems, but I am able to say that the Minister for Health is aware that there is a shortage of cocaine at major hospitals.  His  department has issued licensed importers with permits to import a total of 21.6 kilograms during the calendar year 1977. However, to date only 5.5 kilograms have been imported because of the unavailability of supplies in Europe and the United Kingdom. As at 13 August stocks of cocaine held by wholesalers throughout Australia totalled less than 200 grams. There is a worldwide decrease in the manufacture of cocaine. The International Narcotics Control Board has reported that manufacture in the United States of America fell from 980 kilograms in 1974 to 702 kilograms in 1975, the latest year for which data are available. However, it is understood that this trend is continuing. Exports from Peru, a traditional exporter of crude cocaine for further refining, have fallen from 343 kilograms in 1971 to 57 kilograms in 1975. The United Kingdom, which obtains its material from the United States of America, is Australia's usual supplier, but is unable to fill orders at this stage. Inquiries are also being made in Europe with little success. Further efforts are being made by the Government and by industry to locate supplies both overseas and from Australian importers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>With regard to the availability of cocaine from the Australian illicit market, seizures have not been very substantial. Substances imported illegally and alleged to be cocaine have been found to have been adulterated with other drugs which preclude legitimate medical use. The Minister for Health has this matter under active consideration. If there is any further information that I can give with regard to the relief of the problem in the major hospitals I will see that the honourable senator is supplied with it. </para>

It is supported initially by the Leader of the Opposition and then the leaders of the other parties and any honourable senator who desires to join in the expression of condolence. The honourable senator would also know that certain persons do not have a motion moved on their behalf because they do not fall within the agreed categories. Their names are but mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> It has become a custom for any honourable senator who wishes to stand and make a personal contribution- I emphasise the word 'personal'- to do so. In fact, I would suspect that strictly speaking under the Standing Orders they ought to ask for leave to do so but that is generally waived in these circumstances. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is a difference with regard to the formal motion of condolence which is moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. That is done upon the death of certain heads of state, Governors-General, members of the Royal Family, former Prime Ministers, whom I think fall within this category, and sitting honourable senators and honourable members. I think former Ministers also fall within that category. The normal formality is gone through. The honourable senator may recall that the custom at one stage was for the death of members of the other place not to be mentioned at all in this place and that occasionally honourable senators took the opportunity in the adjourment debate to read into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> their personal views of deceased colleagues. </para>
          <para>As to today's incident, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Haylen</inline> was not a serving member of the Parliament. He was a member of the other place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> as a matter of courtesy, informed the Parliament of his death and a number of his colleagues- I note that they were all New South Welshmen, apart from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> 'Byrne, who had worked very closely with him- added very much their own personal condolences. I think that is a good practice and one which ought to be continued. If the honourable senator believes that the present procedures for dealing with the announcement of the death of members or former members of this Parliament ought to be broadened and made more formal, I would suggest that he should, if he is not still a member of the Standing Orders Committee, seek out one of his colleagues who is and perhaps have it raised there and have a discussion in that area. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I preface it by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that the Hobart Bridge is almost ready for use again after having been out of use for some 32 months. In fact, when I was flying over it in a light aircraft on Friday at least six cars were using it to travel from west to east and a Channel 6 television crew also used it on that day to travel from east to west. I would expect that the Minister is also aware that the honourable member for Franklin and I, amongst the 100,000-pius people who live in Hobart, want a no-nonsense opening of that bridge as soon as possible. Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Transport in Tasmania has said that the holdup of the opening of the bridge is not caused by the associated roadworks and that the apparent delay is only that due to the required sealing of five lanes wide by about a block in area on the new section of the bridge? I have been told that this would be done in two days if the spare bridge fell down tonight. Is the Minister also aware that the Tasman Bridge Reconstruction Commission has announced that the bridge is to be inspected this coming Friday and that the actual date of opening is to be announced after that inspection? The date presently envisaged is 8 October, which is almost another month away. Will the Minister take up with the Minister for Transport the possibility of sending top level department officers to Hobart so that they can accompany the Restoration Committee, which is a joint State and Federal body, on the inspection of the bridge on Friday to ensure that the bridge is opened as soon as possible and is not the subject of bureaucratic delay, particularly as it is Federal money that has financed the project? If it is not possible to open the bridge fully, will the Minister ensure that at least a couple of lanes are open well before 8 October? </para>

            <para>-Senator Townley asked me a question which is, I think, in five parts. At the outset I say that I share his view that, consistent with full safety, the bridge should be opened as soon as possible because of the enormous inconvenience and cost that the people of Hobart have been experiencing. I am aware that the Hobart bridge is approaching completion after some 32 months. I am very much aware of the keen interest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> and the honourable member for Franklin in another place have taken in attempting to expedite the matter and to get the bridge opened without undue ritual. I cannot adjudicate in terms of whether or not the associated road works are delaying completion of the bridge. I have read a Press comment that they are not. I am aware that there is to be an inspection by the Tasman Bridge Reconstruction Commission next Friday. I will certainly ask my colleague in another place to look at the prospect of having Federal officers attend to make the inspection. I will certainly ask my colleague in another place to see whether, consistent with full safety and full facilities, the bridge can be opened before 8 October. </para>

            <para>- There is a detailed statement by the Treasurer with some accompanying figures. I will be as brief as I can and not use all the material that has come to me because if I were to do that honourable senators would be much older by the time I had finished. The features of the changes, first of all, will be, I think, to establish the lifting of the $16,000 limit and the modification to the averaging system that has been announced. The effect really is to allow farmers to put funds aside when they have particularly good years to help in a system when they have particularly bad years. Let us look at the overall position of the system of income tax introduced in the Budget. There are tax reductions for taxpayers generally and a simplified system that improves everybody's position across the board. One or two areas of slight anomaly have been discovered. The intention of the averaging system is to provide for no greater tax liability for the primary producer than for any other taxpayer in receipt of the same average income. There have been, as I said, some isolated cases which needed to be rectified. The main features of the system as it will now be will mean that taxable income will be taxed at average rates when taxable income is higher than average income, that when average income is higher than taxable income the taxable income will be taxed at scale rates, that in calculating the average rate the zero rate on the first $3,750 of taxable income will be taken into account and that the $16,000 income limit for the application of averaging is to be abolished. I have some figures illustrating the examples. I believe they would be useful. I cannot read them out because it would be impossible to follow through the lines that are here. So I seek leave to incorporate the table in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

In view of the Minister's previous answer, are we now to understand that the Government concedes that the original taxation proposals in the Budget would in fact have disadvantaged primary producers?

It is true that basically the whole position has improved for everybody. As I said, there were areas where adjustment was necessary. But would not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> prefer a government that made that adjustment, to a government which refused to make any adjustment when it found adjustments were needed.

            <para>- I have some information on this matter. The Marine Operations Centre did receive a message on this matter from, I think, the whale spotting aircraft. The Department and the Minister are aware that certain incidents took place off Albany last week which involved a whale chaser and people in a motorised rubber dinghy. My understanding is that local police investigated the matter. They were reported in the Press as having concluded their investigation of the incidents. Although the protesters left the area shortly after the incident, the Department of Transport is obtaining material from the police which it will examine, in conjunction with the Attorney-General's Department, to see whether there has been a breach of any Commonwealth requirement such as the collision regulations. Prima facie, there could have been breaches of the Navigation Act which, depending on the circumstances, could involve quite severe penalties to either of the parties involved. However, the question whether a successful prosecution could be launched cannot be assessed until after a full investigation has been completed. </para>

          <para>I think all honourable senators are aware that the question of whale harvesting- its nature and its extent-has been a matter of considerable discussion and controversy throughout the world, including Australia. It is natural that there should be some protest, and one respects the right to protest. But of course the essential thing is that the protest should be carried out within the law and should not in any way impede the due processes of lawful pursuits or of the law itself. </para>

            <para>-I think all honourable senators are aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop's</inline> continuing interest in the problems at Woomera. The last brief I had from my colleague was in August and I will see whether it can be updated. The best information I have at the moment deals with 3 things- the staff reductions, the future of the Woomera village, and the use of the area by the armed Services. The information I have may be of help to the honourable senator, but if it is insufficient he can let me know and I will obtain further and more up to date information for him. Concerning the staff, I am advised that surplus personnel at Salisbury and Woomera have now been identified and advised, using criteria agreed between the Department of Defence, the Public Service Board and the peak councils of the unions concerned. The Department of Defence, with the local Public Service inspector and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, are providing help to these people in their search for new employment. I repeat that compulsory re-deployment or retrenchment is not being considered. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the future of the Woomera village, I am advised that the village and supporting facilities will continue for the foreseeable future to provide facilities primarily for the joint defence space communication station and also to the employees of the joint project during the run-down process and at the care and maintenance level. As to the other question, I am advised that investigations are continuing into the possible uses of Woomera by the Australian Services. An Army exercise using ground troops, aircraft and armoured vehicles is being conducted on the range in September 1977 to assess the financial, logistic and environmental implications of military operations in the area. </para>

            <para>-I will certainly pass on the honourable senator's suggestion. He was kind enough to advise me that he was going to ask the question. Consequently I have the following information from my colleague in the other place. The Minister says: My attention has been drawn to Press reports which allege that a Queensland businessman, Walter James Flynn, travelled abroad on a passport falsely obtained in another person's name. Passport offices are checking to see whether such a passport was issued. The forging of an Australian passport or obtaining such a document by false pretenses is a breach of the law. It would be the responsibility of the Attorney-General's Department to decide whether legal action should be initiated where there is evidence of forgery or false pretences. The Australian Government takes measures comparable to most other governments to prevent the forgery of Australian passports or their being obtained through the provision of false information. An Australian passport may only be issued to an applicant on production of photographs, documentary evidence of citizenship and a signed statement by a person of standing that the applicant is the person he claims to be. Maximum attention is given to maintaining the integrity of a passport against forgery. Measures to secure the issue of passports are continuously under review. As to the last part of the question about the genuine <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flynn,</inline> I will certainly ask my colleague to give proper notice of that in his own Department. </para>

            <para>- One of the questions which I answer as the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs relates to whether I was aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> 's statement with regard to services for migrants. I did read Press reports of the statement. I think I was also asked with regard to the intake of refugees. I confirm that 12,000 Lebanese refugees arrived in this country between June 1976 and May 1977. I believe that some of the matters that were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> in his statement were with regard to unemployment amongst migrants. It should be pointed out that people who have come here as refugees have found it very difficult to obtain employment readily and they have also had many other difficulties in settling in this country. </para>

          <para>As far as the general statement that was issued by the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, I believe that migrant groups and migrants themselves in this country are aware of the Government's attempts through the Department and in other ways to assist them in settling. I believe that they would evaluate the statement with all the inaccuracies that were in it- inaccuracies which related to the funds that were available for migrant services and the claim that these had been cut in the Budget- and the other matters that I read in the Press release and which I know to be incorrect. I am sure that many migrant groups also know them to be incorrect. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and perhaps in part has reference to the responsibilities of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Reflecting on the unemployment figures as at 2 September, released by the Commonwealth Employment Service, which indicated that 9.76 per cent of the work force in the Northern Territory was unemployed, I ask whether the Minister can advise whether it is correct to assume that one person in every three unemployed is an Aboriginal person? Would the greater number of these unemployed Aboriginal people be traditional people from isolated areas, et cetera? Is it the intention of the Government in the future actively to increase funds for work projects rather than pay unemployment benefits or 'sit down money' as the Aborigines refer to it to enable the people to work within their communities on necessary projects rather than live on unemployment benefits? Finally, as it is a matter of concern that the economic reality of the situation in assessing overall unemployment in the Northern Territory is achieved, why is it that Aboriginal people in isolated settlements in the north of South Australia are included in the unemployment figures for the Northern Territory? </para>

The majority of Aboriginals registered for employment are not traditionaloriented people from isolated areas but are mainly from the urban areas of Darwin, Alice Springs and Katherine, and former employees of cattle station owners. Many unemployed Aboriginals in isolated communities do not or are unable to register for unemployment. The report of the interdepartmental working party on Aboriginal employment which was tabled by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the House of Representatives on 26 May referred to this problem. </para>

          <para>The Government has introduced a number of community development employment projects for Aboriginal communities, initially on a pilot basis. One community development employment project is operating at Bamyili near Katherine, and planning is advanced for another at Elcho Island. The effectiveness of these projects will be reviewed by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs with assistance from the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and also my own Department. If the review confirms that the projects are successful, additional moneys will be sought to expand the program. Employment services are provided to people in the far north of South Australia by the Alice Springs office of the Commonwealth Employment Service. Consequently, these figures are reflected in the unemployment figures for the Northern Territory. I think it would be understood that this is because this is dealt with on a regional basis and not because they relate to the Territory as a distict entity. If there are any other questions in the matters raised, I will see that they are answered by the Ministers concerned. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources and follows upon the answer the Minister gave earlier to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. The Minister said that he thought speculation on a resources tax policy, prior to the announcement to any decision, was armful. My question refers also to the answer he gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> in which he said that he would rather accept a statement on a resources tax policy from the  Deputy  Prime Minister than any State Premier. Is the Minister aware that the source of information given by the Premier of Queensland when he assured the Queensland Parliament on Thursday evening last that a resources tax would not be imposed on any mining project in that State was not the  Deputy  Prime Minister but, in fact, the Prime Minister himself? Will the Minister advise the Senate whether the Premier's statement is correct and that therefore a resources tax policy decision apparently has been made. </para>

              <para>- I wish to ask a brief supplementary question. My question was not a case of political point scoring. The difficulty is to get the Premier of Queensland to take the initiative. He has failed to declare a state of emergency. I am hoping that as a result of this question something will be done. Perhaps the Minister can use his offices to do something. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to implement the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission concerning the distribution between States of the local government tax sharing entitlements provided under the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976. The act provides that in 1977-78 and each subsequent year, the amount of general purpose assistance provided to local government authorities will be 1.52 per cent of the previous year's net personal income tax collections. Since the local government tax sharing entitlement is expressed as a percentage of the previous year's tax collections the level of general purpose assistance provided to local government in any year is known with certainty early in that year. Honourable senators will be aware that the earlier Commonwealth suggestion that the States' tax sharing entitlements also be related to the preceding year's personal income tax collections was again raised at the Premiers Conference on 1 July. </para>
          <para>The Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act also sets out the percentage distribution of the funds between the States. The percentage distribution in the Act is that recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its report of May 1976. Following representations from Tasmania the matter of the percentage distribution was again referred early in 1977 to the Commonwealth Grants Commission for inquiry and report. </para>
          <para>The Commission recommended a new and marginally different distribution in its 'Special Report on Financial Assistance for Local Government 1977 ', tabled in the Parliament last May. That distribution was agreed to by all the Premiers at the 1 July Premiers Conference and has been incorporated into this Bill. </para>
          <para>The new distribution means that some States will receive a slightly larger percentage share and some States a slightly smaller percentage share; this is the inevitable result of the arithmetic. </para>
          <para>I point out, however, that the effect of increased net personal income tax collections in 1976- 77 compared with the previous year will swamp the effect of the small reductions for some States arising from the redistribution, and each State will receive substantially more in 1977-78 than it received in 1976-77. On the existing basis of 1.52 per cent of net personal income tax collections being distributed to local government, the amounts payable to local government under this Act will be 18 per cent greater, overall, in 1977- 78 than in 1976-77. The Government considered the matter of the 1.52 percentage share when framing the Budget but decided that it would not see its way to increasing it in the present economic circumstances. </para>
          <para>Last May during the debate in the House of Representatives the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wilson)</inline> suggested that consideration by given to making specific provision in legislation that the Commonwealth Grants Commission should follow equalisation principles in future reviews of local government relativities. I am pleased to inform the Senate that the Government is in consultation with the States on the matter of prescribing guidelines in the Act. We shall be examining the matter further when all the States have made their view known. </para>
          <para class="block">Further legislation may be necessary then. In the meantime, the Government has decided to proceed with this Bill so as not to delay the payment to local government authorities of their tax sharing entitlements for 1977-78. </para>
          <para>This Bill is a short one but it is important, nevertheless. Changes of the kind proposed in this Bill may well be required in the future from time to time. Under this Government's approach to federalism, this change is being proposed after proper process of independent inquiry, as will be any such changes in the future. The Bill continues the arrangements which have been instituted by this Government and which I believe have been of singular benefit to local government in this country. </para>
          <para class="block">Local government received $140m in 1976- 77, an increase of 75 per cent over the level of general purpose assistance provided to it by the Commonwealth in 1975-76. The level of assistance will increase still further to $ 165.3m in 1977- 78. Furthermore, the level of assistance is known very early in each new financial year, and this will assist local authorities with their budgeting. Very importantly, the funds will be untied. This will allow local government authorities to allocate funds in accordance with their own priorities. The inclusion of local government in the tax sharing arrangements has accorded it the status of a genuine partner in our federal system. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I want to speak very briefly tonight about a group of people who are about to undertake a journey across the Nullarbor. They left Perth on Sunday morning to go to Quairading and were to go to Merridan on Monday night. Tonight they will be camping in Kalgoorlie. They will be starting their journey across the Nullarbor on about Thursday of this week. It may not seem very unusual to have people travelling across the Nullarbor in this day and age, but there is a uniqueness about the people of this group in that they are Aboriginals. They have only two cars to transport some 20 people and they do not have a great deal of money but they have found it necessary to travel to Canberra particularly to see the Minister for Aboriginal </para>

In fact, they would consider him to be a long way from the best.

I would like to read into the record the point of view of the Perth Aboriginal fringe dwellers, why they are coming here and what are their aims in making this rather horrendous trip across the Nullarbor without sufficient vehicles to transport them.

            <para>I'd like to go back to that dirty word 'reserve'. These reserves were set down by the early explorers for this purpose only, for Aboriginal people to live on, and they more or less said, squat on this piece of land and well take the rest. Why do the whites want this piece of land they call the reserves? Why do they want it now? </para>
            <para>Shut down the reserves, then naturally the Aboriginal people are going to migrate to the fringes of town. What happens then? You bring them in from the wide open spaces, they're living on the fringes of town, they're suffering, they've got nowhere to go. There's overcrowding in state houses, overcrowding in any private house that's rented by Aboriginals. There's no answer to it. So the Aboriginals pick an open block of land because that block represents the wide open spaces where they come from. If there's no vacant block, they'll pick a bridge and band up together for comfort and understanding, because the black way is to help one another. </para>
            <para>It's wrong for the whites to create a problem that they've got no answer to. If you're going to force the people from the bush and into the fringes of town and give them false hopes, and say you're going to get a state house within the next 5 or 10 years, they're going to be hanging around the fringes of town. </para>
            <para>But what happens when they are evicted from their first trial out into the white community in state housing or a private home? Where do they go? There is no turning-back point to where these people can go. The first thought that comes into their minds is Dad down the road, or Mum, or Uncle or Aunty. This causes overcrowding; these families are in turn evicted. </para>
            <para>If you break up the reserve then you've got to replace that piece of land. That land's got to be on the fringes of town where they know they belong- listen to our desire and you'll get your answer to the problem the whites have created. </para>

          <para class="block">We have seen a situation arise in Western Australia where the State Government returned to the Treasury in 1974-75 a sum of $4.556m which was appropriated by the Federal Government specifically for Aboriginal housing. It was not used. Not one penny of it was used. I am not saying that that would have gone a long way towards housing the people at Lockridge, Saunders Street, Millers Dam or any of the other places in Western Australia, but it would have gone part of the way towards providing land and accommodation for the people who recognise that they do not have the capabilities and the capacity to live in the white man's housing. It would seem that some of these Aborigines are condemned to living under sheets of tin and under the Swan River Bridge, as they did at Guildford for many months before the police and the Shire of Midland eventually moved them forcibly onto a block of land in Saunders Street from which they have now been evicted. Subsequently they camped in a church yard. An interesting article on this subject appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 1 9 August of this year. It was written by Jan  Maymann  and was headed 'Archbishop helped blacks- $95 fine'. The article stated: </para>

          <para class="block">As I said, there is a long history. I want to relate some of the history of the Perth fringe dwellers group. In 1975 and 1976 at Saunders Street, which I mentioned earlier and which is an Aboriginal Lands Trust site, the Aboriginals decided that this was to be their turning back point and that they were going to squat on this piece of land. They applied to have eight houses built by themselves, designed to suit their needs and their extended family lifestyle. But three times plans were submitted to and rejected by the Shire of Swan. Only after a demonstration at the Shire of Swan offices on 14 March of this year by 1 50 Aboriginals and whites were four houses conceded. Even now, despite persistent complaints on health grounds and that of normal human decency, governmental red tape has delayed the provision of an elementary ablution block. </para>
          <para>In April 1977 when their open air camp was burnt out and following constant police pressures a group of fringe dwellers met in Guildford's Stirling Square which is a traditional meeting place in Guildford not only for blacks but also for whites. The fringe dwellers subsequently erected a tent village on Anglican church grounds. Later, as I have already reported, the church was fined for assisting the Aboriginals. Dean Cornish said the church would complain to the United Nations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner,</inline> the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, visited the village and promised the people superior facilities and their own land, and consultation in all decisions affecting their future.

          <para>Bob Bropho erected a tent in the Roman Catholic cathedral grounds to further public awareness of the plight of the Aboriginal. At Guildford in May the winter rains came and still no promises had been met, and so the people raised their tents and marched on to crown land at Lockridge. Their efforts continued to be frustrated so they marched to Parliament House in Perth, having informed the Premier that they were coming to consult with him. Neither the Premier nor any member of his Government chose to see them. They were in actual fact addressed by the Honourable Lyla Elliott, M.L.C. and the Honourable Jack Skidmore, </para>

          <para class="block">This determination is shared by all the fringe dwellers of the Swan Valley. The people of Saunders Street, Widgee Road, the Midland Abattoirs and Miller s Cave have seen no improvement in their situation. As Ruth Kickett of Saunders Street said: 'We are living off the crumbs of the table but even crumbs go mouldy and stink'. Some 30 people left the cathedral in Perth on Sunday morning at about 10.30 and made their way to Quarading, a place noted perhaps for the racist attitude of the shire. Perhaps it was significant that this should be their first stopping point. They stopped in Merredin on Monday night and on Tuesday night, as I said earlier, they wil be stopping in Kalgoorlie. But then the mammoth task of getting them all across the Nullarbor Plain starts. They have only two cars which are able to make the entire journey. Bob Bropho is travelling with his wife and eight children. I think about another three children are involved. Some four families are travelling. </para>
          <para>They are, of course, looking for assistance from the people they will meet on the way. They will need food, shelter and places where they can meet and talk not only to Aboriginal people but also to white people. They will need money for accommodation. They will need places where they can simply shower and freshen up. They will, most of all perhaps, need understanding. They will need to have people talk to them so that we can get a true appreciation of the problems that the Aboriginals face in Australia today. They will need such simple things as blankets and wood for their fires. When they arrive here in Canberra, which we hope will be in about nine days time, they will need understanding, support from members of Parliament and most of all a sympathetic hearing from the Minister. </para>

            <para>- I want briefly to support what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> has said. The safari being organised by this group of people who have become known as the Guildford fringe dwellers highlights the great problems that are faced by fringe dwellers in every major town and city in this countrypeople with no home whose culture has been bruised and battered by white society. Frequently they have no tribe to which they can relate. These days, with the continuing unemployment problems and the cutbacks in housing, obviously they are being treated worse than they were prior to 1967. Bob Bropho, the man who leads this group, is a very quiet sort of fellow. He is most conscious of what is happening to his people. In July this year when the Labor Party eld its national conference in Perth he led a delegation which was met by several of us. He had hoped that the publicity on that occasion would bring some sort of shelter to him and the people associated with him. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think that this pilgrimage raises for the people of Australia the sad things that have happened over the last two years in the field of Aboriginal affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> when he was shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in 1975, spent many thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money in sending telegrams to black communities throughout this country advising them to vote for the Liberal-Country Party because he claimed, they would be better off, not worse off under a new government. He sent other telegrams criticising the Labor Party for indicating that funding for Aboriginal welfare would be grievously reduced. In February 1976 we saw the first cutbacks. It was significant that the first cutbacks were in the field of Aboriginal housing. These are the people who are suffering as a result of what happened. </para>
          <para>I suppose when one looks back over the events of the last week or two, there was no suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> who made all these grandiose promises as the shadow Minister, was likely to resign when the cutbacks in Aboriginal welfare took place. It was not until his political nose was put of joint over a matter of law that he decided that the principle was so great that he had to resign from the Cabinet. Perhaps if he had resigned when the cutbacks took place in aboriginal spending he may then have raised the point, so far as the Australian public and the Government were concerned, that those cutbacks should not have taken place. But apparently principles are expendable in many areas. </para>
          <para>Today we had a group of people from Benelong's Haven waiting here for many hours to see the Minister. Apparently the Minister makes all sorts of appointments which he does not keep. All they want is a few things to make life happier for the people who are trying to escape from alcoholism. On the settlement they are running a bus which was bought by the Labor Government in the days when Gordon Bryant was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. That bus has 400,000 miles on the speedometer. They are running a car with something like 300,000 miles on the speedometer because this Government will not provide the sort of transport that is necessary to run this health centre which is very badly wanted in their community. </para>
          <para>Alcohol is a very great problem, and many of these people are volunteers for cures. A large number who come from the far north of Australia have had to travel long distances to Sydney to seek a cure for their problem. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has refused even to pay their fares for medical treatment. The people associated with the Nadoc organisation, to a lesser degree last year but certainly to a very great degree this year, in almost every area were refused funds. I suppose that if a lot of black people get together it is just possible that they may agitate against the Government. Obviously the Government was not going to take that risk. </para>
          <para>I heard an interjection, from a man who has since left the chamber, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> is the best Minister for Aboriginal Affairs he has ever known. He is not, of course. There were 3 Labor Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs, including my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> who really knew what they were doing and really tried to do something and who had a sympathetic government behind them. </para>

              <para>-Because of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis's</inline> racist attitude he does not believe that Aborigines have the same right to education as everybody else. He has had his education but he would deprive underprivileged people from receiving an education or the other social benefits which ought to be the right of every person in this community. He is all right because he has four incomes and can cope.  His  parliamentary salary is merely his petty cash. So people who want to do this sort of thing, who want to get carried away and use this place as a forum for their own racist attitudes ought to go outside in the streets and declare how well off they are. The answer is for this Government to adopt a more humane attitude. Up to $20m of last year's budget for aboriginal affairs was not spent. When we deal with the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs later this session there will be a whole lot of areas which I and others will expose publicly. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis</inline> and people who think like him, people with the same sort of racist attitude, will read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports covering these things and see what they are doing to our own ethnic minority who are not getting a fair go.

          <quote>
            <para>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Viner, today replied to statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robert</inline> Bropho on behalf of the Aboriginal community living in tents at Lockridge that efforts had been made to persuade him to visit the Lockridge camps to talk to the Aboriginals but he had declined. </para>
            <para>The fact of the matter', <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> said, 'is that no approach had been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bropho</inline> or anyone at the Lockridge camp to talk to them. If they wish to talk to me, they can contact my office in Perth and I shall be happy to make an appointment to discuss their situation. There is absolutely no need for the group to travel to Canberra to see me'. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline>said that although the provision of housing was a matter for the State Government through the State Housing Commission and the Department for Community Welfare, he had been particularly concerned to follow developments amongst homeless Aboriginals in the Guildford/Lockridge area. 'Contrary to reports, I personally visited all campsites, including the then unoccupied Lockridge site and Saunders Street housing then being built, in the area on 20 May this year and since that time have been urging State and local authorities to continue their efforts to find a solution to the present unsatisfactory situation'. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> said that if Aboriginals living in the Lockridge and nearby camps disagreed with proposals for night shelter and other facilities currently being considered, then they should convey their opinion as quickly as possible to the relevant State and local authorities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that indicates, first of all, that the Minister concerned has visited these sites and has made himself available. He is available without the need for a journey by these people to Canberra to see him. He had indicated clearly that he would be available to be seen in Perth or elsewhere. Those who know the Minister and know of his very busy life know that he makes himself available to Aboriginal people throughout Australia. I just make the point that practical concern and solicitude for Aboriginal people is not the monopoly of any one person or any one party in this chamber; nor in fact is it demonstrated by the decibels of the voice of the person expounding it. After all, the problems remained in its intensity, and indeed was exacerbated during the period 1972-1975. </para>

It has existed despite governments of various political persuasions and despite the genuine efforts of governments as such. It is not to be thought that simply invoking strong words against a particular government and railing against that government will solve the problem. It does not. I am privileged in my portfolio to see something of the nature of this intractable problem, and to have the challenge of trying to better the conditions of </para>

The only currently available method of substantially increasing the thermal efficiency of utilisation of power station fuel is to combine electricity generation with the production of steam or hot water for industrial or household purposes. In some parts of Europe, district heating schemes are operated in conjunction with electricity generation. This method has little attraction under Australian conditions, however, because of the favourable climate and low-density residential development. </para>

          <para>There has also been a continual improvement in the thermal efficiency of electricity generation over the years as a result of technological improvements in association with the growth of unit sizes and some further limited gains can still be expected.

          <para>Significant additional gains in generating efficiency will be dependent on the successful commercial development of improved and advanced conversion systems outlined in 1 (b) above, and their subsequent application, with any necessary adaptation, in Australia. </para>

At the end of June 1976 there were 132 positions of which 90 were manned; in June 1977 the corresponding figures were 132 and 112. Those positions which were not staffed in June 1977 were in process of being filled and it is expected that virtually all will be staffed by the end of this month. The Public Service Board is at present examining the Department's additional staff requirements for the implementation of the National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals announced by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs during the previous Session of Parliament. </para>

            <para>The Government is aware that certain vehicles sold in the trade as 'one tonners' are treated by the Commissioner of Taxation as ineligible for the income tax investment allowance. The relevant provisions of the income tax law exclude from the investment allowance a 'road vehicle designed to carry loads of less than 1 tonne or fewer than 9 passengers'. </para>
            <para>In determining the load that a vehicle is designed to carry, the Commissioner has taken the view that the maximum load for any particular vehicle should be regarded as the gross weight of the vehicle, as specified by the manufacturer, reduced by its unladen weight measured with its fuel tank filled, the weight of oil, coolant, spare wheel, jack, installed options, etc., and, where passenger seating is provided as standard equipment, the weight of a driver and one passenger. For the latter purpose, consistently, I understand, with Australian Design Rules, the weight allowance for each person is taken at 68kg. </para>
            <para>The Commissioner has indicated that this view of the requirments of the law was settled after detailed discussions with the vehicle industry, but that, in the exercise of the rights conferred on them by the income tax law, some taxpayers dissatisfied with the Commissioner's ruling are contesting it before a Taxation Board of Review. </para>

            <para>Since coming to office the Government has set about creating the climate necessary to restore the mineral industry to its proper role in the nation's economic development. The restoration of an appropriate climate must, of course, have an impact on all companies in the industry, irrespective of their size. </para>
            <para>Some small companies engaged exclusively in exploration have made representations to the Government seeking the re-introduction of an income taxation scheme of shareholder deductions. This matter was considered by the IAC in its 1976 report on the Petroleum and Mining Industries. The IAC had divided views on this matter, the majority view did not favour shareholder deductions whereas the minority view recommended their re-introduction. In the event, the Government decided not to go beyond the quite considerable measures announced in the 1976-77 Budget concerning the pricing policy for new oil and the deductibility for taxation purposes of expenditure incurred in exploration for and development of petroleum resources. </para>
            <para>The Government again gave very careful consideration to these matters in its deliberations on the current year's Budget. As the honourable senator will know, I announced in Parliament on 24 August 1977 the Government's decision to introduce a scheme which provides for taxation rebates of 30 cents per dollar subscribed for off-shore petroleum exploration and development operations by companies with valid permits and licences under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act, or registered interests in licences on permits under the Act. The Government believes that this measure will provide a most significant incentive to those engaged in exploration for and development of Australia's petroleum resources. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>The question of whether a 'first visit' or initial consultation fee is charged by a specialist after the expiry of a twelve months referral period or when presented with a new Notice of Referral is a matter over which the Government has no control. This matter can only be determined by the specialist having regard to the facts of each individual case and based on medical considerations. From the Government's point of view, the issue of a new Notice of Referral should not necessarily be regarded for benefit purposes as indicating the commencement of a new course of treatment where the referral relates to the specific complaint which was the reason for the first referral. In the final analysis, the responsibility rests with the specialist to determine whether a new course of treatment is being commenced or the earlier treatment is being continued. The Government's involvement in the question of referrals is limited to the establishment of conditions of eligibility for the payment of medical benefits at the appropriate rates. Within this limited context, the referral procedures basically constitute no more than a system for providing written evidence that a referral has taken place. Beyond these simple requirements, laid down solely for medical benefit purposes, the solutions to any problems such as whether a doctor should charge an initial consultation fee each twelve months are to be found primarily in the proper application of medical ethics. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>Because of the wide and to some extent unpredictable variations in circumstances which may arise in relation to medical treatment, there were obvious difficulties in developing referral procedures to meet all cases. Experience has shown that the existing system which has been m operation since 1970 and which necessitates the issue of a Notice of Referral only once every twelve months in cases where a patient is referred for 'continuing management of present condition', constitutes the most satisfactory method of meeting the great majority of cases involving specialist treatment. The Medibank Review Committee which carried out a comprehensive review of the operation of Medibank in 1976 considered the operation of the current system but did not propose any changes to the existing arrangements. It is realised that there are cases of chronic or continuing illnesses such as glaucoma where there may be little need for consulting a general practitioner each twelve months solely to obtain a referral form. This is one of the more common complaints levelled at the referral system by patients and has for some time been noted for consideration m any review of the present system. In this regard, I have recently requested an urgent review of the referral system by my Department to ascertain whether any changes need to be made. However, until such time as the review has been undertaken and any modifications implemented, the present arrangements which are in accordance with the current legislation must continue to operate. </para>

              <para>1 ) The primary purpose of Australia Day functions overseas is to entertain members of the host Government, senior officials, persons of high standing in the community and representatives of other countries. They are not held primarily to entertain Australian citizens. However, some Australian citizens resident in the city where the function is held are usually invited. Their numbers are limited by the funds made available for the function. A specific allocation of money is made each year for Australia Day celebrations to Australian diplomatic missions abroad. The Head of Mission at each post decides on the type of function(s) that would be suitable in the country in which he is resident and, likewise draws up a suitable guest list; </para>

              <para>In 1976 IS Australian residents were invited to the Australia Day reception, and in 1977, 30 were invited. Financial stringency has led to a contraction in the size of Australia Day receptions in Noumea and other posts in recent years. In the case of Noumea, after inclusion of senior officials of the French High Commission, of the New Caledonian Territorial Administration and of the South Pacific Commission (SPC) on the guest list, there was little room or financial provision for many other guests. Australians who were invited were included because of positions they held (e.g. at the SPC) rather than because of their nationality. </para>

            <para>The words used in my speech to the Productivity Groups Advisory Council referred to Public Service Ceilings as having 'had their most severe effect in areas where the functions had not been a major focus of attention when in other departments. As a result, staff numbers are inadequate to perform with maximum effect the tasks which the new department is expected to perform'. </para>
            <para>The imposition of ceilings at present (which incidentally I fully support) has meant for all departments a critical reexamination of priorities. In my Department it has been necessary to undertake a wide range of studies in areas not previously given attention- in particular relating to productivity improvement. I have accepted the fact that with staff limitations it is necessary at times to extend the timescale for completion of tasks and that maximum effect must be sometimes sacrificed in the interests of containment of the size of the Public Service. At the same time I believe much greater efficiency is being achieved, to an extent which will eventually more than counteract some temporary difficulties. </para>
            <para>I am sure most who heard my speech, or subsequently read it, will realise that my purpose was to remind members of productivity groups that much support for their activities must come from industry itself. </para>

              <para>and (2) The Government is giving careful consideration to the report on solar energy from the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which I regard as a valuable contribution to the debate in Australia on prospects for solar energy, and its decisions on the Committee's recommendations will be announced in due course. </para>

          <para>As I announced on 25 August 1977, the Government has decided that as resources flow from the further development of uranium, additional funds will be provided to increase substantially our national effort on solar energy research. </para>
          <para>Energy research and development is a matter to which I have asked the National Energy Advisory Committee to pay particular attention, and I expect to receive advice on this matter from the Committee in the near future. At the request of the Prime Minister, the Australian Science and Technology Council is also preparing advice for the Government on energy research and development in Australia. </para>
          <para>The formulation of an energy research and development policy which will make the most effective use of the nation's research resources cannot take place without detailed knowledge of the existing research effort. Accordingly, the Department of National Resources is currently undertaking a national survey of energy research and development in Australia. The survey of commonwealth Government departments and instrumentalities has commenced, and State Governments, universities and private companies will be approached in due course. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The need for an expanded energy research and development effort has been recognised by Ministers with energy responsibilities from each of the major Australian political parties. At the 19 August 1977 meeting of the Australian Minerals and Energy Council, the Council expressed the unanimous view that there is a need for an active and coordinated national energy research and development effort. The Council is to consider at its next meeting a report from officials on the establishment of a National Energy Research and Development Program, and the means by which such a Program might appropriately be organised and financed. This will enable the Commonwealth to frame a National Energy Research and Development Policy which takes full account of the advice of the National Energy Advisory Committee and the Australian Science and Technology Council, the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources and the activities and priorities of the State Governments. </para>

              <para>1 ) As announced in a press statement by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on 27 May 1977, the partner Governments of the British Phosphate Commissioners- Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom- have agreed to make an ex-gratia payment totalling $A 10,000,000 to set up a trust fund for the Banaban people, the original inhabitants of Ocean Island. The payment would be conditional on the Banabans not proceeding with further litigation apart from the two cases against the British Phosphate Commissioners already before the United Kingdom High Court. The money will come from funds held on behalf of the member governments by the British Phosphate Commissioners which would otherwise have been paid into the consolidated revenues of the respective Governments. </para>

Australia believed that the resolution formulated an interpretation of the Protocol not shared by all parries to it; and that it was for parties to the Protocol to interpret its scope and application, not the General Assembly. Australia, Portugal and the United States voted against the resolution; the NATO countries, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, among others abstained. </para>

The issue is not under consideration at present. The Government would review the question if circumstances arose in which it considered that appropriate. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline>directed a question without notice to me concerning the possibilities of extending eligibility for the Government's Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme to all taxpayers and of having interest on these deposits calculated in a different way. I indicated at the time that I would refer the question to the Treasurer, who has now provided the following answer: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Both of these possibilities received careful consideration by the Government when the form of the Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme was being developed. As regards extending eligibility for participation to all taxpayers, the Income Equalisation Deposits Scheme was introduced to assist in offsetting adverse taxation effects suffered by primary producers, whose incomes fluctuate from year to year to a greater extent than incomes of other classes of taxpayers. The concern of the Government at Budget time last year was to bring into early operation a scheme that would provide benefits in what it regarded as being clearly the area of real need. With the coming into force on 1 February 1978 of the new simplified rate scale, 90 per cent of individual taxpayers will pay tax at no more than the standard rate of 32 per cent applicable to taxable incomes up to $16,000. That being so, any practical case that might have been seen for extending the Income Equalisation Scheme to all taxpayers has become much weaker. </para>
            <para>The decision to pay a low rate of interest on the full amount of an income equalisation deposit rather than a higher rate on the investment component only was made in the interests of simplicity. The view was taken that the additional difficulties that would have been involved in excluding the tax-deferral component from interest entitlements would have put a high cost on such improvement in equity as might have resulted from the adoption of that course. The advent of the new rate scale will, of course, reduce differences between the effective rates of interest on the investment component of deposits as between high-income and low-income depositors. </para>

            <para>Telecom Australia recognises its community obligations by providing public telephones on a less than economic basis in some cases. Indeed, a loss in excess of $ 10m was incurred on the public telephone service in 1975-76. There is however a need to obtain a certain usage from each public telephone installation to partially offset the high costs of provision and maintenance. </para>
            <para>The value of a telephone in the event of an emergency is recognised but it would be impracticable for Telecom to provide 'emergency' or 'trouble telephones at strategic locations along the many thousands of kilometres of roadways in Australia where accidents or break-downs are likely to occur. The cost would be prohibitive and would divert resources from the provision of public telephones in locations where there is a constant need for calls from the community. </para>
            <para>In regard to the roadway between Hobart and Kingston, I understand that Telecom Australia has advised the Kingsborough Municipal Council that, because there is no prospect of even minor revenues, there is no reasonable basis upon which the Commission could undertake the installation of standard public telephone facilities in such a locality at its own cost. At the same time Telecom offered to undertake the installation of alternative emergency facilities provided the cost of installation and subsequent operation and maintenance was borne by an appropriate authority responsible for the highway system as is the normal practice elsewhere in Australia. </para>

            <para>asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport the following question, without notice, on 31 May 1977, relating to the economics of the proposed natural gas pipeline from the North West Shelf to the eastern seaboard: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Is the Minister aware that at this year's annual general meeting of Woodside-Burmah Oil NL, the  Chairman  stated that the transporting of gas from the North West Shelf to Sydney would cost $ 1 .70 and perhaps $2 per thousand cubic feet and would not be acceptable to industry in the eastern States? Is the Minister aware also that the U.S. Federal Power Commission has recommended that a planned ipeline to carry natural gas from Alaska's north slope be uilt across Canada and that the Commission's economic study indicated that the cost per thousand cubic feet delivered to Chicago would be 80c? That information is from the 'Financial Times' of 4 May 1977. As the distance from the north slope of Alaska to Chicago is far greater than the distance from the North West Shelf to Sydney and the terrain much more difficult, would the Minister care to investigate or have investigated the trustworthiness of the Chairman's economics? If the Chairman's figures are proved to be wrong, this question in some way may be able to help preserve a great Australian asset from being shipped overseas, along with all the other energy sources that this Government is hellbent on getting rid of at giveaway prices. </para>
