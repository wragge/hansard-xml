          <para>-by leave- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I would like to take the opportunity of expressing to the family of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Felix</inline> Dittmer the deep regret that my colleagues and I from Queensland have after hearing of his death. I had the opportunity to know Felix Dittmer over a number of years. Although we did not agree politically on many matters, I came to be his friend, especially since it was my advantage to sit alongside him in this chamber. There is no doubt that I learnt many of the tricks that he used in this place. I use the word &#39;tricks&#39; in the softer sense. Felix Dittmer was a person who with great energy intruded himself into debates in this place by way of speech and interjection. He was a colleague whose experience I appreciated well. To his family, a very large and devoted family, I express my sympathy in their time of loss. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland, which he served so well for so long, I express the same sympathy. </para>

          <para>-by leave-I join my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> in expressing regret at the death of Felix Dittmer and in expressing sympathy to his family. Felix Dittmer came to prominence in the Australian Labor Party when he contested the Brisbane lord mayoralty. He was a longstanding delegate to the State Executive of the Labor Party in Queensland and attended quite a number of the triennial conferences. For a very brief period in about 1957 he was the Acting Secretary of the Queensland Central Executive. Probably his greatest contribution to public life was in the arena of State politics. He contested and won the seat of Mount Gravatt, which he represented for a period of time. He became the  Deputy  Leader of the State Parliamentary Labor Party in 1957. He was defeated in the seat of Mount Gravatt later that year- from memory on 3 August- by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hart. He was defeated by a very narrow margin- some 120-odd votes. At the time there was some tribulation in the Labor Party and he suffered some of the backwash. After that he came to this chamber. He represented Queensland in this chamber as a Labor senator for some 12 or 13 years. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The late former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer</inline> had experienced indifferent health over the last year or two. He suffered a minor stroke, which was followed by another one. I understand that he died suddenly of a heart attack last week.  His  family, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has said, was very devoted to him. In fact, it is only 2 years since his wife passed away. It was a fairly large family. One of the sons is prominent today in the Queensland Department of Labour Relations and Consumer Affairs and is a very close friend of mine. </para>
        <para>I think that we in this chamber, as is perhaps the case in all parliaments, have a tendency to forget people when they retire from politics. Over the last few weeks a number of former members of this chamber have passed away. I think that it is probably one of the regrettable things about us- I suppose it is a selfish human trait- that we remain in close contact and friendly with our colleagues here but after they leave here for reasons of ill-health or retirement we have a tendency not to remember them. That was said to me very forcibly by a retired member of the other side of the chamber when I became a member of the Senate in 1965. We met for lunch one day and he said: &#39;There is one suggestion I will make to you. If you ever let politics get you down you will be due for a coronary or a couple of bad ulcers, but if you continue to laugh you will see your way through life fairly satisfactorily&#39;. This gentleman was a former senior minister. He also has now passed away. He also said: Do all the things that you want to do while you are in the Parliament because when you leave it you will be forgotten&#39;. He expressed one regret to  me. He had spent a long period in this chamber, including a lengthy period in the ministry, and he had hoped that at least he would have been consulted by his colleagues when he left the Parliament. He said: &#39;I thought I would be an elder statesman, but it did not work out that way. They do not even call to buy me a grog any more&#39;. I think there is a lesson to be learned from that. I think we should remember the contributions made in this chamber by our colleagues from both sides of the House and try to keep in touch with them in some sort of way afterwards. It is always a sad occasion when one of our former colleagues passes on. I reiterate my sympathy for the family of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Dittmer</inline> and my regret at his passing. </para>

          <para>-by leave- I did not have the honour to serve in this Senate with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Felix</inline> Dittmer. In fact, I succeeded him in this place. There can be no doubt that he was a man of scholarship and wide experience, particularly in the pastoral areas of Queensland where he had a close association with the Australian Workers Union. In fact, in those areas he became somewhat of a legend. There can be no doubt also that he served faithfully and well and with distinction to himself as a State member of parliament and a member of this Senate. I join with my colleagues in expressing to the members of his family my deepest sympathy in their sad loss. </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator&#39;s question is in two parts. As to the freedom of information Bill, I think as recently as the opening of the Australian Legal Convention in Sydney round about 4 July the Prime Minister again said that the Bill would be brought into Parliament. I think it was hoped that it would be introduced this year, but I cannot recollect the legislative program with such particularity. My colleague the Attorney-General may be able to help the honourable senator in a day or two as he settles into his portfolio. It is the Government&#39;s intention to bring in that Bill and to proceed with it. As to the second part of the question about dossiers, this matter was bruited about a little bit in the Press last week. I said at the time that what was happening and what I hoped was happening was that there was an exchange of information between the police forces of this country about persons who may commit violence, no matter against whom, for what cause or where. I would have thought that all honourable senators would agree with such a situation. </para>

              <para>-I am talking about violence. I believe that there is a duty upon members of police forces, where they receive information which may lead to the injury of people, to inform their colleagues in other forces so that the people involved may be properly protected. I know of no honourable senator opposite who subscribes to the theory of violence, nor is there any honourable senator on this side who subscribes to it. All that is being asked is that there be a continuation of the normal co-operation between police forces in the community, to inform one another about possible outbreaks of violence against human beings. That is a policy which I thought would have the support of every honourable senator in this chamber. </para>

This most serious matter has been raised with me by a number of constituents in my State. The Minister will know of the introduction of Touchfone by Telecom Australia. Is the Minister aware that the order of numbers on pushbutton telephones, running from one to nine from top to bottom, is exactly the reverse of most calculating machines where the numbers run from bottom to top? In the interests of efficiency of operation and assistance to workers generally, will the Minister request Telecom to consider a re-arrangement of the numbers into proper form as already established by most calculators? </para>

            <para>- I direct a question in two parts to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The question concerns national security agencies and involves two areas which the Minister knows I have pursued over the last few weeks. Firstly, I ask: With the termination of a certain case in the Canberra courts under Justice Smithers which dealt with Australian Security Intelligence Organisation recruitment, are we likely to get some information on the recruitment methods, mindful of ASIO&#39;s increased budget and some miscalculations regarding the personnel engaged? Secondly, I refer the Minister to a partial promise he gave me some weeks ago that when the Prime Minister returned from Japan we might get a further edition of the Justice Hope report which was supposed to deal with an appeals tribunal for people denied citizenship, which could be related to ASIO evaluations. </para>

            <para>-I know that the honourable senator has had a continuing interest in this problem, as he has seen it, for a long time. I well recall saying to the honourable senator that the Prime Minister hoped to be able to deal with this report when he came back from Japan. I must ask the honourable senator to contain his patience somewhat. The Prime Minister has said that he will be making a statement on this matter as soon as he can. I do not know whether the honourable senator realises- I do not think I am giving anything away- that the Hope report is a very large document. It has only recently been completed. Without attempting to go into the covers of it so far, my estimate is that I will need 30 to 40 hours to read it. Honourable senators can understand the size of the task before the Government in going into the report and coming to decisions on it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I assure the honourable senator that the Government has a very great and continuing interest in this matter. As far as possible it has been implementing parts of the Hope report as they have come in. The honourable senator may remember that the Prime Minister made a statement on 5 May- I tabled the statement on his behalf in this place on 24 May last- concerning certain decisions made by the Government on the first part of the Hope report. As the honourable senator will realise, that was but the start of what the report was to be all about. I well understand the problems in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> has been interested, especially those concerning people applying for naturalisation and migration to this country and the general pursuit of civil liberties about which he has been so ardent for so long. As I read the report I will certainly bear in mind the honourable senator&#39;s attitudes and ideas on the subjects he has raised. </para>

With all deference to the answer I received, I think the Minister overlooked the first part of my question which related to the recruitment of ASIO operatives in view of one or two apparently false evaluations of people in the past. The Minister did not mention the matter in his reply. I do not know whether it is related to the Hope report. </para>

All pastoral leases in the Northern Territory are equally subject to disease control measures. It is unlikely that any Commonwealth or State Minister charged with the responsibility of ensuring that adequate disease prevention and eradication programs are being implemented can be entirely satisfied. However, the incentives provided to producers under the bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign apply equally to all pastoralists in the Territory. In addition, the technical officers of the Department of the Northern Territory are actively engaged in an educational program emphasising both the need for and the mechanics of the Commonwealth Government&#39;s disease eradication program. </para>

            <para>-That is a very clever question because what the honourable senator obviously has overlooked is that it is indicated somewhere in that statement that a resources tax or other taxes may be levied. Company taxes also will be levied. The question is not as clever as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> thought. He asked about a particular section of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and he quoted from the Act. I only represent the Ministers to whom this question should be directed. The question almost verges on asking me for a legal opinion. Therefore, I suggest that the honourable senator place his question on the Notice Paper so that I may get a detailed answer for him. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs. Is the Minister aware of the statement made today by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo,</inline> the South Australian Minister of Local Government, to the effect that the Commonwealth Government adamantly refused to give special consideration to areas outside local government in that State? Is it a fact that the Premier of South Australia agreed to the original proposition put forward by the Commonwealth Grants Commission to the Premiers Conference late in 1976 that unincorporated areas would be excluded from the tax sharing arrangements? Is it also a fact that since the original agreement an opportunity has been provided for Tasmania to put forward complaints and that South Australia has had a similar opportunity to make a definite proposal as far as unincorporated areas of South Australia are concerned to qualify for grants under the local government personal tax sharing arrangements? Has the South Australian Government made representations to have any changes made to the original proposal? Are the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo</inline> against the Commonwealth justified? </para>

            <para>- Since the Premiers Conference met early last year to discuss various federalism matters, it has been clear to the Commonwealth and to all Premiers- specifically to the Premier of South Australia- that South Australia, by the choice of its Government, has a system of local government different from the system in other States and that there are large unincorporated areas in South Australia. It has been clear to all Premiers and to the Commonwealth that it is a matter of choice for South Australia whether those areas remain unincorporated. It has been made clear to South Australia that if it wants to take action and it wants to make representations to the Commonwealth Grants Commission on various matters it is quite competent to do so, but South Australia entered into the revenue sharing arrangements for local government in the full knowledge that those arrangements would apply to incorporated areas. Incidentally, it is fair to remind the honourable senator that I do not think there is any record of this complaint in those years of the </para>

The Minister may recall that when he was the Minister in charge of this portfolio I asked him questions about the future of the defence service homes scheme in relation to serving servicemen and others and to which he replied that, I think, there would be literally no alterations to the provisions. I now ask the Minister: Is it a fact that the conditions and eligibility requirements under this scheme have been quite drastically changed and that the future of land holdings which are at present held by the Defence Service Homes Corporation is in some doubt because of a Government direction that these are likely to be sold? Will the holdings in South Australia at Reynella, Hackham, Christie Downs and Christies Beach and O&#39;sullivan Beach- the Minister has told me that several hundred blocks of land are held in those areas for building purposes- be sold on open tender or are they to be held for applicants who have already lodged applications? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Bishop</inline>referred to questions that he has asked me over some period- I think commencing about this time last year- concerning speculation about changes to the defence service homes scheme. The major speculation during that period was about interest rates being increased from the very favourable rate charged on loans under this scheme. In the answers I gave at the time I said that there were no changes. It is true that there were no changes at the time. The Government considered all matters in relation to the defence service homes scheme in the Budget context and it made some changes to the scheme, some of which have been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> in his question this afternoon. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am happy to emphasise that there has not been any increase in the interest charges on the loans that are available or any decrease in the term of repayment of a loan. These are two of the major features of the scheme which have been held intact. There have been changes concerning eligibility of those who have served in peacetime forces. They are spelt out in a statement attached to the Budget which I issued at the time of the presentation of the Budget. I do not propose to reiterate the changes here but I refer honourable senators to them. I think the major point of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop&#39;s</inline> question concerns decisions that have been made in regard to the policy hitherto of developing land and selling either developed blocks of land or houses and land to people who are interested in obtaining a house and land under those schemes. That has never been the major feature of the defence service homes scheme. The major feature has, of course, been its lending facilities. There is again considerable detail concerning the changes which are proposed in this regard. The Government intends to wind down and ultimately phase out the land development and construction activity aspect of the scheme. However, there are on the books large numbers of applicants for land or land and housing and the Department hopes to be able to satisfy as many as possible of these applicants registered on the books up to the day of the presentation of the Budget, that is, 16 August. That means there must be now a reappraisal of all land holdings to see how much will be required to meet, as far as possible, the requirements of those who have applied for this form of assistance under the scheme. We believe that there is enough land in South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland in a state which may be developed to meet the requirements of those applicants. I cannot give details as to what particular land will be developed or made available. </para>

            <para>-Honourable senators may recall that last week the High Court handed down a judgment in which it held not to be a valid law certain legislation of Western Australia concerning the preservation of maritime wrecks off the coast of that State. Honourable senators will recall also that this Parliament passed the Historic Shipwrecks Bill- I think it was last year -just in case the High Court did, in fact, come to that conclusion. As a result of the judgment which was handed down, I think, on Thursday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> who was then acting AttorneyGeneral, and I had certain discussions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> had further discussions with the Attorney-General of Western Australia and the Act was immediately proclaimed to apply offshore in Western Australia to ensure that none of the historic shipwrecks were plundered for personal gain. The present situation is that those shipwrecks, both in general and in particular the ones named in the Bill, now come under the protection of Commonwealth law. It is my intention to enter into negotiations with my counterpart in Western Australia, as provided in the legislation, to work out a co-operative regime whereby the Western Australian Government, possibly through the Western Australian Maritime Museum will, to a very large extent, if not to the total extent, again resume the responsibility it had before the High Court judgment. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the Minister aware of reports circulating which suggest that Australian military aid to Indonesia is being used to prosecute the war against Fretilin forces in East Timor? Is the Minister able to state whether Australian military aid can be used for such offensive purposes, or is our aid program geared to the defence needs of Indonesia? </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Attorney-General. I recognise that he has new portfolio responsibilities and may not be in a position to give positive answers today. Nevertheless, I ask that he treat the matter as one of some urgency. In view of the extremely delicate situation in which legal assistance has been placed because of this Government&#39;s decision, will the Attorney-General give the precise allocation of funds for the Legal Aid Commission in Western Australia? Will he advise the name and qualifications of his representative to the Legal Aid Commission? Will he table the agreement between the Federal Government and the Western Australian Government in respect to legal aid? Will he ensure that copies of this agreement will be sent to all Australian Legal Aid Office professional staff in Western Australia? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Coleman</inline>asks for a good deal of detail. Even if I had been the Attorney-General for more than an hour or so, I think it would have been beneficial to put a question of that kind on notice so that I might provide more accurate detail than she would expect to get in response to a question without notice. However, I would challenge her suggestion that any decision of this Government has placed legal aid in any jeopardy. In fact, the provision for legal aid in the Budget this year has been increased and we are proceeding, in accordance with Government policy, to establish Legal Aid Commissions, in conjunction with the States, or at least to encourage the States to set up Legal Aid Commissions to which we will be giving support. We believe that the legal aid policy of this Government will greatly rationalise and improve the schemes. </para>

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Recently there have been several demonstrations in Australian universities which have been marked by apparently increasingly violent incidents. Having in mind that some of these incidents have been directed at the Prime Minister and, indeed, have put him in danger of suffering bodily harm, is it correct to say that not all demonstrators have come from universities or from the universities where the demonstrations took place, but have come from left wing groups which are openly defying law and order in an effort to cause as much chaos as possible within the Australian community? Will the Government make known to the people of Australia the results of investigations that have taken place? </para>

              <para>-It was not my mob. The real substance of the honourable senator&#39;s question is that merely because some of these unfortunate demonstrations take place on university grounds, people attending the universities tend to get tagged with the bad name of the people who act perhaps somewhat extremely on those grounds. I hope the members of the community understand that the great majority of people in universities are very busy going about their own lawful business of attending lectures and passing exams. Unfortunately, far too often outsiders go on to campuses and act as they ought not to. They are no more than intruders. They are almost trespassers. They give the genuine students at those places a bad name. This is something which ought to be deplored. The students have enough to put up with in this country without having dial-a-demo and rentacrowd come to their places, so that all students are tagged with the same sort of attitude. I would hope that the Australian community would understand that the great majority of students at tertiary institutions in Australia have nothing to do with these outbreaks of violence on university grounds. </para>

Is he aware that in all States of the Commonwealth newspaper proprietors require the sale of their newspapers to be restricted to newsagents or their nominees as approved by the newspaper proprietors? Is this practice restrictive and contrary to the provisions of free competition? Can the Minister advise what are the circumstances that allow for the sale of interstate daily newspapers in the Australian Capital Territory from a variety of shops, including grog shops? I use the term &#39;grog&#39; as referring to the liquor discount houses that exist in Canberra. Can the Minister advise whether this means that newspaper proprietors are not able to impose their restrictive practices in the territories under the administration of the Commonwealth? </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I have a supplementary question. Is it not a fact that until November 1975 increases of payments under the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act had been annual increases and that the only reason increases were not given in 1975 was the constitutional situation at the time? Does the Government&#39;s present stand mean that it intends to go back on the practice of previous governments of introducing such increases annually? </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and relates to the announcement of the Western Mining Corporation that it intends to dismiss some hundreds of its employees engaged in the mining of nickel at Kambalda in Western Australia. In view of the considerable distress that this will cause to the people of Kambalda and the Eastern Goldfields generally and in view of the fact that the Western Mining Corporation has given as its principal reason for laying off its employees the fact that there is some $45 m worth of unsold nickel and in view of the fact that obviously the demand for nickel will be found again at some time in the future, will the Government consider the buying of the unsold nickel for the purpose of future stockpiling? I understand this is a practice that has been followed in other countries where a similar situation has developed in the mining of ore such as nickel. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Minister for Health aware of the desperate shortage of cocaine at major hospitals in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Penh? The stock of this drug is very low. I understand that Adelaide Hospital has attempted to procure this drug from other hospitals and has been unable to do so. Is the Minister also aware that some hospital authorities have expressed concern that cocaine apparently is still available in Australia through illicit sources? As this drug is used as a pain killer in the treatment of terminal cases of cancer and other painful complaints will the Minister ask her colleague in another place for a report on this subject and also seek his assurance that action will be taken as a matter of urgency to ensure that supplies of this drug are made available as soon as possible to the hospitals of Australia? </para>

            <para>- The general position is that the Navy maintains patrols throughout the area and anybody who is flying over the area is usually asked to note particular vessels. Fishermen in the area have a fair knowledge of what is going on and they tend to report. However, in general there is a need for an acceleration of reporting and general noting of vessels that are fishing not only for clams but also for other fish in Australian waters which incidentally are going to be extended. </para>

            <para>The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act would be applicable to decisions made under the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act. Decisions made under that Act in relation to the suspension, standing down or dismissal of persons would be, in my view, decisions of an administrative character for the purposes of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. It would therefore be open for a person aggrieved by such a decision, which includes a person whose interests are adversely affected by the decision, to apply to the Federal Court of Australia for review of the decision. It would also be open for such a person ... to request written reasons for the decision. </para>

          <para class="block">The point is that the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act sets out a number of grounds or bases on which applications can be made under it. I have never said- I did not say it in the Senate or outside it- that it is providing a direct right of appeal in the sense in which that direct right is given to, say, an Administrative Appeals Tribunal or a Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. But it clearly gives a measure of redress, and in broad terms that can be called a right of appeal within the confines, of course, of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. However, the main point of the request to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Haslem</inline> was in regard to the question of when the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act would be proclaimed and whether or not the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act would be excluded when that Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act were brought into operation.

Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether the Minister for Health instigated an inquiry into the allegations of the high rates of malnutrition and general ill health, particularly amongst Aboriginal children in this area? Was the inquiry completed and the report made available to the Government several weeks ago? Does the report recommend the need for Australian Government assistance to the Redfern Aboriginal Medical Service in its attempt to provide adequate health services? ls it a fact that the Government does not intend to act on the advice set out in the report? Will the Minister now take the initiative in ensuring that the Medical Service receives the funds needed to provide a proper health service? </para>

Does he stand by the assertion of the Minister for Primary Industry, which was repeated by the Prime Minister, that the general rebate system introduced in the 1975 Budget forced primary producers to pay an extra $40m to $50m in income tax? If so, why has the Government in two budgets perpetuated, and in the 1977 Budget exacerbated, what the Government asserts to have been a grossly unfair anomaly? Finally, in assuming that the original allegation is true, I ask: Are we to believe that the Ministers in this Government took more than two years to discover what they assert to be a gross injustice? </para>

In the circumstances, has the Government given consideration to withdrawing the need for all specialist consultation by patients to be regularly referred by a general practitioner? Will the Minister concede that it would be a saving of public funds if referrals could be valid for a period of, say, 4 years, thus providing some relief to patients as well as medical benefits organisations? </para>

I undertake to draw to his attention the suggestion that has been made with regard to referral to specialists. I do not know whether consideration has been given to this in any way. I will certainly refer the question to the Minister and obtain his response. </para>

I ask: In view of the large number of civilians who will be needed when we acquire the 200-mile off-shore fishing zone, has the Government considered the utilisation of blimps rather than conventional aircraft for surveillance purposes? I ask this question in view of the argument that the operating cost of blimps is supposed to be much less than the cost of conventional aircraft. </para>

              <para>- I am happy to answer this question. I have not heard of blimps being used as a method of surveillance but it is a worthy idea. I will suggest it to the appropriate authorities because we will acquire an immense new area of resources which will be of great importance to us. I was working on this in Papua New Guinea last week and so far as I can tell the area that we will acquire is about the size of the Australian continental land mass. Movable fisheries are contained in that area but there are also resources on the sea bed. It is a matter of great importance. I take what the honourable senator said as a good suggestion and I will put it forward. </para>

            <para>- I would just like briefly to refer to the reports which have been presented here today. I refer not to any one in particular but to the whole lot. The first on the list is a report for the year ended 30 June 1 976. The second is for the year ended 30 June 1 973. The third is for the year ended 30 June 1976-15 months ago. The next one is the same. The one after is the same. The following report is for the year ended 30 June 1975, 27 months since the relevant period. The last one again is for the year ended 30 June 1 976.I know that some Ministers have had some concern about the fact that it seems it is taking a long time for some of these reports to come out. As  Chairman  of the Finance and Government Operations Committee I can indicate also that that Committee has expressed its concern about the length of time it is taking some of these reports to come out. I simply ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> whether he could cause some statement to be prepared in explanation as to why these reports have appeared today so that we can perhaps learn something more as to the cause of the delays in the presentation of these reports. </para>

            <para>- I will respond to that comment briefly. I was a bit shattered myself when I saw that the first report I put down, which was for my own Department, was for the year ended 30 June 1976.I have sent a message to the staffof the Department to the effect that when the Estimates Committee meets, the Department had better have a good reason or there might be trouble in that Committee. </para>

          </para>
          <para>Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill  1977 </para>
          <para>As announced in the Budget, licence fees payable by commercial broadcasters are to be increased by 20 per cent. This Bill gives effect to that decision. The Bill extends the range of the present scale upwards so that the impact is upon commercial broadcasters with gross earnings exceeding $4m per annum. The variation of the scale of fees in this manner means that the new scale of fees will affect only a very small number of commercial radio broadcasting stations. The effect on licensees is quite minimal, but the Government decided to retain parity between the scale of licence fees payable by both radio and television licensees. The new scale, effective from 1 September 1 977, is estimated to increase 1977-78 radio broadcasting station licence fee revenue to approximately $ 1 . 4m. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </para>
          <para>Television Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1977 </para>
          <para>As announced in the Budget, licence fees payable by commercial television licensees are to be increased by 20 per cent. This Bill gives effect to that decision. The Bill extends the range of the present scale upwards so that the impact is upon commercial licensees with gross earnings exceeding $4m per annum. The variation of the scale of fees in this manner means that in the main, only metropolitan commercial television station licensees with high gross earnings will be affected. The new scale, effective from 1 September 1977, is estimated to increase 1977-78 television station licence fee revenue by $1.7m to $9.3m. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </para>
          <para>Postal and Telecommunications Commissions (Transitional Provisions) Amendment Bill 1977 </para>
          <para>Prior to the establishment of the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, it was agreed with unions and staff associations that officers of the then Postmaster-General&#39;s Department should not suffer reduced promotional opportunities as a consequence of being allocated to the service of one or other of the commissions. The arrangement agreed to was that, for the five years after the establishment of the commissions, either commission should be able to promote to a position in its service an officer in the service of the other commission; and any officer in the service of either commission should be able to appeal against any promotion to a position in the service of either of the commissions. </para>
          <para>The promotions appeal boards of the two commissions have acted on the basis that section 20 of the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions (Transitional Provisions) Act 1975 gives effect to the agreed arrangements. Recent legal advice is that the section is more limiting in application and denies the right of appeal in certain circumstances. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Act to accord with the original intention and to validate action taken by the promotion appeal boards on appeals and promotions based on that intention. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>- It is not often that I delay the Senate by speaking in the adjournment debate. Tonight, however, I want to raise a matter which is of vital importance to all people of my State, which is of significance to the people of Australia and which deserves to be brought to the attention of the Senate. In this very chamber on 1 1 November 1976 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0</inline> &#39;Byrne launched an unprovoked, vicious, premeditated attack on Bob Watling, the Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, and Peter Imlach, the Minutes Secretary of the Council, as well as against myself. I disregarded this attack as just part of his usual obsession. It has now emerged that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0</inline> &#39;Byrne&#39;s November attack, a copy of the words of which I hold in my hand, was part of a prearranged plan to undermine the responsible leadership of the TTLC and pave the way for a pro-communist takeover. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Tomorrow night these two dedicated unionists face expulsion from the Australian Labor Party on the basis of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne said here on that day. Actually, a letter of 4 February 1977 from the West Hobart branch requested the Labor Party&#39;s rules committee to investigate Bob Watling and Peter Imlach on the basis of evidence &#39;from documents tabled in the Australian Senate on 11 November 1976&#39;. In point of fact, no documents were tabled in the Australian Senate on that day, other than those tabled by Ministers pursuant to statute, which said nothing about Peter Imlach or Bob Watling. But that is only one of the lesser lies upon which the charges should fail. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0</inline> &#39;Byrne did, however, make statements in the Senate that day which were designed to cause and which indeed have caused a witch-hunt of Gestapo proportions against those two top Tasmanian trade union officials. </para>
        <para>Whilst I did not consider at the time that a reply was called for, subsequent events have shown that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne&#39;s parliamentary attack now invites a series of parliamentary rejoinders by me so that honourable senators may be aware of salient political and industrial facts. In the first of these rejoinders it should be noted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0</inline> &#39;Byrne launched his attack after close consultation and collaboration with the extreme Left faction of the ALP. I use that term advisedly. In Launceston the faction includes Tim Thorne and Jim Simmonds, to name just two. I will deal with others in that faction from time to time later. </para>
        <para>Tim Thorne is one of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne&#39;s codelegates on the ALP Federal Conference. Jim </para>
        <para class="block">Simmonds is Deputy Chairman of the Bass Electorate Conference and a member of the ALP&#39;s foreign affairs committee. Both men consistently aid and espouse the cause and policies of the Communist Party of Australia. In addition, Thorne has paid money into the funds of the Communist Party of Australia, which payment has been acknowledged by the Communist Party&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Tribune.</inline> Simmonds as late as December 1976 attended an exclusive gathering of Communist Party of Australia operatives at Orford in Tasmania. This is the very man who, with his hard Left supporters on the rules committee, relentlessly pursued the witch-hunts against Bob Watling and Peter Imlach. This man, who is in breach of the ALP&#39;s rules for aiding and espousing the cause of the Communist Party of Australia, has just been made Chairman of the rules committee which is prosecuting Bob Watling and Peter Imlach. What a travesty and what a mockery of justice that is. </para>
        <para>Seven members of the rules committee laid the charges. Five of them, including Simmonds, are of the hard Left. Who are they? Allan Newitt, the Deputy Chairman of the Wilmot Electorate Council of the ALP, who was not so long ago a well known member of the Communist Party, is one of them. Another is Norm Hanscombe who was imported into Tasmania last year and appointed Secretary of the Miscellaneous Workers Union without a rank and file ballot. He is a member of the ALP&#39;s foreign affairs and defence committee. How they like to get onto that committee. That is the same Norman Hanscombe as the one who assisted the private inquiry agents to gather what Gough Whitlam described as perjured evidence against me in 1971. </para>
        <para>Then there are J. Coates and D. Llewellyn, both of whom have track records of consistent support for the Socialist Left. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne would also know that when Communist Party guru Derek Roebuck convened the inaugural meeting of the Australian-Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea- that is to say communist North Korea- Society, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0</inline> &#39;Byrne became its Patron and J. Coates became its Vice-Patron. Having secretly assisted in this dirty work, J. Coates and D. Llewellyn have now left the rules committee for fear of the electoral fall-out. Well they might, because both are ALP candidates for the next House of Representatives election. </para>
        <para>This rules committee, rejecting the call by ALP  President  Hawke in Launceston on 19 February this year for unity to throw out the Federal Government and &#39;not our colleagues within the movement&#39; and defying the plea made by Premier Neilson to drop the charges, pressed on secretly obtaining what they could from a collection of informers whose credibility is zero. Upon whom did they rely? On J. P. Forester, a man charged and found guilty on 24 June 1977 of offences against rules relating to the funds of the Union, fined the maximum amount under the rules and suspended from union membership. They relied on T. Keogh, who describes himself in his statutory declaration against the two charged men as &#39;a retired trade union official&#39;. Retired my foot! T. Keogh was dismissed from his union position. He tried to proposition organisers and other staff of the union to claim moneys on their expense account over and above those expenses legitimately incurred by them. In other words, he sought to defraud the union to build up the slush fund to pay the Egan mercenaries who are currently engaged in unsuccessful sorties into other unions and States. I do not hear many people coming to the support of the Egan mercenaries at this point in time, particularly as they realise just what Egan is about and just what he has done in New South Walesamalgamating the Australian Workers Union, which incorporated the Shop Assistants Union, with the Building Workers Industrial Union which is controlled by the Socialist Left. </para>

            <para>- Indeed, a terrible thing, done behind closed doors without consultation in any shape or form with the rank and file. Des Lavey was the next person persuaded to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne&#39;s attack. Having given evidence which, so far as I am concerned, is false, Des Lavey realised as much and sought, by letter dated 1 June, to backtrack, stating that whilst the rules committee could use his evidence, with reservations, he does &#39;not wish to become involved further in the current proceedings&#39;. What can be said of him?  His  foolishness is surpassed only by his ingratitude. And for what price? V/as it to have his name not mentioned in this Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne as belonging to an organisation proscribed by the ALP, as alleged in the original Forrester document which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne read on 11 November 1976? A very good friend of mine in the Labor Party gave me a copy of the Forrester document from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne made his wild allegations in the Senate. </para>

        <para>Finally we come to the disciplinary tribunal which will hear the charges tomorrow night. Whom does the tribunal consist of? It consists of R. D. Mainwaring J. Benson and <inline font-weight="bold">Ms G.</inline> Blain. <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Blain</inline> and J. Benson are on record as consistently supporting and voting with the Socialist Left at ALP conferences. R. Mainwaring is in the same boat.  His  claim to fame is that he is  President  of the Building Workers Industrial Union and of course,  President  of the Australia-Soviet Friendship Society- an organisation which has close links with the KGB. The axes are indeed sharpened. The decision of the tribunal tomorrow night is entirely predictable. Little wonder that the TTLC secretary, Bob Watling, has called for an unbiased public inquiry into the whole of this unseemly episode. Is it any wonder that Bert Lacey, whom all honourable senators will know as a former senator in this place, a man who has served the trade union movement and the Labor Party with distinction, dedication and selfsacrifice for more than 50 years, was moved to come to that meeting last night in support of Watling and Imlach to make a speech full of courage and based on a logical understanding of Labor tradition.  His  speech, made to 160 representatives of 29 unions in Hobart last night, called on Bob Watling to boycott the kangaroo court tomorrow night, for the reasons to be sent in writing and for a firm stand to be taken against the pro-communist takeover bid. That meeting went on to make two declarations unanimously. It declared: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>That the underhanded methods used to bring alleged charges against TTLC Secretary Bob Watling and Peter Imlach, the denial to them of their rights and adequate notice, the breaches of ALP rules which have been perpetrated by the Rules Committee and the tribunal are so fundamentally opposed to natural justice and the good name of the Party as to require the firmest challenge. </para>
          <para>Because of the association and voting record of members of the Disciplinary Tribunal with those on the Rules Committee who instigated the charges, that tribunal is incapable of objective and fair judgment and is properly termed a kangaroo court&#39;, whose decision is totally predictable. </para>
          <para>Such tribunal derives its strength only from the ease with which the accused can be entangled in its fraudulent processes. </para>
          <para>We therefore call upon Bob Watling, particularly in view of the absence of Peter Imlach, to consider whether his appearance before such a tribunal would only aid the kangaroo court, bring discredit on the Labor Party which is committed tO justice and fair play. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">Which is tomorrow-  by the tribunal would be unconstitutional and invalid and we recommend to TTLC Secretary Watling that he boycotts the kangaroo court. </para>
        <para class="block">The meeting also supported the call made by Bob Watling on Friday last for an unbiased public inquiry into the whole of the unseemly episode. The second resolution I think ought to be detailed to the Senate. Honourable senators should bear in mind that this attack arose from the attack made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> on 11 November last. This is the response of the members of the organisation: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>This meeting or representatives of 29 Unions declares that if the attacks on Bob Watling and Peter Imlach are allowed to succeed the result will lead to the destruction of the Tasmanian Labor Government and Labor&#39;s chance in the forthcoming Federal Election and will pave the way for a procommunist takeover of the TTLC. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>If some honourable senators on this side have an interest in a pro-communist takeover of the trade union movement they at least should heed the other part of that resolution declaring that it those two top officials are axed it will lead to the destruction of the Labor Government in Tasmania and Labor&#39;s chances in the next Federal election. The resolution went on: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>No genuine unionist or person interested in the Labor Movement can stand by and allow this to occur. We declare that the organised Trade Union Movement is prepared to stand by Bob Watling and Peter Imlach and to defend itself against the persistent attacks launched by the extreme left aided and abetted by informers. </para>

            <para>- How stupid can you be. Let me run quickly over what has happened. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has been known by many aliases over the years. He has kept this anticommunist thing going in the Tasmanian Labor Party for such a long time that he has eventually been flushed out. Everybody knows now that he has been an imposter in the Tasmanian scene for those years. It was because of a statement made by one of his own colleagues- I have it here- and in reply to an attack that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> made on a colleague of mine, a fellow unionist and a member of the Miscellaneous Workers Union, that I came into the debate on 11 November 1976. Over the years <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has found this situation helpful to him. He has been able to bring the dissident groups in parts of the trade union movement against the Labor Party, against their traditional political voice. He has been a white amer and a subversive influence in the Party all these years. Now not only has he been expelled from the Party but also some of his stooges he carefully trained in Tasmania, including the two people he named earlier, Watling and Imlach, have been flushed out. I would like to read the statement and put it on record again for the enlightenment of honourable senators who were not present earlier. After all, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> provoked this statement. I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume,</inline> who was hurt by this statement, saying: &#39;You are a plagiarist. You are reading that speech into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard&#39;.</inline> I said at the time: &#39;Why should I not put it in accurately?&#39;. I put it in accurately. This is what is hurting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine. His</inline> friend was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> P. Forrester, who was Branch Secretary of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, Central and Southern Queensland Branch. The letter was written to the Branch Council. This is one of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> &#39;s own colleagues in his union. </para>

          <para>I have been surprised over the last three years to read of the Harradine situation in the Tasmanian ALP and the protestations made on his behalf by a number of prominent personalities. As I am not a member of the Labor Party and have not been for some five years, I have always felt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harradine</inline> &#39;s relations with that party were the business of the ALP and Harradine himself. </para>
          <para>For what it is worth, I have always felt that the ALP was a little restrictive in rejecting for membership people of various independent and extremist groups and tended to overly limit its capacity to have an exchange of views within the party confines. I personally feel the ALP was a little silly expelling <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harradine</inline> for being a member of the National Civic Council. </para>
          <para>He is surely not the only member of the National Civic Council in the ALP and some former members who are now quite prominent were in the National Civic Council as they climbed their way to their present pre-eminence. </para>

        <para class="block">I will not name the others. The point is that we are entitled to have our own rules and to run our own business. This man wants to come to this Parliament and try to tell the Labor Party in Tasmania how to run its business. We have a rule that forbids any member of the Labor Party from being a member of the National Civic Council. It is as plain as that. If honourable senators opposite had any brains at all they would introduce the same rule into their party rules. If the NCC gets the chance to undermine the parties of honourable senators opposite, it will take them over as it wishes to do to the Labor Party in Tasmania. I am telling honourable senators opposite that this is the case. I have had a lot more experience of the NCC than they have. I have had ten years of this and I know exactly what its tactics are. This is the final clear-out of this influence. The NCC has carefully undermined and penetrated the Labor Party over the years, under the influence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> and his cohorts. </para>

I wrote in my own hand on this document a reference to thieves falling out. This is exactly what has happened. These people have been conspirators. They have been termites on the political body. They have now been found out. We have isolated them and we have found also that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has lined up these two people. He has several of them lined up. But we know about Bennett. He has been a collector of funds for Santamaria who has his session broadcast over the radio. He has also given an address on Vermont Road. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> stays with Bennett. Yet all the time he has the audacity and the sheer impudence to come into the Labor Party conferences and say: &#39;I am not a member of the DLP; I am not a member of the NCC. We know that he is. He smells like one; he looks like one. He quacks like one. He waddles like one. If you waddle like one and you quack like one, you must be one. </para>

            <para>- It is spelt &#39;NCC. They will pull the Chaney on you one of these days, old boy. This is much too serious a subject to joke about. I will just say this: I reject the charges that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has made as extravagant. Of course, he has his own problems. He has to live with them. ButI am pleased to know that after 10 long years we are about to get rid of the NCC influence by the rules of the party. We will do this, in the same way as we got rid of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> despite all the difficulties we had. We are now able to get rid of the last two such people from our Party. They can do what they like in the trade union movement. It has nothing to do with us. This episode represents the pulling down of the curtain on one of the worst episodes in the almost 100 years history of the Labor Party. The fact is that we have lasted 100 years. We have seen such people come and we have seen them go. They have been excrescences on the body of our Party. We will be glad to see the last of them. </para>

          <para>-  I do not want to glorify what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has said by making a long address on this subject. I just say that there are a few things that need straightening out. It appeared in the closing stages of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne&#39;s address that we could be treating the matter as a joke. However, this is possibly one of the most serious things that has happened in recent times. It is serious that a senator will degrade himself by using the privileges of a coward&#39;s castle to slander men no matter what truth there may be in the question. He came into the Senate to slander men knowing that they have no redress and can do nothing to him. The honourable senator has sunk to a very low level to take on such a job and carry it out in this Parliament. This is what has been done tonight. I dare <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> to repeat outside the Parliament the accusations he made against any of these men. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>My main concern in speaking is to rebutt the suggestion that the dedicated Labor personality who we all knew, loved and respected- I am referring to Bert Lacey- went along to a meeting for the purpose of persuading two renegades to defy the authority of the Labor Party and not go to a particular meeting. The fact is that he went along to the meeting. I can assure honourable senators that, knowing Bert Lacey, he never ratted or allowed National Civic Council members to remain in the party. He is above that. I think an apology is owed to Bert Lacey for what it is suggested that he did. I should like to refer to the cases of Forrester and Egan, who are mainly in contention. Those two men were involved in a disputation which went to court. I believe that Forrester was fined for breaches of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act when he forged documents and acted improperly in the conduct of elections for the purpose of getting NCC members elected to the Miscellaneous Workers Union in Victoria. That was the meeting of the NCC which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> attended but which he denies he attended. </para>
        <para>The Labor Party has a rule that it has no place for NCC members. I am hopeful, if these men are NCC members, that they will be expelled from the party and that they will be expelled from every working class tribunal. Whatever may be the faults of the Communist Party, members of an organisation or trade union- an organisation representing working class peoplewill vote for those who give them some assistance rather than for those who are directly opposed to their interests. They would support a pro-communist movement rather than NCC members. These two men have been charged with belonging to an organisation, membership of which automatically puts them outside the Labor Party. They will be tried tomorrow night. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has come out with these public accusations tonight for the purpose of prejudicing the trial. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline>has told us that they have obtained counsel&#39;s opinion that the hearing would be unconstitutional and invalid and that they have nothing to worry about. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> wants them expelled tomorrow. He has made slanderous accusations- many of them false- about those who will hear the case. He has tried to put those people who will judge the case offside with the accused whose cases they will be hearing tomorrow night. He has done this for the sole purpose of ensuring that the persons hearing this case will have no sympathy with the accused. It is part of the whole scheme to ensure the expulsion of these members so that they will become martyrs at the expense of the Tasmanian Labor Party. I assure the honourable senator that I knew the facts as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne recited them in relation to 1 1 November. </para>

            <para>- I happen to know them as fact because I am aware of* the particular incidents. It is surprising how many events take place on 1 1 November. That is Armistice Day, so I suppose it is right that things should happen on that day. Let us hope that we can get above this type of slandering. We should not slander men under the protection of this Parliament for the advancement of our own political ideology when we are not prepared to make the same statement outside this Parliament. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>it is my desire to raise a matter which concerns you as Presiding Officer. Before I do that I should like to say that it is quite obvious who <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> &#39;s friends are in this place. Since he has been here he has associated on every occasion with honourable senators opposite who belong to the Liberal and National Country parties. He dines with them, he drinks with them and daily he is in and out of the offices of some prominent honourable senators opposite. There is no doubt where his sympathies lie. There is no doubt that honourable senators opposite are using him on every occasion they can to try to belittle the Labor Party. We saw a perfect illustration of that here tonight when we saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline> come to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> &#39;s defence. Of course, we have known for a long time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has never been a loyal member of the Labor Party. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> has pointed out, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has been a white anter. We have woken up to him and that is what hurts him. He mentioned tonight that some friend he had in the Labor Party told him something. My interjection was that he does not have a friend in the Labor Party and he never has had one, because of his action in trying to white ant the Labor Party. </para>

        <para>The matter to which I wish to draw your attention tonight is an article which appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> on 1 September 1977. It is headed &#39;Tighter security plan for House&#39;. I will read it to the Senate because although I am a member of the Joint House Committee I am not aware that what this report purports has been carried out. It is an article written by Brad Lawson in Canberra. It states: </para>

          <para>Plans have been made to tighten security at Parliament House in Canberra. </para>
          <para>The present security measures have been described as almost non-existent. </para>

When an honourable senator moves, pursuant to Standing Order 364, for the tabling of a document from which another honourable senator is quoting, does that mean that in future an honourable senator needs only to tear out the page from which he or she is 3 uoting and will not have to table the whole ocument? </para>

That is the first thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> seems to have the right to speak whenever he likes. Secondly, I think the pertinent question now is: What is a document? I do not think there is any disagreement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> has tabled the page from which he quoted. I think there is agreement that the page was clipped to other pages and he took the page from which he quoted off those other pages and tabled it. But the question is: Is everything a senator holds in his hand the document? </para>

            <para>- On the point of order, if I may I will take up basically the same question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has posed because I think it is important. I have always understood the practice in this place to be that if one brings in a file and quotes from it the whole file is the document and one tables the lot. One has never been able just to take out of the file a piece of paper. </para>

            <para>- Wait a minute. That is why I understood that if one was going to quote from a file the sensible practice was that one brought in photostats of the parts one was going to quote from, not the whole file in case someone asked that it be tabled. In fact, I recall that a Minister in a previous government- the McMahon Government or the Gorton Government- had to table a whole file because he quoted from part of it. The question is: When is a file not a file? What is a file? It is a collection of papers. I do not know whether it has to be a collection of papers of the same sort. Perhaps a file can be a miscellany of papers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> evidently had the quoted matter on a page which was stapled, attached, pinned- I do not know which- to some other papers. I am not disputing his word that he has tabled the only page from which he quoted within that collection of papers he had but, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I am quite relaxed about whichever way you rule. Your ruling is going to be of great importance to the future practice of the Senate. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> that the question is: When is a document not a document? I go further and ask: When is a file not a file? It has been alleged that in previous times some honourable senators have just taken out a particular part of a file. </para>

You cannot move other than what the Standing Orders provide. As I recall the Standing Order- I am talking from memory- it says that an honourable senator may move that a document from which an honourable senator has quoted be tabled. </para>

            <para>- I am prepared to admit that he may well have done that but if you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> rule that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> did is correct and proper- I will not get excited if you do rule that way-it will mean that what I have understood to be the previous practice will not be the practice in future. That is that honourable senators can come in here with a sheaf of papers, attached or put loosely together, and they do not have to table the whole bundle- if I may use that expression- instead of the document, the file or whatever it may be. Therefore, I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> you take the point of order of board and rule tomorrow. It is a matter of great importance. I do not know whether it is within your province to rule at a later hour but I think that it is a matter of vast importance to Senate practice. It is something on which we all ought to be quite certain in the future. </para>

Equally, however, Australia is concerned with impediments in regard to access to the Community for our agricultural products and the impact of increasing competition in third markets from the subsidised export of EEC surplus production. I am of the view that there would be advantage to Australia in having a bilateral agreement with the Community but the question of whether there is ultimately such an agreement and what it should include would, of course, be a matter for negotiation. </para>

            <para>There is no national program as such in Australia sponsored by the Government.

Literature to support these activities is provided by the National Heart Foundation, and persons found to have hypertension are referred to their doctor. </para>

            <para>-On 23 March 1977 <inline font-style="italic">{Hansard,</inline> page 402) <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> asked me a question, without notice, relating to enrolments in universities in 1977. In my answer I undertook to provide further information when final enrolment figures were available. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am advised by the Tertiary Education Commission that total enrolments in Australian universities, as at 30 April 1977, were 157,919 (including enrolments at Deakin University for the first time). This figure represents an increase of 3 per cent over total enrolments in 1 976. </para>
          <para>The total enrolment in universities was in accord with planned levels of student load recommended for 1977 in the former Universities Commission&#39;s Report for 1977-79 Triennium. Measured in terms of equivalent full-time students, total actual student load in 1977 was only 0.8 per cent below the level recommended by the Commission. At some universities, enrolment levels in 1977 show a significant departure  from planned levels. It should be stressed, however, that many factors affect the ability of universities to match enrolments precisely to these levels. I expect that the Tertiary Education Commission will comment on this matter in its forthcoming report. </para>
