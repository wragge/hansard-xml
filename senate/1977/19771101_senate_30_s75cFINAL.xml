          <para>- by leave- When I informed the Senate that the Government proposed that the next House of Representatives and half Senate elections should be held on Saturday, 10 December 1977, I undertook to confirm details of the time-table when replies had been received from the States. I am now able to say that all States are in agreement with the time-table, which is as follows: </para>

            <para>To the Honourable  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned students, parents, teachers and citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: </para>
            <para>That the report of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations on Employment Prospects by Industry and Occupation, July 1977, p. 197, states that, in respect of Stenographers/Secretaries: </para>
            <para>With the exception of new business college graduates the demand for less experienced and less skilled people in Sydney is in balance with the supply. </para>
            <para>Business College graduates are exactly what the market wants and employers demand. </para>
            <para>In one of the few fields of employment shown by the report to be under-supplied, the Government is effectively reducing the ability of business colleges to train enough secretaries and stenographers for the positions which are available. </para>
            <para>The sixteen technical colleges in the Metropolitan area of Sydney which accommodate 3220 students in day secretarial studies do not have the capacity to accommodate more than 6 per cent of the 2435 students at non-State business colleges in the same area who will be disadvantaged by the Government&#39;s recent decision to withdraw fees subsidies and living allowances from the end of 1 977. 1977 School leavers who wish to undertake a course in Secretarial Studies and thus ensure they obtain a worthwhile position of employment on graduation are being forced to pay fees of the order of $1400 for the year and also to forgo TEAS living allowances. </para>
            <para>The Government&#39;s decision is unfair, unjust, discriminatory, unreasonable and capricious. </para>
            <para>Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government will act immediately to undertake a thorough review of the position of non-State business colleges, guarantee interim funding forthwith and reverse its decision. </para>

Has he seen also a statement which apeared in the same article, attributed to the Australian Electoral Officer for Western Australia, that under the Commonwealth Electoral Act a how-to-vote card need not necessarily be taken as a notice of intention of how an elector wanted to vote. Is the Minister aware that in a circular issued last July the Australian Chief Electoral Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pearson,</inline> made the following statement: </para>

            <para>-My question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate follows the answer he has just given. He and the Government apparently take great delight in the fact that the Labor Party has allegedly changed its policy on the export and development of uranium. Is the Minister prepared to direct the same criticism against his own Government for changing its policy on the recognition of China, changing its policy on a national health scheme, changing its policy on overseas investment in Australian companies, changing its policy on simultaneous elections, and its policy on the payment of a dairy bounty? I will not bore the Senate but there are many more examples. Is it a fact that the Minister said in this chamber on 2 1 May this year when answering a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> in respect of the constitutional referenda: I am prepared to admit that I was wrong. I have learned by experience*? </para>

            <para>- That is a very interesting question. I do not think it is a terribly good way for the Leader of the Opposition to get out of a factual situation. If the honourable senator had been here last week he would have known that this matter arose from the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> G. Whitlam said on television to Miss Lindy Jenkins that he had never signed anything about the mining and export of uranium. That is what I was talking about. This gentleman, who is all too prone on television to accuse others of being liars, said he never had. As the honourable senator ought to realise, that was not a correct statement. He ought also to know that on 28 October 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> entered into a contract with Peko-EZ to mine and export 6,600 tons of uranium. That is what we are talking about, not whether we changed our minds over mainland China or something else. We are talking about a man going on television- a man who puts himself forward as the alternative Prime Minister of this country- and just not giving the facts. That is what we were talking about last week and what we are still talking about. I say to the Leader of the Opposition in this place that if he trusts a man who will indulge in those sorts of attitudes and ideas, I am certain the Australian electorate will not. </para>

            <para>- The Government was, in accordance with the regulations, appointing six new Family Court judges. Of course, the six judges had to be apportioned throughout the States of Australia, except Western Australia, which has its own State Family Court. Although there have been, and continue to be, great delays in disposing of Family Court matters in Victoria, there are delays in all other States as well. Indeed, the rate of applications in a number of other registries is even greater than that in Victoria. It is to be expected that in the course of time there will be even greater demands on the time of judges in those registeries than there will be in Victoria. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A further consideration is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Butler has been appointed as a Family Court judge resident in northern Tasmania, and that hitherto judges of the Family Court in Victoria from time to time rendered assistance in that State. That call upon their time will no longer be made. Moreover, part of the arrangement made with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Butler is that, because he is not expected to be fully engaged in northern Tasmania, he will be available to travel to Victoria and assist there. Therefore, although only one extra judge is being appointed in Victoria, in effect almost the time of a second judge will be available in that State also. </para>
          <para>I should also refer to the fact that an additional legally qualified  deputy  registrar will commence duties in the Melbourne registry on 24 October. That brings to three the number of persons in the registry who can conduct conferences between parties and that, of course, relieves judges of a considerable burden in terms of time. </para>

Is it a fact that, due to Federal Government restrictions on education funding, a reduction of the order of 8 per cent had to be made in the number of student places envisaged for colleges of advanced education in Queensland in the three years 1977 to 1979?

            <para>- I have not seen the report which, as I understand it, is a State report. I will look at it. If the report suggests what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> says it suggests then it suggests that the former Commission of Advanced Education, which is now the Council of Advanced Education, and the Tertiary Education Commission, both of which are statutory, objective and independent bodies, are in fact being partisan against Queensland. I wonder whether that is a suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> supports. He shakes his head. But he acknowledges it if, as he reports it to me, that is suggested. Let me simply say that I believe that these independent statutory bodies, which in their time- certainly the Commission- were supported by the Whitlam Government, are themselves utterly impartial and their recommendations on the allocation of funds are indeed impartial. But I will look at whether the substance of the matter is as has been suggested and let the honourable senator know. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable senator also asked whether there will be an 8 per cent reduction in the number of student places. That is not my understanding in relation to Australia as a whole. My understanding and the Government&#39;s understanding is that the colleges of advanced education in Australia should be capable in the years ahead of absorbing those who apply. But the honourable senator must keep in mind that 43 per cent of the students who attend colleges of advanced education are teacher trainees. He would be aware that Australia is moving into a glut supply position in relation to the number of qualified teachers. Therefore each State is applying a reduction in the number of places and students themselves are voluntarily not moving forward into teacher training. So voluntarily fewer teacher trainees automatically will be going to colleges of advanced education. I repeat that some 43 per cent of the places in colleges of advanced education are held by teacher trainees. </para>
          <para>There is no reason at all why students in the post-school area cannot find a place appropriate to their qualifications and academic achievements in universities, colleges and the technical and further education field. There will be, of course, by voluntary choice a movement of young people and others from universities and colleges to the technical and further education field. There is a growing realisation in the community that there is a need for manual skills and higher technology, and that there is a financially and spiritually rewarding career in those areas. I will look up the report. If I find any information relevant to this question, I will let the honourable senator know. </para>

            <para>- I have some information on this matter. I am able to advise that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs&#39; share of the cost of restoration of damaged housing on Mornington Island as a result of Cyclone Ted is $1,480,500. The Department will provide the money over a two-year to three-year period. Its cash provision for this program during 1977-78 is $1,050,000. The Natural Disaster Relief Fund will provide $3,454,500, covering both Mornington Island and Burketown. I understand that 83 houses and 40 shelters have been built on Mornington Island. I am not aware of who is occupying these houses; nor am I aware of any delays in construction that have occurred. I remind the Senate that the development of this area is the responsibility of the Queensland State Government. I will ask my colleague the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make inquiries into whether there is further information that he can give on this matter. </para>

Will the Minister for Social Security clear up the matter of whether the letter tabled last week by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> is an authentic letter from the Ombudsman to the Minister or whether it is a fraud? If the letter is authentic, do the Minister&#39;s initials on the side indicate that she has read the letter? If it is authentic, do the figures 28/9 indicate that the Minister read the letter on 28 September? If it is authentic, was the Minister telling the truth - </para>

            <para>- A number of matters have been raised in the honourable senator&#39;s question. Dealing with what I believe to be the first one- the matter of whether the letter tabled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> is an authentic letter- let me say that the copy of the letter tabled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> which I have seen does appear to be a copy of a letter from the Ombudsman addressed to me. Certain markings on the letter had been obscured from the copy that was tabled and certain other markings appeared on it. However, it does appear to be a copy of a letter from the Ombudsman to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> raised several other matters. I should like to refer to the original question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> when he asked: </para>

          <para>That was a true statement of fact at the time that I made it. I still am not aware of whether Karen Green&#39;s case specifically is before the Ombudsman. I am not aware of what is on his desk from time to time and whether he has completed the review of a case or whether he has made a report which I have not seen. If the Opposition will read the answers which are given and understand the plain language in which they are expressed, it will find that it has built a case around an answer which was true at the time and which is true now. Any other semantics which may be indulged in by the Opposition will not lead to any different answer being given by me about whether a case is specifically before the Ombudsman at that time. </para>
          <para>Further questions have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> today in relation to my answer that I am aware that from time to time I receive advice from the Ombudsman of cases which are before him. That also is a statement of fact. From time to time I do receive advice from the Ombudsman, in accordance with his line of duty, of cases which are before him. The Opposition for some reason of its own may have interest only in the case of Karen Green. I assure honourable senators opposite that there is not only one case before the Ombudsman. There are several cases before him. He advises me from time to time of these matters. </para>

            <para>- I cannot say whether the statement attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Hawke is correct. Apart from what I have been told 1 am not aware of what he said on this matter. I accept the fact that apparently he has indicated that he expects this legislation to be withdrawn, that is, the amendments which were made by the Parliament and which passed through the Senate on Friday, 2 1 October, making some major amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I cannot imagine why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Hawke would have thought or expected that the Government would withdraw the legislation. The Government made it perfectly clear before the legislation was introduced and during the passage of the legislation, as I did when anwering questions in the Senate from time to time on behalf of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, that this legislation was regarded by the Government as a most important reform of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Many of the reforms were foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in his policy speech and in speaking on other policy matters on which the Government was elected on 13 December 1975. In fact, provisions dealing with the powers of the Industrial Relations Bureau were incorporated in legislation which was introduced in the Parliament in May this year. When the Government stood those matters over it made it clear that it intended to discuss those matters with the National Labour Consultative Council and certainly adhered to its view that this legislation was desirable and that it would propose the legislation subsequently in the Parliament. The legislation was introduced in accordance with statements and promises which have been made by the Government for some time and in accordance with its policies. I think it is perfectly clear now to most people in the community, if not to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Hawke and to the Opposition, that the legislation was most necessary and desirable and that the Industrial Relations Bureau, with the powers it now has, will contribute substantially to the improvement of industrial relations in this country. </para>

            <para>- I shall answer the second part of the question first. Funds provided by the Commonwealth to New South Wales for its Adult Migrant Education Service in the last 3 program years are as follows: In 1975-76, the last year of the Whitlam Government, $2,626,260; in 1976-77, the first year of the Fraser Government, $2,957,026; this year, 1977-78, including the amount provided in the Budget and additional allocations, it is $3,466,000 which is an increase of 17.21 per cent. So there have been substantial increases. The break-up of funds provided to New South Wales shows that in more recent times I approved an additional $150,000 some weeks ago and, more recently $226,000 to extend the New South Wales programs. New South Wales will take its appropriate share of funds for on-arrival language programs for refugees, English language courses conducted during the vacation, the development of further initiatives and the teaching of English in courses in the working place, assessing the feasibility of English teaching in television programs in high rise housing developments, and increased living allowances for persons in full time courses to the equivalent of the unemployment benefit. So there has been a significant increase in the money flow to adult migrant education as well as considerable diversification in the program. </para>

I will draw the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, to statements that have been made by the South Australian Attorney-General and referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner.</inline> I think that is a matter which he certainly should take up with the South Australian Attorney-General and consider in relation to the negotiations that have been going on. </para>

            <para>-Senator Mulvihill sent me a telegram yesterday on this matter; so I have had an opportunity to try to obtain for him and the Senate some detailed information on the matter. However, it has not been possible to obtain a detailed answer covering all the various Commonwealth employing bodies. We will endeavour to do so in due course. It can be said generally that the Public Service Act which, of course, covers mainly the ministerial departments, which represent about one-third of Commonwealth employment, contains a longstanding requirement that permanent officers should be British subjects. There is no nationality requirement for temporary or exempt staff employed under the Public Service Act. However, in practice, all staff are required to be permanent residents. A major area of Commonwealth employment is within the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions. There is no nationality requirement for staff employed by those commissions, but permanent resident status is a condition of eligibility for employment. In other areas of Commonwealth employment differing arrangements have been established to meet the wide variety of circumstances that obtain. Legislation covering a number of Commonwealth authorities does nor require British subject status for appointment. Those are some of the details that we have been able to obtain for the honourable senator. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Policy on this matter has been under review, following the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration that nationality requirements for permanent appointment should be abolished except where Australian citizenship is prescribed for particular positions. For example, I refer to positions in the diplomatic service or national security areas. Consideration is being given to the Royal Commission&#39;s recommendation in the light of the diversity of employment in the Commonwealth Government and the need to accommodate differing circumstances. </para>

In addition to the question which I sent to the Minister yesterday, and following upon the precedent established by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> as a former Postmaster-General, I asked the Bureau of Customs, in view of its big recruiting program, what was the position of a national of one of the 35 British Commonwealth countries who has married an Australian but, of course, does not have Australian citizenship. The advice I received was that, unless such a person had Australian citizenship by February when the recruitment was completed, he would not be employed. In addition to sending a telegram to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, I sent a telegram to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> who represents the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate, to bracket both Ministers together on a specific issue. I take it now that the Minister will get in touch with the Customs people to see specifically what happens in a case involving a migrant who marries an Australian. Are such people to be denied employment in the Bureau of Customs? </para>

              <para>-I will take up that specific question with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Of course, employment in the Bureau of Customs most probably would come under the Public Service Act. So, the general position in regard to the employment of permanent officers who are British subjects would apply. However, I will not go into the details of the question. Perhaps I should not say anything more about that particular case. </para>

Whilst I appreciate that the Minister cannot and should not give any direction to the ABC, will he, in view of the paucity of informative radio discussion programs currently available, urge the ABC Commissioners to reconsider their decision? As a result of questions asked in the Senate last week on this subject, has the Minister ascertained and can he inform the Senate the reason for the program being discontinued? Is the Minister satisfied that the ABC is at present providing adequate and comprehensive programming so far as public discussion is concerned? </para>

            <para>-It is quite clear that there is considerable public protest at the cancellation of the Terry Lane program. It is equally true that last week I was asked at least several questions on this matter and I undertook to transfer the substance of those questions to my colleague in another place. That has been done. No response has come under my scrutiny which indicates why the Australian Broadcasting Commission has made this decision with regard to Terry Lane. I shall seek to obtain that information and to make it public, as well as making it available to the honourable senator. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable senator asked whether I personally-and presumably the Federal Government-was satisfied that under the Broadcasting and Television Act the Australian Broadcasting Commission was discharging its legislative responsibility to program adequate and comprehensive programs. I have no way of making a value judgment on this matter. I think that in the first place it is a matter for the general public to determine. I think that if there is a substantial and sustained protest it must indicate that in at least one direction the ABC is not fulfilling its legislative responsibility. I have always regarded healthy public protest as a good thing. I hope that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, in a wider sense than just the ABC, is encouraging adequate and comprehensive programming in Australia. In any case, I shall again take up this matter. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources. I refer to the recent visit to Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Dickson</inline> Mabon, the United Kingdom Labour Minister for Energy. I preface my question by saying that I enjoyed a dinner with him and his officers last Thursday night. Is it a fact that the Minister for Energy in the United Kingdom is completely satisfied with the storage techniques being applied to radioactive waste following 20 years of experience in the United Kingdom? Is it also true that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mabon</inline> is very impressed with the safeguards requirements laid down by the Australian Government with respect to uranium? Can the Minister say whether the Government has agreed to supply the United Kingdom Minister&#39;s long-term requirement of 1,000 tonnes of uranium per annum? Is he able to say what such an order would mean to Australia in economic terms and also with respect to job opportunities? Can the Minister say whether the United Kingdom </para>

            <para>-I think we are all well aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mabon</inline> has been in Australia. For some reason he has incurred the wrath of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren,</inline> in the other place who expected a very distinguished member of the United Kingdom Labour Government to look after his political fortunes rather than the interests of the United Kingdom. It must come very hard for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren</inline> and those who think as he does that other members of Labour parties throughout the world do not support the peculiar attitudes of the Australian Labor Party. As I understand it, the United Kingdom Minister said that he was satisfied with the precautions which have been taken in the United Kingdom. He was certainly impressed with the safeguards which have been announced by the Australian Government. He believes them to be the strictest and most useful safeguards promulgated by any government in the world. </para>

          <para>As to whether Australia has agreed to supply 1,000 tonnes of uranium a year I shall have to make inquiries for the honourable senator. I understand that uranium is worth about $40 a pound. I do not know whether that is United States dollars or Australian dollars. From my rough maths I suppose that 1,000 tonnes a year would be worth about $80m a year. Not only has <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mabon</inline> enunciated the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Callaghan</inline> &#39;s United Kingdom Labour Government; it would also be the policy of the British Trade Union Congress. The honourable senator would know that some weeks ago I read into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a resolution of the United Kingdom Trade Union Congress on 8 September this year. The Congress backed a call for an expanded nuclear power program in England. Obviously, the United Kingdom Trade Union Congress is devoting its time and attention to the benefits its members will receive from such a program and not indulging in politics. That contrasts very sharply with the attitude taken by some trade unions in Australia. </para>
          <para>Australia has been very fortunate to have a visitor of the standing and quality of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mabon</inline> to show us how enlightened countries are handling this problem. It was the same sort of attitude that the Whitlam Labor Government had when it was in power. As I said earlier in Question Time, we all recall that the Labor Government, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> was desperately anxious to borrow $4,000m overseas, at least $225m of which was to go into building a uranium enrichment plant in this country. The memorandum of understanding of 28 October 1975 shows that it was putting this in hand. I recall that at that stage the Government was going to put up 72V4 per cent of the capital in return for 50 per cent of the profit. It was anxious, desperately anxious. As I recall, it was said that the reason for using <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to raise $4,000m was to generate jobs in Australia which would have benefited trade unionists. It is a shame that neither the Labor Party nor the trade union movement now seems to have any interest at all in the employment of trade union members. </para>

That is what the honourable senator is saying. He is so bound up in his dislike of individuals that he and his party will put such policies into effect. They will abolish the superphosphate bounty just as they abolished it last time, and all farmers have now been put on notice that the Australian Labor Party does not believe in the payment of such bounties. </para>

The Minister will recall that over the years there has been reported an acceptance by successive Ministers of the fact that a Commonwealth Government centre would be established in Adelaide. Ministers in the present Government, the previous Government and the one before that have reported that such a project has been kept alive. I am now informed that the only block available to accommodate such a building in Adelaide, which was intended to house some of the 20 Commonwealth departments, is to be sold. I ask the Minister: Is that a fact? Will the sale of this land mean the end of any possibility of there being a structure to do that which was formally discussed? </para>

              <para>-Senator Cavanagh could be right. I cannot recall the exact details. I think that under both the State planning ordinances and the city council ordinances the Commonwealth would have had problems in putting a multi-storey office block on that site. Therefore, at the request of the State Government and the city council, it has been sold to the city council for a car parking facility. There is, however, another site which has been held for some time. </para>

            <para>-I read with very considerable concern reports in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberrra Times</inline> of yesterday and today purporting to be a background of a series of events relating to the seventh Williamsburg Conference. I understand that this Conference, which is well respected internationally, had been invited to Australia, in a co-sponsorship with the Australian Institute of International Affairs, to hold private study meetings in its normal way with regard to Asian and Pacific economic and political affairs. In the past this Conference has met in various places. It has met privately but its papers have been published later. Its papers are considerably sought after in the world as well respected in their contents. My understanding is that a booking was made for University House. I have read in the Press that arising from the fear of disruption and violence - </para>

          <para>If a university has found it necessary, in its own judgment, to move a meeting off its campus, then that university has failed to discharge an undertaking that is implicit in the legislation setting it up and has failed to take account of advice from this Government. Universities are given statutory authority in order to ensure academic freedom. Fundamentally, that means they will uphold freedom of speech, whether it be from the Left or the Right, and not selectively, only when it comes from the Left and the far Left. My Government has asked all vice-chancellors to ensure that on campuses there shall be no intimidation, no violence at all, and no threats of terrorism. We have had such an assurance. Since I have only the newspaper reports on this matter, I propose to get in touch with the University and to ask what are the facts. However, I must underline that people in other parts of the world will be horrified at the concept of our institutions in Australia if those institutions cannot support such study groups as this- such freedom of speech. We will become the kind of banana republic that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> is advocating by his interjections. For my part, if the facts are as publicised, there is reason for grave concern in the community. </para>

            <para>- by leaveAll the notices of motion standing in my name on the Business Paper today were given in respect of legislation which was under inquiry by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. The first of the notices of motion relates to the Ombudsman Regulations. The Ombudsman Act passed by the Parliament in 1976 provided that Commonwealth statutory authorities would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, but that they could be excluded from his jurisdiction by regulation. Companies owned by the Commonwealth are excluded unless specifically included by the regulations. The regulations provide for exclusion of a number of statutory authorities and companies and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee considered that it was its duty to examine the reasons for their exclusion. The Committee considers that to restrict the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman is to restrict the rights of the citizen, and that Commonwealth authorities should not be excluded from the Ombudsman&#39;s jurisdiction except for the most cogent reasons. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Committee is concerned that the regulations exclude a number of commercial statutory authorities and companies, such as the various Commonwealth banks, on the ground that they are in competition with private enterprise and their commercial operations should not be subject to review by the Ombudsman. The Committee considers that the administrative acts of these bodies should be included in the Ombudsman&#39;s jurisdiction. The Committee does not object to the other bodies excluded by the regulations. These include judicial and industrial tribunals, bodies established by international agreement, the Auditor-General, and the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has given the Committee an assurance that the Administrative Review Council will review the Ombudsman&#39;s jurisdiction and that the report of the Council will be made available to the Committee. The Committee has accepted this assurance, and also intends, when the report is available, to seek the opinion of the Ombudsman, and information on the number of cases he has been unable to investigate because of lack of jurisdiction under the regulations. On this basis the Committee is prepared to allow the regulations to stand. </para>
          <para>The second notice of motion relates to the Australian Capital Territory Sale of Motor Vehicles Ordinance. This ordinance provides that the Registrar of Motor Vehicle Dealers may adjudicate in disputes between sellers and buyers of motor vehicles and may make such orders as he considers just and there are penalties for enforcing his orders. Although there is an appeal to the courts against decisions cif the Registrar, and the Registrar may not deal with disputes which are before the courts, the Committee considers that these provisions are in principle objectionable, in that they confer on an administrative official the powers and responsibilities of a court. The provision of penalties to enforce the orders of the Registrar violates the principle that civil orders should be enforced in the first instance by civil and not criminal remedies. The other provision that the Committee considers objectionable, is to the effect that persons who bring witnesses in hearings before the Registrar are liable for the expenses of those witnesses, notwithstanding that the witnesses may be material to the proceedings. The Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> has undertaken to review and amend all of these provisions, and the provisions will not come into effect until that review has occurred. The Committee will have the opportunity of examining the amendments when they are made. The Committee is willing to allow the ordinance to stand on the basis of this undertaking. </para>
          <para>The third notice of motion relates to the Australian Capital Territory Legal Aid Ordinance. This ordinance contains a provision to the effect that where a legally assisted person fails in litigation, and had costs awarded against him by the court, the Legal Aid Commission may or may not pay those costs. This decision is subject to no appeal except to a review committee appointed by the Commission itself. The Committee considers that there is a risk of grave injustice being done under this provision. A person may, with the assistance of legal aid, initiate litigation which he would not otherwise have undertaken. The defendant in those proceedings may be put to great expense in defending himself, and then, notwithstanding that the case fails, and the court orders that the plaintiff should pay the defendant&#39;s costs, the defendant may be unable to recover those costs because the Legal Aid Commission, and the review committee appointed by it, refuses to pay the costs regardless of the order of the court. The Committee is also disturbed to note that the review committees are to be the final avenue of appeal against decisions by the Commission, but that they are lacking in procedures under the ordinance and that the appellant is not even given a right to be heard. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack),</inline> in response to the Committee&#39;s view that a court should have the power to decide whether costs awarded against a legally assisted person will be paid by the Legal Aid Commission, has pointed out that this would require an Act of Parliament, and could not be achieved in the present Parliament. The Attorney-General has undertaken to refer to the Administrative Review Council the operation of the ordinance, and to review the ordinance in the light of experience in its first 12 months of operation. The ordinance will also be amended so as to give an appellant the right to be heard by a review committee. The Committee is prepared to allow the ordinance to stand on the basis of that assurance, but the Committee would hope to examine the recommendations of the Administrative Review Council, and also to discover whether there are any cases of costs being awarded against legally assisted persons, and whether the Legal Aid Commission pays those costs in those cases. </para>
          <para>The Senate will see from this statement that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has subjected these three pieces of subordinate legislation to close scrutiny to see whether the rights and liberties of persons are properly safeguarded, and it is hoped that during the new Parliament the operation of this legislation will be reviewed in accordance with the terms of my statement. In view of the undertakings given by the responsible Ministers, and the consequent decisions of the Committee, I withdraw Business of the Senate, Notices of Motion Nos 1, 2 and 3, standing in my name. </para>

              <para>-I am a new member of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> is the  Chairman.  May I express the concern I feel. The Committee does not appear to have sufficient time now to consider some very important changes to regulations. Because we have only IS sitting days in which to make a decision the Committee is constrained and has to come to some arrangement, as has been arrived at in this case, and allow regulations to stand. I believe that the Senate ought to consider whether this Committee is inhibited by the 15-day rule and whether that period of time ought to be extended. </para>

          <para>It also appears to me, as a new member of the Committee, that many more important regulations are coming before the Committee. This may be because of the Government&#39;s policy of seeking to govern perhaps by regulation rather than by Act of Parliament. I make these few remarks to get my concern into the records. The Committee has been under pressure, as has been revealed in respect of the three notices of motion referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood.</inline> As a result the Senate may have to consider the 15-day rule and decide whether it ought to be extended. </para>

          <para>- For some time the Senate has been loth to agree to sittings of committees at the same time as the Senate is sitting unless good and cogent reasons are given to the Senate. I am not saying that there are not good and cogent reasons in this case but they have not been advanced. I think we should ensure, before we agree to such a proposition, that those reasons are put forward by the mover of the motion because it is a principle that the Senate has been careful to preserve. </para>

          <para>- in reply- I apologise to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland).</inline> I thought all the buttons had been done up and that the honourable senator had been advised in this regard. The Public Accounts Committee has been enjoying a very heavy workload recently in respect of public hearings. The Committee, due to a change of secretary, has been unable in the short time available to it to complete all the necessary reports that ought to be submitted to the Parliament before it rises next week. Consequently the Committee, at its meeting this morning, decided to ask the Senate whether it would give leave in this circumstance so that it could meet its obligations. </para>

Details of the amounts sought by each Department are shown in Schedule 2 to the Bill, the sum of these appropriations being $1,329,969,000. Of this, $745,044,000 was authorised by Supply Act (No. 2) 1977-78, the balance of $584,925,000 being authorised by this Bill. The main features of the proposed expenditure were outlined in the Budget Speech. The Schedule to this Bill is the same as that contained in the document entitled &#39;Particulars of Certain Proposed Expenditure in respect of the Year Ending on 30 June 1978&#39; which was referred to the Senate Estimates Committees on 25 August for examination and report. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill provides for an increase in the salary of the Governor-General. Because the Constitution provides that the salary of the Governor-General will not be altered during his continuance in office, the increased salary becomes payable to the next Governor-General, after he is sworn in December. The present Governor-General Act was introduced by the Labor Administration in 1974 and provided for a salary $30,000. It is now proposed that the Governor-General&#39;s salary be $37,000- a salary that will remain unchanged through the period of the next GovernorGeneral&#39;s appointment. </para>
          <para>In 1974 the then Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G.

They are that the Governor-General&#39;s salary would be dealt with in a non-party way; that the salary should recognise the importance and place of his high office; and that the appointment of a Governor-General should not depend on personal wealth or the availability of other income. The Government fully endorses these principles. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill was foreshadowed in the statement to Parliament by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on 6 October when he announced the Government&#39;s decision to appoint <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, to represent Australia overseas in international endeavours to secure a strengthened nuclear non-proliferation regime. In announcing that decision, the Prime Minister mentioned that the Government would be introducing legislation to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox to retain his judicial status and the rights which attach to that status while he is Ambassador-at-Large. This Bill makes provision for those matters. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>Fox is at present the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory and he is also a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. As the Prime Minister mentioned in his statement of 6 October,  His  Honour proposes, when the formalities in relation to his ambassadorial appointment have been completed, to resign his office of Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. This is a step which will be greatly regretted. I know that  His  Honour has reached his decision to resign only after very careful consideration. It is an unselfish step which  His  Honour considers he should take in the interests of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, having regard to the administrative nature of the duties of the Chief Judge of that Court.  His  Honour will nevertheless retain his appointment as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia and the present Bill will remove any doubts that otherwise might exist as to the effect that the ambassadorial appointment might have had on his judicial office. </para>
          <para>This is in line with the legislative action that was taken to remove any doubts that the diplomatic appointments of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon in 1940 and 1942 respectively, and the appointment last year of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward as Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, may have had on their judicial offices. The Bill provides that while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox is holding his appointment as Ambassador-at-Large he will retain his entitlements to remuneration and annual allowance that he would have had as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory.  His  pension entitlement under the Judges &#39; Pensions Act 1 968 is also to be retained on that basis. </para>
          <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox&#39;s appointment as Ambassador-at-Large comes to an end he will retain his position as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia and he will be entitled to remuneration and annual allowances on that basis. This will be a somewhat lesser entitlement than  His  Honour would have had if he had retained the office of Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, but  His  Honour has indicated that this is nevertheless acceptable to him. </para>
          <para>Somewhat different considerations, however, apply in relation to  His  Honour&#39;s pension entitlement under the Judges&#39; Pensions Act. The Bill provides that  His  Honour will not suffer any loss of pension entitlement, which has largely accrued already, by reason of his proposed resignation as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. I am sure honourable senators will agree that it is appropriate that  His  Honour should retain his pension rights. </para>
          <para>It only remains for me to endorse what the Prime Minister has already said about the importance which the Government attaches to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox&#39;s proposed appointment as Ambassador-at-Large and to  His  Honour&#39;s preeminent qualifications for the task. It is a great pity that during the term of his appointment he will be unavailable for judicial service but bis contribution towards our endeavours to secure a strengthened nuclear non-proliferation regime will, I am sure, more than make up for this. </para>

          <para class="block">Since that report was handed down in September 1975, nothing has happened in terms of the recommendations which the Joint Committee, on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament-an all party committee- made to the Parliament. I will cite a very important section of the report which gives some of the reasons why its recommendations should have been carried out and the urgency with which the Committee in 1975 saw that they should be carried out. The Committee said this in a most important statement on page 44 of its report: </para>

            <para>It will be perceived that the thread which has been running through the fabric of this Report is that of concern for the welfare and integrity of public life which is being demeaned by various forces, but particularly by that of insidious cynicism accompanied as it is by destructive denigration. While making proposals to redress this situation due care has been given to the delicate mechanisms of our society which is of necessity a complementary partnership. This partnership of the people is a partnership between responsive Government, a constructive Parliament, a loyal Opposition, a dedicated Public Service, </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Committee finished that paragraph with this sentence: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In such an interdependent community that which is within the power of Parliament and its partners to do to promote this objective should be done with alacrity and with total disregard to self interest. </para>

          <para class="block">That was a message of urgency which a committee of this Parliament gave to the Parliament in 1975. 1 would think that most members of this Parliament believe that we should have the highest standards in Australia in relation to this question of the pecuniary interests of members of this Parliament. After all, in 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> promised us sound management and honest government. There was a lot said in 1975 about the importance of honest government. Honest government involves not just honesty in itself but also the people of this country being able to see that government is honest and that it is perceived to be honest by the people to avoid the sort of cynicism to which the report in 1975 referred. One would have thought that this Government or this Parliament should have nothing to fear from honest disclosure of financial interests. </para>
          <para>Of course, the matter has come to light again in my State of Victoria quite recently with the inquiry into land dealings in that State in which, whatever the results of the inquiry being conducted into land dealings is, it is perceived by a large number of people that there has been a situation in that State in which there must be very grave doubts about the honesty and integrity of a number of public servants. It is also perceived that there must be very grave doubts about the competence and perhaps the honesty of a number of Ministers in the State Government in Victoria. Although that inquiry relates to Victoria, it must be a matter of concern to this Parliament as well. The essential point about the report of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament is simply this: The public is entitled to know, for very obvious reasons. </para>
          <para>I would argue not only that the public is entitled to know- of course, that is the most important thing- but also that we all should be diligent to see that in this country we have standards which are as high as those in other countries with similar pretentions to our own. For example, in the United States of America the policy of the Senate is stated quite clearly. It is that senators, officers and employees of the Senate make full and complete public disclosures of their financial holdings. The position in Great Britain is very well stated in Erskine May&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> and is stated quite explicitly in the  Clerk  of the Senate&#39;s book <inline font-style="italic">Australian Senate Practice.</inline> The section of the latter book which deals with the declaration of interests is to be particularly commended for the way in which it sets out this whole matter. I will quote the learned Clerk&#39;s reference to the particular point of the 1975 report. On page 283 of the book he states, in relation to the situation in Great Britain: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In 1975 the House of Commons agreed, by resolution, to the declaration and registration of Members interests. It is now a rule of the House that every Member - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Not just Ministers or the staff of Ministers- shall furnish to the Registrar of Members&#39; Interests such particulars as shall be required, and shall notify to the Registrar any alterations which may occur therein, and the Registrar shall cause these particulars to be entered in the Register of Members&#39; Interests which shall be available to the public. Interests required to be declared cover the classes of pecuniary interest or benefit which might reasonably be thought to influence the conduct of Members of Parliament. However, Members are not required to disclose the amounts of any remuneration or benefit received. </para>
          <para class="block">That statement is consistent with the statement set out in Erskine May&#39;s book. Commenting on the situation in Australia following the 1975 report, the  Clerk  had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In a unanimous report - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I emphasise that it was a unanimous report- the Committee found that the usefulness of a register lies not in the ability to detect fraud or impropriety but as a means of assuring the public that decisions affecting it are made in the public interest. The system recommended was one whereby Members of Parliament would be required to declare their interests in general terms. </para>
          <para class="block">I have outlined the situation in Australia following the 1975 report. The situation recommended is not the actual situation here. It is the situation in the United States of America and it is the situation in Great Britain. I do not bother to refer to countries such as Norway where people in public life such as members of Parliament not only have to disclose their proprietary interests or their pecuniary interests in various forms of property but also are bound to disclose their incomes which are published annually in newspapers. </para>
          <para class="block">One might ask: Why not, if people are purporting to take part in public life in a manner which is beyond public reproach or public cynicism? </para>
          <para>Following the report of the 1975 Committee the position in a sense is documented by questions that have been asked in this Parliament of both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in this place and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in the House of Representatives. On 18 February 1976, in answer to a question without notice, the Prime Minister said that the recommendations of the 1975 Committee were being taken into account in formulating the requirements of declarations by Ministers and staffs. He said that the Government had not fully determined its attitude to the report as a whole and that senior public servants also would be considered in the determination of the Government&#39;s attitude. In April 1976, in answer to a question on notice regarding alleged conflicts of interest which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland was alleged to have as  chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Prime Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline>Bland is a consultant to the Government. I am certain that he would advise me if he had any conflict of interest. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a complete misunderstanding of the brunt of the report of the parliamentary Committee. It is not up to the individual to notify the Prime Minister in those circumstances of his own volition whether he has any conflict of interest. One would have thought that it would be something which was demanded by the Government. In October 1976 in answer to a further question relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland, in which it was pointed out to the Prime Minister that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> was a director of five companies which were being examined by the Prices Justification Tribunal at the time of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry&#39;s</inline> appointment, the Prime Minister went on to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland had not advised him of any conflict of interest. So again it was being left to a person who might be said to have a pecuniary interest contrary to the interests of this Parliament and of government to decide quite subjectively whether any conflict of interest existed. </para>
          <para>In December 1976 in answer to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> here in the Senate we were told that the Government was still considering the report of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests. The Leader of the Government in the Senate informed the Senate that Ministers already made declarations to the Prime Minister which took into account the recommendations of the Joint Committee and that ministerial staffs made declarations in a similar form. With respect, what a very cosy way of doing it. The purport of the report of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests was that the whole question was one of public disclosure. But here we have this nice little in-club arrangement whereby Ministers in the Fraser Government notify <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> himself whether they have any pecuniary interests which might be in conflict with the sorts of principles which have been enunciated by parliaments in Britain, the United States and here. What a cosy little arrangement for the Government to enter into. </para>
          <para>That was the position in December 1976. In February 1977 m answer to another question <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> was told that the information provided by Ministers was provided on a confidential basis and it was not intended to make it public. In May 1977, in answer to a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston, Senator Withers</inline> said that the pecuniary interest question was still under consideration by the Government and that the implementation of the proposals of the Joint Committee would not require legislation. </para>
          <para>In August 1977 in answer to a further question from the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> the Prime Minister said that an interdepartmental committee was looking at both the Royal Commission&#39;s recommendations and at the recommendations of the parliamentary committee to see to what extent they were compatible so that the Government would be in a position to make a decision on the whole question of pecuniary interests in relation to both members of Parliament and public servants. The Prime Minister went on in his answer to deny that the Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> had any conflict of interest because of his association with a company of funeral directors. That again might be regarded as a cause for some cynicism. </para>
          <para>The record of this Government in its answers to the questions which have been raised about this matter is one of evasion and prevarication. In none of the answers to those questions asked over a period of time is there reference to any apparent intention by the Government to do anything about the report of that Committee. There is no attempt to discuss or to distinguish various types of interest or to disclose those interests in any public sense. That is despite the fact that the Prime Minister wrote to Ministers on 13 January 1976 a letter in which he indicated that he would be seeking the co-operation of Ministers concerning the matter of public duty and private interests of Ministers. The conflict between public duty and private interests of Ministers is referred to quite apparently in the Prime Minister&#39;s letter. The copy of the letter which I have was sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony.</inline> The final two paragraphs state: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I emphasise that it is the responsibility of each Minister to avoid any conflict of interest arising and to inform me of any significant changes in the information provided in response to this letter. </para>
            <para>I am available to discuss with you any aspects of the matters I have referred to. The information provided will of course be kept on a strictly personal and confidential basis. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The consequence of that sort of approach to this issue is as I have pointed out already. The Prime Minister has taken advantage of this report of the Joint Committee of the Parliament to say: &#39;I want to know- as Prime Minister I am entitled to know- from all my Ministers what particular proprietary interests they have, what are their shareholdings, their interests in rural land, their company directorships and so on. I am entitled to know but the public is not. It is a matter which we will keep in-club in this Government. I will have the information and not one iota of that information will be made available to the public&#39;. That is the exact obverse of what the Joint Committee of this Parliament recommended. It recommended that this was a matter of public concern and public interest and that it was not a matter solely for the Prime Minister any more than for any other citizen. The Prime Minister has turned that all around to create this situation of Ministers reporting to him on the matter in a manner which is totally in-club. I use that term advisedly, but it is appropriate to this Government in so many of its endeavours. </para>
          <para>Why should Ministers report to the Prime Minister about this matter? Is it sought to lead the people to think that if Malcolm Fraser knows about those interests there can be no crook Minister in this Government because Malcolm Fraser will look after the matter and will see that there is no conflict of interest? Apparently the people of Australia are asked to accept the word of a Prime Minister whose word has never been answered for in questions which have been directed to him, a Prime Minister in whom, according to the polls, 27 per cent of the Australian people have confidence. Only 27 per cent of the Australian public, who are the people concerned with the consequences of this report, have confidence in the man who is going to decide whether Ministers have a conflict of interest in regard to their private dealings and their public responsibilities. This is perhaps another fascinating insight into life at the top, but it is not the sort of insight to which the people of Australia are entitled on the basis of a unanimous report of this Parliament. </para>
          <para>Why would the Government not want to implement the recommendation which the Joint Committee of the Parliament has made? Why would the Prime Minister want to keep all this information to himself? I refer the Senate again to the content of that report, in which the Committee stated that the main thread of the report was the fact that public life in this country is being demeaned by various forces, but particularly by the force of insidious cynicism, accompanied as it is by destructive denigration. Why would the Prime Minister not want to examine the situation of the public interest and private interests of his Ministers? I do not know the answer to that question, but let me refer honorable senators to a few examples. Let me refer honourable senators first of all to the case of the  Deputy  Prime Minister of this country <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> who, through a very substantial family interest in a company known as Northern Star Holdings Ltd, has a controlling interest in television stations NRN11 and RTN8 in northern New South Wales.  His  family has a controlling interest in radio stations 4GG on the Gold Coast, 2MW in Murwillumbah and 2LM in Lismore, and in a dozen commercial newspapers in the area between South Brisbane and Coffs Harbour. That is a substantial interest which the  Deputy  Prime Minister of this country, through his family, has directly in companies which could bring him in conflict with his public responsibilities as a Minister of the Crown and about which there has not been disclosure presumably to anybody other than to the Prime Minister of Australia. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the House in the other place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Sinclair, is a very substantial shareholder in Television New England Ltd, which has a nice arrangement with the Australian Telecommunications Commission for the sharing of a television translator station near Tamworth in New South Wales. That is a company which makes substantial profits and which, by the arrangement with Telecom, obtains a substantial benefit from taxpayers&#39; money which is put into that television translator station by means of appropriations of this Parliament. In dealing with the question of the declaration of private interests, one would like to know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> made a declaration which engendered him to feel that he might be disposed not to take part in Cabinet discussions when the Broadcasting and Television Act was being amended. He might have felt that it was inappropriate for him to vote in the Parliament when the Act was being amended. The same could be said about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony.</inline> Because of his family holdings perhaps he should have declined to take part when the </para>
          <para class="block">Broadcasting and Television Act was being amended. </para>
          <para>One can follow up the situation of Ian Sinclair through his association- if I can call it that for want of a better expression- with the Sinclair Pastoral Company. That company has substantial interests in shopping premises in Weetangera and Latham in the Australian Capital Territory about which the public is entitled to know. The public is entitled to know whether Ministers of the Crown have interests which could conflict with legislation or ordinances relating to the Australian Capital Territory which have been passed by the Parliament. One wonders whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> thought fit to disclose that information to the Cabinet when those matters were being discussed. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton),</inline> who is a member of this chamber, has as his principal private secretary <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wally</inline> Summons. He was private secretary to the Minister when he was in opposition. From the time this Government obtained office until February this year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summons</inline> was director of a company called Waugh and Josephson Holdings Ltd which had contracts with the Government in that period. I am not suggesting that the Minister or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summons</inline> are involved in any impropriety but the people of Australia are entitled to know these things. The Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament said that the people of Australia were entitled to know these things. With respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summons,</inline> as a director of a public company such as Waugh and Josephson which was accepting contracts from this Government, should not have been private secretary to the Minister for Business and Commerce. </para>

              <para>-I am indebted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The cynics to which the Committee report refers might talk about some section of industry or commerce which the Minister presides over through his staff. I shall not put the matter any higher than that but that is not the whole point. The Committee report recommends specifically that Members of Parliament, not just Ministers, should disclose the location of any realty in which they have a beneficial interest. I understand from various reports that one can put in that basket from the Cabinet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> the  Deputy  Prime Minister of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> the Leader of the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street,</inline> the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt,</inline> the Minister for Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> the Minister for Transport and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> the Minister for Science. Those are just a few examples. None of those Ministers has complied with the standards which the report recommends they should comply with. All those Ministers have participated in discussions, Cabinet decisions and decisions of the Parliament relating to primary industry which have involved substantial benefits to primary producers. None of them has stood up in the Parliament and declared his interests. None of them has done any of the things which might be considered to be consistent with the public interest in this country. As far as we know, none of them has declined to take part in Cabinet discussions or any of those matters. </para>

          <para>These are only examples of the point I am seeking to make. If it was so desired I could point to other honourable senators, not Ministers, who have pecuniary interests of the kind which the report sought to deal with but I am content to let the matter rest with Ministers. After all there is a fair swag of them to illustrate my point. It looks very much as though that is only the tip of the iceberg. The point with which I am concerned is that a situation in which Ministers have holdings of this kind is by any standards of English speaking democracies a public scandal. It is confounded and compounded by the fact that not only has the situation not improved, it is also being made worse by this in-club arrangement which the Prime Minister has arrived at in which he assures Ministers that he is prepared to have a chat with them about the matter but any information will be strictly personal and on a confidential basis. He gives no involvement to the public of Australia and there are no declarations to the Parliament as a committee of the Parliament thought there should be. </para>
          <para>This matter has been of longstanding concern to me. It was brought to my mind most recently by the allegations of impropriety by Ministers and public servants in my own State of Victoria. I felt it would be wrong for me to take part in any criticism of those people if my own house, the Senate, was not in order. I felt it appropriate that 1 should raise the matter here before participating at great length in any debate about anything which might be happening in the Victorian Parliament. It is proper that this Senate and this Parliament should set an example to the parliaments of Australia of a kind which has been set by the </para>

              <para>-The first thing we did when somebody got on to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster&#39;s</inline> private interests- I think he was the senator involved- was to appoint a committee to inquire into this question. It made a report in September 1975. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> might remember that in October 1975 he was a member of the then Opposition that took action in the Senate to delay the Budget and bring about a constitutional crisis in this country. There was no possibility of the Government doing anything about the report at that stage. In 1975 the then Opposition promised that it would introduce a new era of &#39;honest government&#39; as it called it. It has not done much good with respect to this matter. For the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> who came into the chamber late and now wants to know, that is why I am raising the matter today. The present Government talks about public standards. It talks about introducing freedom of information legislation. It talks about a lot of matters which are loosely summarised in the expression &#39;open government&#39;. But it has done nothing about them in the two years in which it has been in office, in spite of repeated prodding in the form of questions and by other means. </para>

          <para>Might I just conclude by referring again to the important conclusion of that report, which must be of concern to every parliamentarian and, indeed, to the public of Australia, since nothing has been done about it.

            <para>-I rise to speak on this first reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for two purposes, the first of which is to repudiate again the accusations that have been made by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> and the honourable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Porter)</inline> concerning the South Australian Labor Government and the Minister for Agriculture of that State, to the effect that they are not carrying out their obligations under the drought relief scheme to which the Commonwealth Government is a party. </para>

          <para>However, I want first to refer to the question asked today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> of the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> that is, would he either confirm or deny that the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> had been the recipient of an amount in the vicinity of $60,000 in superphosphate bounties in recent years. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> neither confirmed nor denied that assertion but went on to state that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> was implying was that the incoming Whitiam Governmentand I am pleased he had admitted that after 10 December there will be an incoming Whitlam Government- would not renegotiate the superphosphate bounty. Of course, nothing is further from the truth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> well knows that recently, when the relevant legislation came before the Parliament, the present Opposition party did not oppose it; nor has it any intention of so doing in the future. </para>

          <para>In contrast, the Labor Government, upon deciding that it would not renegotiate that particular legislation, gave the farmers at least 12 months notice of that fact. It is all very well for the honourable senator to ask why we withdrew it. At least we did not act in an underhand manner. We let the farmers know what we were going to do- quite the opposite of what the Country Party did. The honourable senator&#39;s revered leader, as the senator has often referred to him, took the bounty away. </para>

While the honourable senator is having a glass of water, let me say that challenges are coming from the Opposition on a concerted basis seeking a declaration by certain members of the House of Representatives of amounts they may have received from the payment of a superphostphate bounty. The honourable senator is undoubtedly willing to declare the pecuniary benefit that he obtained when the egg bounty was in vogue and he was as yet a poultry farmer. I hope we shall hear that figure from him before he resumes his seat </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator&#39;s statement is a stupid one because, if he know anything at all about the poultry industry he would know that there has never been a bounty paid on eggs, that poultry farmers get back only a portion of the levy that is made on them.  His  statement shows the depth of his knowledge concerning the poultry industry generally. I have also asked him on earlier occasions, when he has interjected during remarks that I have made on the pastoral industry, whether he knew the difference between a one-eyed stag and a maiden wether. He has not been able to answer that question, thus illustrating that his knowledge of the pastoral industry as well is absolutely nil. </para>

          <para>When I was wrongfully interrupted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster&#39;s</inline> trying to score a cheap point, I was about to say that under the present Superphosphate Bounty Act provision is made whereby the publication of recipients names may be called for. I proposed an amendment, when the legislation was before the Senate, seeking to have that requirement carried out as it had been when Labor was in government, much to the embarrassment of present supporters of the Government. Naturally, my proposed amendment was bitterly opposed. If Government supporters were fair dinkum they would have no objection to the names of persons in receipt of the bounty being tabled because, in effect, it is taxpayers&#39; money. </para>
          <para>I well recall that when we published recipients&#39; names, obtained legally under the provisions of the Act, it took me three days to have them incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was one of the bitterest opponents to that happening, but through the common sense of the now Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton),</inline> incorporation did in fact take place. As I have mentioned previously, I have since had hundreds of requests for a copy of that information, so that people could ascertain who were the major recipients. As I have also mentioned previously, two farmers in South Australia received up to $50,000 a year in superphosphate bounty, although certain small farmers who required it received absolutely nothing. </para>
          <para>The main topic to which I wish to refer is the way in which Government supporters, through the Country Party&#39;s Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> have been trying to mislead the farmers in South Australia, who are suffering the grave consequences of a terrible drought. I refer to the allegation that the South Australian Government is not in fact carrying out its obligations under the drought relief scheme. I had occasion, because of a &#39;Dorothy Dix&#39; question that had been submitted by the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> to the Minister to mention the matter in my speech on the Budget. In replying, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> had said: </para>

In other words, the South Australian Government could pursue a number of measures which are in accordance with existing formulae, including the slaughter of aged stock or drought affected stock, for which there is a scheme of offset within the drought assistance measures. </para>

The system works on the basis of carry-on loans being provided to meet the deficit in the farmer&#39;s budget. The loans are paid out on a quarterly basis to meet the estimated deficit for the next three months. Some successful applicants have received quarterly cheques, others will not until next year when their farm finances move into deficit.

            <para>New, simplified application forms; a faster assessment procedure; a less stringent security requirement and a change to a quarterly cheque system were announced today by the SA Minister of Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brian</inline> Chatterton, as the latest step in the State Government&#39;s plans for drought assistance. </para>

            <para>Forms are available from next week at SA Department of Agriculture and Fisheries offices in drought affected areas. </para>
            <para>Successful applicants for carry-on loans will no longer be required to provide a mortgage over the whole of the farm property as security but will only have to provide sufficient security to cover the actual loan. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chatterton</inline> said that this step had been taken so that the farmer could retain financial flexibility for future years. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chatterton</inline>said that successful applicants will be able to budget their farm and household costs on a quarterly basis. One carry-on loan cheque will be sent out every three months to cover these costs. In the past, farmers have had to send in individual accounts and have received separate cheques for each item of expenditure. </para>
            <para>This decision has been made to save farmers unnecessary time and trouble and to speed up the administration of carryon loans for drought assistance. </para>
            <para>The Minister said that drought assistance assessment staff have been doubled on a temporary basis.

            <para>Farmers in SA are in fact receiving considerable drought relief in the form of both State and Commonwealth funds. </para>
            <para>The current agreement has run from October 1, 1976, and will remain in existence until December 31 when a new scheme (almost identical to the current one) will operate. </para>
            <para>Since the current scheme began, $2,260,544 has been approved for carry-on loans and other drought relief measures in SA. Currently 170 farmers are receiving carry-on loans and there is no delay in the processing of applications. </para>
            <para>SA farmers have not been disadvantaged by the natural disaster funding formula and, in fact, under the formula adopted they now have access to unlimited Commonwealth funds for loans over a seven to 10-year term at 4p.c. interest. </para>
            <para>The Stockowners Association has a representative on the Drought Consultative Committee which I have established to ensure that farmers are involved in the decisions about the type of aid to be made available in times of drought. </para>
            <para>That representative <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr A.M.

          <para class="block">There we have the nominee of the South Australian Stockowners Association claiming some credit for the policy and for the way in which the drought relief scheme in South Australia is being administered. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> from which I have quoted, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whyte</inline> claimed some credit because he said that he had put forward some suggestions. He congratulated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chatterton</inline> for taking notice of his proposals and incorporating them into the scheme. </para>
          <para>Then we find <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Porter, Mr Sinclair,</inline> and particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr James,</inline> the Secretary of the South Australian Stockowners Association, whose representative on the body has congratulated the Minister for the work he has done, criticising the Minister for not being able to administer the policy. The pertinent words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr James</inline> were that the South Australian Government had been incapable of making the right choice. So, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr James</inline> claimed that his own representative on the body was one of those who were incapable of making the right choice, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whyte</inline> must have had quite a lot to say on the committee when the drought relief scheme was set up, and he himself has claimed some credit. We find those people misrepresenting the South Australian Labor Government and saying that it was not administering the scheme in the way it ought to be administered, when in fact the South Australian Stockowners Association had a representative on the committee. I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whyte</inline> is going to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr James</inline> about his statement; but of course that sort of thing is not new. It is getting near election time and, in the main, the farmer organisations are being very critical of the Labor Government and the trade union movement. In that connection, I will refer in a few moments to a statement made by the  president  of another leading organisation. </para>
          <para>To return to the way in which the scheme operates and the claim that the South Australian Government is not doing all that it might, I wish to refer to the October 1977 issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Farmer and Grazier,</inline> a very esteemed journal in South Australia. In an article headed &#39;People&#39;, under a photograph of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barry</inline> Rollbusch, the man who made the statement, these words appear: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Zone 10, chairman, BARRY ROLLBUSCH, had a meeting of a different type to handle at Wunkar recently. </para>
            <para>The subject was drought (what else?) and UFG drought consultative committee representative. Bill Murdoch, wanted as much feed back as possible from the audience on the pros and cons of assistance schemes. </para>
            <para>So the audience of 60 was split into seven groups; a series of questions was asked and a spokesman appointed to present the view of his group after about 30 minutes consideration. </para>
            <para>This way, more people got to have a say and a number of worthwhile suggestions and comments were made. </para>
            <para>One of the most pertinent was that the revised payment system enabling producers to pay their own bills from quarterly cheques instead of sending in accounts to the departments &#39; will restore some dignity to the whole process &#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We now find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Porter</inline> have criticised the very scheme that the Government has implemented and, as I have said several times during my remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whyte</inline> has claimed some credit for devising the scheme. In turn he has been criticised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr James,</inline> and in turn again the people at Wunkar, which is in the very heart of the worst drought affected area in South Australia, have said that the method of paying quarterly cheques instead of sending in accounts to the department will restore some dignity to the whole process. If anybody is doing any cheap politicking on the drought assistance scheme for farmers in South Australia it is not the members of the Australian Labor Party in this Parliament or in the State Parliament, it is the members of the Liberal and National Country parties in the Federal Parliament and some of the spokesmen of their organisations, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr James</inline> in South Australia, who have completely misrepresented what the South Australian Labor Government is endeavouring to do. </para>
          <para>We will hear much more of that type of thing before 10 December. Members of the LiberalNational Country Party coalition will try to influence people who live in the country areas, particularly the farmers, into believing that the Australian Labor Party has no interest in their welfare. I challenge them to prove that. I challenge them to go into the country areas in South Australia, the drought affected areas, and to ask the people what they think about the drought assistance scheme which is operating in South Australia and which has not yet received the amount of money it should have received from the Commonwealth Government, despite the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chatterton</inline> said in his Press statement that he had already expended $2,092,000 in the form of carry-on finance. What more does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> want the State Government to do? It is well known that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> has no sympathy for the farmers, and the Cattlemen&#39;s Union knows that too. As I have said before- I have only repeated what has appeared in the newspapers and what was said at that renowed meeting in Queensland- the Cattlemen&#39;s Union quite rightly passed a motion of no confidence in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> because of actions he had taken. He has no interest in the farmers. </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell,</inline> the Director of the Cattlemen&#39;s Union, said as recently as Saturday or Sunday, about 12 country seats are in jeopardy because of the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> and his lack of interest in the farming community. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cassell</inline> is not the only person who has said these things. Late this afternoon I received a copy of an address given by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Burston, K.B. O.B.E., the  President  of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council. In his address he had this to say about an announcement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony:</inline></para>
          <quote>
            <para>When addressing the Farmers&#39; Federation Conference some two weeks ago, the  Deputy  Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> said: the Government&#39;s policy-and certainly the policy of the National Country Party- (is) that we should make progress in the direction of generally lower tariff levels. This objective must be pursued with increased resolution as the country emerges from its current economic difficulties. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is some doubt whether it is emerging from those difficulties. The quotation from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony&#39;s</inline> address continued: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The leader of that organisation has said that he has little or no confidence in any statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony.</inline> Similarly, the Cattlemen&#39;s Union and the Fruitgrowers Association, following the big marches in Mooroopna, Victoria, and Berri, South Australia, said that the Government  is not living up to its election promise to look after people in the country areas. </para>
          <para>One other matter I want to mention while I am on my feet relates to a Press statement put out by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> He now supersedes <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair.</inline> He knows that they are in hot water so he is taking up the cudgels for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> put out a Press statement on 28 October 1977. It is headed Livestock Marketing&#39; and it states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Prime Minister today announced that he had telexed the Premiers of all States seeking their co-operation with the Commonwealth in a full and urgent review of ways in which present livestock marketing systems could be improved. </para>
            <para>He referred to three special areas where possible improvements should be examined as a matter of urgency: </para>
            <para>The control of anti-competitive practices such as collusion and lot splitting in livestock auctioning. </para>
            <para>The introduction of a weight and grade selling system for cattle. </para>
            <para>The introduction of price stabilisation arrangements, probably of a buffer fund character. </para>
            <para>The Prime Minister stressed that with the present difficulties facing beef producers it was imperative that the Commonwealth and States co-operated in giving the highest priority to the examination of these potentially promising avenues of reform in livestock marketing. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline>made this announcement to try to retrieve some of the lost ground in country areas.

It was released on 30 October, two days after the release of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> &#39;s statement.

            <para class="block">It has been the Australian Government which has dragged the chain in encouraging and introducing reforms. </para>
            <para>It was only after strong pressure by the beef cattle industry and the ALP that the Government agreed to provide funds in the last Budget for carcass classification.

            <para>Producers are thoroughly disillusioned with the FraserSinclair handling of the livestock industry and most of the Premiers will no doubt respond to the Prime Minister&#39;s telex by saying let us see the bona fides of the Government and let us have an assurance that the Australian Government will keep pace with States such as New South Wales. </para>
            <para>It would be useful also if the Prime Minister explained that in the Liberal State of Victoria, livestock and meat marketing reform were proceeding at the slowest pace, concluded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scholes.</inline></para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It has a Canberra dateline of 30 October. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scholes</inline> is saying the verysame thing which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Burston said in his address, a copy of which came to every member of Parliament today.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was the very thing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scholes</inline> was saying when he asked for some assurance to be given that the Australian Government would keep pace with States such as New South Wales. Other matters were also contained in the Press release. We find the Prime Minister, like a cat on hot bricks, is jumping from one thing to another. As I have said, no doubt we will hear a lot more of this sort of thing in the days and weeks to come. I am sure that the people who were prevailed upon to vote for this Government, particularly the people in country areas who were prevailed upon to support the present Government parties in December 1975, will ask what the Government has been doing in the last two years to honour its promises. One or two promises have been honoured, such as the restoration of the superphosphate bounty. With that bounty the greatest amount of benefit goes to the biggest producers who are the ones least in need of assistance. Small farmers get practically nothing. There is an article in that same journal from which I quoted a while ago, the <inline font-style="italic">Farmer and Grazier,</inline> about the superphosphate bounty. The  article is very cynical about some of the statements being made, particularly about the benefit farmers got previously. As is said in this journal, it is very doubtful whether the bounty is of any benefit at all. The article, which is on page 5, is headed: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Perhaps the super bounty is not worth the effort. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The article is written by Stumpjump. I do not know whether he is any relation to the other good correspondent who comes from South Australia and writes in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> which is published every Friday. He may be. He may be one of the chaps to whom that writer refers. But Stumpjump in the article states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am reliably informed that in 1845, French candle makers approached their government seeking compulsory blinds and shutters on every window. </para>
            <para>The idea was that these devices would protect the candle makers from unfair, cheap and foreign competition- in the form of the sun. My records don&#39;t show whether their case was successful. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He then goes on to talk about the superphosphate bounty and whether it was of any benefit to the farmers. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chatterton</inline> pointed out, two farmers in South Australia received up to $50,000 each from the superphosphate bounty when this Government was previously in power. Small farmers use a small amount. I think the average use of superphosphate by Australian farmers is 26 tons a year. The average bounty those people would receive would be about $400 a year. No farmer could claim that he went broke because he lost $400 a year when the superphosphate bounty was abolished. We will have to suffer statements, similar to those which have been made by honourable senators on the Government side, week in week out until the election. If the people in country areas have the common sense to reject the statements and promises made by the Government, I am sure that those people will be well served by an incoming Whitlam government. Another thing we will have to put up with is false claims by Government supporters and some captains of industry that industrial disputes are affecting primary industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Burston</inline> in the same paper under the heading &#39; Industrial Disputes &#39; stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The last 12 months have seen little improvement in the overall industrial scene in Australia, and in some areas a further deterioration in industrial relations has occurred. There can be no question that this problem perpetuates business uncertainty, holds back economic recovery, and adds to the difficulties which exporters face in maintaining international competitiveness. While actual working days lost through strikes may have declined in 1977, the effects of disputes are being felt more widely than ever before. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He then goes on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is no wonder that producers become thoroughly fed up and support Government moves for tougher industrial legislation. The general community might reflect on the situation in the light of Government assistance recently provided to the beef industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There we have it. Whenever there is any problem in marketing or freighting of products Government supporters and captains of industry immediately lay all the blame at the feet of the trade union movement. I went to a forum recently which was organised by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council. I was astounded to hear an Opposition member of the New South Wales Parliament severely criticise the trade union movement. He put all the blame for the problems in primary industry on members of the trade union movement. But I was very heartened to hear another very well respected member of the farming community in this area stand up and say in reply that the primary producers should make a greater effort to sit down and discuss their problems with the leaders of industrial unions. Not only the industrial unions are at fault. Much of the fault also lies with the owners of export abattoirs who deliberately create disputes when they cannot get a continuous run-through of stock. They create or fabricate a dispute so that they can stand down workers. When there is no work the abattoir owners do not have to pay all the hands that are not on piece work. </para>
          <para>This gentleman- I will not name him; everyone knows who he is- made the very sound suggestion that the industry itself, and particularly primary industry leaders, should sit down and talk with members of the trade union movement and see where the problems lie. I am sure that if they did so they would find that there would be much more co-operation from the people who work in the abattoirs. I worked in abattoirs in years gone by and it is a dirty, filthy job. Some of the people who sit opposite and who criticise workers for their non-productivity would not have a clue about the filthy and hard work that these people have to perform. Abattoir workers are not highly paid and are paid weekly for a seasonal job. Yet they are continually under criticism by the captains of primary industry and by the leading lights in the Government who have to find a scapegoat somewhere. They do not lay the criticism at the feet of the owners of the organisations but try to lump it all on to the trade union movement. This goes for other industries such as the heavy industries of this country. </para>
          <para>The trade union movement is not the only section of the community that is at fault. Let us have a look at the other side. The government of the day has to get down to talking with people in the trade union movement instead of introducing repressive legislation every time there is an industrial dispute and making a great blah in the Press by saying that it will bring in diabolical measures to force trade unionists to go back to work. We all know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has been able to settle disputes because of his negotiating skills. But the present government says: Oh, well, it was the fear of the legislation that we have brought in that has forced the people back to work.&#39; Nothing could be further from the truth. If this Government by some chance remains in office after 10 December, and I am sure that it will not, because of an industrial dispute it is put in the position of having to enact the oppressive legislation which was rushed through this Parliament on two occasions within 24 hours- legislation the Senate, which the Government claims is a House of review, did not have a chance to look at so that it could point out all its weaknessess- it will be in for a very rude shock. </para>
          <para>I well remember when I was a boy that Stanley Bruce, a conservative Prime Minister, took the trade union movement on and lost his seat at the next election. Stanley Bruce brought the country into chaos. The same thing will happen again if this Government is unwise enough to try to take on the trade union movement. No trade unionist in my experience- I have been a trade unionist ever since I was about 15 years of age and I still am- goes on strike for no good purpose. He knows that immediately he goes on strike he loses his pay packet and his wife and children suffer. He knows that the bills mount up. He has to have a really good reason for going on strike. He goes on strike only to get some justice. </para>
          <para>The men involved in the recent dispute in the Latrobe Valley- and I commend them and their wives who supported them for having held out during a ten week strike- have had to go back to full arbitration. This Government denied them some of the things they were asking for because it argued that their claims would break the indexation guidelines. Yet what do we find? Only last week another trade union in Victoria was granted an increase outside the indexation guidelines. This Government made no complaint about that situation. Because the people in the Latrobe Valley sought justice and an uplifting of their income they were regarded as the worst people in the world. </para>
          <para>We were informed today that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has been in receipt of at least $60,000 in superphosphate bounty payments over recent years. There was not a whinge about that from the Liberal-Country Party coalition. However, the people in the Latrobe Valley, the real workers of this country, are regarded as terrible and are said to be holding the country to ransom because they are seeking a maximum increase of a miserable $40 a week, no doubt hoping they would get between zero and $40 a week. Yet workers m the Latrobe Valley coal mines earning even $8,000 a year would need to work for seven or eight years to earn the equivalent of what the Prime Minister is receiving out of the taxpayers&#39; pockets in the form of superphosphate bounty payments. We talk about justice! Justice went out the window when this Government came to office. </para>

            <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was speaking to the motion for the first reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and had been quoting from the statement put out by the  President  of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council. In that statement he said that he regretted having to say that based on recent performances he had little confidence in the things which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> was saying he would do for rural producers. I want to place on record the appreciation of the Opposition&#39;s resources committee for the rural pokey document put out by this organisation. It is a most comprehensive document and contains some very good thoughts and proposals. Our committee had the pleasure of having discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Trebeck who in my opinion is a very capable young chap. The Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council is very fortunate to have a person of his ability and expertise as its executive officer to put forward its proposals.

          <para>During the suspension of the sitting I had occasion to look at the copies of Minister&#39;s speeches which are distributed to us. I was most intrigued when I read the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> at the opening of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council&#39;s 137th convention. I was surprised to read in that speech remarks similar to those which I had made earlier today. Of course, I did not know then that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> had made them too. He said in his opening remarks: </para>

          <para class="block">He was talking about his Government&#39;s decisions- the decisions of the last two years- and then look at the Government decisions of the previous three years, he should have no difficulty in arriving at a judgment as to the choice he should make in six weeks time. </para>
          <para class="block">They are the very words which I used: The people in country areas will have no difficulty arriving at their choice when they compare the record of the Whitlam Government in its three years in office-a period interrupted by an election which was forced upon us- with the record of the Liberal-Country Party coalition in the last two years. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony.</inline> The people in the country will have no difficulty arriving at a choice- they will vote Labor. What did concern me greatly was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> in his speech, claimed credit for opening up the beef market in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Everybody knows that the good international relations were set in train by the Whitlam Government. I want to quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> said because it is ill becoming of him to claim credit for something which was set in train by the Whitlam Government. When talking about the beef market he had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There may not be any marked growth in total sales to our traditional markets, but further substantial sales to Eastern European countries, including the USSR, are likely. I&#39;m glad that I&#39;ve been able to make a personal contribution to the process of developing these markets. It was my visit to the USSR and a personal invitation to the head of their meat purchasing agency to visit Australia that really stimulated the whole process of sales to the USSR and Eastern Europe. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What a statement for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> to make. Over the years there has been no one more critical than this Government of the policies and living standards of the USSR and China. As a matter of fact, this Government has offended those countries by its statements. Only recently the Prime Minister made some very offensive statements about the USSR. I have spoken about them in the Senate before. He made those statements in regard to shipping in the Indian Ocean and his own Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> had to repudiate what he said. We now read in the weekend Press that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> is one of the people who will get the axe if by some mischance Fraser is returned as Prime Minister on 10 December. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> has a hide to claim credit for the good public relations which now exist between the USSR and Australia because they are due to the good offices of the Whitlam Labor Government. If some Government supporters are not careful about some comments they make for purely political reasons the Government will lose those markets and it will be left to the incoming Labor Government, after 10 December, to again cement that friendship which we ought to have. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> has pointed out, the USSR is now our second largest market. I have said in this place on many occasions that no successful shopkeeper goes outside his shop when he opens at nine o &#39;clock in the morning and abuses his best customer, yet that is what Government members and supporters have been doing for years. It took the Whitlam Government to bring about the present very happy relationship. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline>made some reference in his speech to fuel prices for country people and said how something ought to be done to give them cheaper fuel, but it was no less a person than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> who advocated the world parity price for fuel in Australia. A statement was made in clear terms in the Budget brought down in August this year that petrol prices will go up by 1 lc a gallon under this Government. Who is that going to hurt the most? It will hurt most the primary producers and the people who live in the country. Yet when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> made his speech on Monday, 31 October, only yesterday, he talked about his Government being concerned for people who live in country areas and about how his Government was going to do something to bring down fuel prices for them. Here again the Government is doing the same as it did in relation to wine tax and many other measures. It votes one way in the Parliament but goes out and tells the producers something else. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> did the same thing yesterday. After putting up the price of petrol by 1 lc a gallon in the Budget he now tells the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council convention that he is going to do something to bring down petrol prices. I do not think he will fool those people. </para>
          <para>The only other matter I wanted to mention concerns <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and I am glad that he is in the Senate at the moment. Shortly we will be debating this Appropriation Bill in the Committee stage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> will recall that I asked him during the hearing of a Senate estimates committee when he would table the VIP manifests so that I could see how our GovernorGeneral has been flitting around the country like a homing pigeon and the cost to the Australian taxpayer. As yet that document has not been tabled. We now come to the Committee stage of the debate on the Appropriation Bill without having been able to look at those VIP manifests. I would be interested to know what the Minister is doing about it. We know there has been overuse of public money in flying the GovernorGeneral all around the place. I will be having something to say later on about this Government giving him an additional perk by flying him overseas at the taxpayers&#39; expense when he will no longer be an office holder of the country. Two or three days after his term expires the Government will pay his air fare when he flits around the world again. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition does not object to the general proposition that has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> but we take advantage of the Estimates debate in the Committee of the Whole to raise certain matters additional to those which were discussed during the hearings of the Estimates committees. I assume from the proposal of the Leader of the Government in the enate that what he envisages is that there will be a general debate in the Committee stage on, for instance, all of the departments that are embodied in the consideration of Senate Estimates Committee A at the one time. In other words, we will not be taking the appropriation for the Parliament separate from those for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or the Department of Administrative Services. As I understand it, the Minister is suggesting- I speak subject to correction- that we lump all of the departments as considered in the various groups into one Committee debate. </para>

              <para>-That being so, I do not think that the Opposition would have any objection to that course of action.

          <para>I speak to the report of Senate Estimates Committee A. Firstly, I wish to compliment the  Chairman  of the Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim,</inline> for the excellent way in which he chaired the deliberations of the Committee. It is fair to say- I know that my colleagues <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> will agree with me- that we were given every opportunity to raise questions with the Minister and with the various departmental officers who came before the Committee. At the outset, I wish to make one or two remarks of an observatory nature concerning the report of the Committee. For instance, on page 2 of the report which was presented to the Senate on 6 October 1977, the Committee has proposed to the Senate that the Government be called on to give an undertaking to table the explanatory notes on the day immediately following the presentation of the Appropriation Bills to the Parliament. </para>
          <para>It was found in connection with one or two of the departments that came before Senate Estimates Committee A- I understand that this applied in respect to other Estimates committeesthat the explanatory notes for those departments under scrutiny arrived long after the Appropriation Bills had been presented to the Parliament and just shortly prior to the time that the Senate Estimates committees were to sit. If the Estimates committees are to mean anything so far as scrutiny of public expenditure by Government departments is concerned, certainly senators and members of the parliament are entitled to expect delivery of the explanatory notes within a reasonable time following the presentation to Parliament of the Appropriation Bills. As I have mentioned, Senate Estimates Committee A has made a recommendation which it proposes to the chamber that the Government be called on to give an undertaking to table the explanatory notes on the day immediately following the presentation of the Appropriation Bills to the Parliament. </para>
          <para>The other matter in the report which relates to the Parliament is outlined on page 3, paragraph (d). It is stated: </para>

            <para>During its examination of the Estimates for the Department of the Senate, the Committee sought an explanation for the shortfall of expenditure as against appropriation for the printing,bindinganddistributionsofpapersintheyear 1976-77.TheCommitteewasinformedthatallaccountsfor printing in progress were expected before the end of the 1976-77 financial year, but that some accounts will now be paid in the financial year 1977-78. </para>
            <para>The Committee appreciates the difficulty which is inherent in administering this particular appropriation, as it involves an estimate to be made of likely Senate Committee activity and Papers ordered to be printed by the Parliament. Such estimates must be heavily weighted by past experience. Nevertheless, the Committee is hopeful that the current enquiry by the Joint Committee on Publications into the Parliamentary Paper series will help to alleviate the problems experienced by both the Parliament and the Australian Government Publishing Service. </para>

            <para>- I will not weary the Committee of the Whole by making again those remarks that I have made already concerning the report of Senate Estimates Committee A. I was speaking about the recommendation of the Committee that appears on page 3 of the report relating to the Committee seeking an explanation for the shortfall of expenditure as against appropriation for the printing, binding and distribution of papers in the year 1976.I had mentioned that we were hopeful that the then current inquiry by the Joint Committee on Publications into Parliamentary Papers might help to overcome the problems that were being experienced by both the Parliament and the Australian Government Publishing Service. Since the time of the presentation of this report, of course, that Joint Committee has tendered its excellent report to the Parliament. I sincerely trust that the Government, and more particularly the Australian Government Publishing Service, will take cognisance of the recommendations that were embodied in that report. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Having made those initial comments, I merely wish to say something about the Parliament itself. I know that there was a recommendation that a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders be held, I think, either this week or next week; but, because of events which have overtaken the calling of that meeting, doubtless no meeting of the Committee will take place between now and the next general election. From the standpoint of the prestige of this place, from the standpoint of public relations so far as Parliament is concerned, the sooner the Standing Orders of this Parliament are brought up to date and into line with modern day standards, practices and conventions, the better it will be for Parliament. </para>
          <para>Frankly, I believe that Parliament as an institution is losing its importance and influence so far as the Australian population is concerned and especially so far as the younger generation is concerned. I say that bearing in mind especially the circumstances and the events which took place in this Parliament some two years ago. I do not want members of the Committee to think that I am merely harping on past experiences. I am just suggesting that if honourable senators were to get out and talk to the younger members of the Australian community- practical, decent, levelheaded members of the Australian communitythey would know that the community is saying that this place is becoming quite meaningless in regard to the events and circumstances with which members of the community, particularly the younger members of the community, are concerned. </para>
          <para>We know that very little of what goes on in this place in fact is reported to the public at large. I think it was three or four weeks ago that I drew the attention of the Senate the fact that at that time one member of the Press Gallery was present. If I look up to the Press Gallery now I see that that situation exists at the present time, when we are discussing the amounts of money which are spent by this Parliament and by government departments in the interests of or on behalf of the Australian taxpayer. I say with great respect to every honourable senator that, if we believe in the institution of Parliament, if we believe in the system of parliamentary democracy, if we believe in the election of people&#39;s representatives to the Parliament, we have to devise and evolve a system whereby as much as possible of the deliberations in this place is recorded and transmitted to the public at large. I believe that the  President  of the Senate, whom I see sitting in this Committee, as the  Chairman  of the Standing Orders Committee has a great responsibility not only to the Parliament but also to the Australian people to see that every step is taken to bring up to date- to bring into line with modern-day practice, custom and convention in society- the Standing Orders of this place so that every honourable senator has the right of effective speech in this Parliament on behalf of the people who elect us to this place. </para>
          <para>Having made those comments, I wish to make no other reference to the estimates for the Parliament, except to say that my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> the other night made an interesting observation when he indicated that he had made representations to the Public Service Board concerning the appointment of staff for members of the Parliament. He indicated that the Public Service Board had replied to him to the effect that in its opinion members of the Australian Parliament, having regard to their work load and their responsibilities, were entitled to a staff of threeone in their electorate office, one in Canberra and one mobile, as it were, between their electorate office and Canberra-but the Public Service Board had stated that because of the shortage of accommodation, particularly in Canberra, at this stage it was impossible to implement such a determination. I think that that is a pretty scandalous state of affairs. </para>
          <para>If the Public Service Board has made that determination, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> read into the record of this chamber, I think that the people who serve the community in this place are entitled to the greatest possible provision of staff, having regard to the responsibilities which fall upon their shoulders. Therefore, I suggest to the Government that it should be having a close look at the recommendation of the Public Service Board. I mention this to you, sir, as  Chairman  of the Committee, and I mention it also to my good friend the  President,  who sits in the Committee at this stage. I draw his attention in particular to the fact that this statement has been made by the Public Service Board and that every attempt possible should be made to overcome the accommodation difficulties which exist in this place and to see that the staff of members of the Parliament is brought up to a standard which will enable members of the Parliament to carry out their job and to do it effectively on behalf of the people they represent. </para>
          <para>Having made those two comments on the estimates for the Parliament- one concerning bringing the Standing Orders up to date and the second concerning the provision of staff for members of the Parliament-I wish now to proceed to the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services. This debate on the estimates of expenditure for 1977-78 affords me an opportunity to discuss government policy and performance in the administrative services portfolio. The present Government- I say &#39;present&#39; with some emphasis- is the most conservative, negative and, I suggest, dishonest government that Australia has known for some time. Last week the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> gave further proof of this statement when he announced the calling of a House of Representatives election a full year before it in fact was required. As I mentioned last week, that announcement was in direct contradiction of a statement which he made a mere five months ago. At a Press conference after the 93rd anniversary rally of the Central Methodist Mission in Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> said that he did not think it was a good idea continually to cut short the term of office of the House of Representatives. He said that the threeyear term was a quite short term by Western democratic standards. Those statements by the Prime Minister were reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald of 23</inline> May 1977. </para>
          <para>I make those observations at the outset, having regard to my earlier remarks about four general elections being held in a period of five years. Bearing in mind what I said about the inadequacy of staff for members of the Parliament and about the obsolescence of the Standing Orders of this place, the ordinary members of the public, particularly those of the younger generationthat section of the community which is suffering as a result of this Government&#39;s policies- are becoming a little disillusioned, to say the least, with the old principle that Parliament is sacrosanct within the Australian community. </para>
          <para>I return now to the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services. The first matter to which I wish to refer is that of staff ceilings and the reduction in the staff of the Department of Administrative Services. The reduction in the staff of that Department is reflected in the decrease, in real terms, in the amount of money appropriated for salaries and payments in the nature of salary. That appropriation totals $3 8m for 1977-78, compared with an appropriation of $42m last financial year. As all Public Service salaries have increased to some extent over the past year, the indications are that there has been a large reduction in the level of staff on the Department &#39;s establishment. In an answer provided to me in the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of IS August of this year in response to question No. 984 the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> said that since 1 January 1976, shortly after this Government came to office a total of 553 offices of the Department of Administrative Services have been abolished, comprising 34 Second Division positions, 178 Third Division positions and 341 Fourth Division positions. Certainly most Second Division positions were recreated but the Minister said that he did not propose to have the answer to the balance of the question researched because of the amount of work involved. </para>
          <para>On page 1 19 of the report of Estimates Committee A a supplementary statement is provided as a result of a question asked by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline> He requested that the Committee be supplied with a breakdown of the area where vacancies are actually occurring and whether they are in Canberra or any of the other capital cities. Page 120 of the Committee &#39;s report sets out attachment &#39;A&#39;, &#39;Summary of Vacancies, Public Service Act Staff, Department of Administrative Services (Excluding Australian Electoral Office and National Library)&#39;. The total number of vacancies is 682, 320 of them being in Canberra, two overseas, 96 in New South Wales, 118 in Victoria, 42 in Queensland, 51 in South Australia, 6 in Western Australia, none in Tasmania and 47 in the Northern Territory. How a government department charged with the very important responsibility of administering the services of this nation can carry out effectively the nation&#39;s requirements in relation to administrative services is beyond me when there is such a large number of vacancies on the staff of the department. It is all very well for the Minister and, with great respect, the officers of the Department to say to the Senate Estimates Committee that despite all the staff shortages caused as a result of the ceilings policy of the Government it is able to carry on the administrative affairs of this nation. I suggest that the Department must be labouring as a large number of other departments are labouring under great inconvenience and inefficiency having regard to the shortage of staff. I hope that I can continue my remarks shortly. </para>

            <para>As a result of the recent transfer of the Director-General of Social Security to the position of Secretary of the Department of Capital Territory, the Committee noted what appears to be a conflict between the <inline font-style="italic">Public Service Act</inline> 1922 and the <inline font-style="italic">Remuneration Tribunals Act</inline> 1973 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> Estimates Committee A, 6 September 1977, pages 7-8, and 15 September 1977, pages 499-501). The Committee reports to the Senate that the Minister for Administrative Services informed the Committee that he has sought advice from Attorney-General as to whether the Acts are in conflict. Due to the importance of the matter the Committee urges the Minister to inform the Senate as soon as possible of the outcome of his inquiries. </para>

            <para>The Committee once again must draw attention to the disparity in the form and content of Explanatory Notes. In addition, we found that some departments still do not make sufficient effort to provide breakdowns of what might be described as &#39;group amounts. </para>

          <para class="block">We were able to ascertain throughout the Estimates that on many occasions the amounts appropriated under the designation &#39;group&#39; were far in excess of the amounts appropriated for certain items that were designated. This is something about which the Committee is concerned. It takes up a lot of time of members of the Committee and the Committee sessions trying to ascertain from officers where this money is being used which is appropriated in sums much larger in many instances that other sums which are set out in the explanatory notes. </para>

I raised this matter with the Minister during the last Estimates hearings. He undertook to have some repairs done to the surface. The Minister had them done but they were not adequate. I now want to know whether that property is going to be sold or whether it is the Government&#39;s intention to use it for building purposes. </para>

            <para>- I am coming to that, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh. Senator Bishop</inline> asked the Minister a question today. He replied that one of the properties owned by the Commonwealth in the metropolitan area of Adelaide had been disposed of to the Adelaide City Council. He could not remember the name of the other one so I interjected and said: &#39;That is the John Bull one. &#39; The Minister thanked me. If my memory serves me correctly he said that only last week he had written to somebody saying that the property was not for sale. That is in conflict with what is stated in the Committee report. </para>

              <para>-I hope the answer that the Minister gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> today is correct and that the answer on page 1 17 of the report is incorrect. I should be very disappointed if the Government were to dispose of that property because it is in a very select site in Adelaide. It is already adjacent to one of Adelaide&#39;s city car parks, takes up quite a large area and extends right down to a private insurance company building, part of which is leased by the Commonwealth for the Commonwealth Electoral Office. For the life of me I cannot see why, in view of the fact that the property was bought back in 19S7 approximately, something has not been done to build a Commonwealth centre to accommodate Federal departments there. </para>

          <para>I know it is costing a tremendous amount for the Commonwealth to lease the fifteenth floor of the AMP building at 1 King William Street. Here we have a block of land which is an eye-sore in the city of Adelaide and which, having in mind the high level of unemployment could, if developed, give employment to building contractors and to many skilled persons who are now looking for work. Such a centre would house not only members of Parliament, who now take up the fifteenth floor of the AMP building, but also the Department of Health, the Department of Social Security and those who are presently occupying, in nearby Currie Street, the premises of the Commonwealth Electoral Office. There is no reason at all why all of these instrumentalities and services could not be housed in such a building, which would be right in the heart of the city, adjacent to a city car park, and convenient to as many of the residents of Adelaide as might wish to visit the departments concerned. </para>
          <para>I hope the answer that the Leader of the Government gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> today was in fact correct, and that the answer he previously gave in his report to the Senate was incorrect. If so, I hope that when we are returned to government on 10 December, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> can bring pressure to bear on the new Minister for Construction in regard to this matter. I know that when he was himself Minister he had set his sights on building a Commonwealth centre there. Unfortunately, he lost that portfolio- we were not allowed to settle down in our jobs- and the incoming Government has of course, taken no action. </para>

              <para>- Be that as it may, we still need a Commonwealth centre because we have insufficient accommodation, even though <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fred</inline> Daly, who was then occupying the portfolio now held by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> bought premises that had already been erected. No doubt, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> implied, he had to do that because we were running short of space due to the lethargy of the previous Government, which had bought the Currie Street property in 1957 and done nothing at all about it. It had not even kept the surface of the car park in proper condition. The few times that I parked my car there during the winter I found that one had to be very careful one did not step into a pothole and end up knee deep in water. At least I give credit to the Minister for Construction for his action after the last Estimates debate in having minor repairs performed to the surface. However, he now says that because the property is to be sold the Government does not intend to carry out any additional repairs. I know that if the answer the Minister gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> today is correct, the senator will have a very worthwhile proposition to put before him, but I will not transgress on his right to do that himself. </para>

          <para>To return to the report of Estimates Committee A, the Committee, in considering the Estimates, came to several conclusions which I would like to bring to the notice of the Senate. In previous reports we had referred to procedures whereby explanatory notes would be made available to honourable senators as early as practicable, to permit a preliminary examination to be made by the committees in private session prior to public examination of the Estimates. We have noted with some pleasure that this aspect has shown improvement. However, following its most recent examination of the Estimates, the committee has proposed that the Government be called upon to give an undertaking to table the explanatory notes on the day immediately following presentation of the Appropriation Bills, thus enabling committees to examine them properly. If one receives them only a week or 10 days beforehand it is very difficult to do that. </para>
          <para>The Committee also noted, with some concern I might add, the lateness in the presentation to the Parliament of the annual reports of some departments and statutory authorities. Whilst these reports do not stand referred to committees, they nevertheless are among the tools used by the committees in exercising their responsibility to the Senate for the scrutiny of government expenditure. It is not the first time that Estimates Committee A has brought these matters to the attention of the Senate. </para>
          <para>The third matter to which the Committee, directed the attention of the Senate was the disparity in the form and content of the explanatory notes. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> was referring to this matter as I came into the chamber. Some departments do not make sufficient effort to provide a breakdown of what might be described as group amounts. This creates problems and wastes the time of committees, which must then endeavour to ascertain the actual breakdown. </para>
          <para>We are aware that other Estimates committees have had the same problem and that both last year and the year before attention was directed to the great variation in the type of explanatory notes provided. We have advocated a degree of standardisation in the models to be used for committee reports. Estimates Committee A would describe the explanatory notes of the Department of Administrative Services as representing a model which provides the greatest possible detail for use by the committee. I know that other committees have proposed explanatory notes from other departments as models to be followed. Accordingly, Estimates Committee A proposes that the Department of Finance review recent reports of Estimates committees and submit to a meeting of committee chairmen a style of note embracing both form and content; that this would then be used as a model for all departments and statutory authorities. We do this quite deliberately because we had great problems, as the Minister might recall with the explanatory notes of some departments, which were almost impossible to understand. For example, I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> being involved at one stage in an argument over the explanatory notes of a particular department. I am quite sure that the Minister for Administrative Services remembers that. We feel that if we could possibly get some standardisation it would enable a far more proper and effective examination to be carried out of the Estimates. We have suggested that the explanatory notes of the Department of Administrative Services should be used as a model. I know that other committees have suggested that those of other departments should be used as a model. We do not wish to take a firm stance on a particular one. But we do suggest that the Department of Finance should produce a model at which the chairmen of the Estimates committees should look and decide whether it is the best model for use. It is for those reasons that I move: </para>

I have put forward the second proposition because we believe that if we can achieve that aim the Estimates committees can be far more effective than they are at the moment. I think we all agree that one of the aims that we seek to achieve is maximum effectiveness of the parliamentary examination of the Estimates. There is nothing new in what we are proposing. As I said earlier, from time to time over the years the chairmen of the Estimates committees individually have put forward such a proposition. It is now being put in the form of a more formal motion. </para>

The Government will not oppose that motion. I will certainly use my best endeavours to make certain that the wish of the Estimates committees is carried out. I shall move through the speeches of honourable senators one by one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland raised a matter which appears on page 4 of the report of Estimates Committee A and mentioned the work of the Joint Committee on Publications on this matter. I am anxiously awaiting the presentation of the report of the Joint Committee on Publications, which, as honourable senators no doubt are aware, has been doing a lot of work on the whole of the operations of the Australian Government Publishing Service. I think it will be coming forward with some very interesting and useful suggestions. </para>

              <para>-It is the old argument of what is the practice and what are the Standing Orders. I think that we occasionally indulge in some ancient rituals handed down from the Incas. I often wonder whether the Standing Orders really contemplate that we are still illiterate. Maybe the Standing Orders are correct. At the same time, honourable senators would appreciatethatoverthelastfiveofsixyearsthere hasbeenanenormousimprovementinandmodernisation of the Standing Orders. Whilst I am one of those who occasionally get testy about some of the archaic methods, I think it is far better to move a little slowly and to do it properly as a result of experience than it is to rush pell-mell into it. I think we have come a long way in recent years in up-dating our Standing Orders. I am quite certain that the committee is seized of the same problem. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline>McClelland also mentioned the report of the Public Service Board. I have not seen it, but I can well recall the Remuneration Tribunal saying that when it was satisfied that there was sufficient accommodation within this building it would be prepared to determine that senators and members of parliament should be granted a third staff member for work in Canberra. That was mentioned in the last report of the Remuneration Tribunal which I tabled in this chamber in August of this year. That is not a matter just for governments to determine; it is a matter which is also within the province of the Presiding Officers. All I can say is that I am well seized of the recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal, as is the Government, and that the Government is anxious to do all it can to bring about an improvement in the conditions in this building so that a third staff member will be granted by the Remuneration Tribunal. It is a matter that I have had under study for some time. Early next year I hope to be announcing some positive steps to bring it about. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline>McClelland referred in passing to the early election. I thought it seemed strange for an opposition to complain about the holding of an election. During the three years that we were in opposition I asked once a week for an election to be held. I think that is a sign of a good opposition. An opposition that is confident that it is going to win an election will want that election to be held so that it can do so. I think that an opposition that complains about the holding of an early election knows that it is going to be beaten. I can remember what happened in those very interesting days when weekly I used to call upon the previous Prime Minister to get into his car and go to Yarralumla and ask for double dissolution after double dissolution. Honourable senators may remember that I always used to ask: Will he jump or do we push? In the end we pushed. We see the result of that today. I think that a really good fighting opposition does not complain about the holding of an early election. </para>

              <para>-I am used to being surprised. The other matter of which the honourable senator was critical was the imposition of staff ceilings. I admit that the staff numbers within departments have fallen, but am I to take it from the honourable senator&#39;s remarks that he will be going out and saying to the taxpayers of Australia: &#39;We believe in having a vastly increased Public Service, which is something for which you will have to pay&#39;? He had better make up his mind. We were elected on the basis that we would bring about more efficient government. Might I say that with a very few exceptions I have not heard a moan or a complaint from the officers of my department in particular, and the Public Service in general, about staff ceilings. I believe that the Public Service has wanted this challenge and that it has wanted the opportunity to show that it can do better. After all, I think that the better members of the Public Service, who are in the great majority, are just sick and tired of being regarded as people who do not work too hard and who do not meet challenges. I think that they have shown in the last two years that they can, and that we have a very good Public Service in Australia. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline>raised two matters. One was the Daniels case. I have been advised that the Attorney-General&#39;s Department has advised the Public Service Board that it has the capacity under the Public Service Act to continue to pay the extra responsibility allowance on the transfer of a Permanent Head. That is an advising of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department and the Government naturally abides by it. The Public Service Board has done nothing unlawful. The other matter that he mentioned was the construction of a Commonwealth centre in Adelaide. I am sorry, but I cannot remember every block of Commonwealth land in Australia. I think that the Commonwealth Government owns 20,000, perhaps 30,000 pieces of real estate in this country, and at times I do get a little confused. However, I understand that I have here the full information. Are the Currie Street site and the John Bull site one and the same? </para>

I understand- again I am calling on my memory and I cannot remember the minute in exact terms- that the building of an office block there now would not be in conformity with City Council and State Government planning regulations. The site evidently has been zoned as a car park and a car park will be constructed there. Is the Simpson Building in Pirie Street the other one? </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline>also raised the matter of the lateness of the tabling of annual reports. Honourable senators will recall that I too have been somewhat critical when I have tabled reports during this part of the financial year. In respect of my own Department and the reports for which I am responsible, I have asked that next year all reports be ready for tabling on the same day as the Budget is put down, that is, the first day of sitting after the end of the financial year. I also have suggested to the Department that in cases where there are technical difficulties in putting down a report, such as awaiting the AuditorGeneral&#39;s certificate or some special requirement under the Act, or even where there is a printing problem, an interim report should be put down and a formal report tabled later, when the Auditor-General&#39;s certificate is obtained. Honourable senators will realise that a number of Acts require that the annual reports, together with the Auditor-General&#39;s certificate, shall be tabled. If one looks at the date of the AuditorGeneral&#39;s certificate one finds frequently that it is October, November or December. I have been advised that, if a report is tabled without the Auditor-General&#39;s certificate attached to it, in effect it has not been tabled in accordance with the Act. I intend to table interim reports for the areas for which I am responsible so that as far as possible they will be tabled on Budget day. </para>

I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has not got them. Apparently work has been proceeding. I regret that they were not available in time for this debate. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition supports the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim.</inline> As a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and I were parties to the resolution, which was unanimous. I also should like to place on record my appreciation of the job done by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> as  Chairman  of Senate Estimates Committee A and of the excellent job done by the staff who looked after the Committee. A study of the report of Estimates Committee A for this year reveals more of the sorts of things we saw in 1976. There were further cuts in public expenditure in many areas, for little or apparently no reason at all. It is interesting to note that a recent poll showed that most Australians believe that cuts in public expenditure have gone too far and they are opposed to any more. The damage has already been done to the social and economic infrastructure of the country by cuts in government expenditure. I believe that it is a policy of economic lunacy, but at this stage I want to confine my remarks to the Department of Administrative Services. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In respect of that Department, funds were set aside for the cost of running elections and, if one looks back now at those estimates, one sees that probably not enough money was set aside for that purpose. One of the points I want to raise is that no funds at all were made available for investigating electoral reform, and we are about to go into an election campaign with a system of running elections, especially for this chamber, that I believe is in the greatest need of reform. As far as the Senate is concerned, we have the compulsory preferential voting system. It has many disadvantages. It is complicated for the voters. It disadvantages the less well educated. It also disadvantages elderly people and especially immigrants. In New South Wales in 1974 people were asked to fill out 73 squares on a ballot paper for the Senate. In 1975 they were asked to fill out 54 squares, and of course the people I mentioned were severely disadvantaged. I believe that we. have to find a much easier system of voting for the Senate. </para>
          <para>Under the present system, the votes take too long to count. In 1975 it took two months to get the final result of the double dissolution election. I know that many people would say that that did not matter because we all knew that the Government had a majority in the House of Representatives and a majority in the Senate. Taking a situation such as the one that occurred in the 1961 election, when the Government finished up with only a one seat majority, in 1975 the country could have been placed in a situation in which for a period of two months nobody would have known who the Government was going to be. That is not good enough. It is not good enough when one compares it with the situation in the United States, which has a presidential election system. Millions of votes are cast, yet the result is known within 24 hours of the ballot closing. West Germany has a list system of voting as well as a constituency system and, despite the fact that the system is complicated, the results usually are known within 24 hours. Perhaps the best place to look at in relation to the quick counting of votes is Great Britain. There are 600-odd seats in the House of Commons and sometimes two or three complete recounts, yet it is usually only 48 to 72 hours before the full election result is known. </para>
          <para>The present system in Australia also contributes to informal voting. In the State of New South Wales, which is the experience to which I will continue to refer, 12.13 per cent of the Senate votes in 1974 were informal. In 1975, despite the campaign waged by both major parties, more than 10 per cent of the votes, or one in ten, were informal. We then had the very first recount of a Senate poll in history, and that showed up some of the many flaws in the system. I understand that about 12,000 votes cast were awarded to different candidates as a result of the recount and that there was a reduction in the total number of formal votes cast. The Commonwealth was put to great expense to carry out that recount. The question also was raised whether the casual staff who were asked to come in and do the recount were competent. I am not talking about the permanent public servants; I am talking about the casuals who were brought in all over New South Wales to do that recount. From my own experience and from the reports that I received from my scrutineers, I do not believe that they were competent enough to do that sort of count. In fact, a complete recount should have been done by only permanent employees at a central place, preferably in Sydney. Again, that is something that ought to be looked at in the future. </para>
          <para>The random sample system of counting preferences also I believe is not a good system. I know that it has been argued that it does not change the overall result, but every time it is used in fact a slightly different result is achieved. When faced with a situation such as that which occurred in New South Wales in the last election, where in the first count there was a difference of only 19 votes per electorate for the 45 electorates, it is apparent that the system of random sampling also needs investigating. Having made those criticisms of the system, I believe that we also have to consider possible solutions, and that is the area in which the Department of Administrative Services should be involved. Optional preferential voting simplifies the process. The present New South Wales Government is bringing in a system for the New South Wales Legislative Council. It will be like the list system used in West Germany. I believe it will cut down drastically on the number of informal votes. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline>has raised a matter in here many times when he has been talking about reforms for the Senate. I refer to the deposit which is required to be paid by Senate candidates. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> has suggested in debate that the amount should be $1,000. I do not know whether it should be $1,000 or more, but the system which now exists, under which it costs only $200 to nominate, is absolutely crazy. A higher amount would certainly get rid of the nonsense candidates who nominated in 1974 and 1975. 1 certainly question how fair dinkum were some of the people who stood in New South Wales for the Senate elections in 1974 and 1975 and whether they paid the $200 deposit themselves. It has also been suggested, I think by </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline>that Senate candidates should have nominators from every federal electorate in their State. Again, this would be a way in which we could cut down on the number of nonsense candidates standing. Surely if one is a responsible candidate for the Senate one would be able to get somebody from each of the 45 electorates as it was then, or from each of the 43 electorates as it is now, to nominate one, instead of requiring just the six people who I think are required at the moment. </para>
          <para>We should indicate the candidate&#39;s party affiliation on the ballot paper. We should also look at the early closure of the polls. This has already been done in New South Wales by the Lewis Liberal-Country Party Government. New South Wales now closes the polling places at 6 o&#39;clock, as a result of which we do not have the situation which used to occur with bad lighting, an insufficient number of booths and, between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., a lot of people voting informally because of these conditions. We ought to be looking at mobile voting booths and computerised counting. I believe it is time that the Department of Administrative Services carried out seriously a study of the use of voting machines. I know that in the past the use of voting machines has been looked at. I know of some of the faults of using voting machines. But I suggest this is something at which we ought to be looking for the future. </para>
          <para>I think also that the Department of Administrative Services should be looking at ways of reducing possible corruption in an election campaign by looking at the public funding of candidates and campaigns. We should look at the situation which exists in western Europe at the moment. In the United States at the last presidential election there was public funding for the first time. I believe that in time this aspect will spread to all the Congressional and Senate elections which are held in the United States. When I was there during the presidential campaign I found it very interesting to be able to go into the office of the Electoral Commission and for ten cents a copy, be able to get every day a list of contributions made to the major candidates who were running at that time for the primaries for the United Sates presidency. </para>
          <para>I think also we should be looking at means of informing migrants and Aboriginals of their voting rights and at means of getting the socially disadvantaged groups on the electoral rolls. The other day I suggested to the appropriate Minister that we ought to reintroduce the mobile multilingual vans which went around and encouraged these people to place their names on the electoral rolls. We have at the moment a system of election for the Senate which is so complicated that it causes much distortion of the electorate&#39;s will. The system of counting votes is archaic. These things reduce the reputation of the Senate and contribute to political alienation in the community. I suggest that a special committee should be formed. Not only should the Department of Administrative Services look at this matter but also we should have a special committee on electoral reform like the Houghton Committee in Great Britain which looked into all these aspects which I have raised tonight. I do not believe that we are about to get these reforms because I think the present Government believes that the system we have now suits it. However, I suggest to the Government that the people of Australia are becoming better educated about electoral reform and that this is something which cannot be put off for much longer. </para>

            <para>- It is gratifying for me to find compliments paid to my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> as  chairman  of Estimates Committee A in affording an opportunity for a full investigation of government expenditure. I rise mainly in response to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland when he referred to the dwindling significance of this chamber and of both Houses of Parliament in the eyes of the people they represent. It has been my task to make some investigation of the reason for that. I think a corollary of our Estimates Committee system is that when a Committee makes a report and it comes into the Committee of the Whole, honourable senators should take unto themselves the right to decide modifications to the Estimates, consistent with a proper responsibility to stability in government. For this reason I had research conducted by the Senate Research officer, firstly, into the historical development of the House of Commons&#39; exclusive power over money Bills. Suffice it to say that that was a development over the centuries culminating in the Parliament Bill of 1911 which we have not copied. After proper consultation with the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> and the  Chairman  of Committees I seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the results of researches of the Senate Research officer. </para>

              <para>Historical development of the House of Common&#39;s exclusive power over money bills. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In the early stages of Parliamentary history, it is apparent that the Common&#39;s battle for ascendancy over the Lords in relation to the granting of monies was pan of, and probably overshadowed by, the more imponant question of the establishment of the principle of no taxation without consent. It is generally agreed that the contitutional foundation for the principle is contained in Chapter 12 of the Magna Cana: &#34;No scutage nor aid shall be imposed on our Kingdom unless by common counsel of our Kingdom, except for ransoming our person, for making our eldest son a Knight, and for marrying our eldest daughter; and for these there shall not be levied more than a reasonable aid. In like manner it shall be done concerning aids from the City of London&#34;. </para>
          <para>This principle was confirmed by the monarchy on many occasions, particularly in the Confirmatio Cartarum in 1297, with a considerably extended scope covering all taxation. While the Confirmatio Cartarum made no mention of the Commons, in practice the Commons were summoned to every Parliament after 1 3 1 1 , so that the concessions enforced by the Barons for their own benefit came to be applied automatically to the Commons. </para>
          <para>According to Einzig1, the most imponant step towards the supremacy of the Commons over the Lords, the right to initiate grants, appears to have been achieved almost without any struggle as an unintentional by-product of Parliament&#39;s victory over the King in the matter of imposing import duties. Until 1372 Kings usually negotiated the tonnage and poundage direct with the merchants of London and Bristol, and Parliament went through with a gesture of endorsing them by incorporating them into the annual grants. In 1373 Edward III was persuaded, in return for the grant of the tonnage and poundage for the subsequent three years, to agree that hencefonh tonnage and poundage would have to be authorised by Parliament as a whole. </para>
          <para>As Einzig points out, since the import duties were paid by the merchants, it stood to reason that the assembly which included their representatives should be first in chronological order to deal with such subsidies. The Prelates and Barons had no direct interest in the matter, since they did not have to pay the duties, nor did they have the expertise necessary for their negotiation. Thus the Lords agreed to the modification of the old-established constitutional formula whereby subsidies were granted by the Lords with the assent of the Commons. In 1 373 the grant was entered into the Rolls of Parliament as being granted by the Commons and assented to by the Lords. </para>
          <para>The full significance of the difference between granting and assenting to a grant does not appear to have been realised or become a matter of controversy until 1407. In that year Henry IV commenced the financial business of the session by a discussion with the Lords as to the probable requirments of the service of the year and the Commons were summoned to be told the result of the discussion. The Commons remonstrated that the King had not accorded them their accustomed privilege of first discussing his money requirements with them. As a result the King formally acknowledged the superiority of the Commons in a declaration before a joint meeting of both Assemblies on December 2, 1407, &#34;that grants of Supply must take their rise in the Commons, and that the resulting grants, after the Lords has assented to them, ought to be reported by the mouth of the  Speaker  of the House of Commons&#34;. (Rolls of Parliament III 611)2. 2 See Anson: Law and Custom of the Constitution Oxford, 1892, Part 1, p. 253. </para>
          <para>Reid: The Politics of Financial Control, London, 1966, p. 55. </para>
          <para>Einzig: op cit, p. 110-111. </para>
          <para>The Lords, understandably, did not acquiesce in such a subordinate position, and frequently argued for their right to amend, as well as reject, financial bills. For example in 1671 they argued as follows: &#34;. . . if the Lords who have the power of treating, advising, giving counsel and applying remedies, cannot amend, abate, or refuse a bill in pan, by what consequence of reason can they enjoy a liberty to reject the whole?&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">This was in response to the Commons resolution of 1671 which resolved, &#34;That in all aids given to the King by the Common&#39;s the rate or tax ought not to be altered.&#34; The Common&#39;s attitude, as communicated to the Lords was Your Lordships . . . have a negative to the whole&#34;. </para>
          <para>In 1678 the Commons finally expressed their claim to superiority in the following significant resolution: &#34;That all Aids and Supplies and Aids to His Majesty in Parliament, are the sole gin of the Commons; and all Bills for the granting of any such Aids and Supplies ought to begin with the Commons; and that it is undoubted and sole right of the Commons to direct, limit, and appoint in such Bills, the ends, purposes, considerations and conditions, limitations and qualifications of such grants, which ought not to be changed or altered by the House of Lords&#34;. </para>
          <para class="block">Thus by the end of the Seventeenth century, it seems to be generally claimed that the House of Lords had a veto power, but not an amending power, over financial bills. (Although, as can be seen in the answer to question 3 below, the Lords did occasionally amend financial legislation of the Commons). As Einzig points out, however, &#34;in some of these precedents the Commons did not stand on their dignity but accepted the Lord&#39;s Amendments, although, to save their face, they dropped the amended Bill and introduced an entirely new Bill in the exact form in which the old Bill was after its amendment by the Lords. In no instance  did these incidents lead to a constitutional crisis&#34;.3 3 Einzig: op cit, p. 304. </para>
          <para>A clash between the two Houses, with most imponant ramifications, did occur in 1860, over the rejection by the Lords of a Bill providing for the repeal of the paper duty. The Commons replied by passing three resolutions which, while not denying that the Lords might have a power of rejecting money bills, and intimating, as Anson suggest, that the Commons had it always in their power so to frame money bills as to make the right of rejection nugatory. The three resolutions are set out by Anson as follows: &#34;The first recites that the right of granting aids and supplies to the Crown is in the Commons alone. </para>
          <para>The second, that although the Lords have exercised the power of rejecting bills of several descriptions relative to taxation, by negativing the whole, yet the exercise of that power by them has not been frequent, and is justly regarded by this House with peculiar jealousy, as affecting the right of the Commons to grant the supplies and to provide the ways and means for the service of the year. </para>
          <para>The third, that to guard for the future against an undue exercise of that power by the Lords, and <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> secure to the Commons their rightful control over Taxation and Supply, this House has in its own hands the power to impose and remit taxes, and to frame bills of supply, that the right of the Commons as to the matter, manner, measure, or time, may be maintained inviolate.&#34;4 </para>
          <para>In 1 86 1 , these resolutions were put into effect. Gladstone &#39;s Budget of April 15 included the repeal of the paper duties as pan of the total annual taxation measures, and from that year onwards the annual Bill contained all the taxation provisions and was named the Customs and Inland Revenue Bill. Subsequently it was to be renamed the Finance Bill. The House of Lords was thus forced into the position of having to accept or reject the financial proposals of the Commons as a whole. </para>
          <para>Before proceeding to an outline of the culmination of the Common s achievement of exclusive power over money bills as enshrined in the Parliament Act of 1 9 1 1 , it is interesting to set down a passage from a proposed report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Tax Bills of 1860 (the report was presented to the Parliament in a different final form) as it provides an indication of the depth of feeling in the Commons over Lords interference in financial legislation. The draft report proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bright,</inline> contained the following passage: &#34;The Committee cannot doubt that the right which the Commons have contended for, and have maintained, is nothing less than an absolute control in determining the expenditure necessary for the service of the Crown, and the mode and the amount of the taxation which shall be imposed upon the People. If the Lords cannot begin a tax, if they cannot increase or abate a tax, yet if they may prolong a tax by refusing their assent to its repeal when that repeal has been voted by the House of Commons, then it appears to the Committee that the &#39;fundamental and inherent right&#39; of the House of Commons to an absolute control over Taxation and Supply is not only menaced, but destroyed. &#34;The Committee cannot conclude their Report without reminding the House, that, if henceforth, which they will not believe to be possible, no tax, hurtful to trade,&#39; and grievous to the People, can be remitted unless the Lords be pleased to remit it, or can be even recommended by the Crown to be considered by the Commons with a view to its remission, with that full assurance which has heretofore existed that such a tax will be remitted; not only will the powers of the House of Commons be impaired, but the foundation of the ancient freedom of England will be undermined; for where shall that ancient freedom be found when the right to determine the mode and the sum of taxation is divorced from the Representative Branch of the Legislature&#34;. </para>
          <para>The events leading up to and subsequent to the Lords rejection of the Finance Bill in 1909, culminating in the General Election of January 1910 and the subsequent passing of the 1909 Bill are well enough known to be not dealt with here. The Government, however, was determined that the 1909 situation should not happen again. Consequently, on April 6, 1 9 10, it introduced the following Resolution: &#34;That it is expedient that the House of Lords be disabled by law from rejecting or amending a Money Bill, but that any such limitation by law shall not be taken to diminish or qualify the existing rights and privileges of the House of Commons. For the purposes of this Resolution a Bill shall be considered a Money Bill if in the opinion of the  Speaker  it contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration or regulation of taxation; charges on the Consolidated Fund or the provision of money by Parliament; supply; the appropriation, control or regulation of public moneys; the raising or guaranteeing of any loan or the repayment thereof; or matters incidental to these subjects or any of them &#34;. </para>
          <para>After lengthy and acrimonious debate, the Resolution was passed by a large majority, and was followed by legislation embodying it, which finally clearly curtailed the financial powers of the House of Lords. The relevant clause of the 1911 Parliament Act reads as follows: &#34;If a Money Bill, having been passed by the House of Commons and sent up to the House of Lords at least one month before the end of the session, is not passed by the House of Lords without Amendment within one month after it is so sent up, the Bill shall, unless the House of Commons directs to the contrary, be presented to  His  Majesty and becomes an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified, not withstanding that the House of Lords have not consented to the Bill &#34;. </para>
          <para>Finally, it is an irony of history that had the Parliament Act been in force in 1909, the  Speaker  of that dme might well have refused to certify the Finance Bill as a Money Bill. Lord Ullswater, who as J. W. Lowther was  Speaker  in 1909 wrote in his memoirs &#34;In my judgment the celebrated Finance Bill of 1909 . . . would not have come under the provisions of Clause 1 Section 2 of the Parliament Act as a &#39; Money Bill &#39;, for it contained a number of provisions which were not within the definition of that clause and section&#34;. (A Speaker&#39;s Commentary, Vol. II, p. 103). </para>

              <para>-It follows, I maintain, that there is a fundamental distinction between an hereditary House of Lords and a Senate elected on an equality of adult suffrage not restricted in any degree from the suffrage of the House of Representatives. Our base is just as much adult suffrage as is the other place in the Federal Parliament. Therefore, I was interested in the matter that seems to be an assumption here that if either the House of Representatives or the Senate passes a motion requesting a reduction of expenditure, that is an indication of want of confidence in the Government. I am pleased to say that the researches of the Senate Research officer assure me that none of the sources that have been consulted reveals any acknowledgment of the existence of such a convention m relation to the House of Commons, a fortiori the House of Representatives or the Senate. Without taking the time of the Committee I therefore ask for leave, after the proper consultations that I have had, to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the note that has been provided on that subject. </para>

          <para>In none of the sources consulted did I find any acknowledgment of the existence of such a convention in relation to the House of Commons. Some writers specifically denied it, while another suggested that it was a myth rather than a convention, and a myth with unfortunate consequences.

          <para>On the Supply Days alloted for the purpose of considering the Estimates in Committee of Supply- a Committee of the Whole House- broad subjects which have little or no connection with the Estimates under review are debated in a general way, and the Estimates themselves are passed purely formally at the beginning or the end of these general debates. It is true that the Opposition often divides the House against Estimates. But this is always done on Amendments moving some token reduction to imply censure of the Government or of the Minister concerned- more likely than not, for not spending enough. </para>
          <para>During recent decades this system has become so firmly established that it is now taken entirely for granted. It does not even occur to Members of Parliament, let alone to the public, that it could and should be otherwise. Very few people are aware that in the United States, France, and other democratic countries Estimates are subject to very close scrutiny before they are passed and are liable to be drastically amended against the wishes of the Executive. Even fewer people are aware that in Britain itself Estimates were subject to a fairly close scrutiny during a great part of the 19th Century, when occasionally many Government supporters felt strongly enough against certain expenditure items to vote against the Government. Admittedly, defeats over Estimates were few and far between, and most of them occurred on items of relatively small importance. But the faa that occasionally Parliamentary majorities turned against their Government in order to defend the taxpayer&#39;s interests must itself have gone a long way towards warning Governments against overspending. </para>
          <para>In the absence of resistance to extravagance in recent times by means of a thorough scrutiny of Estimates on the floor of the House, Governments have been placed in a position to assume that they can do as they please with the taxpayer&#39;s money. It is true, Estimates are criticised by the Select Committee on Estimates. But the Government is at liberty to ignore its recommendations. In any case, the Committee does not even pretend to scrutinise Estimates systematically. Even though it has greatly extended its activities in recent years, it would have to extend them many times more, and it would have to increase its political influence considerably, before it could be regarded as a substitute for the Committee of Supply as the guardian of the taxpayer&#39;s money . . . </para>
          <para>The myth that a Government has to resign or to ask for a dissolution of Parliament if it is defeated on any detail of the Finance Bill or the Estimates goes a long way towards preventing the majority in the House from exercising control over finance. Government supporters assume that the choice lies between provoking a crisis and giving reluctant support to financial measures which they dislike, and they regard the second alternative as the smaller evil. The first step towards a restoration of effective financial control would be the realisation that, under long-established British constitutional practice, defeats over details of the Budget or of Estimates are no cause for resignation, provided that they do not amount to denial to the Government of the entire annual supply or an essential part of it, and provided that they do not amount to the rejection of some major policy to which the Government had committed itself.&#39; </para>
          <para>That such a convention exists is denied strongly by Alpheus Todd, in his work <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Government in England.</inline> To support his contention, he offers the following considerations (vol. ii, pp. 224-6): </para>
          <para>In the exercise of their constitutional functions, the House of Commons not infrequently dissent from the financial propositions of ministers . . . In 1816, after the close of the war with France, when the government were desirous of continuing the property tax for a longer term, the feeling of the House was so strongly opposed to the continuance of war taxes after peace had been obtained, that the chancellor of the exchequer was defeated on the 18th of March, in committee of ways and means, upon his motion for the renewal of the property tax. After this, he voluntarily abandoned the duties upon malt, amounting to about &#163;2,700,000. Altogether it has been computed that the government lost, on this occasion, about twelve millions of anticipated revenue. </para>
          <para>It is somewhat remarkable that the great ministerial defeat, recorded in the preceding paragraph, was so quietly accepted by the government, and did not lead to a ministerial crisis. But the true doctrine on this point is that which was expressed by Lord John Russell, in 1851, after the government had sustained a defeat on some financial proposition. He remarked that &#39;questions of taxation and burdens are questions upon which the House of Commons, representing the country, have peculiar claims to have their opinions listened to, and upon which the executive government may very fairly, without any loss of its dignity-provided they maintain a sufficient revenue for the credit of the country and for its establishment- reconsider any particular measures of finance they have proposed.&#39; To the same effect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr T.</inline> Baring, the undersecretary for war in Lord Palmerston &#39;s administration, said, in 1861, after the rejection by the House of Lords of the bill for the repeal of the paper dutieswhich formed part of the financial measures of government for that year-&#39; I am happy that we live at a time when experience has shown that a budget may be modified or rejected without any change in the position of the ministry. I am glad that we have seen budgets withdrawn, and fresh ones introduced. We have seen taxes remitted, or taxes the remission of which, when proposed, has been refused, without any effect upon the cabinet. In faa, a change of the budget does not involve a change in ministry; and I rejoice that it is so, because I think it would be most unpardonable obstinancy on the part of public men to adhere to the terms of a budget which was opposed to the wishes and feelings of parliament. It would be unfortunate for the free exercise of the judgment of this House, if the rejection of any portion of a budget were to be construed into a vote of want of confidence. &#39; </para>

The research service has provided me with, among other things, a report of the select committee of the House of Commons on tax Bills in 1860 when the final achievement of the House of Commons as to its exclusive power was, in effect, really maintained, and it traces instances where the House of Lords amended or rejected money Bills from early times.

          <para>-I do this for the purpose of formulating a basis of a forum upon which, in the next stage, we shall move to vote as to our view of the proper figure for certain expenses. If it is disagreed to by the government of the day we shall engage in conference and compromise, according to sensible people, because I need not remind all honourable senators that in the American Senate once a money Bill comes onto its floor the Senate has powers equal to those of the House of Representatives. The American Senate has no power to initiate but it has power to amend or reject with no section 57 but only conference procedures which invariably result in compromise. The American Senate determines alterations in presidential proposals for expenditure of the utmost magnitude without disturbing the stability of the Government which is, of course, guaranteed by the Constitution to have a fixed term. It is not subject to dissolution if its House majority withdraws confidence. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am not advocating an adoption of the presidential system but I am adverting to it as a democracy which operates without blasting to instability Government control of finance simply because the Congress takes a defective part in the decision as to finance. Later I will raise certain matters because the Committee of the Whole is where they should be decided. I, in my spirit of moderation and gradual approach will not be asking for any vote of a decisive character this session. But in the next session, the last I will be here, when Supply is before us I will be proposing those things for the decision of the Senate. </para>
        <para>I instance one proposition that comes out of a reference from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline> I have been repeating this ever since I was a Minister for Works. I tried to get a program going for the construction of Commonwealth office buildings that would be adequate to accommodate all government services. Out of five proposals in the six State capitals I got one by a mere accidental afterthought. I will not go into the history of that. However, it is most interesting to me that people will say that Hobart was granted a building because I was a Minister from that city. Nothing of the sort. A building was constructed in Hobart for about $4m. Today the same building would cost $14m. In the meantime payments in the nature of interest and rental have been saved. Yet I find that the Government under division 135.0.1 is paying rent of $53m for private office space, rising each year at the rate of $4m or $5m. This is the greatest diseconomy that could occur, for two reasons. If one reads the report of the National Capital Development Commission in Canberra one will see that there has been a downturn in construction. The fact that we are applying our restricted expenditure economy proposals to capital construction of a productive nature is, I think, shortsighted in the extreme. To apply those proposals to surplus excessive expenditure such as things that are unnecessary, is the way to get money back into relation to earning power. But, for goodness sake, let capital productive works proceed and they, once built, will earn their own reward and create increasing employment. Instead of that we are restricting our capital works and allowing private enterprise to inflate the economy, as it has in Sydney, where there are acres of vacant office space of two or three years standing that should have been built by the Commonwealth two or three years ago. The fault was just as obvious in the time of the Labor Administration so <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> need not chuckle. All I am pointing out is that we should build our capital works. We should not pay rent on private property when we could accommodate much more economically our own services by building. </para>

        <para>I am concerned about two points referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> I would like to clear up some matters raised by the honourable senator in respect to buildings that house Commonwealth offices. I was Minister for Works when Labor came to power and I took up the question of Commonwealth offices. Previous governments seemed to have some arrangement whereby every time an insurance company built a multistorey block the Commonwealth would rent sufficient accommodation in that new building for the purpose of paying the cost of construction in return for the insurance company investing 30 percentofitsinvestmentsinCommonwealth loans. </para>

            <para>-There was some agreement in this respect. The Commonwealth occupies nine floors of the AMP building in Adelaide. An agreement was made for the Australian Taxation Office to rent office space in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> building in Adelaide on the basis that the cost of construction would be paid for in 7&#189; years. I approached <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> who was then the Minister for Services and Property about this. He agreed that something should be done. We were concerned about the size of the rental the Commonwealth was paying to the insurance company and also about clauses in rental agreement which tied up the Commonwealth insofar as every time an alteration had to be made to fittings, such as partitions in the office, the work had to be done by the insurance company&#39;s subcontractor. They were the only people who worked in the building. The insurance company&#39;s sub-contractor had to be accepted by the Commonwealth, whatever his price was, and the price was astronomical. We were paying heavily for every alteration that was made in Commonwealth buildings. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> and I agreed to do something about it. I approached the Department of Works in respect of drawing up plans for the John Bull site in Currie Street, Adelaide. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reiner,</inline> head of the Department of Works, told me that the Department had made investigations a few years previously and that it was not keen on building multi-storey Commonwealth office blocks in congested areas in capital cities because of the number of employees who would be in such an area. The Department some years previously had been offered a site in Adelaide at the old tram depot in Victoria Square, Angus Street, or alternatively a big area at the Richards store on the Anzac Highway at Keswick. He said that the Department would be more interested in getting those sites if they were still available rather than obtaining a site right in the centre of the city. While he was making investigations <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> came to me and said that because of the rent the Commonwealth was paying he thought it should go to the extent of buying a building that was already in the process of being erected. He asked me to defer a decision until such time as the Commonwealth could build its own building which would take about three to five years. He bought the Commonwealth block in King William Street, a new multi-storey building that was then not completed but was being built by private enterprise for the purpose of housing the Taxation Office and some other Commonwealth offices. It is still insufficient. I am pleased to say that the Simpson site is to be the location of the Commonwealth buildings. It is in Wakefield Street which is not such a congested area as </para>
          </talk.start>

        <para class="block">Currie Street. I think it will make a suitable location for Commonwealth offices but speed now is necessary, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> mentioned, in view of what it is costing the Commonwealth to rent offices in which other people have the equity. </para>
        <para>The other thing I want to mention is the low image of Parliament referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. Since I have been in this Chamber I have been proud of the Senate and have tried to raise its prestige as much as I could. Only the other day I objected to the Senate accepting what the other House decided on a matter and said that we should not just accept it. The Senate had some prestige until 1974 when it rejected a money Bill in order to defeat a government. Now the Senate has no prestige in the eyes of the Australian community which declares: You are simply bludging in the Senate. It has no purpose. &#39; It was accepted as a House of review before then; now it is the House that can reject governments. It is the rubber stamp of government and a government cannot operate unless it has a majority in the Senate. Any value it had in the public image has disappeared. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>referred to section 57 of the Constitution dealing with the power of the Senate to reject or to request an alteration in money Bills. I do not know that this section has ever been interpreted as relating to want of confidence in the government. During his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> incorporated material containing a lot of history about what other Parliaments have done but we will not know the value of his speech until we have read it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and have researched the incorporated material. I thought the suggestion contained in that material was that we should try to get some agreement on such Bills. A recognition of the Senate&#39;s power to request amendments lends itself to some agreements. Only today we discussed increased appropriations for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation although we are to set up a new establishment. However, pending that, we will increase the appropriation for the existing organisation which a royal commission found was not a satisfactory organisation, and was one that even acted unlawfully. We are quite within our rights in those circumstances in requesting a reduction of the appropriation of ASIO until such time as a better organisation is set up. I think this would be a reasonable ground for such a request. Perhaps we should have a system of conference by which to determine whether we will appropriate $X this year or reduce the amount by $Y. </para>
        <para>While we always had the power to request amendments or to reject money Bills no one ever accepted that we had the power to dismiss a government. </para>

            <para>-That is right. That was the position and whatever else is said that is the fact. For the first time we found that the Senate had the power to dismiss the elected government of the people and that is a power which the people never thought this Chamber possessed. While that power exists there can never be respect for this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> said that we tried to do the same thing when former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber, and the occasion may arise when the Opposition would try to do the same thing again, but no one can say that that would be correct. Anyone who has the concern of the Senate at heart must advocate an alteration to that section of the Constitution so that when deciding what figure we shall appropriate we cannot again use the power which the Senate assumed and operated under before. The Senate can never regain its prestige and the previous public opinion of it until it abandons the power which it has now. As well as reconsidering the role of the Senate we must look at the powers of the Governor-General whose decision on the operations of the Senate can be superior even to that of both Houses of the Parliament. </para>

          <para>- I intervene again only because three honourable senators have spoken and I do not wish to lose the trend of what they have said. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> again raised the matter of Government expenditure cuts. We are all about to go electioneering and if he intends to advocate as part of his election platform that there ought to be greater government expenditure, I hope he will be honest enough to tell the people where he will get the money. I can tell him now that he can get it from only one of two sources. He can either raise it in taxes or he can print it. There is no other way in which he can get the money. So if he is complaining about the Government&#39;s expenditure cuts and intends saying to the people that the Opposition would reverse them, he should also tell the people how the Opposition would get the money- whether it would raise it by taxation or print it or both. </para>

I do not know what the present Australian Labor Party policy is but, as we are in an election atmosphere, it ought to be clearly made known.

            <para>-I did not quite have the honourable senator in mind. I thank him for reminding me. I am yet to be convinved that people do not understand the preferential voting system. Of course, they do. If they do not understand it, is the whole electoral system to be put into the hands of those who are too stupid to be able to exercise a vote? That is what honourable senators opposite are seeking. In regard to those who are disadvantaged, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> will know, as a result of some prodding from his colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> the Australian Electoral Office is gearing up to do quite a deal of work amongst migrants. That is the way to cure the defect. We should educate those who do not understand the system, not change a system that works well. As some honourable senators would know, the Electoral Office has been doing work amongst the Aboriginals. I hope that next year it will do much more work, especially amongst those two groups in the community. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I hope also that there will be an opportunity to do work in the schools, not necessarily just at the secondary level. I think that, as part of citizenship courses, voting systems ought to be taught early. That is the way to cure defects in the system if they exist. I do not think it is terribly destructive of democracy if somebody has to wait for a week or so to know who has won an election. It is more important to get the right result. I thought that there were a number of defects in the American presidential system in which, as I understand it, theoretically a candidate can receive a majority of the electoral college votes without receiving the majority of the popular votes. Speed is not always necessary in elections. There are very few elections in Australia in which we really do not know who has won government by midnight on Saturday night or 2 o &#39;clock on Sunday morning. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>raised a couple of matters. One was the dwindling importance of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> also adverted to this matter. I rather think that the Senate has improved since I first came to it 12 years agonot because I came here. I would have thought that in recent years the Senate has gained some stature in the community. I think that too many honourable senators underrate the importance and prestige that the Senate has gained, principally through its committee system and not necessarily by indulging in the same mirror-type or sterile debate that takes place in the other place. Honourable senators- including most honourable senators here tonight- work very hard, particularly when working on committees, be they select committees, standing committees or other committees. Only last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume,</inline> on behalf of his committee the Senate </para>
        <para class="block">Standing Committee on Social Welfare, put down a report on drug usage in Australia. Yes, it may be a controversial report. But that does not matter. At least that Senate Committee provided a forum in which many interesting and interested people in Australia could come before it and give evidence on oath. The Committee was able to take that evidence into account and to come to its own conclusions. </para>
        <para>The fact that we are having a different style of Estimates debate from that which occurred when I first came here I think indicates a vast improvement. With all the defects which I think all honourable senators would admit the Senate Estimates committees still have- they are not perfect- they still represent an enormous and vast improvement on the investigation of the Appropriation Bills that occurred prior to the commencement of their operation. I know, and I think all honourable senators know, that the Estimates committees have their defects. I congratulate the committees and the chairmen of them who are working so hard to make them work more and more effectively. One result of the commencement of the Estimates committees has been the establishment of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations under the Chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> As I understand its terms of reference, to some extent that Committee will follow up the matters raised in Estimates committees. </para>
        <para>The committee system in this place is an evolving system. It is one that works by evolution and not by revolution. I am one who has enourmous faith and confidence in this chamber and the work it can do in its committee work. I can see in the future, when most probably I will not be here, the Senate being a quite different place from what it was when I first came here in 1966. It is different now, in 1977. 1 think it will be quite different five to ten years hence. I think the worst thing that could happen to the Senate would be for it to remain static. Institutions that remain too static rot or decay. I think the great strength of the Senate has been that honourable senators on all sides have seen it as an evolving House, a House which ought to play a quite different role perhaps from the traditional role in the parliamentary sense that was envisaged for it for so long. It is a House of the Parliament which has been prepared to launch out on new ideas and on new ventures. </para>
        <para>We want to retain those ancient committees, if I may refer to them in that way- committees such as the Regulations and Ordinances Committee which has been in operation now for more than 40 years and which has proven itself and done an enormous amount of work- that we have inherited. I hope that in 30 or 40 years time honourable senators will be seeing the benefits of the standing committees and Estimates committees which we have established in our time. I do not despair about the the prestige of the Parliament. The matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> in that context I put down as matters of 1975 electioneering. I wish that the honourable senator would come up to date and electioneer in 1977 terms. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>dealt with the way in which the American Congress works. Yes, each house of the Congress has an absolute right over its money Bills once it becomes seized of them, and they nave their conferences. But I would be a little wary about putting too much confidence in that son of system because I understand that it also leads to that interesting system which exists in America and which is known as pork- barrelling. I think that one of the great virtues of the system we have is that so far we have not engaged- I hope we never do- in a pork- barrelling exercise between honourable senators and honourable members in the other place. </para>

        <para>I again return to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> was saying about the Senate. I think it was in 1970 that the then Labor Opposition senators- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> would nave been one of themwith their allies for the day rejected a Budget Bill- a money Bill- which was to raise $68m or $69m under a receipts duties tax. It was part of the Government&#39;s Budget. It was vital to the Government&#39;s legislative program in the normal sense. But honourable senators opposite had no compunction in for political reasons allying themselves with their hated enemies to throw out a Budget Bill or a money Bill. In fact, they gave great reasons for it. </para>

            <para>-No, I thought you would support it. I am always surprised to think that any honourable senator would want to sit in this place and imagine that he had some sort of eternal life here. I believe that if we come here as servants of the people we should be prepared to return to them and, as I said, either be re-elected or put to the sword. </para>

          <para>- I had intended to deal mainly with the matter of passport control, which comes under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs, but I cannot let go unanswered a reference which was made to electoral reform. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> mentioned my views, as did the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> I simply make this observation: Last week when we were dealing with the redistribution of electorates <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> drew a very vivid picture of what would happen if we were to have an election at large. He visualised an enormous ballot paper. I simply say respectfully from the previous experience of more than 50 candidates standing for a Senate election in one State, that unless we can guarantee that there will be fluorescent lighting in every polling booth we will find the frequency of errors rising. I do not think it was good for democracy when well over 12 per cent of the votes were informal. I refuse to accept that they were deliberately informal. We can argue about the IQ of voters, but I think even people with a reasonable education become a bit bored, impatient and so on when so many candidates are listed. If they make an error their vote is nullified. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The best illustration of the reform which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> and I have advocated is the situation which exists with the present very staid civic authorities in the Sydney Town Hall. That certainly is not a socialist administration. In their elections I doubt whether they had more than 11 candidates standing for each ward, but they had optional preferences in a situation where they wanted three aldermen. So I do not think this is a revolutionary proposal. I think the best answer I can give the Minister is to point out that in private conversation with at least three divisional returning officers in New South Wales the officers shuddered at the thought of another field of over 50 candidates. Without arguing about excessive deposits, I believe that every candidate was required to have at least an equivalent number of sponsors to the number required in one electorate in the House of Representatives, but if Senate candidates were required to have at least ten sponsors from each New South Wales division it would mean that at least they had some support. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the main reason for my entering this debate. Perhaps the Minister could up-date for me information in a letter dated 7 October 1977, a copy of which he has in his hand, concerning the famous William Joseph Flynn passport case, which was featured some weeks ago in the weekend Press in Sydney. I emulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and ask that the letter, a copy of which the Minister has in his hand, be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> together with a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maher,</inline> the State member for Drummoyne, in which he seeks information on the role of the Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths. </para>

		<para>Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs Canberra 7 Oct 1977</para>
		<para>Dear Senator,</para>
        <para>I am writing in reply to your letter of 14 September 1977 to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock</inline> about the issue of a passport to a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walter</inline> James Flynn, masquerading as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr William</inline> Joseph Flynn. </para>
        <para>The reply given to you by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock</inline> was never meant to be more than an interim response as at that stage the Department of Foreign Affairs had not had the time to adequately check whether a passport had been issued to Walter James Flynn. </para>
        <para>Investigations have now established that one Walter James Flynn was issued with a passport in Brisbane and there is strong evidence to suggest that he falsely used the identity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flynn</inline> who is a member of the Australian Railways Union. In these circumstances the matter has been referred to the appropriate authorities to see what legal action can be taken in the light of the known circumstances. Australian posts overseas have also been advised that the passport is not valid as it was falsely obtained and all other possible steps will be taken to recover the document from the bearer. </para>
        <para>In reply to your more general question in the Senate the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> that the issue of a passport is subject to certain requirements similar to those which apply elsewhere in the world. So that you will be in no doubt as to what these requirements are I attach a passport application form which sets out the conditions which must be fulfilled before an Australian passport can be issued. You will note that nearly all the requirements are designed to establish the correct identity of the applicant, precisely because a passport should be proof of citizenship and identity, so the bearer, as an Australian, can be assisted in his or her travel, by other Governments. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline>A. Mulvihill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator for</inline> New South Wales. Australian Parliament Offices, Chifley Square, SYDNEY, N.S.W. 2000. </para>
        <para>It may interest you to know that more than 350,000 passports were issued in Australia in 1976 and about 1.2 million passports are believed to be currently valid. Despite the large volume of passports on issue the known incidence of malpractice is extremely small. Successive Governments have maintained under constant review passport procedures with a view to making the documents more difficult to forge or obtain by false pretences. In fact, this whole question has been the subject of a particularly intensive review in the first part of this year by a group of officials, including representatives from Prime Minister and Cabinet, Attorney-Generals, the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Consumer Affairs, and appropriate law enforcement agencies. Particular attention was given in the course of this study to the problem of white collar crime and the control of passports, to prevent those suspected of it from leaving the country. As a result of this examination, which was instigated by the Department of Foreign Affairs, Cabinet will soon be considering proposals to amend the Passports Act, which include harsher penalties and the establishment of permanent committees to keep various aspects under review. </para>
        <para>Additional to this exercise the Department of Foreign Affairs, as a matter of course, follows developments throughout the world for making passports more secure. Where new methods are considered to have reduced malpractice, be it forgery or some other form of falsification, changes will be introduced as practicable. The Department is also introducing new monitoring techniques such as microfiche, visual display units and computer processing which will enable it to exercise even tighter control over passports in the future. </para>
        <para>I was concerned at your unsubstantiated remark to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> to the effect that applicants for passports get the run-around&#39; in Sydney and Brisbane. It is this Government&#39;s wish that the services it offers the public be as efficient, expeditious and as courteous as possible. Therefore, should you have any hard information about problems encountered by applicants in obtaining passports I would be pleased to receive it, so that urgent remedial action can be taken. I am advised, however, that public complaints about passports services are few and that, when these are investigated, many prove to be unwarranted. This of course in no way lessens the Department&#39;s interest in knowing where the service falls down so it can be corrected. </para>
        <para>As you suggested a letter will be sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr William</inline> Joseph Flynn regretting any inconvenience he may have suffered because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walter</inline> James Flynn apparently used his identity to obtain a passport. Even though the issue of the passport was in no way the fault of the passport issuing officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walter</inline> James Flynn having falsely represented himself and misled a reputable witness, you may be assured that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Flynn</inline> of the Australian Railways Union will encounter no difficulties should he apply for a passport. </para>

            <para>- The Minister would know that in that lengthy reply from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Sinclair, which I have incorporated, it was stated that a committee was looking at passport control reform. It was stated also that efforts were being made probably to prosecute somebody for impersonation. I simply ask the Minister whether he is prepared to comment on whether the New South Wales Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths in Sydney might have been lax or, if the Minister is not sure, whether the Registrar&#39;s methods are being checked to see whether they are effective. That is my first plea. </para>

		  <para>The second case I mention, which I think is equally important, has some Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs overtones. I refer to a case in which two Indonesian nationals are facing deportation and a controversy surrounds the fact that they have two children who were born in Australia. I certainly am not going to argue with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> the pros and cons of the deportation as that is a matter which I can deal with with the Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> at a later stage in this debate. But this is a very unusual situation. I have never heard of such a case before. It amazes me that two people who are not citizens of this country but who had children born while they were in transit here were given Australian passports. There might be reasons for this. I think the Minister will agree that perhaps somebody has fumbled the ball. I do not know whether false information was given at the immigration end or perhaps even at the passport section of the Department of Foreign Affairs. But I do think this case merits some explanation of what the real position is. Off the top of my head I always say that if a couple are in Australia and the woman has a child while she is here, that does not make the offspring an Australian citizen. I am open to correction if I am wrong. </para>
          <para>The last matter which I wish to raise deals also with passport control and relates to an answer I received from* the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> to question on notice No. 1 134 relating to a Donald Phillip McMahon of Revesby Heights and Jannette Moule of Penshurst, who were heavily involved in narcotics peddling, which regrettably is becoming a way of life for some people- it is a part of white collar crime. I notice that this answer includes the following statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Both defendants were in possession of Australian passports when arrested. The convictions of both defendants have been drawn to the attention of the Department of Foreign Affairs which, under the Minister, administers the Passports Act 1938. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I just wonder, with all due respect, whether the Minister can indicate to me, in view of the laxity which apparently occurred in the Flynn episode, whether we are rightly applying a heavy hand to people to stop them from using an Australian passport to make money and, in the process, to lead a lot of other people into living a hideous life once they are hooked on drugs. Those are the matters on passport control on which I should like some answers. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I wish briefly to respond to what the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> said about staff ceilings. He dismissed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland &#39;s arguments with a general statement which seemed to indicate that there was no substance in the representations which had been made by staff organisations and by honourable senators, including myself. I think the Minister will probably recall that many questions have been directed to him and to the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> in which we to a large extent supported the arguments of the staff associations which claimed that in many departments staff ceilings which had been applied under the direction of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and reinforced by various Ministers were impeding the work of the departments. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Evidence of that exists in the two glaring cases of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and the Department of Social Security. I think the Minister will recall that I made the claim that the Commonwealth Employment Service was not functioning properly. Following that the Norgard inquiry was set up and later the Myer inquiry. The result was that there was a quite extensive recruitment of labour in the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and finally in the Department of Social Security, after about 18 months of complaints from and action by the unions and from within the Department. An additional 300 staff members were recruited. In addition to that, as the Minister might remember, I brought to the attention of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> the fact that it had been stated in evidence given before the Estimates Committees that on a number of occasions staff ceilings had embarrassed the Industries Assistance Commission. What I am putting to the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> is that staff ceilings, even now with some relaxation, can impede what might be a progress to suitable employment in the Public Service which would absorb a lot of young people who cannot get jobs. They were arbitary ceilings in the first place. They have been relaxed by persuasion and the agitation of staff organisations supported to some extent by the Opposition. I suggest that the Government might well give consideration to relaxing the ceilings again so that more people may be employed in the Public Service. </para>
          <para>I also refer to the case of apprentices. Twelve months ago or more I raised the matter of the employment of apprentices. In all Commonwealth departments the figures on the recruitment of apprentices were lower than they had been in any previous 12 month period. The South Australian Government and some other governments had, in fact, increased the number of apprentices employed. Those numbers were satisfactory. The Government has proposed other measures which have been partly successful. I put to the Government and to the Minister in relation to his own responsibilities that the evidence I have given indicates that the Government might well consider making sure that the staff ceilings do not inhibit the recruitment of skilled staff. Certain staff ceilings have been imposed by an arbitrary action on some statutory corporations such as the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Postal Commission. They have prevented the recruitment of increased numbers of staff by those commissions. </para>
          <para>I shall add one or two points to the saga of the Commonwealth office block in South Australia. It must be 12 years since I raised in the Senate the need for building a Commonwealth centre. Previous Ministers for Works all accepted the need to build a Commonwealth centre. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> the Minister for Works in the previous Liberal-Country Party Government, indicated that approximately $500,000 was being paid in rents by the Commonwealth Government to private organisations in South Australia which, as he well amplified, was unsatisfactory. That amount would now have increased to about Sim a year. I am looking for a continuing commitment by the Government, in addition to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> amplified, that there will be finally in South Australia a Commonwealth centre which will house some of the 27 departments now scattered around the Adelaide metropolitan area. The present facilities are not as convenient as would be provided in a central  building. The Minister&#39;s answer to me today indicated that there is a continuing commitment to that project. I hope that if there is any departure from that commitment he will so indicate. </para>
          <para>There is one other important matter in relation to the Commonwealth office block which was raised by Opposition senators during the period of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. It concerns the Australian Mutual Provident Society building. Our questions prompted an inquiry into the fire hazards of the AMP building in South Australia as a result of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> obtained an opinion from the South Australian Fire Brigade. This is a building of 16 floors. It has a communications system with the South Australian Fire Brigade which is the main resort to fire protection. In recent times it has been amply demonstrated that enclosed staircases and unsatisfactory draughts may well be a smoke and fire hazard. Some of the staff have spoken to me about this matter. I have suggested that they discuss it on a staff basis amongst themselves and that if they want senators from both parties to take up the matter they should let us know. The staff are conscious of the hazards. I do not want to high note the issue but I should like the Minister to give it some examination, including the advice which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> received in respect of the opinion of the South Australian Fire Brigade when he was Minister for Works. </para>

            <para>- I pursue further the remarks I made earlier on the question of staff ceilings. They have been subsequently supplemented by my colleagues <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> On the expiration of the first 15 minutes in which I spoke I referred to a reply to question No. 984 on 16 August. The Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> stated that since 1 January 1976 a total of 553 offices of the Department of Administrative Services have been abolished. On page 120 of the report of Senate Estimates Committee A there is a table headed &#39;Summary of Vacancies Public Service Act. Staff Department of Administrative Services (excluding Australian Electoral Office and National Library)&#39;. The total number of vacancies throughout Australia to which I previously referred is 682, some 320 of them being in the Australian Capital Territory. When those figures were placed in front of the Minister he responded by saying that the Public Service is under challenge and that, unquestionably, we have a Public Service which is now down to an efficient level. The Minister challenged the Labor Party to say that it will increase the size of the Public Service. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I shall cite one or two instances of which the Minister should take cognisance. After all, he is responsible for the administration of the National Library. In its annual report for 1976-77 the National Library Council outlined the effects that staff ceilings are having on the Library and the concern it feels about the long term consequences of such actions. It said: </para>

          <para class="block">This is one area of administration for which the Minister is responsible to the Parliament yet he has the audacity to say that the Public Service is not being impaired in efficiency as a result of the staff ceilings.

          <para class="block">That report was dated 30 June 1977 and yet, if one turns to the Budget papers presented to this Parliament last August, one sees a statement on page 16 as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Since 30 June 1975 the number of public servants in employment areas covered by staff ceilings has fallen by about 12,500. The staff ceilings now set for 30 June 1978 imply a further reduction of over 3,000- or about one per cent- during 1977-78. </para>

          <para class="block">In the light of the statement of the National Library that its efficiency is being impaired, in the light of the Public Service Board&#39;s statement that efficiency is being impaired, if the Minister wants to go to the Australian public and say he believes that irrespective of the efficiency or otherwise of the Public Service there has to continue to be a reduction in staff in order to keep down government expenditure, and thus deprive young school leavers of job opportunities, that is a matter for him. I say here and now that when the Labor movement gets on to the hustings it will not be saying what the Minister is saying now. </para>
          <para>Having responded on that matter, I come to division 161 of the Estimates, relating to the appropriation for the National Library. In this year&#39;s Budget although there was, I believe, an addition of some $400,000 to the budget of the National Library, in real terms this year the Library&#39;s budget was cut by about $ 1.2m- taking inflation into account- as compared with that for last year. As set out in the annual report of the National Library, this cut in funding has necessitated drastic cutbacks in staff levels during the present Government&#39;s term in office. The existing staff ceiling is 710, which is 1 19 below the establishment of 829, but the actual reduction in staff during the last two years is difficult to gauge, as previous figures for staff levels have been unavailable. However, the effects these cutbacks had on the functioning of the National Library were made very clear in the departmental explanations prepared for Senate Estimates Committee A. If one goes to page 414 of the explanatory notes on the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services one sees there the statement that because of shortage of funds the hours of work have in recent years been reduced, resulting in considerable criticism, despite the care that is taken to ensure, in selecting noun of opening, that the least inconvenience possible is caused to users. </para>
          <para>There is an admission that, because of shortage of funds, the hours of opening have in recent years had to be reduced. As I have mentioned already, the annual report of the National Library Council for 1976-77 outlines the effect of staff cutbacks on the work of the Library and the concern of the Council about the long term consequences of such action. On pages eight and 15 the annual report of the National Library for 1976-77 states that: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Council is concerned that the Library&#39;s accommodation is seriously inadequate and considers that additional space is required urgently. An increasing part of the National collection is being housed in corridors and other unsatisfactory areas where it is subject to loss and damage. In many instances the material is irreplaceable. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A committee of inquiry was established and has taken evidence on the needs of public libraries throughout Australia. That report was commissioned by the Whitlam Labor Government and was tendered to the present Government in April 1976. It pointed out all of the things pointed out by the National Library Council in its annual report to the Parliament. The Horton Committee which inquired into national libraries said that as a matter of urgency, if not extreme urgency, the sum of $ 19.6m had to be made available in the ensuing financial year in order to get things underway and ensure that the circumstances subsequently reported to the Parliament by the National Library Council were remedied. That Committee was appointed in March 1975 and chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> A. Horton who was, I believe, the chief librarian of the University of New South Wales. Special efforts were made to complete the Committee&#39;s work early in 1976 so that a beginning on its moderate and responsible proposed 10-year program could be made in planning for the 1976-77 Budget. In its report the Committee stated that it hoped that its proposed public libraries and information council and State joint committees would be set up not later than 30 June 1976 to plan allocation of the suggested provision of $ 19.9m in the 1976-77 Budget. The fact is that the public libraries of Australia received no allocation of funds from this Government either in the 1976-77 Budget or the 1977-78 Budget. </para>
          <para>On 9 March 1977 I gave notice that I would move in this Parliament under the heading of General Business that, in the opinion of the Senate, there had been a failure of the Government to act on the Horton Committee&#39;s recommendations and the subject should be considered as a matter of urgency. Additionally, of course, numerous questions have been asked in an effort to obtain some statement from the Government as to its. views on the Committee&#39;s recommendations. I raised the subject only a fortnight ago and in effect the Minister said in response, &#39;Well, committees of this nature do make recommendations as to the way in which money should be expended but not as to the way in which money should be raised&#39;. All the Committee is doing is asking for a mere $ 19.9m to be spent in one financial year and for such expenditure to be continued over a period of 10 years to enable libraries throughout Australia to be brought up to date and to standards comparable with those enjoyed by people of other nations throughout the world. The Government&#39;s failure to act upon the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries is scandalous and certainly will be used against it by the Labor movement and the people of Australia when they cast their votes at the forthcoming Federal election. </para>

              <para>-I think we had a great debate on optional preference in this chamber in the 1974-75 period. There is an argument for it. I have no doubt that the Commonwealth Electoral Office would like to have it as it would make its task easier. But, after all, the idea of having an election is to make certain that the right government is elected and not to make things easier for anybody in the community. Some people want to put crosses on their ballot papers and others want to have photographs on them. What is wrong with the present system? I think it works well. People understand it. We do not get the distortionsin our electoral system that occur in other electoral systems. It certainly is not uncommon in the United Kingdom, with its first past the post system, for a party to get 60 per cent of the seats with 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the votes. </para>

              <para>-I would not know about that. Let us talk about the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which is legislation for which I am responsible. Rarely does it not return a government according to the wishes of the electorate. As I think I said many times in Opposition, between 1949 and 1975, with the exception of one occasion, the party or parties that obtained the greatest number of votes gained office. The exception was the 1954 election, which the Australian Labor Party should have won. It was held on the boundaries that the Labor Party drew up in 1948; so it had no reason for complaint. After all, the election was held on its boundaries and the funny way in which it drew them. Apart from that oddity, all the House of Representatives elections from 1949 to 1975 showed that the party or parties that obtained the greatest popular vote attained or retained office. </para>

              <para>-The honourable senator is quite right. No matter which walk of life one looks at, there is not one group of people in Australia who would not like to have more bodies and more money. Whether one looks at the public sector or the private sector and no matter what endeavour of life one may like to imagine, there is not one group of people in the community who would not say: &#39;If only we had more people and more money we would be better&#39;. I doubt the accuracy of that statement. I do not believe that it is necessarily true. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland that he should not make over-much of the figures he quoted earlier. For a start, he ought to realise that there was a reorganisation in the Department of Administrative Services, which was formed out of a number of other departments. I have responsibility for parts of the former Department of the Media, parts of the former Department of Services and Property and parts of the former Department of the Special Minister of State, as well as other bodies within the Department of Administrative Services. A reorganisation took place and functions as well as bodies were dispensed with. That ought to be remembered. If one is not carrying out functions one does not need the bodies to do them. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As to the figures that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland has been using concerning the number of vacancies, I say to the honourable senator that there are always vacancies in the Public Service. Vacancies are caused by deaths, resignations and transfers. No government department since 1900 has been without vacancies. I understand that the number of vacancies in a department at any one time could be anywhere between 5 per cent and 7 per cent. When somebody who has applied for a job is successful in his application and leaves his former job the former job has to be advertised before it can be filled. It could remain vacant for some time. If one went to any department at any time during the week and asked whether it had vacancies one would find that it had vacancies. One does not fill those vacancies just by pulling people from the market place outside. They are normally vacancies that will be filled from within the Public Service by people transferring to them and thereby creating other vacancies. I think there is a misunderstanding of what happens within the Public Service. There has been talk about the Department of Administrative Services having 600 vacancies. The Department is made up of all sorts of bodies and probalbly would have about 1 1 ,000 people in it. It is nothing for it to have 600 vacancies because of deaths, retirements and transfers both within the Department and between departments. </para>
          <para>I ought also to inform the Senate that the staff ceilings are not the problem. One of the main problems is to find the right people to fill existing positions. There seems to be some peculiar idea around that, if there is a shortage of people in the Commonwealth Employment Service, all of a sudden one can find 200 people who are expert in the matters covered by it. One does not just take the first 200 people off the street and say: You are now experts. You can be competent Commonwealth Employment Service officers&#39;. One has to recruit them and train them. Somehow or other, I think there is a total misunderstanding around the place about how the members of the Public Service are both recruited and trained. It is only natural that the Public Service Board should say what it said. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland were to put a fair and reasonable interpretation upon what the Board said he would find that the Board was only saying what any employer in the public or private sector would be saying in the same circumstances, namely: &#39;There are peaks in the work load when people are put under pressure. There are most probably periods when things are a bit slack. There are periods when we are not doing as well as we might because the staff ceiling is a bit hard there, but the matter of staff is always a matter of adjustment? I think all honourable senators would know from their experience in this place that at times enormous work loads are put upon them. </para>
          <para>As to the matters raised about the National Library, I imagine that if the National Library had twice the money and three times the building it has it then would be asking for ten times the money to buy collections to fill that building. It is an ever-evolving situation. I come back to what I said earlier: If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland &#39;s party is going out to campaign on filling up the Public Service and expanding the Public Service, it is welcome and entitled to do so; but, in all decency, it should tell us from where it is going to get the money. Is it going to get it from taxes or is it going to print it? Those are the only two options. </para>

              <para>1 ) When motor vehicle registration fees in the ACT were increased recently the opportunity was taken to introduce a flat original registration fee of$81 and a flat renewal fee of $56 for all motor vehicles up to 2 tonnes in weight. This was a break with the tradition that registration fees for all vehicles be proportional to weight. This assumed that owners of larger vehicles had the ability to pay higher charges and that the heavier the vehicle the greater the wear and tear on roads. </para>

          <para>The traditional approach has not recognised that the size or cost of a motor car has no relevance to the level of traffic management and enforcement required by a community nor the resources needed to carry out registration procedures. </para>

              <para>and (3) Neither the flat first registration fee nor the renewal fee are considered to be significant factors affecting purchasing decisions when compared with the original price of a vehicle and other costs such as comprehensive and third party insurance, annual running and maintenance. The action taken is not expected to affect trends towards smaller cars and consequently the interests of energy conservation in transport should not be affected. </para>

            <para>In my answer to question No. 388 I also stated that there were several precedents for bringing persons skilled in various fields to Canberra for receptions in Parliament House. By way of example I mention that the previous Government brought artists and a dance band to Canberra, without calling public tenders, for the reception following the opening of the 28th Parliament on 27 February 1 973 at a cost of $6,269 which was far higher than the cost of bringing floral decorators to Canberra for the reception for The Queen earlier this year. </para>

            <para>Section 1 6 of the Pig Industry Research Act 1971, requires the Pig Industry Research Committee to make a report to the Minister on the operation of the Act and the Minister is required to cause the report to be laid before each House of Parliament. Those requirements were met for the years ending 30 June 1974 and 30 June 1975 by the Committee&#39;s submitting to the Minister and his laying before each House of Parliament an interim annual report. </para>
            <para>The report referred to by the honourable senator as having been tabled on 8 September 1977 is the so-called final report. This is in bound form and contains information on the progress of research projects and other material of a reference nature. Although it was submitted to each House of Parliament, the statutory obligation had already been fulfilled by tabling of an interim report. </para>
            <para>The Committee decided some years ago that its final reports should include summaries of research progress as a means of communicating information to pig producers. It has taken a considerable time to obtain appropriate summaries from all research workers. The Committee&#39;s limited resources to undertake technical editing have caused further delays in finalising the reports. These delays have now been overcome. </para>

          <para>The Australian medical workforce, however, has traditionally included a significant proportion of doctors who qualified overseas. For example, the report of the Committee on Medical Schools &#39;Expansion of Medical Education&#39; estimated that in 1972 some 24 per cent of the doctors in active practice in Australia had graduated in overseas countries. </para>
          <para>While available statistics suggest that there has since been some increase in the total number of doctors immigrating to Australia, the relative proportion of these within the total active medical workforce is not known to have significantly increased. The output from Australian medical schools has also increased in the period. </para>
          <para>Even though statistics are not available, there are some indications which suggest that there is less difficulty in attracting to rural and other high need areas doctors who qualified overseas than doctors who have graduated from Australian medical schools. </para>
