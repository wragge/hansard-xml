            <para>That the United Nations, in apparent illegality, has imposed many restrictions and sanctions upon Rhodesia which has been remarkably free from the bloodshed and turmoil of northern and central African lands, even to the extent now of actively encouraging armed conflict against the legally elected Government of Rhodesia. </para>
            <para>Lord Graham as Minister of External Affairs and Defence had said: &#39;International communism is our enemy, all this talk of political advancement and majority rule is no more than a smokescreen in the early skirmishes of an assault upon the whole of Africa . . . It is even difficult to see this enemy because it is not merely attacking us, but on a broad front is attacking the whole world order, its standards, its law and order, its moralities, its churches, its patriotisms, its philosophies and even much of its learning . . . &#39; </para>
            <para>That Communist Chinese infiltration in much of Africa over many years, and Cuban Communist troops reported to number 25 000 are dominating nearby Angola, and possess modern missiles etc. </para>
            <para>It is urgent that Mozambique, now under Communist domination and which has a common border with Rhodesia, does not receive any further aid from the Commonwealth Government of Australia, which has benefited mainly, the terrorist guerilla movements that are responsible for the deaths of many Rhodesian people. </para>
            <para>It is urgent for the Australian people to determine for themselves, the actual facts of the Rhodesian struggles. </para>
            <para>It is urgent that the Senate and the House Representatives in the Parliament assembled, will observe common justice and proper humanity by inviting only authorised representatives of the present Government of Rhodesia to Australia, to do what they have been deprived to do previously, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested, without interference, and so that the eventual impact on Australia&#39;s own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. </para>

Is it a fact that many organisations have applied to the Government for funds to run vacation programs for children during the May school holidays? Is it a fact that these organisations have not received notification of whether they will receive funds? Is the Minister aware that in all States the school vacation starts within the next few weeks? If the answer to the first 2 parts of the question is yes, how can the Minister expect these groups to plan activity programs when they receive such short notice of whether they will be funded? </para>

Hundreds of applications have been received from organisations which conducted programs during the last vacation, and from new organisations. It has been necessary to decide the priorities which would be accepted. These announcements will be made to all organisations within the next day or two. </para>

            <para>-As the honourable senator was asking his question evidently I got a volunteer from an old fossil, in an interjection, to go into the proposed museum. As the honourable senator knows, there is a proposal for a national museum of history to be established in Canberra. This was one of the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry on Museums and National Collections set up by the previous Government. The honourable senator will recall that I announced in the Senate that last year I arranged for the site proposed for the national museum to be provisionally reserved for that purpose. I certainly wrote to the Minister for the Capital Territory and I think I also wrote to the National Capital Development Commission. I understand that the NCDC has agreed not to release the site for any other purpose. Whilst the NCDC cannot reserve the site absolutely, it has decided not to release it for any other purpose in the meantime. In relation to the ongoing recommendations concerning a national museum, the honourable senator will understand that that is a matter which the Government will take into consideration with all its other programs in the forthcoming Budget. On Budget night we will know one way or the other. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Northern Territory. Did the Minister write to the Minister for National Resources indicating his concern that uranium mining in the Northern Territory would be obstructed by the possible national park boundaries and Aboriginal land rights claims? If so, in the light of the letter&#39;s implication, will the Minister table it for the information of this chamber and of the public? I further ask: If the letter indicates that the Minister is advocating that the Federal Government break its election promises on the environment and on Aboriginal affairs in order to push ahead with uranium mining in the Northern Territory, does not this pre-empt any recommendations which may be made by the second report of the Fox inquiry? If not, why not? Has the Minister had similar correspondence with the Ministers for Environment, Housing and Community Development and Aboriginal Affairs respectively? If so, what were their replies? </para>

            <para>-Mr Old of the Western Australian Government wrote to me in March of this year in relation to this matter and I responded to him. Grasses and weeds are a problem. Certainly this is a matter for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to pursue as its resources allow. Honourable senators will know that on a variety of occasions problems associated with parthenium weed in the Northern Territory and certainly annual ryegrass have developed, not only in Western Australia and the Northern Territory but also in other States. I am not aware of the matters referred to by the honourable senator in relation to the incidence of death of stock from the consumption of annual ryegrass but I will make that aspect my interest. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is difficult to offer any assistance for research into annual ryegrass. Research is continuing within the Division of Land Resources Management in Western Australia. The honourable senator will know that 3 former divisions- that is, the Division of Land Research, the Division of Plant Industry and the Division of Soils- were combined to form the Division of Land Resources Management in 1973. This has meant that that Division has concentrated more on matters related to the environmental management and the social implications of land resources policy and management, and the management of agricultural resources. There are certain scientists within CSIRO who are concentrating their work at the moment on annual ryegrass. There has been an endeavour to find an alternative grass to annual ryegrass but at present none has been found. In relation to the other aspect of the honourable senator&#39;s question, I have been unable to make any variation to the staffing of </para>
          <para>CSIRO but I will make this a point for discussion immediately. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of the problem which for many small firms is quite a serious problem. In some cases it stops them getting the necessary remedy for the problem they have. It adds very considerably to their difficulties and I think it is a wise suggestion that some method of testing what is required and of giving them some facility to present their information is desirable. One of the reasons I got the Industry Advisory Council working on draft reports was so that at that stage we could at least make life easier for people who do not have the resources to meet the tests. What the honourable senator suggests is something on which I have begun work. I will not say any more than that except that this work is in the direction of trying to get a ready reckoner arrangement to determine what is wanted, what will need to be done and to advise where these people can get help rather than that they should have to do it all for themselves. </para>

It is provided that he must also satisfy the DirectorGeneral that his unemployment is not due to his being a direct participant in a strike. Apart from those matters which I have raised and the other provisions within the Act, I am unable to comment further on any members of the Transport Workers Union.

I draw his attention to these facts: The 1976 Budget Papers estimated the cost to revenue of the 40 per cent investment allowance in 1 977-78 to be $600m. In the last couple of months the Treasurer and his  deputy  have stated that it will be $500m. And the official text of the Prime Minister&#39;s address to a Liberal Party dinner in Sydney on 4 April last states that it will be $450m. I ask: Does the difference between the original estimate of $600m and the present estimate of $450m mean that the allowance has failed to stimulate investment as the Government expected? If not, what is the explanation? </para>

            <para>-To the best of my knowledge, the activity that the investment allowance has stimulated has been greater than expected. I can get for the honourable senator the precise figure of increase in investment in plant in industry as the product, in many cases, of the investment allowance. The difference in the estimates of the amount that will be paid by the end of June this year is accounted for by the different points of time taken by people who have been making these estimates. In some cases they have made estimates of what will be the final position and in some cases they have made their estimates on the expenditure to date. The final result will not be known until the Budget Papers come out and show last year&#39;s full expenditure. When that happens the honourable senator will know as much as I do. </para>

            <para>-I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: With the continuing oil tanker drivers&#39; strike in Victoria and the continued seamen&#39;s ban on oil tankers berthing at Port Stanvac in South Australia for the discharging of crude oil for the South Australian refinery, are reports correct that indicate that less than 14 days&#39; petrol supplies are held now in South Australia? If the strike or ban in South Australia continues and endangers the functioning of essential services as well as affecting adversely the jobs of innocent and conscientious workers, will the Government declare a state of emergency to make sure that crude oil will be delivered to the refinery so that the welfare of innocent people will not be placed in jeopardy by a few radicals who seem to have no concern for either the welfare of the community or the economy generally? </para>

            <para>-I am not advocating anything. I simply point out that the essential services within a State are a matter for the respective State government. As I understand it, a number of State governments have legislative power to declare a state of emergency. This is a power which the Commonwealth Government does not possess. Therefore, these are matters which must be resolved at Premier-State government level. Naturally, they are matters which concern the Commonwealth Government in the overall aspect. It naturally concerns the Commonwealth Government that quite innocent people are thrown out of work needlessly; that the community is disrupted; that, due to lack of petroleum products, there could be serious problems in our hospitals, our ambulance services and our fire services; and that life could becould be, I say- exposed to risk. Therefore, because we have a continuing interest in the wellbeing of the Australian community, naturally we are desirous that the Premiers and State governments take these matters in hand. But I repeat that the provision of essential services is primarily a matter for State Premiers and State governments. They and they alone have the constitutional legislative power to implement legislation as to essential services. </para>

            <para>-Does the Minister representing the Prime Minister agree that the proposed wage-price freeze discriminates against workers in this country due to the fact that wages have not been adjusted for price rises in the March quarter of this year? Does the Minister agree that a wage freeze instituted for 3 months would mean an effective wage pause of 7  months, whereas price increases would be frozen, in many instances, for only 3 months? Will the Minister agree that such a prolonged wage pause will lead to greatly diminished living standards of workers, especially in the context of decisions on less than full indexation taken over the past year? </para>

            <para>-I do not agree with anything that the honourable senator said because obviously he is out of touch with community demand, which is that there ought to be a wageprice pause for at least 3 months. Whilst, as the honourable senator says, wages have not been adjusted for a certain period, by the same token within this pause a number of prices will not be adjusted within the same area. There were price rises, both governmental and in the private sector, in the pipeline and they were frozen off immediately on 13 April, I think it was, and I thought that the whole purpose of having a national conference was to work out the anomalies which would arise from that. The Government is still anxious to have all parties agree to a wage-price pause and then to have a conference to sort out the details of the implementation of the pause and the anomalies which may arise thereunder. That has been a constant stand of the Government ever since the Prime Minister and the 6 Premiers made their call. Therefore I do not agree with any of the propositions put forward by the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>-As to the first 2 parts of the question, I am not aware of the position but I shall obtain the information. The honourable senator asks why the contracts were let to private contractors. As he would know from his own experience, the Australian Government Publishing Service attempts to get the best deal in respect of price and the time of delivery, and I should imagine that is why it let the contracts to private contractors. As to the second Fox report, there has been a rumour- it is no higher than thatcurrent for some time that the report is with the Government Printer. The last information I received on this matter, which was, I think, on Friday of last week, was that that was not true. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox and his colleagues, as I understood it then, had not finished their editing of their report and the AGPS does not have the full text of the report.  His  Honour did indicate to the AGPS when the full text might be delivered. The AGPS is under instructions to have that report printed and distributed as early as possible. It has looked both within the public sector and the private sector to see how soon the report can be produced. I shall most likely make a decision that the sector which can produce the report at the earliest will get the contract irrespective of cost because I know that many people in the community are anxious to receive it. I do not give that as a firm undertaking, but it is a matter at which I am looking. I hope that once the text of the report is with the AGPS the report will be in the hands of the public as soon as we are able to print it. Some of the quotations which we received from the private sector are, we believe, far too long as to time of delivery. The Government Printer has been asked whether he will look, as a special effort, at the whole of his operation to see whether he can give us a short time frame in which to produce the report after the full text is delivered. That is what we are looking at at the moment. I repeat: The Government&#39;s desire is to get that report into the hands of the community as soon as we are able to print it. We do not care overmuch whether it is printed in the private sector or the public sector, as long as the people at large can obtain the report as quickly as possible. </para>

Since that time, the honourable senator will recall that during the sittings of the Estimates Committees, questions relating to that subject were asked. I now ask the Minister: Can he state what is the position at the present time with the Tribunal? Is it still being embarrassed by lack of staff or appointments? How can it perform a stronger role if the situation remains as it was last year? </para>

What action has been taken to ensure the implementation of the findings of a marine court of inquiry, under the control of Justice Evatt, which recommended a new code in regard to fighting fires which involved petroleum products? Will we issue an ultimatum to the offending oil companies to modernise their tankers and introduce crew tuition to combat petroleum fires? If any company operating oil tankers is reluctant to introduce a new code, will we use the Navigation Act and ban its operations on the Australian coastline? </para>

This report primarily consisted of a series of further questions that the OECD had worked out following its investigations. During the tour of the OECD representatives I had the privilege of having two discussions with them. The report was given in a very preliminary way at first. There was to be a second and more detailed report. I think this is either just to hand or about to come to hand. A study of the preliminary findings is being undertaken by a policy group- a senior group- of my Department. I will look at the question whether the report should be made public. If it is at all possible to have it published I see no reason why that should not be done. It is a matter of very great concern to all people and I will certainly have it published. </para>

            <para>-No, I think the inquiry is continuing. In any event there is a freeze on medical fees until 1 January 1978. Therefore, the question does not arise. As I understand it- I am calling on memory here- the Australian Medical Association at least has agreed that there will be no fee increases during the calendar year 1977. Therefore, the wage pause of 3 months does not apply to this operation. </para>

I am concerned with his answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> on 13 April to the effect that some Government wage rises had been in the pipeline and that they were immediately cancelled. Is there a defence ordinance which gives big pay increases to the academics of the defence Services retrospective to June of last year? If the 1 5 days for disallowance has not expired, does the Government intend to move on the disallowance of that ordinance? Was there tabled in the Senate last week a decision of a salaries tribunal to increase the salary of the  chairman  of a committee, and is it the Government&#39;s intention to disallow that increase? </para>

            <para>-The question is somewhat similar to other questions raised relating to the control of weeds within the Commonwealth. The proposition put forward by the honourable senator will receive my attention. Ragwort is one of the weeds which persist in various parts of the Commonwealth. As indicated on previous occasions, it has not been possible for the CSIRO to take up every project associated with the elimination of a particular weed. It is concentrating its work in other areas which I have mentioned previously. If there were a request from a State government, and certainly if that government offered financial support for a particular line of science, I can assure the honourable senator that the matter would be taken up and an attempt would be made to meet that government&#39;s wishes. </para>

Is the Minister aware that this breakdown has resulted in recipients receiving 2 cheques each fortnight which, in turn, means that pensioners in some cases are receiving embarrassing requests to refund overpayments? In view of these facts, can the Minister give an assurance that the staff ceiling operating in her Department will be lifted to ease the work load on staff and so expedite the working of her Department? </para>

            <para>- The items canvassed in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of the date mentioned by the honourable senator were pure speculation. I think probably 3 items were mentioned in the article to which he referred. None of those had any basis in fact. As far as the Social Security Appeals Tribunal are concerned, I have been enlarging the number who serve on these tribunals to expedite the hearing of appeals of social security pensioners and beneficiaries. I believe it is very important that we have an adequate system of appeal in respect of matters under the Social Security Act. I have decided and have announced that when we implement fully the Administrative Appeals Tribunals we will take those decisions with which the Director-General does not agree and which emanate from the Social Security Appeals Tribunals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunals, to give a full system of appeal under the Social Security Act. So I can give to the honourable senator the assurance that I favour the operation of a social security appeals tribunal system. I have been enlarging the system to facilitate its operations. Any matters which have been written on or about which there has been speculation to the contrary are without foundation. </para>

            <para>- We have a 3-year program under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act and a certain amount was set aside for the Spastic Welfare Association of Western Australia. Negotiations are at present being conducted between my Department and the Association to reach agreement on some of the proposals of the Association for which there will be funding. Under the Act there is a subsidy of $4 for every $ 1 spent by any voluntary association where the project has been approved by my Department. As I understand it, the Spastic Welfare Association has a large project in view, some of which will involve other departments such as the Department of Education. It is a matter of negotiating with the Association as to what use it will make of the funds which have been allocated under the 3-year program. The subsidy is $4 for $ 1 but on the amount which is approved by the Department and not necessarily on the total amount raised by any association. Such commitment cannot be made because many associations have more than $ 1 m which they may have raised by telethons, for example. It may not be possible in any one Budget or in any one program to match the amount fully by a $4 for $ 1 subsidy but that part of the program to which we can give approval is subsidised at the rate of $4 for $ 1 . </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Social Security: Has there been a request from officers of her Department in Adelaide for an additional 1 16 personnel to meet staff shortages? Is there a delay of up to 6 weeks in processing applications for pensions, particularly in the Alice Springs area? Has the number of mistakes in processing documents doubled over the last few months and has this increased the over-payment of social security benefits? </para>

            <para>- I am unaware of any doubling of mistakes in South Australia or in my Department generally and I am not aware of the specific number of weeks for which there is delay in processing applications in Alice Springs. However, as I stated earlier in the Senate in answer to questions, I am aware that there has been a longer delay in Alice Springs than there has been in general but I cannot confirm the specific number of weeks that has been mentioned. There have been some difficulties in South Australia and Western Australia with regard to members of the Department who are members of the Administrative and Clerical Officers&#39; Association and discussions are to be held tomorrow in Canberra with the First Assistant Commissioner of the Public Service Board concerned with employment conditions, and others with regard to some of the difficulties which are being experienced by the Department. There have been difficulties in filling available positions and there have been delays in some areas. I have some information with regard to this but perhaps it might be appropriate to make a more definitive statement on the matters that have been canvassed after the discussions have been completed tomorrow. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Looking at full-time staff figures for the Department as a whole, in December 1976 there were 8934 members, in January 1977 there were 9038 and in February 1977 there were 9203. So although there has been some delay in finding suitable persons to fill positions we have had that somewhat steady increase in staff numbers, but this does not overcome some of the difficulties which are noticed in South Australia and Western Australia in particular. I regret the sort of situation that is occurring in some offices of the Department where decisions are being taken by officers not to handle certain matters, correspondence or inquiries. I have had an inquiry from the member for Collie in Western Australia today who regrets that he has been advised that the Department would not be able to handle his correspondence. There has been a decision that inquiries from members of Parliament and Ministers will not be handled but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones,</inline> M.L.A., the member for Collie, points out and as we would all be aware, there are disabled pensioners and people generally in every electorate who are unable to write due to frailty and other causes and a decision by the staff of the Department of Social Security not to handle inquiries from members of Parliament will create difficulties for those people who are reliant upon the Department&#39;s work for their entitlements and the assistance they wish to receive. However, having said that, in view of the discussions which are to be held tomorrow, it may be appropriate that I defer giving any further information until after those discussions held. </para>

        <para class="block">This matter was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on 31 March 1977. Within the following week the Committee invited the members of the Senate who had spoken on the Bill to make submissions to the Committee by 1 8 April 1 977. In the event, by 19 April the Committee had received only 2 submissions, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan.</inline> After the Committee had completed its report on Thursday, 21 April, it received a submission, on the following day, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> Most members of the Committee have this day had the opportunity individually to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> comments but they do not believe that they call for any alteration to the recommendations now made. Some of the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> have already been dealt with in the report. Specifically, we do not see any inconsistency or conflict with the provisions of the Crimes Act to which he refers. </para>
        <para>In the course of its inquiry the Committee considered the matters raised in the other submissions before it and also the matters raised in debate in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Briefly, the principal recommendations of the Committee are, first, that the word government&#39; appearing in clause 6 should be defined. The Committee was aware that it would not be possible, however, to cover all situations by this definition but believed nevertheless that an attempt should be made to define &#39;government&#39;. The Committee also considered inconsistencies in the Bill which were brought to light in debate in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. The Committee recommends that clause 6 should be amended to provide that persons serving with the armed forces of a government or persons serving with a force approved by the Minister pursuant to clause 9 (2) of the Bill should not be liable for penalties for acts done during the course of their services with that force. In the report the Committee has stated that it believes that the Government should determine which, if any, of the acts specified in clause 7 should be permitted in Australia by persons fighting abroad in forces approved by the Minister pursuant to clause 9 (2). As the report is quite short, the body of the report being only 6 pages, I do not feel it necessary for me at this stage to detail the other recommendations of the Committee. </para>

          </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill now before the Senate is to give effect to the Government&#39;s decision to accord increased assistance to the automatic data processing equipment industry in Australia by way of a scheme for payment of bounty on the production of specified equipment and parts. The Bill provides, with several exceptions with which I will deal later, for implementation of the recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report No. 96 of 18 August 1976 on ADP equipment and parts. The Commission&#39;s recommendation that the manufacture in Australia of ADP equipment and parts which, if imported, fall to item 84.53 and subitem 92.12.1 of Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Customs Tariff Act 1966 be further assisted by bounty has been accepted by the Government, except as it relates to cathode ray tube display terminals. Production in Australia of cathode ray tube display terminals is an area of high technology which has continued to develop under the existing tariff of 24 per cent and Australian producers have demonstrated their ability in the fields of manufacture and design by supplying the market with terminals specially suited to </para>
          <para>Australian requirements. Accordingly, the Government has decided to maintain the present tariff protection in regard to these display terminals rather than bring such manufacture within the bounty scheme on the same footing as for other ADP equipment as the Commission recommended. </para>
          <para>This Bill provides for the manufacture of eligible ADP equipment and parts, which are at present dutiable at 6 per cent, to be further assisted by bounty for 7 years on a decreasing scale which provides for each of the first 3 years of the scheme bounty equivalent to 20 per cent of the value added in Australia by ADP equipment manufacturers; for the next 2 years- 15 per cent of the value added and for the remaining 2 years- 7.5 per cent of value added. The production of ADP equipment is a high technology industry. Local production is currently confined to cathode ray tube display terminals and a limited range of certain other peripherals. Future production will probably continue to centre on peripheral equipment and small systems. The Government has decided that the industry should have the opportunity to develop further in these areas where it can operate with moderate levels of assistance. By proposing the bounty assistance I have outlined, the Government has accepted the view expressed by the Industries Assistance Commission that duly augmented by bounty assistance for these goods is preferable to a uniform tariff alone. This form of assistance should help maximise the use of computers in Australia, give local manufacturers the time and opportunity to identify and establish low cost production capabilities and obtain acceptance of their products. Because the ADP industry is subject to rapid technological change the Government has decided that the assistance accorded the industry be reviewed in 5 years, rather than in 7 years as recommended by the Commission, and that consideration be given to including the software sector in the review. </para>
          <para>The action proposed by the Bill should provide assistance to the industry in planning for the future and will allow users access to the latest and best computer technology at, or near, world prices to the benefit of both Australian industry and the community as a whole. Clause 22 of the Bill continues the Government&#39;s policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect rights or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>The purpose of the Bill now before the Senate is to give effect to the Government&#39;s decision to provide assistance to the manufacture in Australia of printed polyester- cotton bed sheeting. Following advice received from the Textiles Authority in its report No. 89 of 1 8 June 1 976 on sheets, curtains, etc., and the Industries Assistance Commission in its interim report No. 97 of 27 August 1976 on fabrics for use as bed sheeting, pillow casing or bolster casing, it has been decided to accord assistance by means of a bounty scheme providing for payment to the manufacturer of a bounty of 20 cents per square metre on sheeting of cotton admixture with not less than 20 per cent of man-made fibres which such manufacturer weaves, prints and makes up into bed linen in his own manufacturing establishment in Australia during a period within which the bounty scheme is in effect. </para>
          <para>The bounty which this Bill proposes is seen by the Government as according short-term assistance only. The question of long-term assistance for the manufacture of sheeting and a wide range of other textile and apparel items is currently under review by the Industries Assistance Commission. It is anticipated that the Commission&#39;s report in that regard will be made towards the end of this year. Because of the short-term nature of the bounty proposal, provision has been made for the scheme to operate on a year-by year basis, for the amount available for payment as bounty not to exceed $500,000 in any yearly period and for the bounty scheme to be able to be quickly wound up, as provided for in subclause 4 (2) of the Bill, by the publishing by the Minister of a notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> fixing the date after which no further bounty becomes payable. Clause 2 1 of the Bill continues the Government&#39;s policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect rights or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation.

          </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill now before the Senate is to give effect to the Government&#39;s decision to continue to assist the manufacture in Australia of wheeled agricultural tractors and their derivatives but under a completely revised structure recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report No. 8 1 of 1 9 February 1 976. This revised structure provides for the phasing in, over 5 years, of a bounty scale which, except in respect of tractors in the high engine output category, represents a substantially reduced bounty level to operate for a further 2 years by which time, it is proposed, a further review of the industry will have been completed. The Bill proposes amendments to the Agricultural Tractors Bounty Act 1966, retrospective to 1 January 1977, to extend the terminating date from 31 December 1976 to 31 December 1984 or such later date as may be fixed by proclamation. Provision is made by clause 14 of the Bill whereby a tractor, the manufacture of which was completed on or before 3 1 December 1 976 but which is sold on or after 1 January 1977, will be eligible for bounty under the old scheme as if the tractor was manufactured and sold not later than 31 December 1976. </para>
          <para>The Schedule of amounts of bounty payable under the existing Act in respect of tractors from 15 kW engine output up to 67 kW output and over is, by sub-clause 6 ( 1 ) of the Bill, replaced by a new schedule which provides for the ascending order of bounty entitlements to extend beyond the existing ceiling to take account of manufacture of tractors up to 105 kW engine output. The effect of the substituted bounty scale over the initial period of 3 years, as compared with the old scheme, will be as follows: </para>
          <para>Lower bounty for tractors at the low end of the power scale- 1 5 k W to 34 k W; </para>
          <para>Higher bounty for tractors with engine output of 35 kW and higher; </para>
          <para>Substantially higher bounty for tractors with engine output above 67 kW because of extension of the progressive ascending scale beyond 67 kW up to 105 kW. </para>
          <para class="block">The proposed scheme provides, after that initial period of 3 years to which I have just referred, for the phasing in, in 2 steps, of scale which specifies reduced levels of bounty, as compared with the old scheme, except for tractors with engine output of 67 kW and higher. The  phased-in  reduction of bounty at the low power end of the scale is substantial. </para>
          <para>In order to preserve relativity between the amounts prescribed as bounty entitlements and import price levels, provision is made in clause 6 of the Bill for the scales of amounts of bounty to be indexed to take account of movement in import prices levels. It is proposed that indexation be achieved by prescribing by regulation, from time to time, an appropriate factor by the application of which amounts shown in the bounty scales are to be modified. Administratively, the factor to be prescribed initially will be ascertained by reference to the Reserve Bank of Australia Import Price Index &#39;Machinery Except Electric&#39; Group. The amounts shown in the proposed scales in the Schedule in clause 12 of the Bill are those recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission as based on March 1 976 price levels updated to first quarter 1 977 values by application of that index. Provision is made by paragraph (b) of clause 6 of the Bill for bounty to be reduced by one per cent for each one per cent by which local content of factory cost of a tractor is below 100 per cent. A reactivated provision in sub-section 6 (4) of the 1966 Act provides that no bounty is payable where the local content of factory cost of a tractor is less than 55 percent. </para>
          <para>The proposed revised bounty structure, by providing a more uniform level of assistance in respect of tractor size and level of local content and by providing increased incentive to the production of heavier tractors should ensure the viability of the industry in Australia. It is anticipated that bounty payments under the scheme proposed by this Bill will amount to approximately $5m per annum for the first 3 years of operation of the scheme. This is substantially similar to the amount that would be payable if operation of the previous scheme had been continued. The effect of clause 11 together with clause 13 of the Bill is to continue the Government&#39;s policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect rights or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>In 1975 the Department conducted a review of its experience with detector dogs, including consideration of the value and feasibility of developing and expanding this resource. Resulting from this review which included a study carried out by an Army dog expert, a detector dog development program was commenced. </para>
            <para>German shepherd was the breed selected as most suitable for the purpose. The decision to use this breed was based mainly on a consensus of expert advice that the german shepherd would be best for this type of work in Australian conditions. Also, Customs organisations in other countries had been using this breed for drug detection work successfully and had found it to be more adaptable than others. </para>
            <para>Although the use of detector dogs is still in the development stage, experience has shown the german shepherd to be eminently suitable for the purpose. It is not proposed, at this time, to change the breed of dog used. </para>

            <para>As stated in the answer to Question No. 2 1 8, on 1 8 August 1976 (House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> pages 331-336), it is not the practice to publish the individual staff ceilings set for each department. </para>
            <para>The honourable senator will be aware that staff ceilings are subject to continuing review and may be varied from time to time to take account of changes in Government priorities or in administrative arrangements. For these reasons staff ceiling figures can only be interpreted in the context of circumstances prevailing at the time they are set and valid comparisons over time or between individual staff ceilings would be possible only after a complicated process of adjustment to take account of variations such as those mentioned above. </para>
