            </talker>
            <para>-The direct question from the honourable senator is whether the coordination of solar research in Australia is adequate. My comment is that co-ordination obviously could be improved. I imagine that we will never strike a situation where some matter cannot be improved. The original question put to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> some time ago premised the proposition that the Federal Government should be the sole manager and director of solar research in Australia. The general proposition- it has been put to me by others- is that there should be some central co-ordinating authority. My original answer to the honourable senator was that research in most areas and in solar research is a diversified matter. The very obligation of universities is for some independence. I fully agree with what has been put to me by a number of university researchers as well as by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> that there should be some coordinating authority. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is not my view that within universities, where a large body of solar research is done at the present time, co-ordination means that the allocation of some central fund should be made either to support in detail a project or to withdraw funds from some other project on the whim of some central authority. Professor Kaneff certainly indicated that he thought there should be greater co-ordination, and that view has been put to me by a number of other university researchers in this area. The honourable senator noted that Professor Kaneff said that universities are aware of the type of research being done by other universities. I can assure the Senate that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the major research institute in Australia, is aware of every aspect of solar energy research that is being undertaken in Australia at this time. So there is in that sense coordination, which was the word that the honourable senator just used. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator mentioned that there should be greater co-operation. This has been a matter of discussion for some months. It must be acknowledged that the Minister for National Resources has devoted a great deal of time to the general question of energy research in Australia. It is not my responsibility to determine what the limits of solar energy research should be. General energy research in Australia is a matter in respect of which obviously the view of the Minister for National Resources must take precedence, but where energy research is to be directed within my portfolio that obligation will be met. </para>

              <para>-I wish to ask a supplementary question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> in the early part of his answer acknowledged that there could be improvements. If he does not consider himself to be the Minister who should take the initiative to effect those improvements who, on behalf of the Government, should do so? Are we to understand that he acknowledges that improvements could be made in this area and that approaches have been made to him apparently by scientific and industrial people? If it is not his responsibility whose responsiblility is it? </para>

              <para>- I take it that we are talking of solar energy research and that that is the subject of the question that the honourable senator has asked me. If that is so I shall deal only with solar energy research. I feel that it is no responsibility of mine to determine what type of research should be carried out in any university in Australia. It must be obvious to the honourable senator that the responsibility for the type of research to be carried out in universities is not that of the Minister for Science. However, the type of research carried out by the major research institute in Australia, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, is my responsibility, and I feel very confident- the record speaks for itself- that the type of research that mainly has been the responsibility of the Federal Government has been most useful to the Australian community. It is my responsibility to know what type of research is being done overseas in this field, and it has been stated time and again in this place that the comparison in money terms between what is spent overseas in this field and what is capable of being spent in Australia is a matter perhaps for a watching brief. That would be within my responsibility. If the honourable senator asks whose responsibility it is to initiate research, I can only say that the responsibility must go to a number of portfolios, including that of the Minister for Education, and the Minister for National Resources as well as to various State universities and State educational authorities that may be carrying out work of this type at present. Whether there should be co-ordination on this point, if 'co-ordination' means the allocation of funds for research- </para>

              <para>-The honourable senator now asks another question and we hear the silly laughter from the Opposition, which is a regular occurrence. At the outset I attempted to clear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> 's mind by trying to express what was intended by his question. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> reads <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> he will find that the question was difficult to follow. He now asks whether I will take the initiative in co-ordinating this matter. That was his last question. If that is the question he now wishes to pose to me perhaps I could take it on notice instead of taking up time now during question time. I will supply him with an answer to it. </para>

Without any wish to exacerbate the situation, one can only hope that good sense will prevail. To the extent that I understand the matter may be <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> naturally I must be very careful in any comments that I make. The honourable senator asked whether a stoppage of air traffic to Tasmania would cut off Tasmania from the mainland. The answer must be that as shipping is so irregular and involves such long delays, Tasmania depends on its air link with the mainland and is uniquely affected by stoppages. The honourable senator seeks to have me foreshadow what might or might not be a matter of Government policy. He asks whether the Government proposes to take steps to deal with a situation in which the community may be subjected to great hardships. I can say only that I will refer that matter to the Minister concerned. As to the question of whether the use of civilian airfields by the Air Force may be delimited, that is a highly complex matter. It would depend upon the support systems available at the airfield. It is a hypothetical situation. I do not want to venture on to making comments which could appear, however unwittingly, to be vexatious. I shall simply record the question and pass it on to my colleague. </para>

Will the Minister indicate what action is proposed to alleviate the situation, particularly in the Darwin region, where the regulatory and licensing section is unable to carry out its functions? Will the Minister say also whether he will use his good offices to arrange a meeting between the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and the Institute? The Minister will be interested to know that the Institute has a suggestion that will allow the services to be provided at no additional expenditure; in fact, it will provide additional revenue. </para>

            <para>-I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has identified 2 separate problems. They may be parallel problems, but I suggest to him that they are separate. If he is saying to me- and I understand him to be doing so- that the risk of accidents within the aircraft passenger and cargo industry must be growing due to increased usage and all sorts of other reasons, and that therefore the governments of the day should direct their attention to working out optimum ways to establish a series of rules and of management procedures in air traffic and other behavioural areas, of course I agree with him. It is abundantly right that that should be done. As I understand the question, the honourable senator mentioned an allegation that some pilots had been susceptible to alcohol 10 hours or so before they were due to take up their duties. The honourable senator may know that my colleague in another place, the Minister for Transport, is looking for example, at an extension of the present period relating to alcohol consumption by pilots as another safety factor. There must be many such factors. Indeed my own Government would fully support that attitude and any suggestions that would add to improved safety factors in the whole of the air travel picture. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the second part of the question, I imagine that it is being argued by air traffic controllers that their duties are becoming increasingly responsible. Since the matter has been the subject of a whole series of two, three or four arbitral proceedings in recent years and a wide range of matters has been covered, I do not think it would be proper for me to comment at this moment. I do not know the specifics of the arguments before the tribunal at this moment. I think it improper for me to infer something. As to the first part of the question, I wholeheartedly support the honourable senator. To the extent that the Government can, it is looking towards improving safety factors. As to the industrial dispute, I certainly hope that it can be resolved with common sense, fairness and amity. </para>

            <para>-I have a copy of the Press statement of the Minister for Primary Industry which I imagine most honourable senators would have. It is fairly detailed. On the information that I have I will do the best I can to help the honourable senator. First of all, I have never been one of those who have had tremendous enthusiasm for the performance of the Australian Meat Board in past years, and that is not unusual for the producers either. They have tended to lack enthusiasm for the performance of the Board. This goes back with me about 25 years, so at least I have been consistent. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation was initiated by the Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> in an attempt to improve the overall performance within the industry. I am informed he got about 200 submissions on the subject and they all agreed apparently on only one thing, that is, that there ought to be a corporation in place of the Board. They were consistent in that. Most of the submissions had wide varieties of input, advice, recommendation and indeed, in some cases, insistence expressed in terms such as: 'This is what must be done by you'. Ministers are used to getting those sorts of requests from people put quite mildly and modestly in this way: 'This is what you will do for me'. Most Ministers on this side and former Ministers on the other side have had a fair amount of experience of this. So what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> had to do was to try to strike a balance in the situation between all those various conflicting interests. He has been very good about it, I believe. It has taken a long time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government has finally made a decision. The decision has been announced but there are still talks going on with exporters and producers. They relate to the establishment of a producers group for consultation and an exporters group for consultation to be formed within the Corporation. So I think the exporters of Western Australia and the producers of Western Australia will have a very good chance to make their views known to the Minister in the process of forming those advisory bodies. Whether the producers will ever agree with the exporters or with the customers, both in this country and outside this country, I doubt very much. </para>

It arises from an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of today's date entitled Spy alleges "deception against Australia" Pine Gap mystery deepens'. It is necessary for me to quote briefly from the article. It will I am sure, help the Minister who seems to indicate that he does not read the newspapers.

            <para>-I understand that the current situation with regard to the advertising on radio and television of contraceptives and other aspects of family planning services is that such material may be transmitted provided it is confined to periods outside children's viewing and listening times. This is an experimental arrangement introduced by the former Australian Broadcasting Control Board in 1976 to test public opinion about this form of advertising. The experiment is continuing under the new Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The new Tribunal is conducting at present an inquiry into all matters, including the matter mentioned in the question. The question of newspaper advertisements is dependent upon State law on the one hand and individual company policy on the other hand. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. To some extent it relates to a question asked earlier to which I listened with some interest. What is the purpose of the Government's proposal to establish the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation? Further, will the Corporation have the power to acquire, classify and distribute meat so that the return to the producers can be stabilised and increased? </para>

            <para>-The basic purpose of the Corporation is to improve the performance of the whole of the Australian meat industry for all those involved in it. That means the producers of cattle, the processors of the animals, the consumers of them in the domestic market and the opportunities for people involved in the export market. As to compulsory acquisition, I cannot answer that question. I know no more than I can tell the honourable senator. As to the general promotion, I hope it will be a big improvement. Those of us who have followed meat marketing through the years- I have been personally involved in it- concluded long ago that there was a great need in Australia for an improvement in meat marketing overseas and in the market intelligence overseas. This is what the Corporation is setting out to achieve for the ultimate benefit of the whole of the Australian peopleproducers, consumers and exporters. I hope it will produce much better results than we have had in the past. </para>

I draw the Minister's attention to an article appearing in the South Australian Catholic Weekly newspaper the <inline font-style="italic">Southern Cross</inline> of 22 April calling for an increase in the grants to non-government schools. Is the assertion of the author, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> McDonald, correct when he states that needy primary schools receive grants equal to 32 per cent of standard costs of educating a child at State schools and that secondary schools receive 30 per cent? Is his further statement that the Schools Commission has recommended that by 1977 needy schools should receive 40 per cent of the average cost of educating a child also correct? Can the Minister indicate whether this matter is recieving consideration in the current pre-Budget Cabinet discussions? </para>

            <para>-I have not seen the article to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> referred. In the current budget year, the Commonwealth Government has taken some very significant steps to aid non-government schools and, in particular, those in most need. The honourable senator will know that it is government policy to bring about a direct per capita grant for all parents of children in non-government schools and, of course, to recognise need and its supplement. In that regard 2 things of very great importance have happened, one of enduring importance. The Government has linked the grants to independent schools as a fixed percentage of grants to State schools so that now they automatically move together. This confers a long term benefit and a great planning benefit. Equally, within the limits of the increased money available, my Government increased the amount, however marginally, to level 6 which is the most needy level of schools in which, I think some 90 per cent of all primary pupils reside. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The actual costs vary in terms of percentages. It would be fair to say that taking the State supplement also into account- it is the aim of the Government to have a 20 per cent reciprocal supplement from the States- the most needy schools now may be receiving between, say, 55 per cent and 60 per cent or slightly more of the cost of a government school. Some may be getting a little more. It is not easy to derive the proportions coming from the Commonwealth and the States for the very simple reason that some States have different mechanisms. The South Australian Government has a mechanism different from the formal 20 per cent. However, it is true that needy schools are now somewhere in that category. Those allegedly in less need receive a much lower percentage. In the other categories, schools at the Commonwealth level receive something like 13 per cent or 15 per cent of the equivalent of government schools. I stress that the important thing is the link at this moment in the percentage rate. As to the final part of the question, the Government has a very clear view that it has a responsibility to give to all students, whether at government schools or non-government schools, the best eduction that the taxpayers can afford. Consistent with that view, the needs of the non-government schools, particularly the most needy, will be under review in the forthcoming Budget deliberations. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, by explaining that I have received information from a constituent who was a school leaver in 1976 in relation to her claim for unemployment benefit in January this year. Although she claimed for unemployment benefit early in January she was not granted benefit until after the 1977 school year began. Following the recent court decision on unemployment benefit for a school leaver, she inquired whether she could now claim benefit for the early part of January. She states that she was told that claims for benefit for that period have now been destroyed. Can the Minister confirm whether that is correct? </para>

            <para>-The Opposition takes great interest, I can see, in some of the scientific matters which are of importance to the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> asked whether there is a balloon launching program in the outback of Australia. There is not necessarily one in the outback of Australia but there is one within Australia. Balloon flying has become a very important tool of science. There is a widespread belief among scientists who are familiar with the capabilities of balloons that their potential for obtaining scientific data of high quality at relatively low cost, and with relatively short lead times for instrumental development, is not fully appreciated or realised. Studies which are of growing importance are in the magnetospheric fields and concern the study of particles in that area; cosmic ray research in high energy research; and in low energy gamma ray research. All of these can be particularly important in reference to the various questions asked in this place from time to time about energy. These studies are usually carried out with particularly large balloons. They are usually flown in the stratosphere, perhaps up to a 1 5-kilometre altitude. Australia has launched balloons- that was the question- over a period, from Mildura in Victoria, from Alice Springs in the Northern Territory and from Broken Hill in New South Wales. The growing demand in the international community is for larger balloon capacity. For instance, now the demand is for balloons which may carry a weight in excess of 1000 kilograms. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Department of Science has a small program in this area which I, with advice, am attempting to expand at present. One aspect of the advice given to me is that certain areas in this country provide practically ideal conditions for certain atmospheric and stratospheric research. For instance, I am advised that Alice Springs is suitable because weather conditions generally encountered are good. The expansiveness of the area for the recovery of the balloons and equipment and for the tracing of the flight confirms that that view is correct. The United States Science Foundation has recently encouraged our work by the loan of a very large launching truck. That is providing rewarding experiments just recently carried out from Broken Hill. My Department has plans for the development and the upgrading of building fixtures at Mildura. The Department is developing plans for extra facilities at Alice Springs where we hope there will be a concentration of the larger balloon flying facilities. As yet these plans are not finalised. </para>

The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development has also been consulted about a number of matters.

As the Minister's original announcement was that her Department was funding regional councils for administrative expenses and contracted projects up to 30 June 1977, and as the Minister did not inform the regional council at Burnie until April this year that the council was expected to find the money for accrued leave to employees from its own funds before June, does she now realise that the council must pay off its employees immediately to comply with the harsh demands of the Department? Is this the case with all employees of regional councils who had up till now believed that they would be in employment until 30 June and then be able to look around for new employment while using up accrued leave? Do these stringent procedures differ from general Public Service methods of paying off staff? Will the Minister reconsider this ruling and find from her Department the funds for employees' leave after 30 June? </para>

            <para>- This problem has not previously been brought to my attention, but in the Budget of this year regional councils were given an indication of the funds that were available to them. That is a fixed amount which is available to regional councils for the employment of staff. I have not had drawn to my attention any difficulty in the winding up process in regard to accrued leave but I shall have the matter investigated. I can only say that there will be no funds for the Australian Assistance Plan in the Budget next year following the announcement that was made at budget time last year when we indicated the support that would be given this year. In money terms I thought that that proposal was understood by all regional councils. I shall have the Department investigate the situation in regard to the Burnie Council for Social Development and advise the honourable senator if I can give him any further information on the requirements under the present plan. </para>

By way of preface I refer to a lengthy answer which the Minister gave me on 21 April which virtually contained the Government s policy on whale harvesting. In view of the fact that the International Whaling Commission met last week and the answer was compiled before those proceedings, can I have access to the minutes of those proceedings? The Minister will know that in earlier responses to my questions when reports of overseas observers have been relied on it has been argued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> that they distorted the role of the Australian delegation. </para>

              <para>- I recall answering a question asked by the honourable senator in regard to special benefit for unemployed school leavers. I think it is understood that the special benefit is a benefit paid at the direction of the Director-General because of special need. Those circumstances may relate directly to a school leaver who is ineligible for unemployment benefit or they may relate to other matters. I think there was some doubt as to whether the figures that were available related specifically to the matter that was raised in the honourable senator's question. However, I shall have a further look at the information that is available. I am not aware of a directive in the terms that the honourable senator has mentioned. I can have an inquiry made about that also. But perhaps his source of directives is more adequate than mine has been for those matters in which he is especially interested. </para>

At what rate of interest could the Corporation have obtained funds from overseas? Did the Government prevent the Corporation from borrowing overseas? If so, why. </para>

It is not possible for me to do so. I did not read the article and I do not know about it. But I make some observations about interest rates generally.

              <para>-If the honourable senator will just be quiet for a moment I shall say that inflation is now coming down in Australia and when it comes down it is very important to bring down interest rates. This is a country that does not do at all well on high interest rates. I hope that with inflation coming down we will be able to see interest rates decline. The honourable senator who asked the question has an interest in these matters and he has some knowledge which I appreciate. That is why I am taking the time to try to be helpful. The prime interest rate in the United States is about 7.5 per cent. I think the prime rate in Japan is now down to about 5 per cent. It is clear to anybody therefore that a trading country like ours needs to have a low interest rate. To get that it has to have a low inflation rate. I hope honourable senators will persist in their endeavours to get the inflation rate down. </para>

          <para>- I rise to express displeasure at the way in which this motion is being put to the Senate at this time. There has been practically an hourly or daily basis of change of habit. At this time we are told that the Senate will resume at 8 p.m. unless a message to the contrary is delivered to us. Earlier this week in my discussions with representatives of the Government I was told that it was the intention of the Government to lift the Senate at 12 noon so that Estimates Committees D, E and F could meet from 12 noon until 5 p.m., and that the Senate would not be resuming at 8 p.m. for the purpose of conducting General Business. That information was transmitted by me to my colleagues. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If I may give some indication of the change of plans, it was on 10 December that an intended plan for the sittings of the Estimates Committees was sent out; that plan was amended some time last week or the week before last; then we had another amended plan on 27 April, which was only yesterday, indicating that Senate Estimates Committees D, E and F would sit from 12 noon to 5 p.m., and that on Tuesday, 3 May Senate Estimates Committee A and other committees which had not completed their deliberations would meet. If the Senate is to resume at 8 p.m. we have not been told the reason for the resumption. We do not know whether the Government intends to introduce any emergency legislation to be put through both Houses of the Parliament, or whether it intends to resume at 8 p.m. for the purpose of allowing the Opposition to continue with its General Business debate on the situation in regard to East Timor-. All in all I regard it as being a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. </para>

        <para class="block">Whips face- I use the plural here. I am certain that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> appreciates the difficulty. On the last day of sitting in a week it is necessary for arrangements to be made to get honourable senators back to their States, especially as winter approaches and each morning is likely to be heavy with fog and the airport could be closed. It is not satisfactory to have such a sudden change to the proposed sitting times unless the matter is of extreme urgency. Rumour is about that there is some important legislation to be brought down and I would not object to some dislocation if the matter was extremely urgent but it does not appear to be urgent. If it were so urgent, then some decision should have been reached by the Government ealier this morning or perhaps yesterday rather than placing us on the hook that we are now on that we will not know until after 1.30 p.m. what we are going to do tonight. It is extremely difficult for the Senate to be run in this way. In particular I want to indicate how difficult it must be for the transport officers to make arrangements. </para>

            <para>-I put the responsibility on the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster.</inline> It could have settled this air traffic controllers dispute. I asked a question about this matter this morning and received a reasonable response from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> That dispute is of a different nature. It involves increased responsibility which the air traffic controllers have to expect at present. Several court decisions have been made which indicate that the responsibilities which the air traffic controllers have to accept mean that their status has to be changed. If the Government is complaining about the 24-hour strike it should accept some responsibility for it. The Government should have done something about this matter several months ago. It cannot shift the blame onto the air controllers and I resist that suggestion. Let me get back to the point. I do not think that it is a fair way to run the Senate. It is for that reason that I wanted my comments to be put in the record. </para>

            <para>- No. A very notorious ex-senator used to say, I believe, that if you wanted to know about the sittings of the Senate you asked the doorman. I propose to do that shortly after the Senate rises. I am sure I will be satisfied in that regard. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> should have been in this place before I became Leader of the Government in the Senate. He would have found that for a number of years senators did not know what they were doing from one day to the next. It was a daily occurrence. Due mainly to the cooperation which has been established between the Government Whip and the Opposition Whip, I think it is fair to say that the Senate has been better planned and programmed during the last 1 5 months than it has been in the last 76 years. When I first became a senator we were lucky to know what was going to happen from day to day. I remember the days when the predecessor of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> was Leader of the Government. We did not know what was going to happen from minute to minute. It is because of those terrible days that when we became the Government I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> to exert his best endeavours so that senators would know at least a week in advance what would be coming on for debate and what was a reasonable program. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I know there has been some criticism this morning about the change in the program. I was subjected to criticism from my colleagues last year when they said that they were not informed far enough in advance of the program. So this year, for the first time, we have put down possible sittings of Estimates Committees, not only for this session but also for the Budget sittings of the Senate. I think this Government has gone even further this year. We have not only put down an anticipated period of sittings for this session but also for the Budget session. We are aiming to project as far ahead as possible when honourable senators are likely to be required in Canberra for sittings of the Parliament. Before we rise for the Christmas break I would like to see the pattern of sittings put down for the whole of next year so that there is some certainty of what our program will be. </para>
        <para>I can remember the days when we did not know when Parliament was resuming after the Christmas break. At that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine,</inline> we always asked Wally Lee. I do not think the doorman ever knew anything, but Wally certainly did. I realise that this causes some inconvenience to honourable senators. Apart from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cotter)</inline> in another place, nobody has to travel further than the Western Australian senators, week in and week out. I think we would have the least number of aircraft to get us into Canberra or out of Canberra. I certainly have a personal interest in this also. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The question of the amalgamation of James Cook University of North Queensland and the Townsville College of Advanced Education was first raised by the Commission on Advanced Education's Special Committee on Teacher Education, 1973, and was subsequently the subject of study of a joint Working Party of University and College representatives. The Working Party made recommendations in favour of amalgamation and a joint University/College committee was established to consider ways in which amalgamation might be achieved. I am informed, however, that while the principle of amalgamation has been accepted at various times by the governing bodies and academic boards of the two institutions, no formal proposal for amalgamation has been presented to State or Commonwealth authorities. </para>
            <para>The Universities Commission has not been involved in any formal negotiations concerning the amalgamation of the James Cook University and the Townsville College of Advanced Education. However the matter has been raised with the Commission in discussions with the University and with the Queensland education authorities. In its <inline font-style="italic">Report for 1977-79 Triennium</inline> the Universities Commission noted, at paragraph 6.34, in relation to the Townsville situation that it had been advised by the Vice-Chancellor of James Cook University that the University had decided not to proceed with the proposals for amalgamation which were formulated by the joint Committee, referred to above. The Commission stated that a firm decision not to amalgamate would be unfortunate, given that both institutions were small and were unlikely to grow significantly in the foreseeable future particularly given the general restraint on teacher education enrolments. The Commission encouraged the University to reconsider the possibilities of amalgamation in consultation with the appropriate Queensland authorities. </para>
            <para>I would expect the question of rationalisation of existing tertiary educational institutions to be an issue for consideration by the new Tertiary Education Commission, legislation for which is currently before the Parliament. The detailed consideration of individual situations would, of course, be a matter for consultation with State authorities and the institutions themselves. </para>
