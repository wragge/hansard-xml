            <para>- I thank the Senate for granting leave. I very briefly refer to the sad event of the passing of a great friend and colleague of mine, Albion (Bert) Hendrickson. I am certain he was also a friend of honourable senators who knew him. As you mentioned in your announcement, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> Bert Hendrickson served in the Senate from 1947 until 1 97 1 . He came here with a background of a wide experience of life and he made some very sound and sincere contributions to the debates in the Senate. He was born in the vicinity of Maryborough in Victoria and went to school in Maryborough. He joined the Postmaster General&#39;s Department and was a life member of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union. During the war years he was secretary to the Minister for Trade and Customs. He was elected to the Senate in 1946 and he took his seat in 1947. During his time here he served on numerous committees and generally was a very highly respected member of this chamber. He made a sound contribution to the debates here and in the party room and on the administrative side of the Australian Labor Party in Victoria where he was held in very high esteem. I take this opportunity of placing on record my sincere sorrow at his passing. I wish to convey to his widow, his son and daughters, the sincere appreciation of the Senate for the contribution which he made and for the sterling service which he gave to the Senate and to his country. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Is the Government satisfied that it is sufficiently aware of espionage activities of foreign powers in Australia? In particular, does the Government consider that it is kept sufficiently informed of the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency to the extent that the activities of that body do not in any way interfere with the sovereign rights of the Australian Government? </para>

            <para>-I shall have to refer this question to the Prime Minister to get a detailed answer to the honourable senator, but as far as I know the answer to both questions is yes. The honourable senator should draw upon the knowledge he gained during the 3 years he was in government between 1972 and 1975 and draw his own conclusions from what his then ministerial colleagues learned about this matter from their own confidential briefings. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Recently I directed a question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations concerning his response to results of a survey on migrant unemployment. The survey, conducted by a Monash University research team, found that migrant unemployment was higher than that of Australian born workers. In answering these assertions the Minister stated that those conclusions could not be regarded as accurate due to possible imperfections in the sample and the paucity of relevant information available for measuring this parameter. I thus ask the Minister whether there is any possibility of improving the facilities for collecting data which could be used in order to derive a meaningful and reliable measurement of migrant unemployment. If such data could be obtained it would help to clarify the confusion about this subject created by many conflicting statements that have appeared recently in the media and in the Parliament. </para>

            <para>-Senator Lajovic asked me this question some time ago and I undertook to obtain a detailed answer for him from the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Minister has provided a written answer in some detail to that question. It is certainly true that the survey conducted by Monash University, to which the honourable senator has referred both in the previous question and today, is open to considerable criticism, the reason being that the size and selection of the sample may have affected the results as it was confined to a total of 320 people from 3 Melbourne suburbs Clayton, Notting Hill and Mount Waverley. The selection was predominantly confined to semi-skilled and unskilled occupational groups. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, through its quarterly survey of the labour force, produces information on unemployment amongst persons born overseas and keeps a record of those statistics by reference to the period of the arrival in Australia of the persons concerned. The details of the latest survey carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in November 1976 are available and have been referred to in the answer already given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic.</inline> However, I understand that the honourable senator is concerned to know whether the Commonwealth Employment Service keeps statistics of this kind and whether more detailed information could be obtained from it. I will certainly pass on to the Minister his request for further consideration of this matter. </para>

Has his attention been drawn to an advertisement appearing in last Saturday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> seeking financial support for the No case in the forthcoming referendum, which is purported to be issued by the New South Wales </para>

Is it a fact that there was once a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jack</inline> Kane but that he was defeated at an election in New South Wales as long ago as May 1 974? Is a person who is no longer a senator entitled to put himself forward to the public as such? If not, is this a case of fraudulent advertising? What action, if any, can the Government take in such a matter? </para>

            <para>-My attention had not been drawn to the advertisement but it has now. I shall certainly have a look at it. As I recall, the facts outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland concerning former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> are correct. He came here, I think, in 197 1 and left at the double dissolution in 1 974. From memory, they are the dates between which he was in this Parliament. I undertake to the honourable senator to have a look at the advertisement and, should I think it necessary, I shall refer it to the proper authorities. </para>

            <para>- I understand that until recently both human and animal quarantine facilities were maintained at the Torrens Island quarantine station. However, during 1976 the station was closed for human quarantine purposes and work commenced on proposals to upgrade progressively the animal quarantine facilities at the station so that a wider range of large imported animals could be satisfactorily processed. At present the station caters for imported cats, dogs and horses. No funds have been allocated for this new work during 1976-77. A decision to proceed during 1 977-78 and the timing of commencement of construction will depend on budgetary considerations for the forthcoming Budget. </para>

What situation did the Minister assess? How did the Minister travel to the Northern Territory? How many persons accompanied the Minister? If he used a Royal Australian Air Force plane, what was the total cost of the exercise? Was the Minister aware that it was common knowledge before he boarded his flight to Darwin that there was little or no danger of the cyclone crossing the coast at Darwin and that the cyclone was developing into a quite normal tropical rain depression? Was this knowledge conveyed to the Minister or was there a total breakdown in communications? </para>

            <para>-The precise details of all the matters that the honourable senator raised is not known to me. During the weekend just passed the Bureau of Meteorology had recorded on its radar a most intense cyclone. I was alerted on Saturday morning that it was a matter of concern as the cyclone appeared to be following the path of Cyclone Tracy. It was unusual that a cyclone of that intensity some 300 kilometres from Darwin should have shown up on the radar. There had been some difficulty with equipment. This was righted quickly. I alerted the Minister for the Northern Territory of the problem on Saturday. My recollection is that on Saturday evening the cyclone had stopped its movement and was held in the one position. The situation was considered to be satisfactory. During Sunday, to use the words of the Bureau, the cyclone had re-coursed and was headed on a direct path to Darwin with increased intensity. Later on Sunday a satellite photograph showed that the cyclone was diffused in some way and that the eye of the cyclone was not as intense as it had been shown to be earlier. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am aware that the Minister for the Northern Territory left for Darwin. My understanding is that he did not leave yesterday. I was under the impression that he left today. I may be incorrect and I shall advise the honourable senator. I formed the impression because the Minister requested me to carry out a duty for him this morning, which I did. If&#34; he did leave yesterday, I am unable to say the type of transport he used or, in actual fact, the reason for his leaving. But I should imagine he would have gone not purely for the purpose of taking an interest in the cyclone. I heard of other matters last week which needed his attention. If there is further information that could be given to the honourable senator, I shall let him have it. </para>

              <para>-At times one has to deal with ridiculous questions in the Senate and that is just one such question. As if I am likely to know at question time the cost of an operation which has not yet been completed! I can only say to the honourable senator that a growing amount of intelligence appears to have been shown by the Opposition. This came to the fore recently with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> quoting from the platform and policies of the Liberal and National Country parties but it does not appear to have gathered any force with the Opposition at the present time. I am quite sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> in a quieter moment were to reflect on the question he has asked he would realise that it is not an appropriate question to ask at question time. </para>

              <para>- That interjection came from a man who was against the referendum. He is now all for it. Maybe he hopes that it will get him into the Ministry. It was reported that the purpose of the referendum is that the Prime Minister is trying to find the most favourable time for a Senate election. Does this not very clearly indicate that the Prime Minister&#39;s stated reasons for holding the referendum are untrue; that the real reason is that the Prime Minister is fishing around to find the most suitable time for an election in the hope that he will find a more appropriate time to return to office; and that the purpose of this referendum is to delay a Senate election as long as possible in the hope that he will have things in better shape than he has at the present time? </para>

I might say that one thing happened then that also happened recently and that was that 10 senatorsnot the same senators voted against it. The other thing that is very noteworthy about that referendum is that it was the first referendum to be put to the people and that referendum was one of the four ever put to the people to be carried by a majority of 4 States. In 1906 only 6 years away from the founding of this nation people realised that it was the intention of the founding fathers to have simultaneous elections. Those honourable senators who care to read the debate and to read <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> &#39;s speech will see that he admitted that the Bill to which I have referred might not achieve the Government&#39;s intention totally and that he did invite honourable senators to think up any idea whereby the </para>
          <para class="block">Government could be assisted to make absolutely certain that there would be simultaneous elections and said that he would welcome such a proposition. If one looks through the No division lists and the Yes division lists in those days I think that one will find that the people who really worked to bring about the federation of Australia were on the Yes division lists in that period. </para>

Is it not a fact that he is one of the people on this side of the House who wrote that No case? </para>

              <para>-I am prepared to admit that I was wrong. I have learned by experience. There are some who never learn. There has been a lot of changing of views by many people in this place over a number of years. Merely because one did something 3 years ago is not to say that one cannot learn something in the meantime. I have learned something in the meantime. For what it is worth people may quarrel with it I am convinced in my mind that simultaneous elections will not do to the Senate those things that I asserted in 1974 they would do. Might I say in conclusion that I asserted all those things in 1974 but, luckily for me, I was never asked to prove them? Let those who now wish to proclaim those things that I then asserted prove the truth of my then assertions. </para>

I have seen the newspaper comments on what it is said the publication states. It seems to me that, as normal, it is wrong. It is nearly always wrong. This time it appears to be even more wrong than usual. The Government expects the inflationary trend to continue downwards. It expects the calculation contained in that publication to be proved wrong. If it does not prove to be wrong, I shall apologise most humbly some 6 months from now. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to an answer given by the Minister to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> on Tuesday, 26 April, in relation to staff shortages in the Department of Social Security. In her reply the Minister stated that she had had a letter from the member for Collie in Western Australia, the  Hon.  T. Jones, M.L.A., complaining that the Department in Perth will not service queries from members of Parliament or from the Minister. I have had 2 such complaints from members of State parliament, and I had direct evidence of the ban when endeavouring to obtain information on behalf of a constituent on Friday of last week. As the ban relates basically to overtime which has been caused by the staff ceilings applied to the Department, will the Minister advise what action is being taken to alleviate the situation in Western Australia? I am given to understand that the Department is understaffed by approximately 85 to 90 people in the training and relief areas at the moment. Although there has been an appropriation of some 29 people over the last few days, this will not make a great deal of difference in these areas. I am also given to understand that there was a further meeting in Perth this morning. Is the Minister in a position to advise what decisions or recommendations were made at that meeting? </para>

            <para>- There are difficulties in South Australia and Western Australia. A meeting was called in South Australia this morning. As I understand it, the meeting was still continuing a short time ago. There have been public statements by members of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association and, indeed, public advertisements from the South Australian branch mentioning actions to be proposed as motions to be put before the meeting in South Australia today. I am unable to advise any conclusion to the difficulties in both these States. Discussions are proceeding with the Public Service Board and with the Federal Secretariat of the ACOA. As soon as I am able to advise some conclusion to these discussions I shall do so. It is extremely difficult for a Department such as mine to function when officers of the Department have decided that certain duties are not to be carried out by them. To decide selectively that some duties would not cause hardship overlooks the integration of the work of the Department. I am hopeful that as a result of the discussions and the sense of responsibility accepted by staff members, these matters can soon be resolved. </para>

          <para>In response to a request from the Solomons Government on 23 April for the services of a helicopter and crews for rescue and relief operations, an Iroquois helicopter and crews as well as medical supplies were immediately uplifted to Honiara by Hercules aircraft (23 April). </para>
          <para>On 28 April the Solomons Government requested 50 tents capable of accommodating 8-10 people. Commercial tents were not suitable for the type of accommodation required and arrangements were made to draw upon Army stocks. The consignment was despatched by commercial air charter on 29 April. It is anticipated that the helicopter will cease operations on 7 May and that the total Australian assistance will amount to about $73,000. As many gardens have been destroyed Australia will continue to watch the situation closely and stands ready to provide additional assistance which might be requested. In broadcast statements both the Solomon Islands Governor and his Chief Minister have been forthcoming with their thanks for the prompt assistance rendered by Australia. </para>

By way of preface I refer to an earlier environment impact statement which was made on the proposed Concorde aircraft flights to this continent. I now ask the Minister: Do we more or less leave that decision as it was taken or, in the light of later decibel readings at Heathrow Airport and subsequently at North American airports, are we likely to have a reevaluation of the evidence? As a corollary to that, I ask: What is happening about the working party of scientists who were looking at the ozone displacement which could be compounded by Concorde and other high flying aircraft? </para>

            <para>- In recent weeks I have not had cause to seek the most up-to-date information on the evaluation of Concorde aircraft flights. I am aware that the Department of Transport and the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development have been in constant contact with evaluation studies undertaken throughout the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> will be aware that the original environment impact study was a British study of which we had the benefit together with supplementation. We had our own measurements taken during the proving flights of the Concorde aircraft from Melbourne to Singapore across the continent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> will be aware that Concorde is flying commercially on quite a number of routes in the world. Therefore it can be evaluated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have mentioned in the Senate many times a fact to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> adverted and that is that one should not look at Concorde as being unique. For example, in Australia we have, I suppose, some 23 FU 1aircraft and some 100 Mirage aircraft. All of them fly supersonically. In the world there are many thousands of such aircraft. Every day on the continent of Europe there are supersonic flights. The honourable senator asked me whether there had been any later reevaluation of the impact on the ozone layer. I can say only that the last information I had was that scientists felt that no perceptible damage was being done. In case there is any later information I shall refer the question to my colleague. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. I refer to a ministerial Press release issued by the Minister for Primary Industry on 27 April relating to the setting up of the body to be known as the &#39;Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation&#39; which will replace the present Australian Meat Board. Is the Minister aware of the deep disappointment of that section of the industry engaged in the purchase, processing, packaging and marketing of the product that its representation on the new Corporation will drop from the present 20 per cent to 1 1 per cent? How realistic is this proposal having regard to the vital and essential role of that sector, a number of members of which are co-operative organisations with a close, vital and sympathetic relationship with the producer in both a physical and on-going financial sense? Can the Minister say from what area of experience or expertise the 2 &#39;specially qualified members&#39; will come? In view of the traditional and vital role of the processor/exporter in the industry, as evidenced by the fact that he has an investment of $2,000m and employs some 60 000 people, will the Minister review the proposed structure of the Corporation so as to enable that sector to have its present level of representation? </para>

            <para>- That is a very long question, and perhaps the best thing I can do is to offer to the honourable senator after question time all the information which I have on this subject, which was brought together in the Press statement to which he referred. I know something about this matter. The people on the processing side of the industry had a long talk to me prior to the setting up of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, and the views they expressed to me were passed on to the Department of Primary Industry and to the Minister for Primary Industry. As I went through the matter very carefully it seemed to me that a fair balance of representation had been achieved right across the scene, because this Corporation will represent more than just one group. I know that some people are saying that they ought to have total control of the Meat and Livestock Corporation in order to preserve their own position in the industry. I can see why they would want that but I cannot see any validity in it. A lot of people are involved in the meat and livestock industries. There are not only the producers of cattle but also the people who buy cattle, the people who transport cattle, the people who process cattle for local consumption, the people who process cattle for export, the people who take risks with the plant that is used and the people who trade and have to export overseas, which involves market hazards such as having to wait for their money. Then there is the Australian consumer who buys and consumes the meat. In addition, and not to be forgotten, are the men and women who work in the industry in the various processing plants and shops. So there is a broad range of interests. I cannot see therefore that any section ought to have total power over the Corporation. I know where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> &#39;s concern probably originated and I understand it, but it seems to me that a fair balance of representation has been struck. The Minister for Primary Industry has had a tremendous number of representations from groups with wide ranging interests. I shall put the honourable senator&#39;s case to the Minister and shall make available to the honourable senator all the information that I have which may help him. </para>

            <para>- My attention was drawn to an article which appeared in the news media regarding the planting of certain types of seed by a new method. I took it to be quite an advance in agricultural research. It involves seeds which are of a very light nature, such as carrot seeds, and which may float in the wind being planted through a drill in a type of toothpaste mixture. It is similar to toothpaste coming out of a toothpaste tube. This gives the grower the opportunity to plant the seed not only in the proper fashion as regards the correct spacing but also with sufficient moisture and a correct mix of fertiliser to see to its germination. It appeared that a great advance could be made in growing certain types of vegetable seeds and other seeds. I referred that article to the CSIRO for its evaluation. As yet I have not received a response. I realise that this matter is of immense importance, particularly for growers in Tasmania, and I acknowledge the great interest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> has in it. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Is it true that, of the 47 Victorian applications for assistance in the May vacation holiday care programs, only 19 were funded and then in most cases were funded only as to a proportion of the amount sought? Is it true, despite the Minister&#39;s emphasis on &#39;care&#39; in these programs, that because those receiving funding received advice, at least in the case of Victoria, only one week before the beginning of the vacation, and because of the lack of funding and reduced funding, most of those planned programs have been reduced in size and have become at best minding operations? Is it true that hundreds of children around Australia will now be left to their own devices throughout the fortnight&#39;s break? What were the criteria on which funding was made available? Is it true that the applications for funding were returned to the Minister by the Office of Child Care on 25 March and therefore lay on her table for 34 days before the Minister made the announcements? </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of whether the figure of 19 out of 47 Victorian applications being funded is absolutely accurate. It is true that last week we announced the funding which had been approved for the school holiday programs through the Office of Child Care. The total amount of the program is $149,972. There has been some Press comment about halving the school holiday program, but I point out that funding for the program in May 1976 was $98,000 and that for 1975 it was $74,000. So it could hardly be said that the expenditure of $ 149,000 in May this year represents a halving of the program. As to the subject of care and the composition of the program, having decided in December last year that an amount of about $140,000 would be available for the program, the main criterion was that we would look first at those organisations which had conducted successful holiday programs last year and which had re-applied for funds this year. As I understand it, most of those organisations have been funded again for May this year. I understand that a variety of programs had been approved formerly and had been accepted by the community. I had not heard previously that there was a lack of care in the programs which had been funded in previous years, nor had I heard some of the assertions which have been made today. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the assertion that material from the Office of Child Care was given to my office on 25 March, that is quite inaccurate. The first statements from the Office of Child Care to my office that had any meaning at all represented recommendations for 2 States and I believe that they arrived about 6 April. On 1 8 April the full program, with recommendations for all States, reached my office. At that time priorities had to be decided because the recommendations representated an amount far in excess of the amount that had been agreed upon with the Office in December last year. If any further information is required I will provide it to the honourable senator, but I want to say that the expenditure of almost $150,000 on vacation care programs represents a sizable contribution to the care of children whose parents are absent from the home and whose parents are unable to plan programs for them during the holiday period. </para>

Is the Minister aware that delegates at the Hobart meeting agreed that it was impossible to find a form of words that would provide for all contingencies when filling a casual Senate vacancy, as did the 1958-59 Joint Committee on Constitutional Review? Why did the Government not write into the Constitution Alteration (Senate Casual Vacancies) Bill reference to a casual vacancy caused by the death or <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> illness of a senator? Why did the Government proceed with this Bill in the knowledge that it did not conform with the spirit of the Constitutional Convention in Hobart? Under the existing provisions of the Bill, how does the Government propose filling a casual vacancy caused by the death or <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> illness of (a) an independent senator, (b) a senator who resigns from his party, (c) a senator who has been expelled from his party and (d) a senator whose party has merged with or broken away from another party? Finally, as a political party is not defined in the proposed legislation, can the Minister indicate how this would be determined? </para>

The fact that the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review 1958-59 was unable to find a set of words sufficient to write into the Constitution is not a sufficient excuse to say that the present Government and the Parliament have not found a way. The honourable senator asks about 4 classes of people. He referred first to an independent. I thought we all knew that the position of an independent would remain as it is under the present Constitution. The honourable senator also referred to a senator who resigned from his party after having been chosen by the people as being a member of that party and taking his seat as a member of that party. That senator would be replaced by a senator from the party to which the former senator belonged when he was chosen to come into this place and when he took his seat. </para>

              <para>-No, senator. I wish you people would try to get some facts straight. As I understand it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall-</inline> he can speak for himself later if he so desires- came in here as a member of the Liberal Movement. As I understand what happened in South Australia, there was an amalgamation in fact, and I imagine at law, of the Liberal Movement and the Liberal Party of Australia, South Australian Division. So one party is now subsumed within the other. I think that is what happens in the (c) and (d) situations. This is a matter of fact for a Court of Disputed Returns to determine at the time. That is why one has provisions within the Commonwealth Electoral Act, certainly within the Constitution and within our own Standing Orders, as to disputed returns on election of senators, no matter how chosen. Should there be dispute as to whether one belonged to a certain political party or not, or as to the definition of a political party, they would be matters for a court of disputed returns to settle. Since a long way back that court has comprised a single justice of the High Court from whose decision there is no right of appeal. That system has worked successfully in the past and I see no reason for its not working successfully in the future. </para>

          <para>The honourable senator asked: What is a political party? I suppose that since 1948 political parties have been mentioned in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I think all of us at present in this chamber signed 2 forms when we nominated to be chosen as senators. One form was for nomination and the other was directed to the Electoral Officer of our State, indicating the order in which we wanted to appear on the ballot paper. That order was not picked by those nominating, it was picked by the party which endorsed us. It was not something that arose accidentally. </para>
          <para>The fact that political parties might not be recognised in many places does not seem to deter people from attempting occasionally to recognise them. I doubt that any honourable senator on my side of the chamber has not been to meetings of the Liberal Party where there have been requests that party affiliations of candidates for election be shown on ballot papers. That proposition is supported in some places and opposed in others. Yet I have never heard anybody pose the proposition that it would be wicked, improper or not right to put party designations on ballot papers. Therefore, we believe that what the Parliament has done in presenting the second referendum question is fair, decent, sensible and capable of implementation. I say again that I have yet to find anybody in the community or any member of the Federal Parliament who does not say that he believes totally and absolutely that replacement senators ought to come from the same party as the senator they are replacing. All that the Parliament is doing in submitting this referendum to the people is to make that absolutely certain in the future. I must say that I am somewhat suspicious of people who say they subscribe to the principle but are not prepared to write it into the Constitution. </para>

            <para>- I am unable to confirm the accuracy of the figures quoted by the honourable senator. The programs approved for this year cover a variety of programs in the various States- different types of programs. It could be that there is a difference in the number of children who will benefit, although I do not know whether that would be the only criteria on which we would judge them entirely. Some are longer term programs; others are daily or weekly programs. As far as I am concerned the applications that were funded and were successful in the previous year were given priority for funding this year. If it is a fact those which catered for larger numbers have been removed from the programs by their own choice because they have not made application that could result in a difference in numbers. However, the amount of funds that has been provided has been increased from $98,000 to $149,000. It would seem to me that the programs that have been chosen on this occasion should provide a variety of occupations and plans for children. I hope that they will be beneficial to the children who will attend the programs that have been arranged. </para>

          <para>- I bring up the first report of the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, together with the minutes of proceedings. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>On 24 March 1927 the Commonwealth Parliament resolved that the next sitting of the Parliament would be at the Federal Capital, Canberra. The Parliament, on 9 May 1927, moved into a building that was a compromise solution- one that was neither a monumental permanent structure nor a cheap temporary one. It was a provisional Parliament House meant to serve only until the 1 970s. We have occupied it for 50 years. In December 1965 the first Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House was established to inquire into certain aspects of a new and permanent parliament house. Since that date, a tremendous amount of time and effort has been spent by members and senators in planning the new building. </para>
        <para>The site of the new and permanent parliament house was debated and resolved by the Parliament Act 1974. By this Act, Parliament determined that the site is Capital Hill. Following determination of that issue the Joint Standing Committee was established in 1975 and reestablished in 1976 to act for and represent the Parliament, as the client for the new and permanent parliament house, in all matters concerned with the planning, design and construction of the new and permanent parliament house and all matters incidental thereto. The first report which I have just presented is, in essence, a progress report. The Committee has agreed unanimously to a program which would enable a fully functioning stage 1 parliament house to be constructed and occupied by 26 January 1988- the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia. I must stress that the Committee&#39;s decision does not involve the expenditure of any significant funds for at least 2 years. No specific government expenditure or commitment will be required before the 1979-80 Budget. </para>
        <para>In order that some comprehension of the way in which the national capital building could be designed appropriately to its environment on Capital Hill, an artist&#39;s impression was drawn. There is no design and that artist&#39;s impression serves no purpose other than to assist in seeing a building on the site. Studies of the mass of a building show that a balance can be achieved between the lines of a building while retaining the natural beauty of the site. Artists&#39; impressions in the report illustrate this. They show how a cone shaped building, for example, could be used to reinforce the hill shape and how the radial road pattern can be visually extended into the building to form courtyards and access corridors. It is stressed that the sketches are not the proposed design but merely an example of the effect a building may have on Capital Hill. </para>
        <para>The Committee&#39;s first report coincides with celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the opening of the provisional Parliament House. The opportunity now lies ahead to take the first step towards marking the 200th Australia Day celebrations by opening the new and permanent parliament house on 26 January 1988. </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">Insurance Amendment Bill 1977 </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Insurance Act 1973- to strengthen its administrative machinery and to remove a number of anomalies. The Bill will up-date certain provisions and provide for the transfer of the appeals jurisdiction of the Insurance Tribunal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Since the Insurance Act came into full operation on 1 August 1974, the Insurance Commissioner has been processing applications from insurers seeking authority to carry on insurance business in Australia. I am pleased to be able to say that the task of processing these applications is nearing completion. The Commissioner has gained a great deal of practical experience in the supervision of insurance companies. As a direct result, a number of weaknesses and anomalies in the legislation has become apparent. This Bill will remedy these defects and the opportunity is being taken to improve the Act in other ways. </para>
          <para>There are 6 specific points that I should mention. First, honourable senators will be aware of the debate within and outside the accounting profession on the treatment of future tax benefits in the accounts of companies. The Government wishes to put this matter beyond doubt so far as the Insurance Act is concerned. The Bill provides for the specific exclusion of such contingent benefits from an insurer&#39;s assets for the purposes of calculating its margin of solvency under the Act. Secondly, provision has also been made to clarify the situation with regard to the inclusion of guarantees in an insurer&#39;s assets for solvency purposes. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, it is proposed that insurance companies be able to omit from the calculation of their annual premium income for purposes of the Act amounts they have collected for onward transmission to the States or Territories in the form of fire brigade levies, stamp duties and other similar charges. Fourthly, under the Act as it now stands, an insurer that has been refused an authority to carry on business cannot be properly directed as to the way it should run off commitments previously entered into. It is now proposed to tighten this aspect of the Act by empowering the Treasurer to give directions to such an insurer in relation to the meeting of commitments under contracts of insurance previously entered into. </para>
          <para>Fifthly, it has become apparent that a considerable amount of insurance is being sent to unauthorised insurers overseas through agents in Australia. Section 1 1 3 of the existing Act- which has not yet been proclaimed- prohibits such a practice. Following consultation with the industry, we have decided to allow exemptions from this prohibition, so as to increase the flexibility of the provision. The amendments make provision to obtain more information on business going to the unauthorised market overseas. The amendments also require those sending business to the overseas market on behalf of Australian clients to notify those clients that they have insurance cover which is outside the supervision of the Australian Act. I add that neither the existing legislation nor the proposed amendments to it unduly restricts the freedom of individuals or companies in Australia to obtain insurance cover overseas. The legislation regulates the precise way in which this can be done consistent with the general intent of the Act. Sixthly, it is proposed to transfer the responsibility for having appeals under the Insurance Act from the Insurance Tribunal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </para>
          <para>I should also mention one matter in respect of which we have decided not to amend either the Insurance Act 1973 or the Life Insurance Act 1945. The Labor Government announced in 1973 that it would introduce amendments under which proposals relating to the establishment of new insurance companies would be examined on the basis of national interest criteria. Arrangements to achieve that have since applied on an administrative basis without the backing of legislation. This matter has recently been reviewed in depth. We have concluded that these arrangements are unnecessary having regard to the effectiveness of existing legislation designed to ensure the financial soundness of insurance companies. I emphasise, however, that proposals by overseas interests will continue to be subject to examination under the Government&#39;s foreign investment policy. The various amendments effected by this Bill have been developed in close consultation with the general insurance industry. Although they are generally more of a machinery than a policy nature we believe that they will contribute in a significant way to the effective supervision of the industry. </para>
          <para>Finally, a substantial weakness has recently become apparent in the Insurance Act and it has been found necessary to provide an adequate basis on which to institute proceedings against an authorised insurer for late lodgment of returns. It is emphasised that the requirement that an authorised insurer make detailed returns and statements at specified intervals is fundamental to the effective administration of the legislation. Thus the amendment in clause 34A would enable the Commissioner to prosecute in appropriate cases for late lodgment of returns. It has been drafted along the lines of sub-section 12 (4) of the Companies Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory and will facilitate the Commissioner&#39;s task of proving the non-lodgment of documents to the satisfaction of the court. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>
          <para class="block">Life Insurance Amendment Bill 1977 </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Life Insurance Act 1945. More specifically the Bill will up-date and improve the existing supervisory machinery established by the Act, to take account of changes in money values and business practices. It will facilitate appeals against administrative decisions. It will bring the Act into line with the Government&#39;s policy of divesting the </para>
          <para class="block">High Court of its original jurisdiction under Commonwealth statutes and conferring it on other appropriate courts. </para>
          <para>The Life Insurance Act since its introduction over 3 1 years ago has been singularly successfuly in preventing failures among life insurance companies in Australia. It has brought about a degree of stability in the industry which has few rivals anywhere else in the world. However, changing conditions, changing forms of policies and changing public demand and expectations have made it desirable to up-date some areas of the legislation. At the same time new problems have arisen which are not covered in the Act at all. With this in mind, the Government views the current set of proposed amendments to the Life Insurance Act as a forerunner to a much wider review to determine what kind of supervisory legislation is best suited to Australia&#39;s life insurance industry in the future. </para>
          <para>It is proposed to strengthen the supervision over registered life insurers. The Bill requires them to seek permission from the life Insurance Commission before they commence a form of business other than life or general insurance. However, the Commissioner will not be able to refuse an insurer permission to enter a noninsurance area unless he is satisfied that such entry would be to the detriment of existing and prospective policy owners. </para>
          <para>The existing legislation provides that a life insurance company shall not invest directly or indirectly in another such company. This is obviously unworkable as almost all companies listed on the stock exchange would have some link with a life insurer merely because life insurers are large investors in shares. It is proposed to relax this particular provision. New safeguards will however enable the life insurance commissioner to oversee certain investment outlets where the investments of particular kinds exceed specified limits. Investments in companies related to life insurance companies, mutual funds and unit trusts will come under this provision. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides for an insurer to have a prospectus seeking investment in its debentures approved by the Life Insurance Commissioner before the debenture issue can be made. This is consistent with the existing provision which requires approval of the Commissioner of an insurer&#39;s share prospectus before issue. Provision has also been made to have the Commissioner fully informed when a take-over is made for a registered life insurance company. </para>
          <para>To increase the effectiveness of the Commissioner&#39;s supervision and generally speed up the collection of data, it is proposed to shorten the period a company has in which to lodge returns. In future balance sheets and other financial returns will be required 5 months after the close of its financial year. The period for the submission of the actuarial abstract and statement will be shortened to 6 months. </para>
          <para>Provision has been made for the abolition of the requirement for a life insurance company to lodge and maintain a deposit with the Treasurer. The necessity for authorised general insurers under the Insurance Act to lodge and maintain deposits has been abolished. It has been found, both here and overseas, that the maintenance of deposits has served little or no practical purpose because of changes in money values. </para>
          <para>Of considerable benefit to policy owners and their dependants are the proposals to amend money values referred to in a number of sections of the Act and to allow for the values to be altered by regulation in the future. I mention as a particular example the proposal that probate or administration on a policy need not be applied for until the total value reaches $6,000- the current amount is $2,000. </para>
          <para>Clause 36 in the Bill has the effect of allowing the Fourth Schedule to the Act to be changed by regulation. This will enable greater flexibility in periods of changes in interest rates and has significant implications in terms of increased benefits to policy owners. I might explain that the purpose of the Fourth Schedule to the Act is to ensure that life companies calculate the liabilities that will accrue under policies in the future and the funds that will be available to meet them in an actuarially sound way. At present, the basis is based on interest rates and other factors applying many years ago. It is restricting companies in the benefits they can provide. The necessity to liberalise the minimum valuation basis in the Fourth Schedule and the concern felt in the industry that changes be made as soon as possible are fully appreciated by the Government. Priority will be given to drafting the necessary regulations. </para>
          <para>It is proposed to transfer the responsibility for the hearing of certain appeals under the Life Insurance Act from the High Court to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In addition, the number of administrative acts of the Life Insurance Commissioner against which an appeal can be lodged has been increased. The opportunity has been taken to divest the High Court of its original jurisdiction under the Act and to transfer that jurisdiction to other appropriate courts. There are also a number of formal amendments which will bring the Act into line with current drafting practices. </para>
          <para>Because of the highly technical nature of life insurance and the effect any amendments to the Act are likely to have on the industry and policy owners, the amendments effected by this Bill have been developed in close consultation with the life insurance industry. We are confident that these amendments, although only a beginning to the major task of modernising the Life Insurance Act, will bring considerable benefits to life insurance as a whole. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to implement the Government&#39;s decision to extend the period of operation of the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974 by one year to 30 June 1978. The amending legislation will provide an additional amount of $ 10m in interest-free non repayable grants to the States in 1977-78 to finance provision by their housing authorities of self-contained units of accommodation for a range of single pensioners entitled to supplementary assistance. The eligible categories are age, invalid and class B widow pensioners and Service pensioners who are permanently unemployable, suffering from tuberculosis or are in receipt of a pension because of age. </para>
          <para>Under the current legislation $30m in grants has been made available for the same purpose over the 3-year period from 1 July 1974 to 30 June 1977. To date this has enabled approval of building schemes to provide a total of 20 1 7 units of accommodation. As the States collectively have committed $29.3m of the $30m appropriated under the current legislation the Government considered that the program would lose momentum if there was any delay in committing funds for 1 977-78. It is for this reason that the Bill to amend the present Act is being introduced now. It will enable the States to plan for further construction in the coming financial year and thus preserve continuity in their programs. </para>
          <para>The amending legislation is intended to remove the existing requirement for the States to submit for the Commonwealth Minister&#39;s approval details of each building scheme to be financed under the program. Instead, grants will be authorised on the basis of schemes nominated by the States. Detailed planning of each project is a State responsibility and the removal of the requirement for approval is consistent with the Government&#39;s concept of Commonwealth-State relations. The Government is closely studying the reports of the Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and Health and of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care of the Aged and Infirm. Both these reports present major reviews of Government policy in relation to the care of the aged. Extension of the existing dwellings for pensioners scheme for one year will allow time for consideration of relevant recommendations of these reports and the introduction of changes considered necessary. It will also allow for consideration of the housing of the aged within the context of discussions for new CommonwealthState housing arrangements to take effect from July 1978. </para>
          <para>The additional $10m has been apportioned between the States in the same ratio as the original $30m was made available under the 1974 legislation. This was based on the numbers of single pensioners in receipt of supplementary assistance in each State. Thus the amount payable to each State in 1 977-78 will be: </para>

          </para>
          <para>The New Zealand Re-exports Act of 1924 was introduced to provide, in relation to goods which after importation into New Zealand were reexported to Australia, a concessional basis of valuation for duty purposes outside the normal valuation provisions of Part VIII of the Customs Act. This is done by providing that, subject to proper certification, the value for duty of such reexports will, with some time limit safeguards, be the sum of the current domestic value of the goods in the country of original export and the charges for placing the goods &#39;free on board &#39; for export to New Zealand, increased by a statutory 10 per cent. The Act and the reciprocal New Zealand legislation in relation to re-exports from Australia to New Zealand each no doubt served its respective purpose well for many years. However, because of faster and more frequent shipping services and the advent and development of air cargo, the facility has been little used of recent years and is seen at present as providing, for a very small number of overseas suppliers, little more than an option for filling certain orders either direct or from stocks held in New Zealand or in Australia, as the case may be. Since adoption by Australia last year of a modified Brussels Definition of Value there has been no requirement for import documents to show the current domestic value of goods in the country of export and, because of this, Australia is not able to fulfil its part in the scheme by providing the certifications required under the reciprocal New Zealand legislation. Furthermore the Brussels Convention on the Valuation of Goods for Customs Purposes, to which Australia intends to accede in due course, enjoins contracting parties to take all necessary steps as soon as circumstances permit, to conform to the provisions of the Convention which do not allow for bi-lateral agreements outside those provisions. Because of Australia&#39;s movement away from the system of valuation on which the arrangement between the two countries depends, and because of duties and obligations which Australia accepts, or will accept, in relation to the Valuation Convention, the Government has decided, in consultation with representatives of the New Zealand Government, to repeal the Act. New Zealand has indicated in the consultations to which I have referred, that it raises no objection to the repeal of the Australian legislation and it is understood that the New Zealand authorities will arrange for the repeal of their relevant regulations to coincide with the coming into effect of the Australian repeal Act. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I wish to speak briefly of an anomaly in the regulations governing the payment of tertiary student allowances. The specific case concerns a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> Smith, an elector of Western Australia, but presumably other students have been similarly affected in the past and are likely to be similarly affected in the future unless the regulation is changed. I wrote to the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> on 8 March and received a substantive reply on 1 5 April. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> was a trainee teacher bonded to the Education Department of Western Australia. He completed 2 years of a 3-year training course and received an allowance from the Department for the 2 years to 30 December 1976. In December 1976 he notified the State Education Department of his intention to transfer to Murdoch University to undertake a history and economics course, and became a full time student this year. The State Education Department did not terminate its bond until 9 March 1 977. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> did not receive the training allowance from the Western Australian Department of Education from 30 December to 9 March because he was no longer continuing with teacher training, and he did not receive any assistance under the Student Assistance Act of 1973 because regulation 34 ( 1 ) (c) states that a person is not eligible for assistance if he is a party to a training agreement. For that 10-week period between 30 December 1976 and 9 March 1977 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> fell between 2 stools, so to speak, and received no allowance from either State or Federal sources. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It seems quite clear that regulation 34(1) (c) was designed to prevent double payments of student training allowances from different authorities and of course, as such, is fully justifiable. But I doubt very much that it was intended that it should apply in this case when payment under one training agreement had been terminated but because the agreement had not been formally terminated the person was precluded from obtaining the Commonwealth assistance to which he would have been entitled had the agreement with the State authority been terminated and to which he was entitled and in fact did receive after 9 March. So I ask the Minister to give some consideration to this regulation with a view to framing some appropriate amendment that would enable a person in a case such as this and persons in the future who may be affected in this way to receive the training allowance, which I think the intention of the Act requires. I realise that there may be difficulties in setting a precedent here but I also ask the Minister to consider making an <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payment in this case for the 10 weeks from 30 December. </para>

            <para>- The matter that concerns me is the Commonwealth Employment Service administration of the relocation allowance. I have raised this matter with officers in South Australia, with the Assistant Director in South Australia and at the Estimates Committee hearing but I have still not received satisfaction that the statement of the scheme put out by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> in September has been followed. I refer to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Duthie who was living at 41 Suffolk Street, Glenelg. He is a married man with 4 children. He has been unemployed and in receipt of unemployment benefits for 6 months. He was living in one room of a flat with his mother-in-law. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>His mother-in-law received notice that she had to vacate the flat within 2 weeks. She did, and he was allowed to stay there a further 2 weeks. He had an offer of a job at Blackwood, which is about 30 miles from Adelaide. The conditions of employment included a house provided rent free. He was to be paid $70 a week for 3 days &#39; work a week with the possibility of full time work later on. He accepted the job but, having been unemployed for 6 months he had no money to get his furniture transferred to Blackwood. He applied at the Glenelg office of the Commonwealth Employment Service for assistance under the relocation scheme and was advised by an officer there that because the job was not full time he was not eligible for any assistance. </para>
          <para>Later, this matter was referred to me. I had a look at the conditions and requirements of the scheme. I rang the officer and complained that this man had been unemployed for 6 months; that he was living in one room with 4 children in a house that was rented by his mother-in-law; that he was genuinely seeking employment; that he had a job to go to but could not go unless he had about $160 to get his furniture transferred to Blackwood. The officer told me that the man did not qualify for the scheme because the job to which he was going was not a firm offer of employment. I contacted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duthie</inline> regarding this allegation from the officer that the reason he was not given relocation assistance was that he did not have a firm offer of a job. The officer had told me that this information was relayed to the office by telephone. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duthie</inline> informed me that he had not told the officer at Glenelg any such thing by telephone; that as a matter of fact he had called in to the office and told the officer about the firm job for 3 days a week at $70 a week. He said that what the officer was alleging was not quite correct. So we have a difference of opinion regarding the reason for his not getting relocation assistance. As a result of the mishandling of this matter by the officers in Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duthie</inline> not only lost the job but also lost the opportunity of a house in which he and his 4 children could have lived. </para>
          <para>For a further 8 weeks <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duthie</inline> received unemployment benefit. He looked everywhere in the State for employment. He tried at Whyalla. He even put in a full day in Nuriootpa going around wineries and vineyards seeking employment. He had an offer of a house at Nuriootpa from the South Australian Housing Trust. He could not take the house because he could not find a job. During this time he was receiving unemployment benefit at the rate of about $107 a week. The Department of Social Security paid him $856 for those <inline font-style="italic">8 weeks</inline> whereas for about $160 it could have transported his furniture to the locality where he had employment and a house. He contacted me last week to advise that he had another job and a house to go to. Again he was rejected for his relocation assistance. </para>
          <para>I rang the Glenelg office and spoke to the person who had previously told me that the reason <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duthie</inline> did not get the relocation assistance was that he did not have a firm offer of a job. I asked the officer again why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duthie</inline> did not receive the assistance when he applied the first time. The officer said that it was because it was only part time work. I reminded the officer that on the first occasion I spoke to him he had told me the reason <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duthie</inline> did not receive the assistance because he did not have a firm offer of a job. The officer went away and looked up a file. He then said: &#39;That is right. I did tell you that&#39;. </para>
          <para>Apparently the officer told me one thing and told the applicant for the relocation assistance another thing. </para>
          <para>Last Friday I again rang because the man was getting desperate. He had an offer of a job at Chapman&#39;s Factory in Nairne, about 30 miles from Adelaide. He also had an offer of a house from the South Australian Housing Trust at Brukunga, a few miles away. He was told that the Department would not pay the cost of transferring his furniture to Brukunga. I rang the Assistant Director of the Department in Adelaide and asked him whether employment had to be full time to qualify for the relocation assistance. He said &#39;I do not know. I will find out and let you know.&#39; I asked a similar question at the sitting of Estimates Committee F last Thursday and was given a similar answer. The Committee was dealing with expenditure of $200,000 for payment of relocation assistance this financial year. I refer to page 192 of transcript of Estimates Committee F of 28 April 1977. The First Assistant Secretary, Management and Secretariat Division of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations said: </para>

            <para>I can only state to the best of my knowledge the scheme relates only to full time employment or training under NEAT leading to full time employment, and similarly that the scheme relates only to people changing their permanent place of residence, and therefore excludes persons who have no permanent place of residence.

          <para class="block">So there is nothing in the application requirements to indicate that for an employee to receive relocation assistance he has to be in full  time employment. I think the officers of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations misled <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duthie,</inline> who is genuinely seeking employment. They made a mistake and are now trying to cover up for that mistake. I telephoned the person in charge of the relocation assistance scheme in the Department&#39;s central office in Melbourne and he is not aware of any provision that the employment has to be full time. Unfortunately, through this bungling and mess up in interpreting the scheme, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duthie</inline> lost the job and the house, as I previously mentioned. He was in a predicament and was very worried.  His  landlord had told him that he had to get out because the landlord&#39;s daughter-in-law was going there to live. Those people even started to move furniture into his apartment where he was living with his 4 children. Still the Commonwealth Employment Service in Adelaide would not budge and give him one cent towards having his furniture transferred to a little place 30 miles out of Adelaide. </para>
          <para>After getting the second job and the offer of a house he again made a request to the same officers in Glenelg and was told: &#39;Yes, everything will be all right this time. You will have no worries. Get 3 quotes from furniture removalists. When you have the quotes come back to me and we will make arrangements for the removalist submitting the cheapest quote to transfer your furniture to Brukunga&#39;. He obtained 3 quotes, the cheapest being $ 1 84. He was told to accept that quote and that he would receive money to pay for transferring his furniture to Brukunga. After making all the arrangements, after having his hopes built up about having a job and a house to which he could take his family, he was told: &#39;No, you are not entitled to the assistance because there are other unemployed persons in the vicinity of Nairne and Brukunga&#39;. On these 2 occasions wrong information has been given and an officer of the Commonwealth Employment Service in Adelaide has told me untruths and tried to mislead me. </para>
          <para>I still am not satisfied that the officer in Adelaide, the Assisting Director or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wood,</inline> in the information he gave at the hearings of the Estimates Committee, told us the requirements of the scheme. If they have secret requirements regarding part time and full time employment, why are we not told about them? How are we expected to find employment for people who are unemployed when they are being misled by officers of that Department in accordance with some secret document that we cannot obtain? Despite all my efforts to obtain the correct instructions about requirements for eligibility under the scheme, I am unable to do so. I do not think anybody knows, even the Minister himself, whether the application of the relocation assistance scheme applies to full time employees or part time employees. I have no doubt he will alter the scheme now to say that it applies to full time employees only. I have no doubt about that. I raise this matter to enable the Minister to correct the injustice that has been done to this family which was desperately seeking employment in South Australia. </para>
          <para>These people were so desperate that they were prepared to go anywhere interstate. Anyone who is prepared to accept a job on $70 a week with a house provided, which is $37 a week less than he was getting on unemployment benefits, to me is genuine. He should have been encouraged to take this job and the house, not told untruths by inefficient officers of the Department in Adelaide. I ask the Minister to take up with his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street,</inline> whether a gratuity should be paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duthie.</inline> This man should be reimbursed for the cost of his furniture being transported to Brukunga. Under the scheme he also should be paid the 2 weeks&#39; rental from the South Australian Housing Trust for the rented house at Brukunga and also the deposit that was required by the South Australian Housing Trust. I raise this matter in the hope that the Minister will rectify this mistake and that the same mistake will never happen again. </para>

            <para>- I refer to the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> concerning, I think, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> Smith of Parmelia in Western Australia. As I understand it- I have in front of me a copy of correspondence from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> to me and my reply to him of some weeks later- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> Smith was for 2 years a bonded student of the Western Australian Department of Education. I think it should be understood that as a bonded student- whilst I am not clear on the specific bond conditions in Western Australia, they would be similar to those in other States- he would have been receiving special privileges, special payments higher than provided for in the Tertiary Education Allowance Scheme. Studentships in general are <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> unilateral arrangements. In other words, they are not payments that can be terminated, without some degree of penalty, by the student concerned. A TEAS student of course can terminate a TEAS allowance at a time but a bond in itself is in fact a contractural instrument whereby in consideration of considerable allowances and payments made to the student during the course of 3 years the student undertakes certain commitments thereafter. It is not clear at this moment as to when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline></para>

              <para>-It is not in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> &#39;s letter. I accept his interjection that it was in December. It is clear that the Department of Education terminated his bond on 9 March. Assuming that an approach was made to the Department in December, what I do not know is the reasons for the delay of some 2 months or so in that regard; nor indeed do I know what conditions or penalties, if any, were exacted by the Department in the termination of the bond. It seems to me, on the initial perusal, that this case does not call for any alteration of the regulations; what it calls for, firstly, is an understanding of the arrangements of the bond, the discussions which may or may not have gone on between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> Smith and the Department, and some understanding of the reasons for the delay. If the matter were one on which the Department could agree to a termination on a December date for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard</inline> Smith the TEAS allowance would, of course, be retrospective. There is no provision in the regulations for any intervention at a ministerial level, nor do I think at this moment on the evidence before me that there ought to be. Once one opens such doors there are difficulties of supervision, control and equity. I simply say that I shall seek through my Department further inquiries from the Western Australian Department as to the reason for the delay of 2 months and as to whether the State Department could in any sense of equity terminate the bond at the end of December. If so, of course, the TEAS allowance could be reconsidered. </para>

            <para>- The matter that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron raised this evening concerning the application of the relocation assistance scheme to people obtaining pan time employment was, as he has said, raised by him at the meeting of Estimates Committee F last week. The officer who was present there indicated to the Committee that he would endeavour to obtain the answer for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron and the Committee. As far as I know that has not yet been given to the Committee. However, it is less than a week since the matter was raised before the Committee and the Committee finished its deliberations only this evening. In the normal course of events the information sought would be made available to the Committee in time for its report. That is the normal practice. I should hope that that would apply here. I gathered from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron&#39;s remarks this evening that the matter is perhaps more urgent than that, although I think at this stage that the particular matter regarding the repayment that has been sought is perhaps one that could await the final advice to the Committee. </para>

          <para>If I had been advised earlier in the day as to the specific point that was to be raised tonight I may have been able to obtain some information for the debate this evening. However, I was not so advised and I have not been able to obtain any information in the time available to me. I shall advise the Minister for employment and Industrial relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> of the matters that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron has raised this evening. I would simply say that the question obviously raises a matter of interpretation of the scheme, as I indicated at the Estimates Committee meeting when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron raised it. He does seem to have raised a matter of substance and no doubt of some difficulty. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline>Cameron made some fairly strong allegations of the Department in Adelaide. He spoke of mis-truths, bungling, cover-ups and one thing and another. I think that his allegations at this stage are hardly justified on the evidence that has been so far presented. As I have said, it does seem as though there is a real question at issue as to whether this scheme applies to people who obtain only part-time employment. The general replies that have been received from officers in Adelaide and at the Estimates Committee meeting certainly senior officers of the Department were before the Estimates Committee when the honourable senator raised the matter clearly indicated that in their opinion it did not apply to part-time employment. So, I think it is a little bit hard to jump to any conclusions about the inefficiencies of or whatever is alleged against the officers in the South Australian Department. It seems to me that this raises a question which may well have to be decided by the Minister himself. The matter was raised last Tuesday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Cameron. It is no doubt being considered by senior departmental officials and, for all I know, by the Minister himself at this stage. I shall simply pass on the remarks and ask that they be given more urgent consideration, although the fact that they were raised at the Estimates Committee would lead me to expect that they were indeed being given such consideration. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In answer to parliamentary Question No. 1352 on 30 November 1976 1 provided an estimate of final public sector expenditure on education in Australia for 1975-76 in relation to gross domestic product. The percentage was 6.0. A revised estimate for 1975-76 is now 5.9 per cent. For the previous five years the corresponding figures were: 1974-75. 5.7 per cent; 1973-74, 4.5 percent; 1972-73, 4.2 per cent; 1971-72, 4.1 percent; 1970-71, 3.8 percent. </para>
            <para>The figures quoted by the honourable senator for the five years preceding 1975-76 represent public sector outlay on education as a percentage of gross domestic product. The corresponding figure for 1 975-76 is 6.5 per cent. </para>
            <para>The Bureau of Statistics makes the distribution between final public sector expenditure and public sector outlay on the grounds that a significant part of outlays, e.g. student assistance, is in the form of transfer payments to the private sector. </para>
            <para>There has, therefore, been no decline in expenditure on education as a percentage of gross domestic product, from 1974-75 to 1975-76. It is not possible, at this stage, to provide a projection for 1976-77, because of difficulties in estimating GDP. </para>

            <para>In 1974, the previous Government invited the States to submit works programs for water resource development for the ensuing five to ten years as a basis for selection by the Commonwealth of projects for financial assistance in accordance with its objectives in the water area.
