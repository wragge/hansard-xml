          <para class="block">Yet in the Budget Speech delivered in this chamber by the Minister on behalf of the Treasurer, he said, under the heading &#39;Assistance to rural industry&#39;, that $ 12m would be provided for the continuation of the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy at its present level with the proposed review of that level from 1 January 1978 being postponed. My question is: Does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> know something that the Treasurer does not or is he, by a slip of the tongue, inadvertently letting the rural industries know what will happen to them if by some misfortune Labor is returned to power? </para>

            <para>- The rural industries have a lot of worries but one of their great statisfactions must be that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and his Party will never get back into power. What I ought to do here is quote exactly the situation as it affects this matter which, I think, has been the subject of some very misleading statements. Legislation to amend the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act was passed during the last session of Parliament. The provision of $40m in the Budget will enable payment of a subsidy at the rate of $12 per ton of standard superphosphate produced and sold in Australia. The scope of the bounty is extended to include crushed and calcinated rock and phosphatic materials used in stock foods. Similarly the Government has examined the operation of the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Act and has agreed that payment of the subsidy should be continued at the same rate as applied during 1977. The sum of $12m will be allocated for 1977-78. I also talked to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> about this matter and he made it clear in discussions with me that this would allow farmers to plan their fertiliser, cropping and pasture programs with some degree of confidence at a time when they were faced with many difficult problems. I think, to say the least, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s comments demonstrate above all other things his continuing thirst for inaccuracy. </para>

            <para>-My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government, follows a question already directed to him by the Leader of the Opposition. I remind the Minister that in his resignation speech the former Attorney-General said that subsequent to the Cabinet meeting of 26 July he had approached various individuals who had had some connection with the loans affair, including the Permanent Head of the Treasury and the Permanent Head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, with a view to obtaining statement or files on the matter. The former Attorney-General went on to say that he was still unable to obtain any information from those individuals. Can the Minister say whether any instructions were given by the Prime Minister or by individual Ministers to those persons in connection with any approaches made to them by the former Attorney-General? </para>

            <para>-As far as I am aware no instructions were given. Honourable senators will be well aware of the Government&#39;s stance that governments should not pry into the documents and files of their predecessors, especially concerning those matters where advice was given by members of the Public Service to Ministers. Our attitude is that such advice is given to Ministers who are members of a government for the time being. If this were not the stance, the Government believes that this would destroy the relationship of an independent Public Service in being able to give advice fearlessly and accurately to Ministers for the time being. As far as I am aware no instructions were given to public servants either to give information or to refuse information. </para>

              <para>-Senator Georges is, of course, confusing the situation of the right of the Parliament to demand answers from anybody in the community. Parliament has quite a different role in this regard. Parliament has certain rights and privileges in this matter which have been established for centuries. The answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is no in each case: </para>

In view of the fact that the Prime Minister used the loans affair to achieve government and in view of the statement apparently made by the former AttorneyGeneral that the Prime Minister wanted the Sankey case to be taken over so as to terminate it, would the Minister not consider that it would be the general public&#39;s thinking that it is rather odd, in view of the Prime Minister&#39;s previous views before the election, that he does not want the matter to be prosecuted to the full, and that if there is nothing wrong this case should proceed in order to prove that the men charged are innocent or to prove that they are guilty if they are guilty? In my own opinion it would be the public&#39;s view that the matter should be prosecuted to the fullest. </para>

            <para>-I think it would be fanto say that the Government&#39;s general view is that the matters arising out of not just the loans affair but the whole period of the Whitlam Government were well known to the public. They were tried before a jury of 6,000,000 people, who brought down their verdict on 13 December 1975, and that is the end of the matter. The idea that a government should pursue its predecessors through the courts after the electors have made a judgment just does not appeal to me. </para>

            <para>-I am afraid that the Leader of the Opposition does not quite understand the situation. I am talking about what the Government&#39;s view is. I thought the Prime Minister made it quite clear that whether to take over the case and to prosecute or not to prosecute is a matter for determination by the AttorneyGeneral for the time being, and that it is for him and him alone to make that determination. Of course, that is not to say that the AttorneyGeneral ought not to consult with his colleagues and take into account what their views are. The Prime Minister believes it to be fair enough that the Government&#39;s views be known. It is for the Attorney-General ultimately to make the decision on the case. </para>

          <para>It is not that we fear that we are likely to be prosecuted in the future. I know of no unlawful act, and we have never been accused of committing any unlawful act, for which we might be prosecuted. We have had a certain stance under the Westminster system, namely, that, the electors having changed governments, one gets on with the future. </para>

It is not in contemplation and never has been. The creation of these straw images for oneself so as to set fire to them later is a useless, unproductive exercise. The Government acknowledges the independent nature of the IAC. It always has done so. So did the previous Government. The Government acknowledges that the IAC &#39;s job is to investigate matters, to make public reports on them, which get published, to identify costs and to communicate its views to the Government. The Government can accept them, change them, reject them or send back for more informaton. Past governments, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Crawford himself and the present Government understand that the responsibility of government is to make policy decisions. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources. Is it correct that when in government the Australian Labor Party purchased 41.6 per cent of the Mary Kathleen uranium shares through a governmental instrumentality- the Australian Atomic Energy Commission- using the Australian taxpayers&#39; money, which percentage represented some 30,764,142 shares in the company, and then appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egerton,</inline> a senior trade unionist, to the Mary Kathleen board to supervise the Labor Party&#39;s interest in the mining of uranium and the production and sale of uranium oxide- yellowcake? Is it also correct that when the Labor Party was in government it entered into a memorandum of understanding with Peko-EZ to fund 72 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent of the Ranger development in return for 50 per cent of Ranger&#39;s production of yellowcake? If this is the case, following this commitment of the taxpayers&#39; money to uranium development, is not the action of the Labor Party completely inexplicable in calling for a moratorium for an indefinite period, which would mean the leaving of all Australian uranium in the ground, after having encouraged production and milling and arranged for the sale of uranium overseas? Finally, what are the people of Australia to think when they see left wing Labor endeavouring - </para>

              <para>- It is fairly obvious that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> was so involved in making his statement that he did not notice that I was on my feet taking a point of order. The point of order I am raising is that the patience of honourable senators on this side of the chamber is stretched to the point of protest when an honourable senator gives information after information in the nature of a statement rather than asking a question directly of the Minister. I put it to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that far too much information is contained in the question. </para>

              <para>-I have a very good answer. A feature of the uranium development policy of the Whitlam Government was direct Commonwealth participation. The Whitlam Government obtained a 42 per cent shareholding in Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd. On the basis of these arrangements re-commissioning of the mine commenced in 1974, and production commenced early in 1976. Production and export of uranium is continuing at Mary Kathleen and to date 690 short tons of uranium oxide have been exported for electric power generation in Japan, the United States and West Germany. Following its decision on the Mary Kathleen project, the Whitlam Government tabled in the Parliament on 31 October 1974 a statement announcing a program of large scale uranium development in the Northern Territory of Australia commencing with exploitation of the Ranger deposit to be followed by development of the Narbarlek, Jabiluka and Koongarra deposits. Together with the Whitlam Government&#39;s statement on 31 October 1974 there was also tabled in the Parliament an agreement with Peko-EZ for joint development of the Ranger deposit by the Commonwealth and those companies. The agreement was signed by the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> G. Whitlam; the then  Deputy  Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns;</inline> the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor;</inline> the  Chairman  of Peko Mines , <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Proud;</inline> and the Managing Director of the Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Ltd, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mackay.</inline> That agreement was elaborated further in a memorandum of understanding dated 28 October 1975 which also was tabled in the Parliament. The Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> G. Whitlam, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Proud</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mackay</inline> of Peko-EZ. </para>

          <para>Queensland Mines Ltd to allow early delivery to be made under the approved export contracts of those companies prior to the mines at Ranger and Nabarlek coming into production. It should be recalled that central considerations in the Whitlam Government&#39;s policy of uranium development were the economic benefits to Australia which would accrue and the responsibility Australia had as an energy-rich nation in meeting the energy needs of other countries. </para>
          <para>The Whitlam Government statement on uranium development, which was tabled in Parliament on 3 1 October 1974, opened with the following words:  . . this statement is to outline the Government&#39;s program for the rational development of uranium resources in the Northern Territory; a program which will return substantial economic benefits to Australia from our supply of this vital energy resource to our overseas trading partners who face such grave difficulties in securing their energy requirements . . . </para>

            <para>- My attention has been drawn to statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kilduff,</inline> a stipendiary magistrate in the Australian Capital Territory, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> this morning. He has drawn his complaints with a fairly wide brush and has covered quite a bit of ground. I have not had the opportunity to consider the details fully. However, it seems that the main complaint is that the number of magistrates in the Australian Capital Territory is inadequate. The situation in regard to the appointment of magistrates is that my predecessor had hoped to announce the appointment of another stipendiary magistrate within the next couple of weeks. Applicants for the position have been interviewed, and I understand that my predecessor had formed an opinion as to the recommendation he would make. Naturally, in view of the change, I will have to reconsider the matter, but I will do it as speedily as possible. However, one of the reasons for the delay and perhaps the reason for my predecessor not actually making an appointment was that one of the applicants who had been favourably considered had apparently declined the appointment, and that rather threw the question into the melting pot again. However, I will certainly look at the matter as quickly as possible. There seems to be some view abroad that 1 have only one matter on my mind at the present moment. I can assure the Senate, particularly the honourable senator who asked the question, that I have many other matters on my mind, including not only the appointment of magistrates but also the question of additional assistance to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

At that time it was pointed out that it was the tribal elders or leaders who had decided on this form of treatment for younger members of the tribe. As far as my knowledge goes, it is not Government policy but rather a method of dealing within the tribal situation with offences by younger Aboriginals.

            <para>- I have been asked a question recently along similar lines to that asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> when I did quote a section of the Trade Practices Act. I do not have it with me at the moment but I refer the Senate to the answer I gave then. I think it is sufficient to say that the right to take proceedings in regard to false and misleading advertisements is restricted under the Act in certain cases and I do not think, broadly speaking, that the sort of advertisement to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> has referred is covered under the Act. However, I do not want to give a firm opinion on that matter. Indeed, I suppose I should not be giving legal opinions at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> asked what redress can be taken. The redress that can be taken on matters of this kind is in the political arena. Redress is taken by the strength of the Government&#39;s case on this matter which is being so firmly promoted and which I am sure the electorate will understand. That is the best form of redress that can be taken against this sort of misleading advertisement. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security in that capacity and also in her capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Health. I refer to representations which have been made in most States-certainly in South Australia -on behalf of those who suffer  from coeliac disease and who, although working, are required to incur quite extensive extra costs in performing their duties because of the special foods needed. The position is that although they are not completely handicapped they face a great deal of hardship and so do the families which have children who have the disease. I have made representations to the Minister on particular cases. I ask the Minister whether there is any way in which these people- I am not referring to the totally handicapped- might be given assistance in the special cases I have mentioned? I also ask whether any special consideration can be given to school children affected with this disease who need special consideration from their superiors? </para>

            <para>- With regard to adults who incur continuing medical expenditure, there is no real assistance that I am able to mention. As far as children are concerned, the eligibility for the handicapped child&#39;s allowance is dependent on medical evidence. Each claim must be considered on its merits. The Department of Health takes into account the seventy of the handicap and any secondary disability and the ability of the child to cope with his handicap. As I announced in August, the Government has decided to extend the eligibility for the handicapped child&#39;s allowance to low income families who have the care, custody and control of the substantially handicapped child. This new eligibility will apply in respect of a child whose handicap does not fully meet the medical criteria currently applying where, because of continuing substantial expenditure associated with the child&#39;s disability, the parent or guardian is, in the opinion of the Director-General of Social Services, suffering severe financial hardship. That would cover the matter that has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> Where there is a case of a disease, particularly the disease mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> and continuing expenditure is involved and the medical criteria for eligibility are not established, the Director-General may consider that case to see whether he will allow a handicapped child&#39;s allowance to be paid to that person. </para>

There is absolutely no question of that in my mind, in the mind of the Prime Minister or in the minds of my colleagues. </para>

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. No doubt the Minister has noticed that the Hamer Government in Victoria has now joined Queensland in abolishing probate duty. Is this not partly due to the healthy condition of State revenues under the new and generous Commonwealth tax sharing scheme? Is it not also due to the final and expanding view of probate as a destructive tax, a tax on initiative, and one which militates against long term capital investment and job opportunities which follow? Will the Minister seek to maintain pressure for its early abolition in the federal arena? </para>

            <para>-Yes, I think that all those things can be fairly said to be true. Of course, in politics one is always accountable for one&#39;s past record and for having spoken publicly on certain issues. I, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Margaret</inline> Guilfoyle and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ellis</inline> Lawrie, as he then was, together worked on a Senate committee in this area with other honourable senators. We were then of the view as back bench senators that probate duty would be usefully abolished by the Commonwealth. We said so and I think we would not resile from that position. We were concerned as a committee that if the Commonwealth did this and the States were to move in and pick up the revenue, nobody would be any better off. So one is naturally very pleased to see, because of the Commonwealth&#39;s advanced financial policies towards the States under the new federalism, that the States are now in a buoyant position and can begin to move accordingly to abolish probate. What we now see is Queensland abolishing probate duty, Victoria abolishing probate duty and a massive tug of war for people, buildings and resources between those two eminent States. </para>

              <para>-Senator Cavanagh is quite right but as he has now tempted me I will go a little further because the answer is not out of order. This just points up the great dilemma, both within the Labor Party and the trade union movement, when one person, who is the head of both those bodies, cannot quite make up his mind what he wants. In fact, it ought to be remembered that the decision in Perth by the Australian Labor Party was arrived at without -as the Press said at the time- any of the heavies of the Labor Party participating. All the lightweights and the fringe lunatics evidently took part in that debate and none of the real heavies ever had any real participation in the decisionmaking of that conference. </para>

Is the Minister aware that the Australian Farmers Federation, as a result of the Government&#39;s lack of decision to alleviate the problems of the farmers, is now urging its members to use their votes against the Liberal Party and the National Country Party?

We have decided- I will be making an early announcement of this-that an interdepartmental committee and a committee of Ministers for a number of departments, including Education, Health, Foreign Affairs, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Aboriginal Affairs and my own department- maybe others as well- will work towards the observance of this Year. Further I will be announcing that we will be working with the voluntary organisations in the community and providing funds to enable a secretariat to be established. This decision of the Government has not yet been announced. I hope to be able to make such an announcement in the very near future. But it is not a year that will be observed only through the work of the Department of Social Security, but that Department is the one that will co-ordinate the efforts of all other Federal Government departments. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. It relates to a question I asked in the Senate on 27 May this year. I asked whether it would be possible for some emergency telephones to be installed along highways such as the one in Tasmania between Hobart and Kingston. My question really was whether, in view of the profit made by Telecom Australia, it could be requested to examine the installation of emergency telephones along the highway I have mentioned and the establishment of a committee to develop a policy on the installation of telephones in some areas even though there is no prospect of commercial revenue sufficient to pay for such installations. It has been quite a while since that question was asked. I am wondering whether the Minister yet has any information on it for me and, if not, whether he could have it for me by next Monday, which is when I believe the Estimates Committee concerned with the subject will be meeting. </para>

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He may remember that several weeks ago I asked him whether it was a fact that separate passports had been issued to members of an Australian parliamentary delegation visiting the Middle East- one to each of them for use in Israel and another for use on entering the Arab countries- and, if that was the case, why it was done. As I do not appear to have received an answer to this question, which the Minister told me he would obtain for me, I am wondering whether he could find out from the Minister for Foreign Affairs what is the position in regard to this subject. </para>

            <para>-I will certainly chase it up. My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack is also very interested in the subject matter of the question. The position raised is not very unusual. I remember that in 1975, when our predecessors were in office, I went to both Japan and Taiwan and the then Government issued me with two passports-a green one for entry to Japan and a blue one for entry to Taiwan. So it is evidently a practice of some standing within the Department of Foreign Affairs, perhaps to satisfy relations with other countries. I will ask about this matter as a matter of urgency and provide the honourable senator with information on it next week. </para>

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. It refers to the safety of seat belts in aircraft. I understand that it is now a general rule that seat belts in motor vehicles should fasten at the side of a passenger rather than in the middle of the body. Can the Minister state whether any investigations have been made as to the safety of aircraft seat belts which fasten in the middle? Is it not a fact that investigations have shown on occasions that significant injuries have been suffered in aircraft accidents as a result of an impact between a passenger&#39;s body and the heavy buckle of a seat belt? Will the Minister have this matter examined to see whether aircraft seat belts should fasten at the side, as is now generally the case in motor vehicles? Will the Minister also examine whether the narrow, unpadded seat belts currently in use are effective or whether some other form of belt might be of greater benefit to the safety of air passengers? </para>

            <para>-I think the matter is an important one. I think that the whole question of increased safety provisions in aircraft or motor vehicles is one that should be given keen attention. I do not know of a specific study of particular safety belts in aircraft and whether ones with centre buckles or side buckles or ones that are padded or unpadded have advantages. I will certainly bring the whole of the question to the attention of my colleague in another place and seek his comments. </para>

            <para>- Until a few days ago, as the honourable senator said, I was the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs. Up to that time I had not been aware of any general complaints about the standards of treatment and care at Greenslopes. There are always individual complaints about care at any hospital- that does crop up from time to time- but I am not aware of any general complaint of that kind about Greenslopes. I have been asked questions in the Senate about the effect of staff ceilings in hospitals. The honourable senator will recall some industrial problems at Heidelberg Hospital arising out of some complaints from the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia. The problems were all resolved. I assured the Senate then and I assure it now that there has not been any deterioration in the standard of treatment anywhere as a result of any staff ceilings. Indeed, the repatriation hospitals were treated very favourably in regard to staff ceilings. Priority at all times has been given to the need to deliver health care and medical care at the hospitals. </para>

            <para>- There are two essential features of the Commission&#39;s report. These concern the impact of the issue of guidelines by the Government on the Commission&#39;s operations, and the availability of funds to meet essential requirements for schools in the States in 1978, more particularly for government schools. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I deal first with guidelines. Guidelines are not new. The Whitlam Government first issued them in 1975 for all of the Education Commissions when it set aside the reports of the four Commissions for the 1976-78 triennium, suspended the triennial principle and directed the Commissions to present recommendations for 1976 within stipulated financial limits. The 1975 guidelines for schools specified areas to receive priority treatment. The program adopted by the Whitlam Government for 1 976 constituted a cut iri real terms in the funds available for government schools in the States and an increase in the funds available for non-government schools. </para>
        <para>For the program year 1977, the present Government, in the process of applying appreciable restraint to Commonwealth Government expenditure, also found it necessary to provide guidelines with financial limits and priority areas to the Schools Commission. However, we gave a 2 per cent real growth in funds for schools over the 1976 levels and in doing so provided for a real increase in expenditure for both government and non-government schools. </para>
        <para>In the context of current and prospective economic circumstances, our Government has issued guidelines for the 1978 program year which provide for grants for schools in the States totalling $5 71m, in December 1976 prices, as the base level for the programs of the Schools Commission during 1978. This total amount is the same in real terms as was provided in 1977, subject to a modification of the cost supplementation procedures. </para>
        <para>The guidelines for 1978 contain a number of specifications, including the continuation of special purpose programs for disadvantaged groups, the retention of the automatic link between recurrent grants to non-government schools and expenditure in government schools, together with the first step towards the restoration of the principle cf a basic per capita grant to ail non-government schools equal to 20 per cent of running costs per pupil in government schools and an increase in capital funds for nongovernment schools to assist building programs in newly expanding areas of population. Within the no-growth situation for direct grants for schools, the Government proposed that approximately $4m of the amount of about SI 4m needed to meet the specifications in respect of non-government schools, should be found by reductions in the programs for services and development and ibr special projects, which apply to both government and non-government schools. </para>
        <para>In its report, the Schools Commission has acknowledged that under its Act it is obliged to carryout tasks referred to it by the Minister and to report in a way consistent with the guidelines. It sees the Schools Commission Act as giving it also a continuing obligation to report on the needs of schools for buildings, equipment, staff and other facilities and the respective priorities to be given to the satisfying of those needs. I have no quarrel with that point of view. However, the action taken by the Government has in no way impeded the Commission in discharging its responsibilities under the Schools Commission Act. 1 believe it is important to keep clearly in mind the essential role and responsiblity of the Schools Commission. lt operates as an advisory body to the Government to assist it with measures of financial assistance for the benefit of schools and school systems in the States, and also in the Territories. The obligation under its charter to report on the needs of schools and of priorities within those needs cannot be discharged in isolation from the issue of financial resources likely to be available to the Commonwealth, and indeed to the States and the non-government school authorities. Experience since the days of the Interim Committee, and also with other advisory commissions in education, demonstrates this fact. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the second essential feature of the Schools Commission report; that is, the availability of funds for government schools in the States in 1978. In my view, the Commission has ignored the very real capacity the States have to continue to maintain the level of resources in their own schools. It has not taken proper account of all the financial resources available to the State governments. The States obtain funds ibr their schools from their own revenues and from general purpose grants from the Commonwealth, as well as from the specific purposegrants under the Schools Commission program. A significant factor in the increased efforts the States have made in respect of their own schools in recent years has been the increasing genera! financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth. Since it came into office our Government, in pursuance of its federalism policy, has responded to the demands of all States by giving them increased resources and therefore greater capacity for the exercise of discretion and determination of priorities under the revised income tax sharing arrangements. I remind the Senate that in the current financial ye.tr the Commonwealth will be making available to the States $4.336m under the tax sharing arrangements, which is an increase of more than $600 m over 1976-77 and at least $10Om more than their estimated entitlement under the former uniform tax formula. This represents an increase of nearly 17 per cent over the last financial year, significantly larger than the expected rate of inflation, and will permit the States to further increase their spending on schools if they wish. </para>
        <para>At a number of places in its report the Commission has acknowledged the facts of the substantially improved position of government schools, and I illustrate: &#39;Resources in most government school systems are about to reach or have already reached the improvement targets set&#39;- see paragraph 3.15; and &#34;States have continued to impove their own allocations for recurrent purposes in recent years and if the trend continues reductions in Commonwealth grants would slow down rather than halt that improvement&#39;- see paragraph 3.9. These comments are supported by statistical material in Appendix B to the Commission&#39;s report, including evidence that between 1972 and 1976 recurrent resource usage for primary students increased by 37 per cent in government schools compared with 27 per cent in non-government schools, and for secondary students by 29 per cent in government schools compared with 26 per cent in non-government schools. Furthermore, the percentage of total budget devoted to schools for all States increased from 26.3 per cent in 197 1-72 to 28.4 per cent in 1975-76 and to an estimated 29.4 per cent in 1976-77 for recurrent expenditure, and on a three-year average basis from 18.6 per cent for the period ending 1971-72 to an estimated 22.9 per cent for the period ending 1976-77 for capital expenditure (Table B.8). Against this background it would have been reasonable for the Commission to assume a further expansion of effort in the year ahead on the part of the States for government schools. </para>
        <para class="block">The Commission has also noted that the Commonwealth&#39;s direct contribution to government schools in the States constitutes about 7 per cent of the total recurrent resources used and about 30 per cent of total capital programs- see paragraph 3.7. This fact emphasises the importance for state schools of the continued flow of general purpose funds from the Commonwealth to the States, and these in fact have been increased as previously noted. The Commission has acknowledged that in the light of the events since 1972 the assumption of the Interim Committee for the Schools Commission in 1973 that resource improvements in government schools would bc met increasingly from specific purpose Commonwealth grants is no longer tenable- see paragraph 3.16. </para>
        <para>The Commission appears to have ignored these facts about the position of state schools in reaching the conclusion that &#39;it would be unwise to rely on continuance of past trends, particularly in relation to reduction in grants without reasonable notice&#39;- see paragraph 3.9- and in recommending a rephrasing of the guidelines <inline font-style="italic">to avoid</inline> the transfer of $5m out of a total of $342m for government schools- see paragraph 5.4. Nor has the Commission appeared to have taken any account of the specific statement in the guidelines that the Government expects the States to continue to discharge their own financial responsibilities to both government and nongovernment schools and has noted their significantly improved financial capacity to do so- see Appendix A, paragraph 4. The burden of the States will be further eased by relatively small projected increases in school enrolments. Overall government enrolments are unlikely to rise by more than one-half of one per cent next, year, and will fall steadily from 1978 on for at least the next five years. </para>
        <para>In view of the substantial improvement in States&#39; revenues, a reduction of $5m in Schools Commission funds ought to be reasonably capable of being absorbed. It is important to keep the impact of the Government&#39;s guidelines in perspective. Of the $57 1m available for 1978, $566m is for programs which continue established patterns, including close to $9m for the additional cost of automatically linking grants to the non-government schools to per capita expenditure in government schools. This particular policy was introduced for 1977 following a recommendation from the Schools Commission and will be continued. It should be noted also that in its present report the Schools Commission has stated that even without a direction from the Government it would have recommended a continuation of this linking arrangement, notwithstanding the overall no-growth situation. </para>
        <para>Within the relatively small reallocations made necessary by the guidelines, the Commission recommended that savings of $3. 5m be found from the joint programs for services and development and for special projects. The Government made the suggestion that an amount of the order of $4m be found there in the belief that it would assist in maintaining at very close to existing levels those programs- in particular the general recurrent program for government schoolswhich were relatively inflexible. The Commission has also found a saving of $300,000 in the fund for emergency assistance to nongovernment schools suffering a drop in country enrolments. </para>
        <para>It is the marginal sum of $5m-$3m as a contribution towards the long identified problem of non-government schools in providing places for newly expanding areas of population and $2m as the first step in bringing the per pupil grants from the Commonwealth to non-government schools in the States back to 20 per cent of running costs per pupil in government schools- which has presented difficulties for the Commission and has caused it to recommend a reconsideration of the guidelines. As to the first of these measures, the Commission has acknowledged the severe shortage of capital funds for both government and non-government schools and also the pressure to make non-government schooling available in newly developed areas, but in its judgment gives a higher priority to maintaining the Commonwealth contribution to both general recurrent and general capital programs in government schools. In doing so it has ignored the financial position of the States. </para>
        <para>As to the 20 per cent principle as a minimum contribution to the running costs of all nongovernment schools, the Commission has had no regard to the Government&#39;s policy or, it appears, to the fact that most States are already assisting non-government schools at the 20 per cent ratethe Tasmanian Government has just announced in its present, budget that its grants to nongovernment schools will in future be equal to 20 per cent of the cost of educating children in State schools. It is worth noting also that in the beginning of 1973 the Whitlam Government adopted, and subsequently maintained, the 20 per cent principle in determining the level of State-type per capita grants to non-government schools in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory in addition to the national grants under the Schools Commission program. </para>
        <para>In these circumstances, I have no hesitation in stating that the Government will not adopt the recommendation of the Schools Commission that it amend the guidelines. We will make our decisions having regard to those allocations of the Commission which are consistent with the guidelines. These decisions will be taken and announced as soon as the Government has had an opportunity to look at the report in more detail and has received comments from the States and the non-government school authorities. </para>
        <para>I want to mention one other aspect of the Commission&#39;s report. The report deals essentially with the recommendations for the year 1978. The Commission intends early in 1978 to produce a further report containing a detailed review of issues and needs for the period 1979-81. I accept that this is an appropriate course, having particular regard to the limited time available since the issue of the guidelines. I foreshadow that the Tertiary Education Commission, whose report should be available shortly, intends to proceed in a similar fashion. The second stage report from the Schools Commission will be helpful to the Government in formulating fresh guidelines for the rolling triennium to commence in 1979. 1 seek leave to move a motion to take note of the paper. </para>

          <para>- The statement which has been made by the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> was accompanied by the Schools Commission report which is, of course, quite a detailed document. I thank the Minister for giving me a copy of the statement at about 9 o&#39;clock this morning. As honourable senators will realise, it has been impossible for me to study this report in detail. In the time that I have had to look at it one thing has become apparent and that is that this report slams this Government&#39;s education policies. If we have ever seen a breakdown between a government and a statutory commission- an advisory commission- we are seeing it now. This Government deserves the criticism that is contained in this report from the Schools Commission. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I realise that we have Estimates to deal with and that the Senate should be adjourning now. But I am not going to pass up the opportunity to refer to some extracts in this report so that we can see the collision that has occurred because of the policies followed by this Government in the area of education. I want to put to rest again one argument which we continually hear put forward by this Government, particularly by the Minister, about the way the Labor Government cut expenditure on education. The Government has overlooked the fact that in the last Budget of the Labor Government- the 1975 Budget- there was an increase in the appropriation for education. There was an increase in the Budget and that is where it counts. We should take no notice of the bulge in capital expenditures over two year programs which the Minister relies upon to defend his argument. The allocation for education was increased in the first year of the Labor Government by $237m. In those three years of Labor in office the average increase in real terms in allocations to education was 41 per cent. I ask honourable senators to compare that with the record of the first two years of this wonderful Government with its new federalism policy. It has increased the allocation to education by one per cent. Yet honourable senators opposite have the neck to come into the Senate chamber and talk about cuts in education in the third year of the Labor Government when the most they can do is squeeze the entire education system and give it a one per cent average increase over the first two years they have been in office and admit in this statement that funds are now frozen for education. That is the total picture of what this Government is doing under this new federalism policy. </para>
        <para>But there is something more damaging than that. As I have said many times in the Senate, it is up to the government itself to determine how much money it is prepared to give to any sector and it reserves the right to amend any commissions&#39; recommendations within the financial guidelines and the financial responsibilities that governments have. I do not argue with that. We did it ourselves in 1975. It is a perfectly legitimate exercise. But there is an important difference here. The Labor Government established the Schools Commission for two basic reasons. The first was that it would take out this running argument, this running sore, that had been going on in this country for so long between the non-government and the government school sector- the so-called State aid argument. It was divisive to us as a community and it was bad for the education system. We introduced the Schools </para>
        <para>Commission for the purpose of allocating funds on a needs basis so that it did not matter whether it was a government school or a non-government school. If on the criteria established by the Commission a school was justified in receiving government support, it would receive that support. </para>
        <para>Having done that, we as a government accepted the manner in which the Commission determined those needs. Within the financial strictures that any government must apply, we adopted the principle that the Commission should be the body to advise the government where those needs existed. This Government is throwing that principle overboard and the Commission recognises that in this report. It is telling the Government and the whole of the education system of Australia what the position is. I hope that every educationist, every school teacher and every parent in Australia who has a child at school is mindful of what this means. The Commission states in paragraph 1.6 on page 2 of the report: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The guidelines for the 1977-79 triennium did not contain directions about how the funds were to be allocated within the total funds available. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">We have a different story now in 1978. 1 might add that when the Labor government was in power and there was a need for the government of that day to restrict in its third year of expenditure the amount that was being allocated to education- after, as I have just indicated, an average 41 per cent increase in real terms in expenditure on education in those three years, including that third year, compared to the miserly one per cent increase in expenditure provided by this Government- this is what the Minister of the day wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr McKinnon,</inline> the  Chairman  of the Schools Commission, on 19 August 1975: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I would expect the Commission to take account of the Government&#39;s guidelines that I have referred to above in preparing its recommendations.

        </quote>
        <para>The importance of these two letters was that the Labor Government was not saying to the Schools Commission that it would determine where the money goes and that the Government and not the Commission would say where the priorities and the needs lie; it was saying that it would still accept the Commission&#39;s right to advise the Government on where the priorities and the needs lie. Finally, in the statement concerning the 1976 program by the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> presented in the House of Representatives he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>At my request the Schools Commission has provided a Report which makes recommendations on programs for 1976 within these amounts, and accords with the guidelines laid down by the Government. This Report is based on a previous one by the Schools Commission, which I commend to the House, on 4 June last. </para>
          <para>The Government is pleased to endorse the three basic themes for the Report, laying emphasis as they do on equality, on more open attitudes to educational issues and on wider participation in decision-making by the school community. </para>
          <para>The Government also endorses the Commission&#39;s wish to ensure a more adequate flow of information to the Government and the public concerning the intended and actual use of Australian Government grants. </para>

        <para class="block">Then he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>All the program recommendations are accepted, with a modification to the method of administering grants to nongovernment schools. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The important point is that the Labor Government said that the Schools Commission would still retain the right to advise the Government on needs. The thing that has really upset the Commission and which has been coming for the last several months is the fact that that principle now is thrown overboard. I know I cannot take much time- there will be an opportunity to debate this in greater depth next week- but I take this opportunity to read into the record a couple of comments by the Commission. Paragraph 1.9 of the Schools Commission report dated August 1977 states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Commission views very seriously the implications of such prescriptive guidelines. In its July 1976 Report ... the Commission noted a distinction between reporting on needs without financial restrictions and the task of advising the Government on the pattern and priorities for expenditure within given levels of funding. Either of these circumstances would allow the Commission to give useful advice on the priorities which ought to be given to various needs. The 1977 situation is different in principle because most of the internal priorities have already been established by direction making it difficult for the Commission fully to exercise its responsibilities under the Act. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Paragraph 1.10 states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Act requires the Commission when writing reports to undertake consultation with all interested parties. Prescriptive guidelines not only pre-empt the nature of the Commission&#39;s advice but threaten the consultation and decisionmaking process by which competing needs and priorities, within and between the government and non-government sectors, can be reconciled. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Paragraphs 1.11 comes to the heart of what I was saying earlier about the divisive nature of this education debate over the years-divisiveness which the Commission has done so much to remove. It states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A feature of the Commission&#39;s work since its inception has been its success in drawing together the diverse interests in government and non-government sectors. Traditional barriers between these sectors have been substantially reduced and individuals and groups within them have been encouraged to work together in the common interests of educating all Australian school children to the best possible standards. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This is not Labor Party propaganda. This is included in the report of the Schools Commission. It goes on: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The operation of the Commission&#39;s joint programs and the development of formal and informal planning relationships between government and non-government schools and systems are significant examples of the evolution of this consensus. This is a major outcome of the Commission&#39;s work over the past four years and indeed may be one of the major achievements of the Commonwealth in its role in Australian education. The Commission views with great concern the implications of the guidelines for the maintenance of the situation. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is a clear statement. I personally congratulate the Commission for having the courage to spell out in a document to this Parliament exactly where this Government is taking education in this country. I could read many of these extracts to the Senate today, but I know that there is not the time to do so and that there are many other things with which we need to deal. We will have the opportunity later. </para>
        <para>I will refer to just one other matter which I think should be referred to, and that is the manner in which the Minister&#39;s statement misinterprets what the Commission has said. The Commission is accused of not taking into account the alleged better fund-raising capacities of the States. This is a favourite theme of the Minister for Education, who is also in charge of Federal affairs. On page 7 of Budget Paper No. 7 the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> shows once again the percentage increases in payments to the States for a whole range of matters, including education. He shows there that in the first year of the Labor Government there was a 2 1 per cent increase in payments to the States. In the second year of the Labor Government there was a 53 per cent increase in payments to the States. These are total payments. That is what we are concerned about. In the third year of the Labor Government the increase was 29 per cent. In the first year of the new federalism there was a crash to 9.5 per cent, and this year the estimate is for a further crash to 9.2 per cent. Yet we are told that the States will have to pay more and more of their education bills. </para>
        <para>The Commission is accused of not taking into account what is allegedly the States&#39; better capacity to finance education. I suggest that the Commission has done its homework just as well as this Government. In fact, I suggest that it has done it much better. On page 5 of the Minister&#39;s statement we find this sentence: </para>

          <para>The Commission has acknowledged that in the light of the events since 1972 the assumption of the Interim Committee for the Schools Commission in 1973 that resource improvements in government schools would be met increasingly from specific purpose Commonwealth grants is no longer tenable- see paragraph 3.16. </para>

        <para class="block">I suggest that that is a deliberate misrepresentation of what the Commission says in paragraph 3.16. This is what the Commission says: </para>

Obviously the Commission recognises that there is a need for a reallocation of input, but under no circumstances could one interpret that to mean what is contained in the Minister&#39;s statement. It was inevitable, and has been for some time, that this would happen-that the Schools Commission would jack up on this Government- because it is sick of the way it is being interfered with. The whole of the programs it develops, the tremendous amount of detailed information it receives and the tremendous amount of work that goes into them is just being thrown out the window. The Commission can see the thin end of the wedge now. For straight out political purposes, this Government will destroy the principles which have been enunciated so ably in the paragraph that I read a few minutes ago. I suggest that this is indicative of where the Government is taking us in the education field. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Although there are no separate statistics available, imports of scallops from North America are understood to have been high in recent months. </para>
            <para>Over the past two years scallop landings in North America have approached record levels. These high catches have been related primarily to the abundance of scallops spawned in 1972 which began to reach harvestable size in 1975. </para>
            <para>These catches have had a depressing effect on world scallop prices generally. For example, wholesale prices in the United States currently average about $A4. 10 kg, a fall of 33 per cent compared with early 1976. Present prices to fishermen in Queensland are$A2.00 kg compared with over $A3.00 kg last year. </para>
            <para>The low overseas prices combined with a shortage of supplies earlier this year resulted in Australian importers ordering considerable quantities of scallops overseas. The arrival of these imports has coincided with the prospects of a good catch in Queensland and the market is now over-filled. &#91;understand that as a result of this situation importers have stopped ordering from overseas and the level of scallop imports is expected to fall over the next few months. </para>
            <para>The question of the protection or other assistance to the fishing industry is being examined by the Industries Assistance Commission. Hearings were held in capital cities in June 1977 and it is anticipated that a draft report for public comment will be produced later this year. </para>
            <para>I would suggest that scallop fishermen and all other parties affected by imports present their case at the final Industries Assistance Commission hearing following publication of its draft report in order that their point of view be reflected in the Commission&#39;s report to the Government. </para>

On 1 1 August I conveyed to the New South Wales and South Australian Premiers and the  Chairman  of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack, the Government&#39;s decision to accept the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission not to vary the rates of assistance for shipbuilding, as payable under the legislation introduced by the previous Commonwealth Government. </para>
            <para>In coming to this position the Government took carefully into account the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, as well as the views put forward by the South Australian and New South Wales Governments, the union movement and other organisations and individuals in Whyalla and Newcastle. A special Commonwealth/State Task Force reported on the social implications of a decline in shipbuilding for Whyalla and Newcastle. In these circumstances there would seem to be nothing to gain from establishing yet another committee to report on the industry. </para>
            <para>It is accepted that the decision taken is likely to lead to the decline of large ship construction in Australia. The Government&#39;s evaluations show conclusively, however, that the cost  to the community oi&#34; the assistance needed to protect the future of the shipbuilding industry would be well beyond the level that could tie justified on economic, social and defence grounds. </para>

            <para>A full-scale investigation into the effects of television generally, and television advertising in particular, on the minds and outlook of children would, of course, represent a very lengthy and most costly task. A vast amount of money and effort has gone into research of this nature in a number of countries overseas and many of the studies have provided considerable insight into the possible influence of television on children. However, I understand that few of these projects have provided definitive answers to some of the more critical questions on the manner in which television may effect the young, and that there is also frequent disagreement among some of the experts on the interpretation of many of the findings. </para>
            <para>Some relevant research has also been carried out within academic institutions in Australia which has contributed to our knowledge on this matter, but naturally has not matched the scale of some of the overseas effort. </para>
            <para>My Department has noi been involved in research in this area as it is one which is closely linked with station programming and therefore would be more appropriately undertaken by the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </para>
            <para>While a number of studies to viewer reaction or response to various aspects of programming have at times been carried out by the ABC or the former Australian Broadcasting Control Board, no major study of the magnitude required to investigate the wide range of complex and inter-relating factors involved in assessments of the overall effects of television have been carried out by an authority within my jurisdiction. </para>
            <para>I am extremely conscious however, that this is a most vital and important area of research, and data available from local sources or overseas is being closely monitored. </para>

            <para>- On Tuesday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> asked me a question without notice relating to the future of the Bulimba Hostels Pty Ltd in Brisbane. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have since inquired into the questions raised. I have received a submission from the Department relating to the Hostel. I have not yet acted on that submission. </para>
          <para>The Bulimba Hostel is located on Commonwealth land at Brisbane Street, Bulimba, an inner suburb of Brisbane. The complex comprises six timber and asbestos cement buildings of World War II vintage. </para>
          <para>The property was initially operated as a Commonwealth Hostel until 15 July 1946 when it was leased to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs H.</inline> G. Lamble, who have continued to operate the hostel to date, recently as a private company. </para>
          <para>The buildings have now reached the end of their economic life. They have been the subject of reports from the Department of Construction, the Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board and the Brisbane City Council. </para>
          <para>The hostel currently houses some 320 persons, primarily aged pensioners and other recipients of social security payments. </para>
          <para>The present lease is due to expire on 30 September and in the light of the condition of the buildings the Chief Property Officer for Queensland advised the lessees in May 1976 that the lease would not be renewed. The lessees have been offered a three month carry-over from 1 October 1977 to wind down operations. </para>
          <para>My main concern is for the welfare of the people living in the Hostel. If it is closed there will be a need to make arrangements for alternative accommodations. As a result I intend to have discussions with my colleagues as to what assistance can be provided. I shall not make any decisions on the future of the building until those discussions have taken place, and I am satisfied that the welfare of those people has been protected. </para>

            <para>-On 6 September 1977 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> asked me a question about the problems of Kambalda and the stockpile of nickel. I have been advised by the Minister for National Resources that he has arranged in conjunction with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations for senior officials of the Departments of National Resources and Employment and Industrial Relations to visit Kalgoorlie next week for urgent discussions with local authorities, the mining company and unions to assess the extent of the problem caused by the nickel industry retrenchments and report back to the Ministers. Regrettably the world nickel industry of which Australia is a leading exporter, is iri a depressed state with producers &#39; stocks at an all time high. Leading Canadian producers have cut production in an attempt to bring some semblance of order into a deteriorating market. Unfortunately, it seems that it might take some years for the market situation to improve. Given the already high level of stocks in the industry and the acute over-supply situation, continued accumulation of stocks does not icem to offer a realistic solution. The Government is however, most mindful of the likely serious impact of the nickel industry retrenchments in the Kalgoorlie region and the officials will be reporting back to Ministers. </para>
