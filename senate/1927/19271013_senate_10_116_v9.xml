                    <para>- During the visit to Australia of the Empire Parliamentary Association, reference was made, particularly by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the Hon.</inline> F. L. Schaffner, to the desire of the Government of Canada to presentto this Senate a chair for the use of the  President.  The offer was accepted, and drawings of a chair, together with samples of the fittings of this chamber, were forwarded to Canada. The chair, which is made of Canadian timhers, bus now arrived, and is being used by me, for the first time, to-day. It is particularly appropriate that the Government of a sister Dominion should follow the example set by the members of the British Parliament, when not long ago they presented to the House of Representatives a chair for the use of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> This Parliament is now in the unique position of having in one branch of the legislature a chair presented for the use of the presiding officer by the Mother of Parliaments, and in the other a chair presented for the use of the  President  by the Government of a sister Dominion. I know that I am voicing the sentiments of honorable senators when I express my appreciation of this very appropriate and excellent gift. </para>

                    <para>That this Senate recordsits high appreciation of the gift of the chair which the Government of Canada has been so graciously pleased to make to this Parliament for the use of the  President  of the Senate of the Commonwealth. We value it for what it is - a splendid example of the products of Canada and the handicraft of her people. We shall treasure it for what it represents - the friendly interestof the citizens of our great sister Dominion in our welfare and progress - and shall cherish it as another link binding together our peoples in common loyalty to one Throne, and as integral parts of one Empire, within which we enjoy the heritage of our great free parliamentary institutions. </para>

                <para class="block">As the  President  remarked, it is fitting that the Senate should be the recipient of a chair, from the great sister Dominion of Canada, for the use of its presiding officer. The chair reveals not only the beauty of Canada's timbers, but also the excellent craftsmanship of her artisans. It will be a constant reminder of the freedom which we and. our sister dominions enjoy within the Empire, and of our common heritage from the Mother of Parliaments. We accept the gift with a keenappreciation of the generosity of the Government of Canada. Its presence in this chamber will be a constant reminder to us that Canada and Australia are part of the one great Empire, and that both owe allegiance to the one Crown. </para>

                    <para>. - With very great pleasure I second the motion expressing our thanks for, and appreciation of, the splendid gift we have received from the Government of Canada. We shall value the chair not only for its intrinsic worth and its excellent workmanship, but also because it symbolizes the ties that exist between the people of this country and those of the sister Dominion of Canada. We appreciate the kindly thought that prompted the gift, which will be the companion of the chair presented to another place by the British Parliament. Its presence in this chamber will, I feel sure, constantly remind us of the bond that now exists between this country and Canada, and strengthen the friendship that exists between the people of the two Dominions. On behalf of honorable senators on your left, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I support the motion moved by the Acting Leader of the Senate. </para>

Under an arrangement between the Commonwealth Government and the governments of the five mainland States and the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, an exhaustive investigation is now taking place into the tobacco growing industry in Australia, with a view to placing it on a sound basis. The results of this investigation will be made available to the States Governments, which will be responsible for disseminating such results amongst growers and others interested. </para>

                            <para>Yes. Up to the present the Federal Capital Commission has conducted a limited city omnibus service, but it recently called for tenders for the conduct of an adequate service to meet present development. After negotiation with the lowest tenderer, a satisfactory proposal was submitted, and has been accepted by the commission, under which a city omnibus service to meet the present needs of Canberra will be conducted in the near future and under conditions which are to the financial advantage of the commission, and ensure that the public will be properly protected and served, as the undertaking must be conducted in conformity with the provisions of the Motor Traffic Ordinance 1926-27. The same company will also conduct a taxi-cab and hire-car service in the Territory at rates equivalent to those prevailing in Sydney. Such services must also be carried on subject to the control provided by law. </para>

                            <para>As the new arrangements for the conduct of the amended service have already been brought to finality, there would not appear to be any advantage in reviewing the matter at this stage. Although the Federal Capital Commission might have dealt with this matter entirely within the scope of its authority, it nevertheless consulted the Government, which concurred in the action taken. The service to be provided will be an advantage to the public and will relieve the commission of the necessity for investing considerable capital and turning its organization into a channel which it did not desire to enter in view of the many other urgent matters calling for its attention at the present time and in the immediate future. The commission already has heavy responsibility in operating such municipal services and facilities as water supply, sewerage, lighting, power, roads, stormwater drainage, fire brigade, abattoirs and similar activities, in addition to the administration of many  important matters that are outside the ordinary municipal sphere, and it was felt that, as private enterprise had not taken a very active part in the development of Canberra, the necessity to conduct a more extensive omnibus service afforded a fitting opportunity for its co-operation. </para>

                <para>The amendment is a very simple one. It is easily understood, and I hope it will have the support of a majority of the Committee. My object is to free the Senate from the evil effects of party influences. The objective of the framers of the Constitution was that the Senate should be a chamber of revision and review, and the defender of State rights. It was to be an entirely independent part of the legislative machine, subject to no party influences - a chamber in which there should be complete freedom of discussion. In fact, it was designed to provide a healthy check upon anything that might be done hastily in another place. Its Constitution was debated at length by the several conventions. One section of opinion desired the Senate to be elected by the State legislatures; another wished it to be elected on a limited franchise; and a third section, which was in the majority, advocated its election under the present system. As at present constituted, the Senate does not meet the requirements of the people of Australia, nor does it fulfil the purpose intended by the framers of the Constitution. The adoption of the present method was due, in my opinion, to an excess of democratic zeal on the part of members of the convention which finalized the details of the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- Those who favoured the election of the Senate by popular vote urged that equal representation would make it a strong branch of the legislature, and so that senators might be free from divisional influences and interests they provided that each State should be polled as one electorate. However, matters have not worked out according to those high ideals. A good deal of valuable work was done by the Senate in the early days of federation simply because there was no strict regimentation of parties within its four walls. </para>

                        <para>- I may deal with that aspect of the position on another occasion. I wish for the moment to confine my attention to the amendment which I have submitted. The Senate rarely attempts to amend a bill sent here from another place. Ministers bring down a measure, tells us it represents  Government  policy, and ask the Senate to endorse it. On many occasions honorable senators have voted against their honest convictions merely to save the Government from a difficulty. Under existing conditions the usefulness of the Senate is destroyed. If it continues on these lines it is facing certain  suicide. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. The amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> is not competent for several reasons. The qualifications for a seat in the Senate cannot be affected by anything that may be done in this way. The matter is governed by certain provisions in the Constitution, and they may not be amended by the insertion of a proposed new section in the Electoral Act. I submit that the amendment of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> has given notice is not within the competence of the Senate, as it purports to interfere with the qualifications or disqualifications of senators. That, cannot be done by amending an electoral bill, but only by an amendment of the Constitution. The amendment is a violation of the provisions of the Constitution inasmuch as it attempts to determine who shall be eligible for election as senators. The provisions of the Constitution governing the qualifications for election to Parliament are rigid, and until they are amended in the proper manner must be adhered to. I submit that the amendment is an attempt to override the provisions of the Constitution, and that it is also outside the ambit of the bill we are now discussing. </para>

                        <para>- Whilst I do not agree with the amendment of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> has given notice, I cannot support the point of order raised by the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> McLach-Ian).  He contends that it is not within' the power of the Senate to say who shall and who shall not be qualified to act as senators. Such is not the case, because the Parliament itself determined that a member of a State Parliament could not be nominated for the Federal legislature until, he had resigned his seat. If it is within the power of the Senate to legislate in that way, it is also within our power to amend the bill in the manner <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> suggests. </para>

                        <para>- I have not had an opportunity to peruse the provisions of the Constitution, but I think the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> will find that in connexion with the election of senators it provides for certain qualifications until " the Parliament otherwise provides." It is within the power of this Parliament to alter the qualifications, as has been done on two or three occasions by an amending electoral bill. For instance, a member of a State Parliament was precluded from nominating for election as a senator until he had resigned his seat in the State Legislature. If the amendment of which I have given notice embodies a breach of the Constitution, the amending legislation to which I hive referred is also unconstitutional. Some time later we went even further when Tasmania attempted to override the Commonwealth law. I now find that section 34 of the Constitution provides that "Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the qualifications of a member of the House of Representatives shall be as follows." Then follow the qualifications. Section 16 of the Constitution provides that the qualifications of a senator shall be the same as those of a member of the House of Representatives. The section further provides  that a candidate must be of the full age of 21 years, and must also he an elector, &amp;c. We cannot alter the term that senators are to serve, neither can we alter the representation of the States; hut we can alter the qualifications of a senator. </para>

                    <para>- I rule that the point of order taken by the Minister cannot be sustained. The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> is in order. Neither this Senate nor Parliament itself is, under the Constitution, charged with the responsibility of interpreting the Constitution. So far as my knowledge goes, it has always been the practice in the Senate foi the  President,  when a point of order affecting the interpretation of the Constitution has been raised, to declare that it is within the power of the Senate to do as it pleases so long as its standing orders are observed. The standing orders do not require the Senate to interpret the Constitution. That is the function of the High Court. As has already been pointed out, Ave have on other occasions added to the grounds on which certain persons may be prevented from voting at an election and from taking their seats as members of this parliament. In sub-section 4 of section 39 of the Electoral Act it is provided :: - </para>

                        <para>- I have brought forward this amendment with the object of drawing public attention to what I consider is a great weakness in connexion with the representation of electors in the Senate. To accomplish my objective by an alteration of the Constitution would be difficult ;. but believing - a belief which is now an assurance because of the ruling of the Temporary  Chairman  - that there is power under the Constitution for Parliament to alter the qualifications for membership of the Senate, I adopted this method of endeavouring to make the Senate what the framers of the Constitution believed it should be. It may be said that I have departed from the democratic principles which I held at one time. That is not so. In my opinion there should be <inline font-style="italic">an"</inline> alteration of the existing practice of filling vacancies in the Senate by a vote of the members of the State legislature. </para>

My object in bringing it forward is, however, to <inline font-style="italic">pre.serve</inline> the dignity of the Senate, to magnify its strength, and to make it what it was intended to be - a strong, virile body above the strife of party warfare. While I have the opportunity I shall do what I can to get the Senate back to first principles, to make honorable senators free individuals, and the Senate an institution which will be respected by all sections of the comunity. If the Senate continues to act as it has acted during recent years it will destroy itself. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> has brought forward this amendment. If he wants the Senate to be the strong, virile, independent body to which he has referred, he can assist to make it so by tendering his resignation as a member of it. The honorable senator is out of touch with public sentiment throughout Australia. I remind him that he would not now be a member of the Senate if ha had not at one time been a member of a party organization. For many years <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> was a prominent member of the Labour party.  His  presence in this chamber is directly due to his former activity as a member of that party. </para>

                            now desires to destroy the foundation of a democratic edifice. Subject to certain, limitations it is the right of every adult to aspire to membership of the Senate. The honorable senator proposes, by his amendment, to abolish that well -won right.

That was about the year 1913, when the Opposition consisted of five members of the party that now sits opposite. That practice has since prevailed, and I do not think it has done any harm. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> argued that the Senate is useless. I point out that, except in relation to the initiation of legislation dealing -with finance, its powers are co-equal with those of the other branch of the legislature. Where I say it has acted wrongly is in having fallen into the habit of waiting for .legislation to be initiated by another place. That, however, is' not a reason for our acceptance of the amendment. We hear a great deal about interference with the liberty of the subject. This would certainly interfere with the right of citizens to attempt to win a seat in this chamber. I do not think that a parliament will ever be elected without the aid of party organizations; human nature will first have to be radically altered. </para>

                    <para>.- - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> ought to recognize that it was the party machine which first introduced him to public life, and found for him a place in this chamber. That machine has grown, and today no candidate could be elected if he did not have it behind him. Greater men than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> have endeavoured to win elections without its aid. I instance <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, of South Australia, who, I suppose, was one of the greatest men in politics that Australia has known. He fell between the two parties, with the result that, instead of repeating the experience of the previous election, when, as a member of  a party, lie was returned at the head of the poll, he found himself at the bottom. I am not able to grasp what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> hopes to accomplish. How would honorable senators reach a common understanding if they were prevented from attending meetings of their parties ? I do not think that the amendment will help the honorable senator along the road that he wishes to travel. He has argued that it would be a democratic move to have honorable senators elected by the parliaments of the States. I should regard that as a conservative plan. </para>

                        <para>- I am now stating my individual opinion, not. that of the Labour movement.  There  is always a possibility that that movement will change its view. The Senate is elected upon the broadest franchise that exists in the world. Nothing could be fairer. The electors may return whom they please. I am opposed to the amendment, and do not think the committee ought to agree to it. </para>

                <para>SenatorFOLL  (Queensland)  [4.15]. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> made a statement to which I take strong exception. He said that, by reason of the system which operates in this chamber, honorable senators times without number have recorded a vote in opposition to the dictates of their consciences. The honorable senator appears to consider that he has a monopoly of conscience, and is the only member of this chamber who votes according to it. If other honorable senators do not see eye to eye with him he charges them with voting against their conscience. I throw that charge back in his teeth. He would not have been returned to the Senate if he had not had the assistance of the party machine. I have been in this chamber for a longer period than he has, and my experience has been that honorable senators vote according to their consciences. . I can recall the time when there was only one member of the Labour party in this Senate, and  35  alleged supporters of the Government. On at least two occasions Government bills were thrown out on the motion for their second reading. That is proof that the Senate has not lost its usefulness as a chamber of review. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden's</inline> conscience is probably worrying him. Perhaps that is the reason he is having so much to say on this subject. </para>

All that I say is that they are misguided by excessive zeal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> said that I was elected to the Senate as a party man. Probably I had the support of a portion of the  Labour  movement; but I also obtained  10,000  national votes. On the platform I made the definite statement that I did not consider I had a right if elected to the Senate to attend the caucus, and that I would not continue to do so. When I came to the Senate the first thing I received was  a  summons to appear before the executive of the Parliamentary Labour Party. I was then asked, " Did you say that . you would not attend caucus meetings as a Labour man? I said, " Yes, I did ". I said further, " Everything you have there I have said." The principal cause of complaint against me was that I had said that senators ought not to attend caucus meetings. I did not attend caucus meetings. </para>

If I were a member of another place I would be compelled to belong to a party, but while I am a member of this Senate I shall belong to no party, and I shall not attend any party caucus. I hope that the honorable senators will have compassion upon me even if they cannot sympathize with my proposal, and I trust that the discussion which has arisen upon my amendment may draw us nearer to that very much desired day when the Senate will  be  set free from party, as it was intended to be and as undoubtedly it should be. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that the Senate stands for the continuance of parties, and in those circumstances it is our duty to make voting as simple as possible. Four or five years ago in the Senate I strongly urged the adoption of the system of grouping the names of candidates on Senate ballot papers. Provision for that had been made in a bill introduced by the then government, and it was supported by honorable senators of the Labour party, but Nationalist senators rejected it. I remember pointing out at the time that in the absence of grouping ex-Senator Garling, who was a Nationalist, would lose his seat at the following election because his name would appear alphabetically on the. ballot paper after that of ex-Senator Gardiner. It is problematical whether ex-Senator Garling did lose his seat on that account - ex-Senator Gardiner may deny it - but the fact remains that, although ex-Senator Garling was the third Nationalist in alphabetical order on the ballot-paper, he was not elected, and ex-Senator Gardiner was elected. Had the names been grouped on the ballot-papers, as I desired, I fee! certain that ex-Senator Garling would have been re-elected. However, as the outcome of that election we saw the virtue of the grouping system, and adopted it  for future Senate elections. I believe that it has worked satisfactorily. Tt rnakes it easy for the people to record their votes. Many persons say that if a party is running three candidates for a Senate election, and if the supporters of the party vote 1, 2 and 3 for those three candidates, it makes no particular difference how the .names of candidates are arranged on the ballot-paper, so long as they are in one particular group. But with an electorate like New South Wales, with its 1,000,000 voters, is it possible to expect over 500,000 people to vote exactly in the way I have indicated? I understand that candidates are grouped for Tasmanian State elections, but that the Nationalist organization does not ask its supporters to vote 1, 2, 3 in any order. </para>

                        <para>- Candidates are also grouped in Western Australia. So desirous are the electors of being assisted to vote that the select committee, which has just done most excellent work, has submitted a recommendation that candidates should be grouped in Senate ballot-papers as Nationalists, Labour, Country party, or Independents. The Government. however, despite its wish to help the elector to fill in his ballot-paper, thinks that it would be rather difficult to cai-ry out the committee's recommendation. Many honorable senators do not understand the presentsystem of counting votes at elections for the Senate. When it was first adopted, I venture to say that only two of the then senators, ex-Senator Gardiner and ex-Senator Garling, understood it. Under our present system, so long as a candidate's organization votes solidly 1, <inline font-style="italic">2</inline> and 3 for its three candidates, it makes little difference whether his name appears first, second or third on the ballot-paper. But all the supporters of the party cannot be relied on to do this in the case of a very large constituency. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> was first elected to the Senate, there were three candidates standing in Queensland in the interests of the Nationalist party - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Adamson, Senator Givens,</inline> and the honorable senator. Their names were placed on the ballot-paper in alphabetical order, and the Nationalist organization in Queensland asked its supporters to vote Adamson 1, Givens 2, Glasgow 3. ' The three of them were returned, but until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Adamson</inline> was declared elected, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> could not be returned. </para>

                        <para>- He had not, so long as the supporters of the Nationalist candidates voted solidly for their party. But can we expect 500,000 voters all to be true to their party? We were told in New South Wales that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> Grant, at the pre-selection, had polled more votes than ex-Senator Gardiner; but, at any rate, the executive of the Labour party very wisely, I think, put up ex-Senator Gardiner as its first candidate. There were five Nationalist candidates, and immediately it was seen that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> Grant was put in the second position by the Labour party, we knew that he could not possibly be elected. If every elector voted the party ticket, it would make no difference where a candidate's name appeared on the ballot-paper. Under the present system the candidate whose name is below that of another is just as anxious for the candidate preceding him to secure election as he is for his own success, because he realizes that he has no chance of election until the other candidate has secured the required majority. </para>

                        <para>- At the last Senate election in New South Wales the Nationalist candidates received 400,000  votes and the Country party representatives 136,000 votes. When the scrutiny had reached the stage that necessitated the transfer of the Country party's preferences the Nationalists lost about 5,000 votes which went over to Labour; but since the Nationalists had a surplus of 70,000 votes it did not . matter very much. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> each lost about 5,000 votes, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> and myself lost about 6,000. If the votes had been given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott,</inline> and not to us to keep either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> or myself out, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> himself would have been defeated. As it happened, he received 1,000 votes more than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan, Senator Greene,</inline> or myself, but the result was not affected. If, however, the election figures had been as close as they were when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen secured election by only 450 votes over the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> the votes that we lost in the way I have described would have been sufficient to turn the election against us and keep <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> out. </para>

                    GLASGOW (Queensland - Minister for Defence) [4.40]. - I hope the committee will not accept the amendment. The grouping system has been in operation for the last two elections. Friction is likely to occur if any attempt is ma.de to arrange the order in which the supporters of a party shall be .asked to vote for the several candidates. At present the names are arranged in alphabetical order within the groups. This prevents argument and the possibility of friction ; and the respective parties arrange to give the preferences to the several candidates in a certain definite order.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline>
                    has referred to the position in Queensland. I suggest that, if he desires candidates belonging to his own party to be returned he should do nothing to alter the present system, because it has not worked to our disadvantage.

                        <para>- The fact remains that  the  candidates names are arranged alphabetically, and the system has worked well. The grouping of candidates under  party  designations prevents confusion on  the  part of electors. A voter may  have  some knowledge of certain candidates whom  he  wishes to see elected, but  he may  not know the whole of them.  The  gouping system thus comes to his aid. </para>

                    <para>. - I should have been pleased if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> had gone a step further, and had proposed to have the names of the party printed on the ballot-paper opposite each group. It is not too late even now to do that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> has stated that the amendment will, if adopted, cause friction amongst candidates comprising the respective groups. I do not think it will, because, as I understand it, the order in which the names of candidates within a group appear on the ballot-paper  must  be the result of an arrangement between the candidates themselves. If they are satisfied to have their names  printed  in a certain order, how can any friction be caused? I could understand the objection made by the Minister if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> had suggested that Parliament should arbitrarily determine how the names of candidates should appear on the ballot-paper; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> does not propose to do that at all. All he suggests is that the candidates in the different groups shall agree amongst themselves as to the order in which their names shall appear. It is well known that the respective party organizations agree, prior to an election, as to which candidate shall receive No. 1 vote, and how the other preferences shall be distributed. The proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> will simplify the postion and is worthy of a trial. </para>

                <para class="block">Again I cite what happened at the last federal election in New South Wales. The Nationalist party was supporting five candidates for the Senate - four Nationalists and one Country party representative. On that occasion the alphabetical arrangement worked satisfactorily. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox, Senator Duncan,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> were seeking re-election, so it was arranged that they should be Nos. 1, 2, and 3. I came fourth. That was a perfectly reasonable arrangement. If my name had been "Bowden" instead of " Thomas " the voter would have merely had to mark his preferences in the order named against the three other candidates, and then, instead of working down the ballot-paper to my name, to look above the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> for " Bowden " and give me the fourth preference. </para>

                        <para>- I assume that the Nationalist party would drop me and 'put forward someone else. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne, Senator Plain,</inline> and ex-Senator Bolton were contesting a Senate election some time ago, the Nationalist supporters were asked by the organization to give their No. 1 vote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> their No. 2 to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain,</inline> and their No. 3 to ex-Senator Bolton. This meant that in marking the ballot-paper they had to commence at the bottom and work upwards, which led to a good deal of confusion. Under my proposal that difficulty would be obviated. Even intelligent persons are sometimes confused in correctly marking a ballot-paper, and we should make the work as simple as possible. Why have we the grouping system? </para>

I then thought as the Minister does; but after a brief interview with a returning officer I was convinced that I was wrong. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott,</inline> whose name appeared at the top of the ballot-paper, obtained 1,000 more votes than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene, Senator Duncan,</inline> and myself, and that number of votes might have been sufficient to bring about not only our our defeat, but his as well. The system which I advocate would simplify voting, and would, I believe, he acceptable to the electors. </para>

                    <para>.- I cannot support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> because it is a direct negation of what I favour. It would have the effect of perpetuating a system which seeks to embody in our legislation the vicious and undesirable principle of party. The system adopted does not matter so long as the best men are selected to represent the people. I believe in elective ministries ; but that is another matter. </para>

                        <para>- It helps those candidates a little, for the reason that some electors, more or less ignorant of the qualifications of the respective candidates, place their preferences in order, beginning at the top of the ballot-paper. Those candidates whose names begin with letters near the beginning of the alphabet consequently obtain a number of votes which they would not receive if their names commenced with letters lower down in the alphabet. That, probably, is the honorable senator's difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- Under existing conditions, with the names of the candidates belonging to the different groups arranged in alphabetical order, the various political organizations advise their supporters as to the manner in which they should distribute their preferences. That, at times, causes trouble, but not so much as would be the case if the honorable senator's amendment were agreed to. In any case, there is likely to be trouble ; no system can be satisfactory to all. At the last election my name appeared third in the group in which it was placed. I am satisfied to continue in that position. Seeing that there will be difficulties connected with whatever system is adopted, I think that we should adhere to the present arrangement, by which the names of the candidate are placed in alphabetical order on the ballot-paper in the particular group to which they belong. The party organization should then shoulder the responsibility of advising its supporters as to the order in which they should east their preferences. </para>

                    <para>. -  Throughout Australia the names of the candidates at municipal and State elections are invariably placed on the ballot-papers in alphabetical order. So far as I know, in no State election are the names of the candidates divided into groups. Since the establishment of the Commonwealth, the names of candidates for election to another place have always been placed in alphabetical order on the ballot-paper. That also was the practice for some years in connexion with Senate elections ; but on account of the large number of informal votes, or for some other reason, it was decided later to divide the candidates into groups according to the political parties to which they belonged, placing their  names  in alphabetical order in each group. The object was to make it easier for the electors to identify the candidates belonging to the party they supported. The number of informal votes cast in connexion with Senate elections has not decreased because of the alteration in the system of placing the names of candidates on the ballot-papers. I believe that the number runs into a good many thousands in some of the States? </para>

                        <para>- That is probably about 8 per cent. or 9 per cent. of the total number of votes cast. It is extraordinary that in a country which has compulsory education, and where practically every person can read and write, such a large number of adults fail to mark their ballot-papers as required and in accordance with their real desires. I do not know what are the principal causes of informality. An elector has merely to mark his or her ballot-paper in the order of preference. That should not be beyond the ability of the average elector. A wrangle occurred in the ranks of the Nationalist party prior to an election, at which the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, ex-Senator Garling and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> were the candidates of that party for the Senate. The controllers of the party decided that the order of preference should be " Garling (1), Millen (2), Thomas (3)." Whilst Garling was absent from headquarters another caucus meeting was held, and, rightly or wrongly, Millen was placed first in order of preference. I believe, although I am not quite sure, that the others were placed " Thomas (2), Garling (3)." That was the official ticket throughout the State, and electors had merely to follow the orderset out on the " How to vote cards that were placed in their hands on election day.  We  must all admit that every possible care is taken and no expense is spared, at least by the Nationalist party, to inculcate in the minds of the electors the order  of  preference they wish to have observed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> appears to think that it would make an enormous difference to have the names arranged not only in groups, but also in the order decided upon by the head-quarters of the different parties. That might or might not have made a difference at the election to which I have referred. I do not consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has made- out a case sufficiently strong to justify the committee in accepting his proposal. I doubt whether the number of informal votes has been reduced as a result of the adoption of the existing system, under which the names of candidates are arranged in alphabetical order. The election of a man to the Senate is dependent upon a number of factors which are quite distinct from that mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas.</inline> I cannot support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  That the electors appreciate the group system is evidenced by the fact that in one electorate in New South Wales 16,000 of the 24,000 electors who voted for the Nationalist candidates observed the party arrangement. It appears to me that a scheme such as I propose would make the task of the electors much easier than it now is. I should be sorry to think that I had done anything which had led an elector to vote in a manner different from his or her intentions. Our ballot-papers should be made as simple as possible. We should not regard the alphabetical arrangement as sacrosanct. </para>

                    <para>. -  For some considerable time the number  of  informalities in the votes cast for the Senate has been simply appalling. This is one of the subjects to which the Electoral Committee devoted close attention. It took a mass of evidence from men of all shades of political opinion. Informal voting has in recent years shown a decrease, which is a proof that the electors are becoming educated up to the requirements and that the group system is having a beneficial effect. The committee decided that one way of reducing informality was to have the names of the parties printed opposite each group. I therefore move - </para>

                    proposal. No difficulty need be feared on the allegation that there are two Labour parties in Australia. There are some people who call themselves the National Labour party; but they are not members of the Labour party. There is only one Labour party in Australia, and that is the Australian Labour party.

We have already gone a long way on the road to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson's</inline> proposal by having the grouping system on ballot-papers, and by designating the groups A, B, C and so on. As a matter of fact when the provision in this respect was debated in the Senate it was regarded as a compromise. If we went a little further and placed the names of the parties on the ballot papers it would be of great assistance to the electors. </para>

I am entitled so to declare myself whether the organization consents or not. If there are sixteen candidates, some of whom are not endorsed by their organizations, they can still declare themselves to be Nationalists, Labour or Independent. It should be open for each candidate to declare his party. Any man can stand for parliament, and likewise any man should have the right to declare himself to be representing the party to which he has chosen to attach himself. The new clause I propose would enable him to do so, and at the same time would, I am sure, lead to a reduction in the number of informal votes. </para>

No matter what confusion there may be among the candidates, it is of the utmost importance that that confusion shall not be brought into the electoral . office. We should so frame our laws as not to bring the various contending political parties into conflict with the electoral authority. There is no simpler way of putting the names of the candidates on the ballot-paper than that which at present is followed. The names are placed on the ballot-paper in alphabetical order, and the groups themselves are arranged in alphabetical order. There is no need for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson's</inline> amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson's</inline> object is to make the position clearer to an elector when he goes to vote, but if his proposal were agreed to it might create a very difficult and even dangerous position. At the present time certain candidates can group themselves. Let us assume that candidates A, B and C are endorsed as the selected candidates of a party, and agree to group themselves on the ballot-paper. At the same time candidates D, E and F, who are not endorsed or selected candidates, are seeking election as representing the same party. Thus there may be two sets of candidates grouped - A, B and C, with the word " Nationalist " opposite them, and D, E and F also declaring themselves to be Nationalists, as possibly they' may be. As a matter of fact there may be three groups of Nationalists, and two or three groups of Labour candidates. </para>

                        <para>- There could not be one group of each. If I am a candidate I am grouped with two other candidates, a fid we describe ourselves as of the one party. But other people have the right to do the same thing. The adoption of the honorable senator's proposal would therefore make it difficult for people to record their votes in the way desired by them. Another thing that strikes me is that we are losing sight of the individual. The proposal before the Senate" is merely for the glorification of party. The act deals with the individual up to this point, but now the honorable senator wants to introduce party The respective organizations might as well be allowed to go a step further and have printed on the ballot-paper a paragraph setting out the virtues of the Nationalist candidates and the Nationalist party as far as Australia is concerned. The Labour party would have as much right to do the same, and in a short time the proposed system would become a perfect farce. </para>

                        <para>- The organization that endorses them. Personally I see no harm whatever in printing on the ballot-paper, not only the group names of candidates, but also alongside the respective groups the names of the parties on whose behalf the candidates so grouped are contesting an election. This would not in any way prevent other candidates for either House from seeking election and having set out on the ballot-paper the party they represented. At times there is a certain amount of haziness on the part of some voters as to whether group " A " represents official Labour and group "B" official Nationalist or vice versa. These doubts would be entirely removed if the proposal were adopted, and electors would be able to cast a more intelligent and effective vote. . It is almost impossible for an independent candidate to win an election. It is only  when a candidate is endorsed by his organization that he can hope to succeed. In other respects the independent candidate is also at a disadvantage. He is handicapped financially and in addition has to make all his own arrangements. </para>

The people would then know from the two main groups who were the official and endorsed candidates of the different parties. This system would not prevent other candidates from nominating as independent Labourites or independent Nationalists. </para>

Apart from meeting the religious objections of the Jewish section of the community it will be a great convenience to farmers and others engaged in rural pursuits, to be able to record their votes up to8 p.m. I have received an authoritative communication stating that the Jewish people are not allowed towrite on their Sabbath, which ends at dark on Saturday. It is obvious that many Jewish citizens would he debarred from marking their ballot-papers if the polls closed at 7 p.m. They contend that in most places in Australia they would not have the opportunity to record their votes at elections held in midsummer, as night falls much later than 7 p.m. </para>

The committee carefully inquired into the disabilities likely to be experienced by the Jews, Seventh Day Adven tists, and the members of other religious bodies, and found that the objections were not sufficient to justify the retention of the present hour of closing the poll. I feel it my duty to support the recommendation of the committee, which was made on substantial grounds and after consideration of the customs in other States; but in view of the division just taken I feel that it is hardly worth  while  pressing the point. </para>

                    NEEDHAM  (Western Australia [6.22].  -  I hope that the Committee will reject this clause. Members of Parliament should have the courage of their convictions, and decide for themselves whether they shall make gifts or donations. If agreed to, the clause would place members at a disadvantage compared with other men who might aspire to take their places in this Parliament. But that is not the reason for my opposition to the clause. I advocate its deletion because I believe that members of Parliament should be free to determine these matters for themselves.

                    <para>.- The inclusion of this clause might give the impression that members of Parliament want to protect themselves against the charge that they are becoming more and more parsimonious, or are afraid to say " no " to appeals made to them. There is no reason why they should be treated differently from other members of the community. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has said, the clause would place them at a disadvantage compared with other persons who may oppose them at elections. Members of Parliament who desire to assist some worthy object should be free to do so. I hope that the Minister will agree to the deletion of the clause. The generosity of some members of Parliament may have given rise to the belief that they will respond to every appeal, and to that extent this clause would offer them some protection; but any person who is elected to Parliament should be manly enough to decide this matter for himself. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator made that statement at one of the conferences which were held between the Commonwealth and State Ministers, and it was most ably answered by the then Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart).</inline> We cannot develop Australia properly until we have one railway gauge. It is not fair for us to ask that preference should be given to our products in Great Britain unless they are produced in the most efficient manner. A tremendous amount of waste is caused by our having different gauges. Some little while ago the Queensland authorities complained of the absence of trucks for the transport of their produce from the border of New South Wales. I wrote to the Commissioner for Railways in that State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davidson,</inline> asking if he could estimate the amount wasted because of the break of gauge at the border. He wrote me an extremely kind letter in which he said that he could not state the amount definitely, but that 150,000 tons of produce were transferred from the Queensland to the New South Wales trucks at Wallangarra, at a cost of at least1s.10d. a ton. That would amount to nearly £15,000. There must, therefore,be a tremendous wastage over the whole of the continent. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The honorable senator, however, must admit that he is in agreement with the general idea of auniform gauge. In the last analysis Australia has to depend on her railways for the transport of her produce, although, I admit, good roads are an excellent adjunct. I understand that Commissioner Webb in South Australia was able to shift the whole of that State's wheat harvest with the larger type of engines and trucks that he introduced some little time ago. Conferences have been held from time to time to consider the advisability of bringing about a unification of the gauges. The stumbling block to an agreement has been the claim by the Victorian and South Australian engineers that 5 ft. 3 in. is the proper gauge; whilst the New South Wales engineers insist upon 4 ft. 81/2 in. With a view to ascertaining which was the better gauge <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Hughes, as Prime Minister, called a conference of the Premiers of the different States. That conference agreed to refer the matter to two outside experts and a financial man from within Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It was further decided that the Commonwealth should pay a certain proportion of the cost and that the States should contribute on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. The experts decided that 4 ft. 81/2 in. was the most suitable gauge. Some six years ago I raised in the Senate the question of having a line constructed via either Hay or Condobolin to junction with the east-west railway. I was then met with the argument, which I could not but accept, that a decision had not been come to as to whether the gauge should be 4 ft. in. or 5 ft. 3 in., and consequently the discussion was premature. Subsequent to the decision in favour of 4 ft. 81/2 in., I again advanced the proposition. I then contended that the object of the conference was to bring about the unification of the gauges betweenFremantle and Brisbane. </para>

So impressed has this Government been with the idea of having a railway via either Hay or Condobolin that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> as Prime Minister, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart,</inline> then Minister for Works and Railways, convened a conference of the Premiers of the States to discuss the possibility of linking up with the New South Wales system via Hay and of constructing a' line from Kyogle to South Brisbane. Unfortunately, considerable disagreement developed in that conference. One- of the principal antagonists of the proposal was the then Treasurer of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McPherson. In expressing opposition to anything being done in the way of unification, he argued that we could not afford to pay for it, and that we should wait until we had doubled our population, so that the cost per head would be halved. At our present rate of progress, a considerable time will elapse before the population of Australia is doubled. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Barwell was Premier of South Australia at that time, and took part in the deliberations of the conference.

Of the two schemes for connecting the New South Wales railway system with Port Augusta, the New South Wales Ministers preferred a route via Broken Hill to that via Hay. From their standpoint there was a good deal to. be said in favour of their attitude, because they had already undertaken to build a line from Condobolin to Broken Hill. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly ; but I am not proposing that the Government should build two lines. I am not in a position to say which would be the better route to adopt. Experts differ on the point. My proposal is that the Commonwealth Government should enter into negotiations with the State Governments of New South Wales and South Australia to link Port Augusta with the New South Wales 4 ft.81/2 in. gauge.

                        <para>- The cost of the scheme is estimated at £4,500,000. It will mean the construction through South Australian territory of about 190 miles of railway. I have no doubt that the South Australian Government would not object very seriously if the Commonwealth shouldered that financial obligation. The  completion of the work would enable passengers to travel overland from Kalgoorlie to Sydney, and, when the Kyogle-Brisbane section is completed, right through to the capital of the northern State. </para>

                        <para>- That would depend upon the attitude of South Australia and Victoria. If the governmentsofthose States were prepared to proceed with the unification of the line from Adelaide through Melbourne to Albury, I should say no. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell that that would be the bigger and the proper scheme to adopt. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> objects to that work being done now because he thinks that, at some future time, the economic conditions will be more favourable and possibly material will cost less. Why should we wait? The South Australian and Victorian Governments are against the scheme. </para>

                    <para>In the first place I should like to explain that this course is somewhat unusual, although it is not in any way improper. As . a mater of fact, I was actuated in taking it by the knowledge that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> had promised in another place to give honorable members of that chamber an opportunity to discuss the report and I thought it was only fair that the Senate which, in this respect at all events, enjoys equal rights with another place, should have a similar opportunity to consider it. The remarks which I have to make at this juncture will be somewhat formal ; but I have no doubt that, as the debate proceeds, the appearance of formality will disappear altogether and that when I exercise, as I intend to do, my right to reply, I shall be called uponto offer some explanation concerning the various comments that will he made upon the report by honorable senators. It is, I think, a very important report. It deals with what has been, for some years one of the most keenly criticized branches of the Commonwealth Government's activities. The committee has endeavoured to make the report as self-explanatory as possible. It is couched in simple language. The opinions which have been expressed by members are set out very definitely. That being so, it only remains for honorable senators, in the ensuing debate, to place on record their opinions upon the conclusions of the committee. Honorable senators will see that the report is not one-sided. That is to say in addition to the report of the majority of the committee, there is a report also from the minority. This, in itself, will probably give rise to some discussion. The* committee has not been hurried over the preparation of its report. Therefore there is no need for me to apologize for, so much as to explain the delay which has occurred. The inquiry was begun in May, 1926, and it was continued without interruption until August of the same year. Then an urgent matter was placed before the committee by the Government, which asked it to conduct an enquiry into the Pacific Islands shipping routes. That work occupied members for about six months. The committee then resumed its inquiry into the Commonwealth's shipping activities and the reports was ready foi- presentation, as honorable senators will no doubt have heard, when Parliament was opened in Canberra on the 9th of May last. I have no desire to refer to the circumstances which led to the postponement of the presentation, or suppression of the report at that stage. Let me state, however, that the delay up to that stage, was beneficial to the committee, in that it afforded members an opportunity to watch the operations of the line almost intimately for about twelve months, and to see to what extent the prognostications of its officials were correct or otherwise. That undoubtedly was a great advantage because it enabled the committee to obtain a better insight into the workings of the line than would have been possible in other circumstances. Although there is a considerable difference of opinion expressed in the two reports which are now presented to the Senate, I should like to make it clear that the proceedings of the committee were marked by an almost unusual degree of calmness and that members gave careful attention to the evidence which was placed before them. That evidence was given by witnesses in an extremely satisfactory manner. There never was difficulty with any of them.  I think I attended every meeting of the committee and for the last few months of the enquiry, was its chairman. I am, therefore, in a position to testify both as to the frankness and willingness of the witnesses which enabled the committee to give its reasons for its findings and also to the industry of its members, who took a keen interest in the preparation of the  reports  which are now before honorable senators. When the. opportunity is afforded me J shall be prepared to. give such  explanations  as may lie in my power to any re marks which honorable senators maT make upon the report. If unable to satisfy them, I hope, at all events, to show them that, so far as the majority of the committee is concerned, it had justification - or what may be taken as justification - for expressing the opinions it has in the report we are now considering. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to debate that point. As a leasehold system has been inflicted upon the  unfortunate  inhabitants df this place, the authorities should make it approximate, as nearly as possible, to the freehold system until they reach that happy stage when they are able to obtain the freehold. At present a lease-holder may sub-let the whole of his shop or dwelling; but, for some unknown reason, a lease-holder in the Civic Centre cannot sub-let the upper story of his premises without the consent of the Federal Capital Commission. I do not know why such a distinction should be made. The obligation to obtain the consent of the commission is not set out in all the leases. </para>

                        <para>- It is superimposed upon leases by an ordinance. The average layman when ascertaining the conditions under which he takes up the land, naturally refers to his lease. Theoretically every one is supposed to be conversant with the law; but I venture to say there are very few persons in the Territory who can say what the ordinances provide. They have been amended from time to time. </para>

In all probability some of the leases were granted before the ordinance to which I refer was adopted ; but it apparently occurred to some one that the arcade at the Civic Centre should be annexed to the leases so as to compel them to keep it in repair. In order to give effect to this proposal the old leases were called in, and new leases were granted so that irrespective of the year of original issue, these uew leases are now subject to an ordinance passed prior to this year. </para>

                        <para>- It could not force the lessees to accept new leases, but they were offered various advantages to induce them to agree to the new arrangement. By mutual consent the whole of the leases are now subject to the ordinance which provides that a portion of a shop or building shall not be sublet, without the consent of the commission first being obtained. This is causing a great amount of inconvenience to those - who may wish to change their tenants. The commission has a tremendous amount of business to transact, and weeks sometimes elapse before a decision is given. In such cases the tenants cannot wait. </para>

                        <para>- No one knows why it is being done. A private owner has a very clear idea what he wants when he insists upon his consent being obtained. In such cases it may be his desire to avoid competition in a particular area, but the commission has no such interests to conserve. The commission says, in effect, that Parliament must have intended it to do something in regard to this wretched thing, but that there is no principle to guide it. </para>

                        <para>- Not in this ordinance. In Victoria, the law provides that where a private individual inserts in a lease a clause that it shall not he assigned without consent, it shall be implied that such consent shall not be unreasonably or arbitrarily withheld.  In this instance no such provision has been made, as the commission has the discretionary right to withhold its consent. So far as I have been able to gather, the ordinance was framed on the recommendation of the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce).</inline></para>

                        <para>- I know of one case where a man has been almost ruined, by being unable to sublet to a person who was agreeable to pay him £2,000 a year. When this person was told of this arbitrary power in the commission under which it professed to be able to inquire if rents charged were fair, it led to the cancellation of the contract. It will be difficult to find tenants if the commission is to inquire into the rents to be charged. There is a Fair Rents Court in New South Wales, but up to the present no such court has been established in the Federal Capital Territory. Apparently it is the intention of the commission to ascertain whether the rentals to be charged are reasonable or excessive. </para>

                        <para>- He was given to understand that permission to sub-let would not be granted. The commission made it clear that it was opposed to middlemen. The man then feared that he had made a serious mistake in trying to lease the property. This condition of affairs has arisen because of an excess of caution on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce, who at the time was Minister for Home and Territories. The ordinance was passed because it was intended at first that the shops should have residences above them ; later, when it was found that there was no demand for the residences, it was decided that the upstairs rooms should be used for offices. When, the rooms were made available as offices the condition? as to sub-letting residences remained in force. I believe that the commission would be glad to be relieved of its responsibility in the matter, but, with the ordinance in force, it feels that it must take every precaution. Seeing that the whole of a building may be disposed of. there is no reason why the present restrictions regarding sub-letting, of parts of the building should continue. If the desire is to prevent overcrowding, the position could be met by a special ordinance. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The Federal Capital will not develop if lessees are needlessly harassed. The leases themselves contain ample safeguards against undesirable businesses being conducted on the premises. That is the proper place for such conditions. Moreover, there is power to pass any further ordinances considered necessary. For instance, it would be possible to prevent the establishment of boilingdown works in the Territory by passing a special ordinance to prohibit them. </para>

                    <para class="block">That such a vital provision should have been passed without debate in either House is amazing. The measure was introduced into the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and into another place by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley, neither of whom in his second reading speech made any reference to the difficulties that might arise from the attempted application of this principle to modern conditions.- In both Houses clauses 1 to 10 were passed without debate. The Ministers in charge of the measure designedly made no reference  to clause 9. That clause appears to have been entirely overlooked by the party then in Opposition, " either inadvertently or because it was hoped and believed that the Federal Capital would never materialize. Whatever may have been the causes of the omission, the fact remains that this most vital and far-reaching provision was silently, almost surreptitiously, inserted in the bill, not only without the debate which its importance plainly required, but also without a single questioning voice being raised in regard to it. In the absence of any such debate or question, it is quite impossible for me to fathom the principle, or lack of principle, that was at the bottom of its adoption in 1910. But it appears perfectly clear that none of the difficulties which were likely to arise from its application ' received the slightest consideration from either party. I have, therefore, adopted this course to bring it prominently before the Senate, so that we may hear publicly and openly the reasons for and against its being further persisted in. If the principle had been consistently pursued to its logical conclusion; if the Government had said once and for all, " No one shall own stick or stone in this Territory; the Government will take all the risks ; it willbuild as required for all the inhabitants as they come along; if prices rise it will take all the gains, and if they slump it will face the loss " that would have been an understandable and a logical policy. But having enunciated the policy the Government was afraid to stand up to it, and so began, in effect, to whittle it away by creating long-term leases. This, in reality, is camouflage. The Government endeavours to get people to sink their capital in the creation of the Federal Capital, but with them it is a case of " Heads I win, tails you lose. If there is a rise in values I will take it all. If there is a slump you must carry the baby." It is not as if the Government or the Federal Capital Commission had anything at stake. If they contributed one-half of the cost of the buildings they could claim to have an interest equal to that of the tenant. That is not done. They contribute the land. It cost <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> an acre; but is doled out in minute portions at a ground rent calculated on a capital value enormously in excess of that sum. The Unfortunate tenant has to pay as a first charge £5 per cent, per annum on a ground rent arrived at under unfair conditions. </para>

                        <para>- So long as the people have the necessary amount of cash to invest in such a proposition some of them will do so ; but they are very, few in number. The fact is being recognized by both the Federal Government and the Governments of the States, that so long as people are required to pay more than a very small deposit they will not take upon themselves the obligation of purchasing a home of their own. The consequence is that those Governments are reaching out with both hands to assist them over the stile. Why is it desirable that our people should own their own homes? In the first place there is in every Anglo-Saxon an inherent desire to be the possessor of a spot that he can truly call his own. Out of the turmoil of the middle ages the axiom emerged, " The Englishman's home is his castle." That principle received the sanction of the law to the utmost extent- It was said of an Englishman's home, " The storm may enter, the rain may enter, but the King of England cannot, except with the permission of the owner." It has always been regarded ' as the ' principal heritage of the nation. A man strains every nerve to become possessed of a home of his own so that he may bequeath it to his widow and. children and thus make them secure. The effect of the act that I am now attacking is to deprive the coming generation of that heritage. The implication is that it is evil and hateful to wish to own one's own home and thus make one's widow and children secure of shelter, and that it must on no account be countenanced. I do not know whether public servants have fully realized the position. A. man may spend thousands of pounds upon a house in the Federal Capital Territory, . believing that he will thus render himself secure. If ill health should come upon him and cause his death, the entire property will revert to the commission in the event of his widow falling into arrears with the ground rent. </para>

                        <para>- What will happen in the. meantime to any widow who may fall into arrears with her payments? It may be said that the Governmentis not heartless, and will hot take advantage of a man's misfortune. My reply is that the commission must insist on the rent being paid, and, if that is not done, dispossess the lessee. It has no power to sell the house and give to the widow whatever is left after the claim for rent has been satisfied. As all houses are built on land the property of thecommission, it must see that they are painted and kept in a proper state of repair, irrespective of the wishes of the tenant. A notice to paint may be served upon the tenant at an inconvenient time. When a man has the freehold of his land he can defer that work for a year or two; but in the circumstances of this case the requirement of the law may impose upon him a very serious hardship. It would be quite a proper provision if the Government built the house. But the interest of these unfortunate people is considerably greater than that of the Government. A man may purchase for £300 the lease of a block of land, and erect upon if a building costing £3,000. </para>

                        <para>- With a house costing £3,000 as security he would get it for very little more than that. The whole frame-work of the law relating to land tenure went by the board when this act was passed. The tenant has been compelled to part with his birthright and to become a slave. A leaseholder cannot leave his home unless he sacrifices all that he has put into it. He has no. refuge, because there is no other place here, where he can go. The owner of a freehold can, if necessity arises, cast his house away, so to speak: the leaseholder cannot. He is boundto the soil as veritably as the Russian serf in the days of the Czar. A person who has. given a mortgage on his freehold is in a much better position. The mortgages cannot turn him out at a moment's notice,but is compelled to put the place up for sale. That safeguard does not apply in this territory What chance has a Canberra tenant of obtainingcapital to build his house with the insecure tenure that he can offer? </para>

It is said that the Commonwealth Bank and other banks will give assistance, but they will do so only on terms, of overdraft and in view of the insecurity of the tenure, for their own protection. Their money must always be at call. And they will insist on having a margin that will render their assistance practically useless to any one not overburdened with cash. </para>

                        <para>- That is true, but where can any one get money except from them? When a person desires to raise money in this or any other country, he turns to that great reservoir of wealth, the accumulated trust funds in the hands of individuals or corporations, which are allowed to advance money on certain limited investments. The first thing - a municipality does when it wants to- get money is to get its bonds or debentures made a trust, security. Mortgages on freehold land have always been accepted by the courts as a trust security without the need for legislation. But no State has ever suggested that leaseholds are, or ever might be, made a trust security. I am informed that the Queensland Rural Bank is forbidden by law to invest its funds in making advances on Queensland Government leaseholds. </para>

                        <para>--Great difficulty is experienced in Queensland owing to the fact that there is now no equity in leasehold land on account of the rack rent which has been inserted in the conditions of the leases. Consequently the bigpastoralists have recently been insisting on a substantial reduction in their rents before they restock their runs. In the Federal Capital Territory, -by putting upto auction about three blocks where ten are wanted, the commission gets more than a rack rent.. The first result of thispolicy is to debar absolutely and forever a home-seeker from obtaining cheap money. When we consider the other disadvantages - lack of security, danger of forfeiture, inspections, reappraisements,. and a hundred other inflictions cast upon the leaseholder - we must realize that from the standpoint of the individual citizen the leasehold system as applied in the Federal Capital Territory has not a good point in favour of it. What was the reason for its adoption? It appears to have been adopted on the unreasonable parrot cry that those who get in early reap the unearned increment. If we follow the course of development of the cities of Australia, and of the country districts also, we find that in very many, perhaps in the majority of, cases there is not only no unearned increment, but also, with one or two exceptions, a fall in values. Much of the high priced country land in Victoria if it reverted to nature, as some of it has done, would cost more to clear, again than its value at the present day prices. There is certainly no unearned increment there. It is true that in the principal capital cities and in certain very confined, areas there has been a great increase in values, but that has not been the case in the large country towns approaching the size which Canberra is likely to reach in the next 100 years. The land in such towns has not greatly increased, and in some cases is lower, in value than it was 30 or 40 years ago. It is only when hundreds of thousands or millions of people congregate that great increases in value have been brought about. </para>

The miners who went to Wonthaggi in Victoria were fully impressed with the worth of the leasehold system. They got leases on a low deposit, and the rents theywere to pay were very low, but when they tried to build their homes they discovered that no one would advance money on them. </para>

Seeing that it was absurd to advance money on leaseholds, the Electricity Commission took the bull by the horns, set to work in a logical manner, built the whole township, and let the buildings at reasonable rentals. Had that been done in Canberra there would not have been any complaint except from the taxpayer at the losses that would have resulted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. If all the lands which are now unoccupied were cut up for sale there would not be a single penny increase in the value of any of it, because to-day no one knows where the real trend of population will be. It is quite evident that development is being forced on artificial lines. It is no use going out on the Duntroon-road when one knows that one will not be allowed to establish any kind of business there. I suggest that Canberra, land should be sold as freehold - not in large areas of course,  butinsingle blocks suitable for residences - and preferably on conditional purchase, which would oblige each purchaser in build within a reasonable time. Out of the purchase money of every block £100 should be set aside and placed in the hands of the National Debt Sinking Fund Commis- sioners. A sum of £100 invested at compound interest in Commonwealth loans would in 100 years, the period of a Canberra lease, amount to between £13,000 and £15,000. For the purpose of my argument I. take 100 years, the period of the leasehold system adopted in Canberra. </para>

The principal aim of every man is to secure the freehold of his home, so that his wife and children may enjoy a feeling of security.

                        <para>- Perhaps I am; but the figures are good enough to work upon. Let us assume, therefore, that in 100 years from now there will be 100,000 people in Canberra. If the Government sold 30,000 blocks of land at £100 each - we know that some of the leases sold recently realized £5,000 - it would have an initial sum of £3,000,000. If we multiply that by £13,000 or £l4,000, representing the compound interest on the blocks over the full period, we get a sum of about £40,000,000,000. </para>

What I wish to point out is that on my figures the fund would grow to such an enormous sum that at the end of the period mentioned - if the population remained at the figure assumed which, I believe, errs on the generous side - the land, which would have remained at about the same value at at present, could be brought back at the original price of about £3,000,000, and the Government would still have a great surplus in hand. The scheme is not one which honorable senators can dismiss as a joke. I put it forward as a serious proposition. If the Government brought, in a bill to compel members of Parliament to purchase a leasehold here, they would then realize the disadvantages of living in Canberra. </para><interjection>
