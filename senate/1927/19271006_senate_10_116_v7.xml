                                <para>The matter was discussed with the Chief Commissioner, Federal Capital Commission;, but it was not considered that there should be any alteration in the method of assessing the upset prices of business blocks. The upset prices, put on the allotments in the 1928 sales were arrived at by expert valuators, after consideration of the results of the 1924 sales and other factors which affect laud values. At the last auction sale in April, 1927, the upset prices were exceeded in practically all cases. The results of the April sale indicate that the number of blocks then offered amply met the existing demand, no private requirements being shut out as far as could be ascertained by the Commission. </para>

                            <para>The Development and Migration Commission and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research advise that the State viticultuval experts have a close knowledge of methods of fighting frosts and of the treatment of vines injured by frosts, and have from time to time issued statements and recommendations in regard thereto. In order to possibly supplement this information and to ascertain whether any development of very recent date had occurred in Europe, the Development and Migration Commission recently cabled <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> L. McDougall, their correspondent at Australia House, through the High Commissioner, asking him to forward the fullest particulars of any recent developments in knowledge of this subject. A reply has been received that the Empire Marketing Board, London, on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> is the Australian representative, has immediately despatched an expert to Montpellier, in France, and that the expert's report will be furnished at the earliest possible moment. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has also cabled to a special investigator in California, with a view to obtaining the latest information on the subject in that country. Meanwhile, the Development and Migration Commission are consulting with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the State authorities to obtain the most authoritative and agreed statement on the matter, which it is proposed to embody in the report upon the dried fruit industry now in course of preparation. Past experience indicates that a later crop of less quantity but high quality is often obtained after damage by frosts, if conditions are favorable and proper treatment of the vines is carried out. </para>

                    <para>. - In discussing the proposed vote of £11,720, for the Parliament, I desire to direct the attention of honorable senators to the unsatisfactory nature of the answers I received to-day io certain questions submitted to the Minister representing the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> in this Chamber. Health is paramount to wealth, and, irrespective of opinions which may be expressed to the contrary, I contend that we cannot have a healthy and happy community unless we do all that is humanly possible to suppress the blow-fly pest which is - an absolute menace to the people of Australia. It has been said by the most eminent authorities that flies are more deadly that snakes. They come into existence in filth. I am astounded to find that in order to cheapen the houses erected in the Federal Capital city, which ought to set an example to all cities throughout Australia, the Federal Capital Commission is providing only the kitchen and. dining-rooms of the houses with flyproof door and window screens. Are the flies to be trained in such a way that they will seek to enter only the rooms which are so protected? Flies enter at every possible point of access. Expense is a secondary consideration when compared with health and comfort, and in my own home I have provided every door, window, chimney, and ventilator with fly-proof screens in an endeavour to prevent the spread of disease. I have not resided in Canberra long, but those who have been here for some time have told me that at certain periods of the year blow-flies are a severe menace. It m'ay be that now that a good deal of ploughing has been don,: there will he fewer opportunities for this pest to thrive. The cost of supplying flyproof wire is infinitesimal. Personally I like Canberra, and have always spoken favorably of it. I want the people who are to permanently reside here to be happy and comfortable, and to assist in doing this such a necessary convenience should be provided. The Government should issue instructions to the commission to provide this necessary protection to all buildings erected or in course of erection. The cost will be a mere bagatelle. If what I suggest is not done I shall appeal to the health authorities, and I feel sure that my appeal will not be in vain. In the interests of the health of the people in the Federal Capital Territory, steps should be taken immediately to provide fly-proof screens for the doors and windows of all dwelling-houses. Some people may be indifferent to the menace of mosquitoes and flies. I am not. I believe in health laws and hygienic conditions generally for the people. I declare war on all pests. I speak strongly on this subject because I feel strongly about it, and I hope it will not be necessary to raise my voice again in respect to this important matter. </para>

                    <para>[3.27].  -  I remind the honorable senator senator should discuss this matter under the division dealing with the Department of Health. At present there is no ordinance in the Federal Capital Territory and no law in any State of the Commonwealth making it compulsory for persons to affix fly-proof gauze to the windows or doors of dwellings. In my reply to the honorable senator this afternoon, I stated that instructions would be issued for the provision of fly-wire screens to bedrooms and chimneys where after experience of the summer months in Canberra, a public servant decided that it was necessary to have such screens fitted. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to direct attention to an anomaly with regard to the classification of certain officers by the Public Service Board. It is the custom of the board to place officers in the smaller States in a lower classification with a lower salary than in the larger States, notwithstanding that they and officers filling them may be carrying out the same duties. I refer particularly to heads of departments and citeas an illustration the  Deputy  Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Hobart and the Sub-Collector of Customs in the same city. Their classification and salary are lower than the classification and salary of officers performing the same duties in Western Australia, and the latter, so I understand, are classified lower than similar officers in Victoria. I see no good reason for this differentiation because the responsibility resting upon officers in the smaller States, is just as great, and it is possible that their duties are more onerous. This grievance has been felt by heads of departments in the smaller States for a long time and I should like to see it removed. </para>

We findthat the property, being freehold, we cannot come under the Mining Act which entitles wages to come first and as no attempt is made to pay these wages which are due since May, our only hope is to have the matter placed in the hands of our Federal members. The total amount of wages due to the men employed, is £943 2s. 9d. wages, and £97 10s. salaries,' making a total of £1S40 12s. 9d. We are in hopes that, if the facts are placed before the Federal members, they will see how unjust it is to take from the men the bread and butter that this money represents.

                        <para>- I can assure the honorable senator that the fault is not mine. I am speaking more loudly than is customary with me on a public platform. If it is so difficult to hear in this chamber we should adjourn until the. acoustic properties have been improved. I have in my hand a long list of the names of the men to whom salaries and wages are owing, and the amounts that are due to them. According to the strict letter of the law, the attitude which has been adopted by the Commonwealth Bank and the Treasurer may be unassailable; but it is not right that these men should be deprived of their wages, particularly as the bank is in a position to pay them as an act of grace. Under the laws of the State of Western Australia, the men would have redress, but under Commonwealth law they have none. With all due deference, I submit the matter to the Minister who represents the Treasurer in this chamber with the request that it be re-opened with a view to justice being done to the men concerned. </para>

The answers I regarded as entirely unsatisfactory, particularly in their relation to sales of leases that were made in the Territory  in  April last. I was informed that 20 leases were then offered for sale, the upset prices ranging from £1,000 to £3,000 in the Civic Centre, and being lower in other centres. Each of those 20 leases was sold, that on- which an upset price  of £3,000 had been placed realising £5,100. The lowest upset price in the Civic Centre was £1,000, and the realization was £2,200. </para>

                        <para>- They have a 20- ft. frontage with a depth of approximately 108 feet. It must be realized that the sum offered has not to be paid, but that it is adopted as a basis for computing the rental to be charged. The block for which £5,100 was accepted will carry an annual rental of £255. It has been stated that the upset prices placed on the allotments at the 1926 sales were arrived at by expert valuators after a consideration of the prices realized at previous sales. Notwithstanding that fact, those upset prices were practically doubled at the sale. It has actually been contended that the results of the April sale indicated that the blocks then offered amply fulfilled the existing demand. If that is so, why did people pay double the upset prices? It is apparent that the offerings were not in any way commensurate with the demand, and if a greater number of blocks had been available, the upset prices would not have been exceeded. It is obvious that the Federal Capital Commission is adopting a forcing policy just as would a private land-holder who held a monopoly. As a friend of the Territory, I suggest that the Government should obtain the services of outside experts to advise it as to the proper policy to pursue. It is obvious that the Minister accepts without question whatever is placed before him by the commission. One block for a motor service station at Eastlake was offered, the upset price being £2,000. Because of the keen competition for the block the price realized' at auction was £11,300. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know exactly; it is a little larger than the shopping sites at Civic Centre. I do not know how the lessees will be able to pay an annual rental of £568 for that block unless they charge their customers enormous prices. It must be remembered that that amount paid was for the land without buildings. The excessive price realized was due to- only one site in the city being made available for the purpose of a motor service station. </para>

Intending bidders were given to understand that no further sites for motor service stations would be made available, and thus to obtain the block the present lessees were compelled to pay a price far in excess of the upset. </para>

                        <para>- This undue inflation of prices at Canberra will affect the residents. The upset prices at the next auction will no doubt be based on those realized at the last sale; and thus further fictitious values will be realized. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> I claim to be a friend of Canberra. For that reason I do not agree with land values being raised fictitiously, thus increasing the difficulties of the residents of the city. With such high rentals, business firms in Canberra will he unable to compete with firms in Sydney and Melbourne. I endorse <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott's</inline> suggestion that outside experts should be obtained to value the land. The success of Canberra depends to a great extent on the prices realized for land, and, therefore, I hope that the Minister will give this matter lis careful attention. </para>

                        <para>- It is forced up because the number of blocks made available is not sufficient to meet the demand. The result will be that the people of Canberra will be required to pay high prices for the commodities they require. Laud values in Canberra are extraordinarily high when compared with values in the other cities of the Commonwealth. Not long ago the freehold of a. large and valuable piece of land, almost in the centre of Brisbane, was sold for £2,500, whereas to obtain a lease of a motor service station site in this city with but a small population, the lessee was compelled to pay £11,300. I want to see Canberra progress. I am not here to complain about flies and lack of wire doors; but I think that the values of the city land ought to be fixed in a proper way, so that when people come here they will get a return for their investments. With the rentals they are called upon to pay, it seems to me that the Canberra shopkeepers cannot get a fair return on the stock they have to keep. I am afraid that they will get into trouble financially, with the result that a bad impression will be created about Canberra. I hope that the question will be satisfactorily dealt with, because it is of the utmost importance to the future development of the Federal Capital. </para>

                    <para>. - If we permit an extraordinary boom in land values in this city, allowing land to be sold at 300 or 400 per cent, higher than the upset price, the extra charge will have to be borne by the general public. As a State Government auctioneer I have sold Crown lands in Victoria for many years past. The system in that State is to fix the upset price and give ^ applicants a chance to buy privately at a price 10 per cent, in excess of the upset price. That method does away with speculation and prevents booming of land values. I suggest that in Canberra a certain number of blocks should be allotted in certain positions for particular trade areas, and sold one at a time. Where there are several people competing for certain blocks, they should be given the option of acquiring them at the upset price. There need be no fear of the Commonwealth sustaining a loss. No one knows better than the officers of the commission the value of the land in the Territory, and it is they who fix the upset price. For my part I think it is wise to stop the land boom in Canberra as soon as possible. </para>

On that occasion an order was sent out for the cadets to parade, and it was so worded that it was construed as a call to a compulsory parade. When, however, the cadets claimed pay for the time they had Jost from their employment, the military authorities in Perth said that it was not a compulsory parade, and refused their claim. The matter was taken up by the United Furniture Trades Industrial Union of Perth, and the Defence Department was sued for  a  breach of the United Furniture Trades Award. The award covering this industry shows that an apprentice shall receive pay for all time lost through attending compulsory military training except training imposed through failure to attend compulsory parade.

                    <para>At the time that order was written, it was fully anticipated that we would have a public holiday, and generally, when we call a voluntary parade for a public holiday, we get few attendants. It was incumbent on us at the time to get sufficient men to form a guard of honour, and the order was worded, as near as possible, in such a way as to make it a compulsory parade, without calling it a compulsory parade.....

                    <para>. - The most important recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee was that  oil  shale deposits in Australia should, if possible, be treated as they are in  America.  Even at the present high prices charged for American and foreign petrol, shale oil cannot be extracted at a price which will enable it to compete successfully with flow oil. For the future safety of Australia it is therefore deemed essential that no such competition should be entered into; but that the oil shale deposits in Australia should be conserved for use in times of emergency, as is being done in America. That country, which is wonderfully rich in petroleum products, possesses millions of pounds' worth of flow oil, and has also large tracts of country carrying deposits of oil shale which are jealously conserved by the American Government in case the supply of flow oil should become exhausted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the extraction of oil from shale, and the" production and carriage of flow oil are also cheaper in that country, but the American authorities have found it necessary to pursue the policy I have mentioned. If that is the case, it is of greater urgency that Australia, which up to the present has not any flow oil, should conserve its oil shale deposits against emergencies which may arise, and when supplies of flow oil may be cut off. I sincerely trust that the committee mentioned by the Minister may he influenced to some little degree by the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I endorse all that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill.</inline> As a member of the Accounts Committee at the time the investigation was conducted, I may say that the committee went very carefully into the whole question of oil shale deposits in Australia. We ascertained that unless the shale deposits at Newnes were preserved and the plant protected much of the work already done would be valueless. The timbers in the workings were collapsing, and if operations were to re-commence in the event of an emergency, a good deal of preliminary work would have to be undertaken. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, the committee recommended that the Government should, as soon as possible, endeavour to obtain control of the shale, but not necessarily with the intention of working the deposits to full capacity. A number of expert witnesses gave valuable information to the committee concerning what is being done in America. As mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> the American authorities have already taken steps to preserve the shale  deposits in that country, although, we understand, there is practically an unlimited supply of flow oil available. Competent authorities stated in evidence before the committee that at that time there was no indication of any diminution in the supply of flow oil. The American authorities evidently think it essential to place the large deposits of shale under government control, so that they mav be available for future use. Up to the present flow oil is not available in Australia, but there are some very valuable deposits of oil shale. In these circumstances it is necessary to obtain control so that if necessary oil may be extracted with the least possible delay. I assi.ro honorable senators that the members of the committee were much impressed by the large oil shale deposits in the different States, which should be placed under the control of the Government, so that supplies of oil shale may be available should they be needed. </para>

                    <para>. - The treatment of oil shale is a rather important subject. I read very carefully the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, and I believe that if the Government should' attempt to do anything of the nature recommended by the committee it will be confronted with a very large order. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent in New South Wales and Tasmania. There are two  companies operating in the latter State, one of which is this month giving a demonstration of its process of extracting the oil. I remind the Minister and honorable senators that the correct commercial process for the extraction of oil from shale has not  yet  been discovered. </para>

                        <para>- Neither in New South Wales nor in Tasmania has the most suitable commercial process been discovered. Another difficulty is that the land belongs to the State. No doubt the Commonwealth could resume it in  a  time of crisis; but it cannot reserve these areas without compensating the companies for the large amount of money which they have spent. The Government should assist those who are endeavouring to discover a successful process, even if in the future the oil may be required for defence and other purposes. The oil shale is practically useless until  a  proper commercial process is discovered.  What  will  be  the use of conserving such supplies if in  a  few years  a  superior motor spirit is discovered? It is unwise to recommend conserving supplies for future use. The position is quite different in America, where motor spirit can be bought for ls. to ls. Id. a gallon, whereas it is approximately 2s.  a  gallon in, say, Melbourne  and  Sydney. It is an easy matter for America to conserve her* supplies of oil shale. The Bronder process is being tried out iri Tasmania, and it is hoped that it will be  a  success. Experiments are being made with another process, at Southern Cross, and those associated with the undertaking say that the product will be able to successfully compete with motor spirit now in use. </para>

                        <para>- No. It is not a question of keeping the shale out of use. The trouble is the inability, up to the present, to devise any satisfactory scheme for the extraction of oil from the Wolgan deposits. We cannot possibly hope to compete, for the time being, with the oil producing companies in the United States of America. I understand that the shale in the Wolgan valley is exceedingly rich in oil, but so far no process has been devised for its extraction on a commercial basis. </para>

                        <para>- I know of another shale oil deposit between Brisbane and Ipswich to which I should like to direct the attention of the Minister. Some of the people who are interested in it have made representations to the federal members with the object of securing assistance from the Government to carry on the work there. A considerable sum of money has already been expended and the prospects, I believe, are really goo ^ ; but unfortunately the company has not sufficient funds to continue operations. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> is opposed to the Government becoming actively associated with these undertakings. He believes that more good will be done by financial assistance being given to the companies operating these deposits. There may be something in his argument. Up to the present all the numerous attempts to extract oil from the shale oil deposits in the different States have not been entirely satisfactory from a commercial point of view. I trust, however, that the Government will see its way to help the company I have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>.- I have a personal knowledge of the Wolgan Valley shale oil deposits and I know that, if the Government could be prevailed upon to grant financial assistance, a number of private citizens would be prepared to invest £100,000 in a company for the exploitation of the shale. I doubt, however, if that amount of capital would be sufficient. </para>

                    <para>. -  Another subject which I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Glasgow)</inline> is the decision of the High Court in October last in the action brought by the Defence Department against the English Electric Company of Australia, Limited, Sydney. It appears that some time ago a young apprentice, who, under the compulsory training conditions of the Defence Act, had to attend training camps, was penalized by his employers, who required him at the end of his apprenticeship term to serve an additional period to cover the number of days during which he was absent from his employment on military duties. The Defence Department brought an action against the firm for a breach of the Defence Act, and the magistrate imposed a fine of £10. The Supreme Court of New South Wales, to which the firm appealed, quashed the conviction, and the High Court, on appeal, on the casting vote of the Chief Justice, decided in favour of the firm. In view of the decision of the High Court, the Senate is entitled to know if it is the intention of the Government, to amend the Defence Act so as to protect other apprentices from being penalized in the same .manner. Theseyoung men are being trained to equip, themselves for the defence of Australia.. If, unfortunately, war broke out, they would be assisting to defend the property of some employers who might have penalized them during their apprenticeship. Certainly it was not the intention of Parliament, when the Defence Act was passed, to allow any trainee to be penalized in this way. I am sure that, as a whole, the employers of Australia will not take advantage of the High Court decision, which has disclosed a weakness in the law. The case put up by the company was that the trainee was absent from his employment without leave. I ask honorable senators to consider the position of apprentices, and, indeed, all young men in employment. They are obliged under the law to attend military training camps for a certain period each year. If they fail to do so they may be proceeded against and fined. If, on the other hand, they obey the law, they are liable to be penalized by their employers, who may require them to serve an extra period at the close of their apprenticeship. This state of affairs cannot be tolerated. The sooner the Defence Act is amended the better. </para>

                    <para>.- £ should like to direct the attention of the Minister for Defence to the system oi territorial training in Great Britain, with a view to its introduction in Australia. We have it to a limited extent in connexion with our Light Horse, in which a considerable number of men are serving on a voluntary basis. In Great Britain the Territorials are regarded as volunteers, and they receive what is termed ".efficiency pay," that is to say, pay based upon their degree of efficiency as the result of each year's training. Under our present system the training received  by the rank and file is not sufficient to equip them properly for actual war service. In point of fact, the purpose of the ordinary rank and file of the Australian army is to provide the material for the training of officers and non-commissioned officers. Obviously, officers could not become efficient unless they had a sufficient number of men to work under them. Under the old military system a great many men regarded their regiment as a sort of club. I feel sure that if the British Territorial system could be tried in the Australian infantry, as it is being worked in the Light Horse, and if an appeal were made to ex-service men to join their corresponding units on a voluntary basis, there would be a great response on the part of the citizens of Australia. For a period following the termination of the war everybody was heartily sick of war aud the training necessary to prepare for it. That feeling is now dying away to a marked degree and a great deal of valuable training is being carried on voluntarily in rifle clubs. It is gratifying to witness the enthusiasm displayed by young men at Williamstown on the first Saturday in each month. Much might be accomplished if the act were amended so as to permit those who have completed their training to continue to serve in the ranks. In a report on the British territorial forces considerable stress is laid on the fact that the men are no longer paid in the ordinary way, they are given what is called " efficiency pay," which does not amount to very much. The voluntary system exists to a large extent in our light horse unit, and very fine results accrue from it. The compulsory training system should be continued so that we would be in a state of preparedness in an emergency; but a big effort should be made also to induce voluntary enlistment. At each annual camp there would not then be so much of the tiresome elementary squad drill; the men would be able to devote themselves to advanced technical training. Voluntary enlistment as a non-commissioned officer is now permitted, but many men have neither the time nor the inclination to study for appointment as noncommissioned or commissioned officers. It might be possible to hold a conference of the men with a view to ascertaining what there is in the system that attracts and what discourages them. A systematic investigation of the position ought to lead to a solution of the difficulty. Under existing conditions only recruits are handled. I should like to see the force placed in the position of being able to engage in advanced training which would give a greater return for the money expended. </para>

                        <para>- (Queensland - Minister for Defence) [4.40]. - I have a certain degree of sympathy with the view of the honorable senator. I point out, however, that the position which exists in the light horse pertains also to the -infantry in relation to non-commissioned officers. It is competent under the act for a man to enlist voluntarily as a non-commissioned officer in the infantry. As everybody undergoes compulsory training, probably few would be available for voluntary enlistment in the ranks of the infantry. The system sets out to train a nucleus of officers, and non-commissioned officers, as well as the rank and file in elementary work. I do not know that we could adopt the territorial force system, and it would not be wise to revert to the old voluntary system. Although under that system wo had a. very efficient force and enthusiastic officers and non-commissioned officers, the number trained was very limited and no reserve was formed. When I as a commanding officer secured a good officer or  non-commissioned officer I did my best to retain his services. We had a very large number of men with long service but did not train any reserves, and in the event of trouble arising it would have been impossible to expand our force. Although we do not now have the same enthusiasm and keenness amongst officers and non-commissioned officers I believe it will be generally admitted that we train a larger number of men and form them into a reserve force. I sympathize with those officers who are devoting their time to training the youth of the country, but are unable to make any advance in higher forms of training. They could overcome that to a degree by evolving tactical schemes in their schools even though such a method might not be as interesting as would he the case if they had units to handle. I do not believe it is possible to induce the older men to enlist in the ranks. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. In Australia every physically fit youth is compelled to undergo  a  course  of training. I question very much whether we would succeed in inducing them, to remain voluntarily in the ranks when they had completed their three years' service. I shall, however, have an investigation made to see if voluntary enlistment can be extended to' include men who have completed their compulsory training, and are prepared to continue in the ranks. </para>

                    <para>-- I should like to be furnished with information relating to civil aviation. Has the service been extended from Derby to Wyndham in Western Australia; also, what steps are being taken to extend it from. Camooweal to Brunette Downs in the Northern Territory, as well as from Charleville to Toowoomba and thence to Brisbane, thus completing a chain of stations that would encircle the .continent. The Government should grant every assistance that lies within its power to enable the service to be extended from Wyndham to Darwin, and from that place to Brunette Downs. If we had a network of stations, we should be in a position to take full advantage of any improvement in the service from England to Australia. </para>

                    GLASGOW (Queensland - Minister for Defence) [4.49.]- The sum of £200,000 is to be made available out .of last year's surplus for the extension of civil aviation. The first service to be put in operation will be that from Adelaide to Perth. It will bring Western Australia into closer communication with the eastern States, and will reduce by one week the time that is  now occupied in the transport of mails between England and Australia and vice versa.

                        <para>- It will be primarily a service to reduce the time of mails between the Old Country and Australia; but only mail matter, carrying a surcharge of 3d. per half-ounce, will be carried. It is also proposed to extend the service from Camooweal, on the border of North Australia and Queensland, to a point near Daly Waters, on a line running south from Darwin. That service will be of great benefit to residents in those remote parts of the country, and will reduce from two months to a fortnight the time occupied in the conveyance of mails from the eastern States to North Australia and return. Another service which will connect the Queensland system  with the capital - a very important consideration - will run from Charleville to Brisbane. It is also proposed to institute a seaplane service between Brisbane and Sydney. A further service will be instituted between Sydney and Melbourne, via Canberra ; while yet another will connect Melbourne and Hobart. For the service across Bass Strait it is proposed to use the Southampton flying boats, which are expected to arrive in Australia towards the end of the present year. That service will, at first, be largely experimental. A further  extension  of the Western Australian airway services to connect Derby with Wyndham is also contemplated. I point out that it will take some time to establish these services, chiefly because the whole of the ground organization, such as the provision of aerodromes and permanent as well as temporary landing places, has yet to be prepared. </para>

                        <para>- They will be dual-engined machines. Honorable senators will recognize that during the winter months Bass Strait will be difficult to navigate, because of fogs. It will take some time to get these services established on the same reliable and punctual basis as the existing services; but the Government is keenly  desirious  of  utlizing  this new and efficient means of transport to bring the outback portions of the Commonwealth into closer touch with the more settled districts, and to expedite communications generally. The service between Perth and Adelaide will be a very important link in the chain between Britain and Australia, seeing that it will reduce by one week the time in which replies to letters may be obtained. If a reasonable percentage of first-class mail matter be sent by the new service, it should not be long before it is almost self-supporting. So soon as the ground organization has been completed, tenders for these services will be invited. Care will be taken to give intending tenderers sufficient time to prepare their estimates, and also to ensure that the successful tenderers can be relied upon to carry out their contracts. </para>

                    <para>.- In common with other honorable senators representing Queensland, I have, during the last few weeks, received considerable correspondence from various rifle clubs in Queensland, which desire to know what provision will be made for them for the current financial year. Last year £40,000 was expended in connexion with rifle clubs throughout the Commonwealth, whereas this year a sum of about £2,000 less is to be provided. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> pointed out that to a great extent the compulsory military training system is valueless, because the trainees, having completed the statutory period of three years' service, receive no further training, unless they join rifle clubs. I know that the Minister for Defence recognizes the value of rifle clubs as a second line of defence. Both in Australia and in Great Britain they provided a substantial line of defence in the Great War, as well  as a  considerable number of expert marksmen. I should like to know how these rifle clubs are to be treated during the present financial year </para>

                    <para>.- Before I left Brisbane for Canberra several members of rifle clubs approached me regarding the provision to be made for rifle clubs for the current financial year. These men spend a good deal of their time and money making themselves efficient marksmen, and, although in so doing they derive a good deal of pleasure, it must be recognized that they are also establishinga valuable second line of defence. For some reason, the Government has decided this year to reduce the vote for rifle clubs. I trust, however, that they will be treated as generously as possible. </para>

                        <para>-  (Queensland - Minister for Defence) [5.1]. - The Government recognizes the importance of the rifle clubs throughout the Commonwealth, and has assisted them to the fullest possible extent. It is true that the vote this year is a little less than it was last year; but included in the expenditure for 1926- 27 was an item which will not recur. Thp amount made available this year for distribution among the rifle clubs is practically the same as that expended last year. The Government does not propose in any way to curtail the existing concessions granted to riflfle clubs, namely, 5s., or 2s. 6d. per annum for each efficient member, according to whether the club has its own range, or uses a military range. To be classed as efficient a member must fire a prescribed musketry course. In addition, ammunition to the extent of 100 rounds for each new member and 200 rounds for each efficient member is issued free, while additional ammunition is sold at the reduced rate of £2 10s. per one thousand rounds. Towards the construction of a new range a sum of £75 is granted, and such grants as may be deemed necessary, to a maximum of £75, are made to assist in altering, repairing, or enlarging ranges after construction. </para>

I felt that I was justified in bringing it forward under the heading "Parliament," because Parliament created the Federal Capital Commission, and that what Parliamentcreates it can destroy. I have yet to learn that any commission or any other body constituted by parliament can flout the will of parliament.I do not say that the Federal Capital Commission is doing so in this case, but I am surprised to learn that is clothed with such powers that it can say, in effect, that the residents of the territory go thus far and no farther in regard to protecting their homes and guarding their health - that it can say that under certain conditions no fly-proof windows and doors will be permitted. </para>

Are the people of the brick area of more importance than those who live in the area where there are wooden buildings, and where I understand there are not fly-proof doors or windows? If the commission considers it right to put these health protectors on brick buildings, what reason does it advance for not treating in the same way those who live in the area to which I have just referred? I hope that the Government will urge the commission to make all tenements in the city area as nearly as possible fly and mosquito proof, especially when we are nearing the summer months, during which I arn informed, I think correctly, that blow-flies are a serious menace. </para>

I should like to know if the Government  is  pushing on with the extension of the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line from Port Augusta to Red Hill, and if the South Australian Government has begun to lay the third rail from Red Hill to Adelaide. Honorable senators will recollect that the Commonwealth Government agreed with the South Australian Government to build a railway from Port Augusta to. Red Hill, and the South Australian Government agreed to lay a third rail from Red Hill to Adelaide. Under that arrangement, overseas passengers travelling by the East-West railway will make their journey in greater comfort, and will not be obliged to change from the comfortable transcon tinental train into inconvenient trains between Port Augusta and Adelaide. </para>

                    <para>. - Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid,</inline> I am pleased to note in the latest report presented to Parliament by the Commonwealth Commissioner of Railways, the progress made by the East- West railway. The bill introduced in the Commonwealth Parliament t 'o authorize a survey of a route to link up the east and the west, was most unpopular in Victoria. There was much opposition to it; a lot of pessimists thought that if the line were built it would prove to be an everlasting burden on the shoulders of the people of Australia. The line was designated by many uncomplimentary names. When, later on, a bill for the construction of the railway came before the Commonwealth Parliament, I supported it, as I had supported the Survey Bill. At that time some people, conscientiously, perhaps, believed that those members of Parliament who gave their support to either bill would be well within the danger zone when they met their masters, the electors, at a general election. I told those who were of that opinion that I should do what I conscientiously believed to be right, and that if I lost my seat in the Senate as a result of my votes, I should bow to the will of the majority. Time passed, and to-day there is no one who will declare that the East- West line has not justified its construction, and is not in the best interests of Australia. No one in his wildest moments would anticipate that such a railway would pay at the commencement. No one anxious for the progress of the Commonwealth would anticipate that a big proposition like this, built for the development of the Commonwealth, and the convenience of its people, and involving considerable expenditure, would pay immediately. The direct and indirect benefit derived from the railway cannot be calculated in pounds, shillings and pence. If we looked at every big proposition from a financial viewpoint little or no progress would be made in Australia. The east-west railway has now turned the corner. During the last financial year it paid working expenses and provided a sum to meet a portion of the interest on the capital outlay. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but I have always been in favour of a uniform gauge, which will have to be adopted sooner or later. There are, for instance, three breaks of gauge between Adelaide and Perth, namely at Terowie, Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, and it is easy to imagine the inconvenience and cost to travellers. Incidentally I may refer to the break of gauge at Albury. To attend the sittings of Parliament last week, I left Melbourne on the Monday preceeding the Wednesday on which the present session opened. TheRoyal Agricultural Show had been in progress in Melbourne and there were a number of interstate travellers and Federal Parliamentarians on the train. The Albury station, which is not well lighted, was overcrowded, and I found that it was most difficult to make any progress along the platform owing to space taken up by the mail matter being transferred from one train to another, by passengers handling their own baggage, and by dogs being led along the platform. All this inconvenience could be avoided if the Commonwealth Government in co-operation with the States adopted a uniform gauge. </para>

                        <para>- I know there is a feeling amongst certain people in Victoria that that is the best gauge, but in other directions a different opinion prevails. These breaks of gauge are a bad advertisement for Australia especially when oversease and interstate travellers, are, by reason of them, subjected to a great deal of inconvenience and cost. Now a commencement has been made with the work of linking Brisbane with Sydney by means of a 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge line. I trust the Government will undertake the necessary work of linking the east with the west in the same way. If that were done, it would not be long before the construction of a uniform gauge line between Melbourne and Sydney would be undertaken. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am anxious to know what progress is being made with the construction of the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway. I understand there has been some difficulty in commencing the construction of a bridge over the Clarence River. The New South Wales Government has been promising to commence this necessary work, but up to the present very little has been done. It is essential that the completion of the bridge should synchronize with the completion of the railway, and I trust that if the New South Wales Government has not yet made a start pressure will be brought upon it by the federal authorities, so that the opening of the line may not be unnecessarily delayed. I join with other honorable senators in expressing appreciation of the manner in which the Commonwealth railways, particularly the east-west line, are being conducted. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner has indulged in some self-congratulation by quoting the opinion of world-wide travellers I can, from personal experience, endorse all that he has said. On a journey to Perth I happened to be in company with an American globe-trotter, and incidentally remarked that the eastwest line provided the best service of any railway in Australia. He replied, "I have travelled the world, and know of nothing better anywhere." That is sufficient to show that, in the opinion of that gentleman, at least, the remarks of the commissioner are fully justified. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Minister consider the advisableness of installing wireless telegraphy on the trains on the east-west railway? During the time I have been travelling on that line I have heard nothing but approval of the comforts  available, and the civility of the staff. A piano is provided in the lounge, and passengers have also the luxury of a shower-bath, which is unusual on trains. It should be an easy matter to provide a wireless set, with a loud  speaker,  so that passengers may be kept in touch with the world's news. This matter, I believe, was brought under the notice of the Government by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green),</inline> who received a reply to the effect that it was impracticable to operate wireless on trains. That is not so. On one occasion when I was travelling between Perth and Kalgoorlie a passenger with a wireless set obtained good reception by fixing a broom handle on the footboard and running a wire as an aerial along the top of the carriage. The equipment was so effective that all the way to Northam passengers enjoyed a splendid programme, transmitted from Farmers', in Perth. If that can be done with a primitive equipment, surely an effective wireless set could be provided, on the east-west trains. </para>

The mutilated message caused not only considerable expense to the person to whom it was addressed, but also gave him a great shock. The message was despatched to a man named Thomas, at Lyall's Mill, via Collie, and read - "Little girl discharged hospital returned home. Account No. 1,021 tickets other material forwarded McKenzie." The message as received by Thomas read - " Little girl just died hospit.il return home." One can imagine the anguish of a father on receiving such a message. Thomas lost four days' employment. It cost him approximately £17, I understand, for motor hire to reach the hospital, and all the time he was under the impression that his daughter was dead.

I  beg  to express regret for the mutilation which occurred in telephonic transmission from Collie during the progress of a thunderstorm, which rendered reception difficult. The circumstances and inconvenience occasioned are very, much regretted. </para>

                <para class="block">The secretary of the union then brought the matter under my notice, and I communicated with the Postmaster-General, who upheld the decision of the DeputyDirector of Posts and Telegraphs, and stated that there was no redress for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas.</inline> I realize that it 'is almost impossible to conduct a vast telegraphic system, such as we have in Australia, without occasional mistakes, and that the service is an excellent one; but I venture to say that the case I have just mentioned should be reconsidered. Let any honorable senator put himself in the position of this man, working, as he was, some distance from his home, and knowing that his child was in a hospital. Let honorable senators imagine his feelings when he received a telegram to say that his child had just died; let them imagne, also, the mental agony which he must have suffered before he was able to reach the hospital, then to learn that his child was alive and well. The Postmaster-General was quite sympathetic in his reply to my representations, but I maintain that in such extraordinary circumstances the decision should be reviewed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> should be compensated for the time lost from his work, and reimbursed the expenses which he had to incur in trying to reach the hospital as quickly as possible. I hope that the Honorary Minister will bring the matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General again, with a view to securing redress for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas.</inline></para>

I recognize that the commission has not had much time up to the present to determine what are the best lines of development to recommend; but I happen to know that certain work is being undertaken, with, I presume, the knowledge  of  the Cabinet. I refer to certain railway surveys, which I believe have -been undertaken at the instigation of the  commission. </para>

                    <para>. - Under the heading " Federal Capital Territory" I should like to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories to the 'bus service at present being conducted by the Federal Capital Commission. I am informed that some timeago tenders were called by the commission to enable the service to be carried out by private enterprise, and that the tenders were not considered satisfactory, with the result that the commission is still responsible for the service. Personally I believe in State or  communityowned public activities, and I should be sorry to see private enterprise controlling the 'bus service in the Federal Capital Territory. My complaint now is that the service is not frequent enough. Possibly the commission considers that an improved service is not justified by the returns; but from observations which I made a few days ago, I should say that unless better provision i3 made for the convenience of 'the people living in Canberra, there will be risk of extreme danger to life some day. In all cities throughout Australia public conveyances are licensed to carry a certain number of passengers ; if those who run them permit overcrowding, they are liable to prosecution. At certain times of the day the buses plying for hire in Canberra are packed with people like sardines in a box. If anything happened to one of those vehicles when it was so overcrowded, many lives would be endangered. I should like to know whether it is the intention of the commission to provide a better service, or whether that body wishes to hand over the 'buses to private enterprise. Meantime, the convenience of the residents should be considered. At present many of them have to wait long periods for 'buses to convey them to their respec tive homes. The majority of public servants are employed at considerable distances from their homes. If for any reason they are obliged to walk, they are seriously inconvenienced, especially during such wet weather as was experienced last week. Men and women have to be at their place of employment at a certain hour each day, and at times it may not be convenient for them to walk. If the 'bus is full when it comes along it is impossible for those people to reach their destination within the time desired. I hope that the Government will see that conveyances are provided for those who wish to use them and that they will not be so overcrowded as to constitute a danger to those who travel by them. </para>

                    <para>.- There is another matter that the Ministry would do well to consider. The government of the Federal Capital Territory is carried on under ordinances, into one of which an irritating provision has crept. If a person has business premises in the civic centre he can let the whole of them without reference to the commission, but if he should wish to sub-let a portion he must first obtain its consent. Considerable delay is thus caused, and a prospective tenant cannot be readily informed whether he may have the use of the portion he desires. The idea originally was that the shopkeeper would have his residence on the upper floor, and it was considered undesirable to allow him to take in lodgers, the benevolent intention being to obviate the creation of slum areas. I believe that the commission itself has found the provision unworkable and is anxious that it should be withdrawn. </para>

                        <para>- A complaint has reached me from servants of the  adminis- tration in New Guinea. They have not the right of appeal in regard to salaries to either the Public Service Board or the Public Service Arbitrator. Their salaries have not been increased since the date of their appointment. A most glaring anomaly has occurred as the result of the appointment recently of  a  gold-fields warden - a junior officer with really no high professional qualifications. It was found necessary to appoint a Queensland man and the administration was obliged to offer him a high salary. He is receiving a salary greater than that which is. being paid to other officers who are his superiors. Neither in Victoria nor in New South Wales is  a  gold-fields warden or a magistrate in receipt of a salary greater than that which is paid to the head of the department. The salaries attaching to those positions in Australia have risen considerably since 1920, and they must be paid to any one who goes to New Guinea from Australia. Provision should be made whereby public servants in New Guinea would have access to either the Public Service Arbitrator or the Public Service Board. </para>

I point out to the honorable senator that it was necessary to obtain the services of a very competent officer who possessed a knowledge of mining law, to administer affairs at Edie Creek, where trouble had occurred. At the time there was not in the Territory an officer who possessed those qualifications, and he had to be obtained from a mainland State in which there was a mining administration. The officer selected has succeeded in bringing about more contentment. I shall refer to the Minister the question that has been raised by the honorable senator. </para>

                    <para>This bill is to grant and apply the sum of £317,649 out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the services of the year ending the 30th June, 1928, for the purposes of additions, new works, buildings, &amp;c., and to appropriate that sum. The total amount which Parliament is being asked to appropriate is £101,202 more than the expenditure of the previous year, and £20,915 more than the amount voted for 1926-27. The amounts included in the bill for the many services are relatively small. The total amount of £317,649 is distributed under two parts, as follows :  - Part I. Departments and services, other than business undertakings and Territories of the Commonwealth, £284,049 ; and Part 3. Territories of the Commonwealth, £33,600. The principal items provided for are: - Reserves of stores, including ammunition, ordnance, torpedo stores, and coal and oil fuel, £74,000; oil fuel storage facilities, £24,000; naval bases, works and establishments, £20,000; machinery and plant for manufacture of munitions not now produced in Australia, £39,681; acquisition of Small Arms Ammunition. Factory, Footscray, £19,153; erection of, and alterations and additions to, buildings, and construction of launches and vessels for Customs Department, £25,015 ; new buildings, alterations, and additions, and construction of launches and vessels for Health Department, £  41,870  ; erection, &amp;c. of buildings, construction and filling of petrol tank and construction of buildings and roads, engineering services and water boring in North Australia and Central Australia,  £31,600.  Ministers will be glad to furnish any information required as to the details of the works referred to when the bill reaches the committee stage. </para>

                    <para>. -  I listened.yesterday with a great deal of interest to the speech of the Minister when moving the second reading of this measure. The honorable gentleman complimented the Joint Committee on Electoral Law and Procedure on the excellent work it had performed and the recommendations it had made in connexion with our electoral laws; but he intimated that the Government could not seeits way clear to accept some of those recommendations. In many directions our electoral laws could be improved. For instance, those sections which deal with elections to the Senate could, with advantage, be amended. I realize, however, that if I were to refer to many of the defects in our existing electoral legislation I should be discussing matters which are outside the scope of the measure now before us. I have carefully perused the bill, and realize that it embodies, to a greatextent, the recommendations of the committee to which reference has been made, and of the officers of Electoral Department. It is principally a machinery measure. I propose to refer to four matters with which it deals, namely: signed articles, the reduction in the hours of polling, postal voting and gifts, donations, and contributions by members of Parliament.

                </list>
                <para class="block">This amendment opens up a question, which is not only important, but also very controversial. When the electoral law was altered to make it compulsory that all articles appearng in newspapers for a certain period prior to an election, and until the return of the writs, should be signed, I was a member of the Senate, and assisted in passing the amendment. Nothing has occurred in the intervening years to make me change my opinion. I supported the amendment of the law at that time to compel writers of leading and other articles in the newspapers during an election campaign to sign their names to them. My reason for doing so was that parties were subjected to a vast amount of misrepresentation in newspaper articles, and the members of the party to which I belonged were particular sufferers in that respect. The fact that the writers of articles have been compelled to sign them has, I think, been the means of reducing a great deal of the misrepresentation that previously existed. As a matter of fact, "misrepresentation" is a rather mild term to use. All sorts of statements were made to vilify the Labour party, and place the objects it had in view in a false light before the people. I have no reason to think that that particular antagonism has diminished in the slightest. I venture to say that if this check on newspaper writers is removed there will be scope for active writers in the interests of their parties and in the dissemination of their party propaganda to go beyond the bounds of ordinary f airplay, and to so put their case before the electors as to confuse them and prevent them from giving a really clear and intelligent vote on election day. There is certainly a qualification in the proposal containing the bill. If any comment is made on the subject matter of a report the article must be signed. But I am not at all in favour of either the recommendation of the Select Committee or the Government's proposal. Evidence may have been brought forward in favour of it, but I know no just reason why the law should be altered in this regard. The provision in the act has helped to make political contests fairer; it has helped to put the views of all candidates clearly before the electors, and, after all, it is the duty of all parties to give to the great jury which on election day will decide the personnel of Parliament all the facts necessary to assist them in arriving at their verdict. I have come to the conclusion, therefore, that I cannot support the proposed amendment. In this regard I wish it to be clearly understood that whatever comments I may make on this measure, however I may vote, I am speaking and acting for myself. Honorable senators of the Labour party differ in their views in regard to this bill, and the electoral law generally. For my own part I cannot support an amendment which will mean the elimination of the obligation to sign articles in newspapers during an election campaign. Another important amendment seeks to reduce the hours of voting. </para>

                        <para>- Probably it does, and the Commonwealth system of having the poll from 8 o'clock in the morning till 8 o'clock at night has also worked well. I know no valid reason why the hours of polling should be reduced. It must be remembered that we provide for compulsory voting in our electoral law. Therefore, we should not restrict the facilities given to the people to comply with the law. I cannot see what those in charge of polling booths will gain by reducing the polling time by one hour. </para>

                    <para>That the manner in which the proceedings in the Senate were conducted at its meeting on 9th May, 1927, was a grave breach of the privileges of the House, and must not be regarded as a precedent. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit this motion without the slightest particle of party or personal feeling. My only object is to preserve the rights, independence, integrity, dignity, and honour of the Senate, which I feel is an obligation not only upon me, but also upon every other honorable senator. The British are the only people I know of who, right down through all the centuries, have displayed a genius for constitutional government. They have taught the world the way in which constitutional and party government should be exercised, by maintaining the rights, independence, integrity, dignity and honour of that great Mother of Parliaments, the House of Commons, which is regarded as the principal parliamentary institution in the world, and sets an example worthy of emulation. In the fight for these rights the House of Commons has had to resist the aggression of the Crown, sometimes of the old feudal system, and also of governments; but it always has upheld its rights, privileges, independence, integrity, dignity, and honour. We have inherited these great traditions - we have adopted the practice of the House of Commons - and it is our bounden duty to see that every right and privilege handed down to us is passed on intact to those who succeed us. That is the only reason I have for submitting this motion. I contend that if the practice adopted in the Senate on the 9th May were accepted as  a  precedent, this chamber might as well be wiped out of  existence, because it would be at the mercy of any government which chose to prevent the Senate from transacting its business in accordance with its rules of procedure. The procedure to be followed on that day was clearly laid down in a paper prepared for the guidance of senators, presumably by the  Clerk  of the Senate, and, sir, with your concurrence. The paper set out that after petitions had been presented, notices of motion and questions might be called on and papers laid upon the table. It further stated that a motion for the presentation of an address to  His  Royal Highness, the Duke of York, would be moved, and also that motion for leave of absence and that the Senate should rise until a date to be fixed would be moved. That was the correct procedure to be followed. But what happened? Petitions were not called for by you, sir; notices of motion and questions were not invited. The Government intervened before this business was transacted, and intervened, I believe, sir, with your concurrence. Leave to move a motion was obtained before the sittings of the Senate were properly opened. If the Government can do that on one occasion, it can do it On another. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister had no right to obtain the leave of the Senate to do anything until the proceedings had been properly opened. No one has a right to intervene until that is done. The people of Great Britain have an incontrovertible right to approach Parliament by petition before Parliament can proceed to transact any business. That has always been the right of the British people. On this occasion petitions were not called for. No one has the right to ask for leave to do anything in the. Senate until you, sir, call for the presentation of petitions in the proper way, ask for notices of motion, and call on questions. After that has been done the Minister in charge of Government business can ask for leave to move a motion, but not before. I wish to direct particular attention to what actually happened. The  chairman  of a joint committee of both Houses was prevented by the procedure followed from presenting a report of the committee to the Senate, although he was present in the Chamber, and was not only willing but anxious to present it. </para>

                        <para>- I have stated the position. The  chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee expressed indignation at being prevented by the procedure adopted from presenting the committee's report. After an interval of four and a half months it has now been presented to the Senate. The report was the result of a long and careful investigation by the committee, the cost of which has to be met by the taxpayers. The taxpayers, however, were denied the right of ascertaining the contents of the report for four and a half months, owing solely to the procedure adopted on that occasion. That is entirely wrong. Such a course has never been followed before in this Parliament, and never in the House of Commons during the whole of its existence. On this occassion the only business transacted was that which the Government chose to submit. I, in common with other honorable senators, was aware from the outset that the procedure was entirely out of order. You, sir, in speaking on the matter on that occasion, directed attention to the fact that no objection was raised at the time. I ask you, sir, what that has to do with the question. It is not so much our business to see that the procedure is correct as it is yours, although I admit that every honorable senator hasa responsibility. You, sir, also twitted honorable senators with having failed to direct attention to the matter at the time.If I may be permittedto say so, that was rather ungenerous on your part, seeing that, personally, I did not call attention to the manner in which business was being transacted, mainly out of consideration for yourself. It is absolutely distasteful and unpleasant to me to call attention to wrong procedure or to raise points of order. I intensely dislike doing such a thing to my successor in the chair. Wo find that not only did the Minister in charge of business. in the Senate on the 9th May, move a motion which he had no right to move when he did, although you sir, said that he had a right 10 move it by leave, but that you, sir, before calling on the business in the proper way, read a message from  His Excellency  the Governor-General containing a list of bills, which I shall not enumerate, to which assent had been given. That was done without asking for petitions or calling on notices of motion and questions. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> presented a long list of papers. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I am exceedingly sorry that he is not present; I should have liked him to be here. "We cannot delay discussion on this subject until he returns, because the Senate cannot be permitted to sleep on its rights. I have no desire to censure any one; my only wish is to assist in preserving the rights of the Senate. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> also presented a number of papers. He did not seek or obtain leave, and the business of the Senate was not called on in the proper way. A motion for leave of absence, and a motion concerning the next meeting of the Senate were disposed of before the business of the Senate was called on; as a matter of fact the business was not called at all during the sitting. I must beg leave to differ entirely from any one who says that that was not a breach of the privileges of the Senate. Why was it done? We were told that objection would be taken to the presentation of the Public Accounts Committee's report to the Senate on that day as it might lead to an unseemly discussion. No discussion could have arisen on the day the report was presented. The  Chairman  of the Committee would have done the same as he did last week. He would have presented the report, and given notice of his intention to move " that the paper be printed." In any case an arrangement for the convenience of the other House should not concern the Senate, which is an independent branch of the legislature. - As I have said, no discussion would have taken place had the report been presented that day. It was brought forward last Wednesday week - ten days ago - and there has not yet been a word of discussion upon it.

                <para>I do not wish to labour the question. Even if I felt so disposed, my physical condition would not allow me to do so. I should like to emphasize that if. in my view, the procedure, to which j take exception, on the 9th May had been due to inadvertence because of excitement natural on such a unique and important occasion or to exhilaration on the part of either you, sir, or the Leader of the Senate because of the honour that had been conferred upon you, the matter could have been overlooked; but since it has been admitted that the procedure was adopted deliberately, I feel compelled to submit this motion in order to protect the rights of this chamber. If honorable senators will look at Standing Order No. 412 they will find that when the mover of a motion has replied, the debate is absolutely closed. There can be no exception to that rule whatever. On the 9th May, however, that Standing Order was not complied with. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the proceedings shows that after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had moved his motion, and had replied, you, sir, also addressed the Senate. Your right to do that at the proper time and on any subject, and to vote on any subject is unchallengeable. But you have no more right than any other honorable senator to address the chamber after a debate has been closed as provided by the Standing Orders. However, that is a much smaller matter, and I do not wish to stress it. My chief concern is to sec that the rights and privileges, the independence, the honour, and the dignity of the Senate are not impaired, and  1  appeal to every honorable senator to declare that the procedure of the 9th May must not be regarded as a precedent. If it were, it would deprive us of those rights and privileges which have been fought for through the centuries by -the House of Commons. </para>

                    GLASGOW.As the honorable senator has said,  if  there had been an objection, the Vice-President of the Executive Council could not have submitted his motion. The permission of the Senate having been obtained, as provided for in the standing order I have just quoted, the procedure was altered. The first business was a message from the Governor-General. It will be admitted that under the Standing Orders, such a message may be reported at any time, so long as a debate is not interrupted. Then, in accordance with Standing Order 67, certain papers were presented. The presentation of papers also may be done at any time when other business is not before the Senate. Then came a motion by the Leader of the Senate, under Standing Order 65, which provides that any motion connected with the conduct of the business of the Senate may be moved by  a  Minister at any time without notice. After that came the motion for the adjournment, as provided for in Standing Order 63. This may be moved by a Minister at any time. Although the procedure of the 9th May may have been unusual, the departure from the routine of business was not made without the leave of the Senate, as provided/ for in Standing Order 66. This matter was discussed at some length on the motion for the adjournment on the 9th May, and I do not think that anything has arisen since then to alter the position. I hope that the Senate will not agree to the motion.

                    <para>. - I shall say but a very few words on this subject since I think it has been threshed almost threadbare. I intend to support the motion, because, in my opinion, the procedure adopted on the occasion referred to was most undesirable, and, I believe, was taken deliberately, in order to prevent an important report of the Public Accounts Committee from being presented. If I were at liberty, I could bring proof of that statement. </para>

                <para class="block">The fact that it was a tactical blunder has nothing to do with the case, and does not influence my judgment on this occasion. My very long experience of parliamentary procedure on the floor of the House, and in the Chair, convinces me that it is a precedent which ought not to be followed. If the motion is defeated, the inference will be that the procedure adopted on the 9th May should be regarded as a precedent. I ask honorable senators to bear that point in mind. Foi the reasons that I have endeavoured to express as clearly and shortly as possible, it is my intention to support the motion, although I regret that it has been moved, believing that we should "Let the dead past bury its dead." I should not be true to my conception of the functions of this Senate, the Parliament as a whole, and the procedure that ought to be followed, if I did not support the motion. </para>

It was "otherwise ordered." If my memory serves me rightly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> had in his hands the report of the Public Accounts Committee in readiness to submit it. Why did he not submit it? What was the power behind the scenes that prevented him from doing so? Usually outspoken and courageous, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> must have been " got at " by some unseen power that exercised its influence in the National caucus.

                        <para>- It was our own fault in one sense but not in another. The majority of honorable senators thought that the Leader of the Senate was presenting unimportant business. I do not blame the Government for seizing an opportunity to avoid trouble; but the result was that the Senate was misled. I consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has -made out a very good case in support of the charge that there was a grave breach of the privileges of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> as  Chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee, endeavoured to present its report on certain matters, but was prevented from doing so by the action of the Leader of the Senate. Every honorable senator is aware that it was the desire of the Government to avoid the friction that would have been caused by the Labour party, which had issued a threat that if the paper were presented it would be debated that day. The contention that the rights and privileges of honorable senators were interfered with has not been disproved. If the occurrence were allowed to pass without a protest it  might be repeated. I. therefore, support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline></para>

                    <para>.-- On the 9th May I was anxious that a certain report should he presented to the Senate, and when the procedure which was adopted did not allow of that being done I was greatly disappointed. I thought then, and I think now, that the procedure was wrong. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has made out a ' very strong case. He has said that the traditions of the Senate should be preserved, and that what happened on 9th May should not be regarded as a precedent. I do not think it is likely to be so regarded. It must be remembered that the circum-r  stances surrounding the sitting were exceptional; they are not likely to recur. A member of the Royal Family was in attendance to perform a specific duty, and the notice paper was specially designed to enable the proceedings' to be brought to a conclusion without the slightest hitch. .The report of the Public Accounts Committee has since been presented, and we might very well allow the matter to rest. After the splendid speech that has been delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> in his anxiety to preserve the honour and traditions of the Senate, no Government would dream of again departing from the usual practice. No good can result from the passage of the motion. The honorable senator has practically won the battle, and if I were in his place I should withdraw the motion. If he does not I shall vote against it. </para>

                    <para>.- The question before the Senate is a very simple one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> interjected that there had not been a breach of privilege. That is directly at variance with the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes, and with the facts themselves. As an honorable senator I am at liberty to give notice of a question or a motion. On the 9th May that privilege was withdrawn from me. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes has admitted that the  chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee was deprived of the opportunity to submit its report. That was another distinct breach of privilege. What harm would be done if the motion were carried? It would simply amount to a declaration that in the opinion of the Senate there had been a very serious breach of privilege. The passage of the motion can do no harm. </para>

                    <para>. - It has been obvious during this debate that many honorable senators who feel that the procedure adopted on the historic occasion to which reference has already been made, was not what it ought to have been - a fact admitted by the Government - are unwilling to vote for the motion in its present form because it carries with it some condemnation, inferred, if not actually expressed, of the  President  of the Senate, as well as of the Government. If, however, we fail to declare that the procedure adopted on the 9th May last must not be regarded as a precedent, we, in fact, agree that it must be so regarded. </para>

                        <para>- If we refuse to say that it must not be regarded as a precedent the only inference that can be drawn is that it can be regarded as a precedent, to be used as such by any one who in the future is in charge of the business of the Senate. We may not always have on the Government bench the  highly estimable type of men who now occupy it. The day may come when a Leader of the Government in this chamber will seek to rob honorable senators of their rights and privileges by quoting the vote of the Senate on this motion as a precedent - as he would be  entitled to do - and acting upon it with the support of the majority of honorable senators. It would not be wise for the Senate to run a risk of that kind. It is our duty, in the interests of the Senate, both now and in the future, to maintain all the rights and privileges which we enjoy to-day. But we can do that without in any way inferring condemnation of your action, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and that of the Minister who was in charge of the Senate on the historic occasion in question.

                        <para>- I think it does. It will be admitted by all that the occasion to which reference has been made was an extraordinary one. Perhaps a similar occasion will never occur again. Every honorable senator on that day realized its importance, and was willing to do and to suffer things which he would not do or suffer on other occasions. Having in view the historic nature of the event, and its great importance, we should be prepared to overlook, to some extent, any departure from the ordinary practices of the Senate, provided that we make it clear that similar happenings must not occur in connexion with its conduct on other occasions. My amendment, if agreed to, would meet the occasion in every way, while carrying with it no sting. It would enable honorable senators to vote in the way they desire, but which they might not otherwise do for fear that they would be passing a vote of censure on the presiding officer and the Leader of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - Every honorable senator with a true sense of his responsibility as a member of this Parliament, the highest tribunal in the land, realizes that the matter now before the Senate should not be decided lightly or with any personal feeling. As has already been pointed out, the protection of the privileges of the Senate, or of any other deliberative British assembly, is a matter of serious moment to all concerned. We all subscribe to the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> as to the necessity of maintaining the honour, integrity, and dignity of this Chamber. This Senate like every other deliberative assembly in the British Empire is governed by certain standing orders, and parliamentary practices. Moreover, it is the right of every member of those tribunals to avail himself to the fullest possible extent of the procedure laid down for the conduct of business. The Leader of this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who is unfortunately absent, admitted that on the historic occasion referred to he availed himself of the procedure of the Senate to prevent a certain event from happening. It has been suggested that the notice-paper was interfered with on the 9th May. I have the notice-paper for that day in my hand. There was no interference with it. Indeed, there could have been no interference with it, because it was open to the Minister to move to do anything, by leave, immediately the  President  entered the chamber. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator suggest that physical disability, such as deafness- or that ignorance or the bad acoustic properties of this chamber - should affect our judgment in dealing with  a  matter so important as the preservation of the privileges of the Senate? If, for any reason, honorable senators on the 9th May were lulled into a false sense of security, or  a  belief that certain things were happening, which, in fact, were not happening, is that to be regarded as a matter of privilege ? The course adopted was strictly in accordance with, our Standing Orders. Had any senator exercised his undoubted right to object to the Leader of the Senate making a statement, by leave, the statement which he did make on the 9 th May could not have been made, and the business of the Senate could not have been conducted in the way that it was conducted. </para>

                        <para>- While it is not for me to do that, I suggest that if honorable senators had cared to avail themselves to the full of their rights and privileges, objection might have been taken to the presence in this chamber on the morning of the 9th May of a member of the Royal Family. I am sure no honorable senator would dream of such a thing; but had that objection been taken, it would not have been for the first time in the history of parliaments. Honorable senators will recollect that when, on the 9th May, the Leader of the Senate asked for leave to do certain things, no voice was raised in dissent. That is made clear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

                        <para>- If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> suggests, in the language of the Palestine or Western front, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did " put it over us," that does not necessarily mean that his action was a breach of, privilege. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has frankly admitted that he used the machinery of the Senate on that occasion to obtain a certain result, although honorable senators could have prevented him from doing so had they desired. The action of the Leader of the Senate in availing himself of that machinery to attain the object he had in view, was not a breach of  privilege.  It has been said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> the  Chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee, had no opportunity on the 9th May to present an important report to the Senate. Whose fault was that? To agree to the motion would be tantamount to saying that the use of our own Standing Orders to bring about a * certain result constitutes a breach of privilege. On the 9th May no breach of the Standing Orders occurred. Standing Order 66, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> has referred, clearly contemplates that the procedure which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> evident ,' regards as a rigid rule, can be departed from by order of the Senate. </para>

Under Standing Order 135, if one dissentient voice had been raised there could not have been an order, but for the reason referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> no dissentient voice was raised. Whatever the cause, no dissentient voice being raised when the right, honorable the Leader of the Government in the Senate asked for leave to move a motion, it became an order. The honorable senator asked for. leave to submit a notion not once, but on two or three distinct occasions during the afternon, and on no occasion did an honorable senator dissent. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that we have been wandering through a realm of conjecture about privilege  when privilege is no.t involved. If the procedure of the Senate has been used to " put something over " honorable senators - to use the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> - the blame rests on the whole of the Senate for not being watchful. Perhaps on the occasion referred to honorable senators were less vigilant than usual - perhaps they did not 'realize for the moment what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was doing - but I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> even at this late hour not to place this in the category of breaches of privilege. To do so is to attach too much importance to it, and to set up a dangerous precedent, quite  unwarranted by the facts. Tho honorable senator claims that the right of the people to petition Parliament was violated. He asks why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> did not inquire, as he usually does when he takes the chair, "Has any honorable senator a petition to present?" The  President,  did not do so on that occasion because the right honorable Leader of the Government in the Senate intervened. The same thing may happen to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- It is apparently a murky subject in my friend's mind, but the Leader of the Senate kept within his rights. He obtained leave to do what he did without a dissentient voice being raised, and what he did was thus in accordance with the Standing Orders. If honorable senators were not alert enough, or if through some inadvertence on their part; they allowed the Leader of the Senate to proceed in the way he did, surely no one is entitled to regard it as a breach of privilege. One point in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens'</inline> observations which struck me as somewhat important was that if the Government could do this once it could do it again. Certainly it could, and so could any honorable senator. But that does not constitute it a breach of privilege. The right honorable the Leader of the Government in the Senate simply exercised a right given to him under the Standing Orders. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> it is a practice that is undesirable, but that is a matter which the Leader of the Senate must from -time to time decide according to his own conscience and according to the exigencies of the situation. I have the notice paper for the 9th May. The charge that it was departed from is unfounded. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes has had a long parliamentary experience, and I am sure he can distinguish between a breach of privilege and a breach of procedure. I want him to ask himself whether there is any breach of privilege in this case, or whether it is something that affects the rights of honorable senators.  His  answer must be that it is purely a question of procedure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> has pointed out that no opportunity was given to the  Chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee to present a report of the committee. The opportunity to present that report was removed, not because there was any breach of the privileges of honorable senators, but because leave was given to the Leader of the Senate to proceed in a certain manner. To place what happened on the plane of. a breach of privilege would be to establish a wrong precedent, which would not redound to the credit of the Senate. It would be giving a simple matter an importance that it does not deserve. </para>

                        <para>- That seems to be the kernel of the honorable senator's argument. But leave was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in accordance with the Standing Orders, because no. dissentient voice . was raised. The procedure adopted on that occasion cannot form a precedent, for the simple reason that if leave is sought to make a statement, and honorable senators do not wish the statement to be made, any individual honorable senator can insist on the procedure laid down in Standing Order 66 being followed. Notwithstanding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens's</inline> technical point, I submit that the Standing Order itself contemplates leave being obtained to alter the procedure it lays down. </para>

We play games according to rules. In this great game of parliamentary responsibility we have rules by which we are governed; but because in this case they were used in a manner that does not quite appeal to the technical mind of my friend from Queensland, he asks us to regard what took place as abreach of privilege. No question of privilege is involved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> simply availed himself of the Standing Orders in order to attain a certain end.

                    <para>. - I am a stranger here. I do not know whether or not honorable senators want to take me in, but after listening to this debate I have come to the conclusion that no good can result from it. There is no value in exhuming a body. Seeing the length of time that has elapsed since the happening which is the subject of this motion,I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that having attained his end he should withdraw his motion. One honorable senator says that the Leader of the Senate did certain things; another honorable senator says that the Opposition used a threat. Where may I, a stranger in the Senate, look for finality? I am reminded of the old woman who, when shown two pieces of cloth by a salesman whom she thought was trying to impose upon her, said that the only difference between them was that they were both alike. In this case there seems to be very little difference between the opinions of those who support and those who are opposed to the motion. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who for a number of years occupied with distinction the position of President of the Senate, will realize that it is easy for an error to be made and that no law is perfect., I feel compelled to vote against the motion. </para>

                <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline> John Newlands). -  I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> gave the key to the whole situation when he interjected that the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> on the occasion in question, " put it over " the Senate. Certain honorable senators, believing that he did so, apparently desire now to " put it over " someone else. They are sorry that they gave the Minister leave to move a motion without notice on the day to which reference has been made, and wish to place the responsibility on someone else. It is not my desire to quarrel with any honorable senator ; but I take very strong exception to certain statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill.</inline> They have inferred that I was in league with the Government to prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> from presenting to the Senate a report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the 9th of May. That is absolutely incorrect. I was not in league with the Government then, nor am I to-day. The Leader of the Government in the Senate, on the day in question, asked me to " see " him as soon as possible. I had no more idea of what was in his mind than had any man a thousand miles away. That is all I can say of the incident. This motion has been moved ostensibly for the purpose of directing attention to some alleged omission on my part on that day, and really to censure me for it.For the information of honorable senators, I shall recall the facts. A function of great importance, the like of which will probably never occur again, was being held in Parliament House, and I was possibly somewhat excited, although not for the reason so ungenerously suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> Excitement was shown by honorable senators generally. I was not really excited, but anxious for the reason that my health was impaired, and I was afraid that at any moment I might collapse. I am not putting that forward as an excuse for any omission on my part ; I mention it only as an unfortunate fact. As I have said, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the Leader of the Senate, asked me to " see " him as soon as possible, and I did so. If I omitted to call for the presentation of petitions, or questions without notice, in the usual way, I will show  later that it was not the first occasion on which a President of the Senate had omitted to do so. Frequently the adjournment of the- Senate has been moved at the inception of the proceedings without notices of motion or questions being called for. For instance, when an adverse motion is moved in another place, it is customary for the Minister in charge in this House, before any business is transacted, to move " That the Senate do now adjourn." On such occasions petitions and notices of motion are not asked for, and, therefore, the procedure followed on the 9th of May did not establish a precedent. This question has been raised <inline font-style="italic">aa</inline> one of privilege. I consider it to be a question not of privilege, but of procedure under the Standing Orders. Notwithstanding the extensive knowledge of the Standing Orders possessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and his long experience in the chair, I venture the opinion that a minister in this chamber is entitled to rise in his place at any moment when there is no business before the Senate and ask for leave to move a motion. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did on the occasion referred to, and the Senate granted him leave. There was not a dissentient voice. If the procedure was unusual, or in any sense irregular, then honorable senators who did not object to leave being granted were as much at fault as I was. While I may be censured by some for permitting an alleged breach of the Standing Orders, I say unhesitatingly that I endeavoured, notwithstanding my anxiety and illness, to carry out my important duties to the best ' of my ability, and that in my opinion nothing that was contrary to .the Standing Orders was done. Standing Order 66, which sets out the--routine of business, provides that the business of the Senate shall be taken in a certain order, "unless otherwise ordered." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> in effect, has told the Senate repeatedly that the words, "unless otherwise ordered" are not to be taken into account. I remind him that the routine of business provided for in Standing Order 66 has frequently been departed from. It is not imperative that the  President  shall call for petitions, notices of motion, and questons  before any other business is transacted. For the information of the </para>
                <para>Senate, I quote a ruling of a distinguished predecessor of mine, exPresident <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Gould, who held that a Minister may move the adjournment of the Senate immediately after the reading of prayers. That is to be found in the records of rulings provided for the guidance of honorable senators. Standing Order 65 lays it down that a Minister may at any time move a motion connected with the conduct of the business of the Senate without notice; he can intervene before notices of motion and questions are called for. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> and other honorable senators know that a Minister always has the right of call: that is a well-established principle, so far as I know,. in every Parliament. </para>
                <para>As honorable senators are aware, the Duke of York was to open the first, sitting of the Federal Parliament at Canberra, and .in order to carry out the ceremony in a proper way, it was necessary to arrange a set procedure, which had to be followed as far as possible, according to a timetable, before any ordinary  business was transacted. All that I know concerning any prior discussion between the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce),</inline> the leader of the Labour party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> and the  Chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Kingsmill)</inline> has been gathered, since the proceedings, from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. At the time I knew absolutely nothing concerning any discussion between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> or any one else. Many senators who now appear to be thoroughly conversant with what occurred in that regard, obtained their information, as, I did, from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">Journals of the Senate</inline> show that at the outset of the proceedings on the day under review a message from the Governor-General was reported. I think it will be conceded that under Standing Order 376 this can be done at any time unless a debate is proceeding. After that papers were presented. Under Standing Order 67 this can be done at any time when other business is not before the Senate. As the <inline font-style="italic">Journals of the Senate</inline> show, two Ministers presented a  num-  ber of reports and papers, so that </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline>
                    could alsohave presented the report of the Public Accounts Committee. I am sure that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline>
                    would not have considered that he was doing wrong had he followed the example of Ministers. Following the presentation of reports and papers by Ministers, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, asked for leave, as he had a perfect right to do, to submit a motion. Then followed a motion under Standing Order 65 connected with the business of the Senate, which may also be moved at any time. Followng that, the adjournment was moved under Standing Order 63, which may be moved by a Minister at any time. The whole question hinges upon the fact that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline>
                    Pearce was given leave to move a certain motion, not a dissentient voice being raised. Even the Leader of the Opposition
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham),</inline>
                    who is usually ready and anxious to take exception to leave being granted to submit a motion without notice, did not exercise his usual vigilance on that occasion. After studying the procedure very carefully, I have come to the conclusion that nothing was done which was contrary to the Standing Orders, and that since honorable senators did not take exception to leave being given to the Minister to move his motion, the responsibility rests with them as much as with me.I have stated the facts as I know them without embellishment - without any rhetorical flourishes in regard to the "preservation of the rights of the people." The right of the people to govern themselves was not jeopardized by anything done on this occasion. I am not finding fault with the action of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline>
                    but I think it would have been better if this discussion had been avoided. I appreciate the action of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline>
                    in moving an amendment to "save my face," as it were; but if the Senate considers I have been guilty of carelessness, and have jeopardized in any way the rights and privileges of honorable senators - and I deny that I have - I am prepared to acpept its reprimand.

On that historic day we were privileged to have with us a son of  His  Majesty the King, who opened this Parliament.

                        <para>- Leave is not " order." " Otherwise ordered " can only be accomplished' by motion. It is of no use for the Government now to  try to camouflage the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> being a lawyer, talked all round the issue with the object of confusing honorable senators and, as might have been expected, he succeeded in making it as obscure as was possible. The Senate on the 9th May, did not " order " the usual procedure to be departed from, notwithstanding what my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> has said. He stated that a message from the Governor-General may, be received at any time. My reply is that anything can be done in the Senate provided it is done at the proper time and in the proper way. I am not disputing that for a moment. What I am saying is that neither you, sir, nor the Government had any right to proceed with any business until the Senate had been opened in the usual manner. That is the point which I wish to impress upon honorable senators. If you had called for petitions and had asked for notices of motion and questions, then, undoubtedly, the Leader of the Senate would have been within his right in asking the leave of the Senate to adopt a certain procedure. My objection is that the departure from the recognized parliamentary practice was deliberate on the part of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> admitted that at the time. He said that it was the intention of the Government to prevent a certain report of a Joint Parliamentary Committee from being presented. As a result of that action the public have been deprived of the report for a period of four and a half months. That is another point which I wish to make. In the course of your remarks you, sir, quoted a ruling by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Gould, a former  President  of the Senate, that it is competent for a Minister to move the adjournment of the Senate immediately after prayers. I am not going to dispute that ruling. I have not looked it up, and, therefore, I am not -in a position to express an opinion. My point is* that if a Minister can move that motion at that stage the Senate can do no business, and, therefore, can do no wrong. But on the 9th May the Senate did transact business, and it was not done in the proper way. You have also said, sir, that if there was anything wrong with the procedure of the Senate on that occasion all honorable senators were equally guilty. </para>

                <para class="block">I remind you that whilst what you have said may be true, you, as  President  of this chamber, are not only the custodian of the rights and privileges of the Senate, but also primarily the guardian of those rights and privileges. Therefore, if it was our duty to protect them, it was much more your duty to watch over our procedure It is a strange doctrine that the proceedings may be conducted any old way without any responsibility on the part of the  President  if members do not object. I have already said that whilst I knew the procedure was wrong I thought it was due to inadvertence, and, because of the historic nature of the proceedings, excusable. But the matter assumed an entirely different aspect when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in moving the adjournment of the Senate, stated that the procedure had been adopted deliberately. I should probably have taken definite action then but for the fact that it would have been distasteful to me to raise a point of order; and, moreover there was a general desire, out of consideration for you, that the proceedings should pass off smoothly. I merely wish to add that if your health was bad on that day I think mine was- very much worse. However, that is a personal matter, and need not be enlarged upon. If, as you contend, the Leader of the Senate had a right to move a motion by leave before the business was called on in the proper way, all I can say is that there is no precedent for that course in the records of either the House of Commons or this Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B.

                        <para>- It was not my duty at that stage to intervene. If anything wrong was being done it was primarily the duty of the  President  to see that the proper procedure was followed. If I had thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was adopting the procedure deliberately - as afterwards he admitted - I should have taken a point of order at once. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> I shall be very cautious, in future, about granting leave to Ministers to depart from the ordinary procedure of the Senate, and I am afraid that the Government will find my objection at times exceedingly inconvenient. Ministers must understand, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> has said, that they cannot " put it over us," and hope to get away with it every time. The  President  has said that, when the Leader of the Senate rose in his place on that occasion, he called on the Minister to speak.In ordinary circumstances it is unquestionably right for the  President  to do that. It is a courtesy generally accorded to a Minister. But the  President  had no right to see any one, not even the Minister, until the business of the Senate had been called on in the proper way. </para>

I am willing to believe that if either you, sir, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> had been seized of the gravity and the importance of that unusual procedure, it would not have been adopted. I drew attention to the fact that you di.d not intervene in the debate until after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had replied. You did not do me the honour to reply to the point which I had raised as to your right to do that. . You will find, that according to Standing Order 412, that in all cases the reply of the mover of the original question closes the debate. That is definite enough. I have no personal feeling in the matter at all; but I insist that it is the duty of every member of this Parliament to preserve those rights and privileges which were fought for and won for us down through the centuries, and to do all that lies in his power to ensure the independence and integrity of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to bring before honorable senators adisability under which members of both Houses suffer. When we sat in Melbourne honorable senators could read in the morning newspapers an account of the business which had been transacted in another place on the previous day. Here we are not aware of what has been done until we can obtain a copy of either a Sydney or a Melbourne newspaper. That  isa  disadvantage to members of the Senate, and, possibly, also to members of the House of Representatives. Arrangements ought to be made for the publication each morning pf the proceedings in the House of Representatives. Frequently one does not have an opportunity to read the newspapers when they arrive, and consequently is not kept properly informed of the' business that has been transacted in another place. </para>

                    <para>[9.56] .   -  I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> and to honorable senators generally, that the staff at Federal Government House have not been in Australia very long, but the practice is adopted which obtains all over the world of issuing invitations to those who observe the courtesy of entering their names in the Governor-General's book. On a previous occasion, when there was an occurrence similar to that referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> the  Clerk  of the other House entered the name of every member in the book kept for that purpose at Government House. I do not know whether honorable senators consider that they should haveextended to them privileges that are not enjoyed by other members of the community. Every one is aware that certain courtesies are required in society. I use that term in a sense different from that appliedto it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> All that is asked is that the courtesy which is expected from the Governor-General should be extendedalso to him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is fully aware that in every British dominion certain courtesies are extended to Vice-regal representatives. A further consideration of the matter, I am sure, will convince him that honorable senators shouldnot expect to be absolved from doing that which other members of the community are expected to do. I do not object to his having drawn attention to the matter : but I suggest that honorable senators should see that their names are entered in the book which is kept at Government House, or that which is available at No. 2 Secretariat. </para>
