                <para class="block">My object in submitting this motion is to place myself in a position, so soon as the formal stage of the first reading of the bill has been passed, to move the second reading of the measure and make a speech thereon. No objection will be offered to the debate then being adjourned. If that course is desired by any honorable senator, his right to move in that direction will not be in any way curtailed. In view of the small amount of business on our notice-paper, it is considered desirable to advance the bill to the stage that I have indicated. It is not intended to curtail the debate in any way. </para>

                    <para>. - I am somewhat surprised that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> should move for the suspension of the Standing Orders at any stage of this measure. I can see no urgency for the hill. On the contrary, there are strong reasons for its passage being delayed, particularly in this Senate. The right honorable gentleman has advanced, as a reason for our immediately entering upon a discussion upon this allimportant matter, the small amount of business that appears upon our notice paper. I remind the right honorable senator that it is certainly not the fault of the Senate that there is very little business on the notice-paper. The fault lies with the Government. Sixteen months ago Ministers placed in the hands of  His Excellency  the Governor-General a document filled with lots of promises about certain legislation ; but very little, if any, of the programme then outlined has been put through Parliament. Now, after an adjournment from August until March, and after another place has devoted eight days to the consideration of this most important piece of legislation, the Senate is asked to suspend the standing orders so that it may be disposed of as soon as possible. I regret that I cannot countenance that sort of thing, despite the assurance of the right honorable senator that it is his intention not to proceed further than moving the second reading of the bill. If ever there was a time for caution and even delay on the part of this branch of the national legislature, it is now when one of the most important measures we have ever been asked to consider has come before us. I trust that the Senate will not accede to the request for the suspension of the standing orders at any stage in the passage of this bill. As the motion now submitted, if agreed to, will save only one day, I think the right honorable senator might have adopted the ordinary procedure. I think also that the Senate ought to assert its rights in this manner, particularly as it is supposed to be the guardian of the rights of the States which, if this legislation is adopted, will be seriously affected. Care and deliberation rather than haste should be our rule. </para>

                <para>That the bill be now read a second time. </para>
                <para>This bill provides for the termination, from the 30th June, 1927, of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States as provided for in the Surplus Revenue Act. It also provides for special grants to the States of Western Australia and Tasmania and, subject to any agreement arrived at, for payments to all the States, equivalent to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, during the financial year commencing 1st July, 1927. It is not proposed to ask Parliament to proceed with bills repealing the direct taxation imposed by the Commonwealth. That matter will be left in abeyance pending negotiations with States. If this bill passes it is the intention of the Government, later on in the year, to seek a conference with the States. Before the Senate is asked to pass legislation repealing the direct taxation imposed by the Commonwealth it is our intention to explore with the States, if they are willing to meet us, all or any methods that may be suggested for a new financial arrangement between them and the Commonwealth. The suggestions put forward may include the adoption of the present proposals, payments by the Commonwealth to a sinking fund to liquidate State debts, or the taking over of a portion or the whole of those debts. All these suggestions and others, if there are others, we are willing to consider and discuss with the States in an honest endeavour to arrive at an amicable arrangement with them as to the most satisfactory basis for the financial relationships between the Commonwealth and States. At this juncture, therefore, the Senate is not asked to approve of the repeal of all or any of the direct taxation referred to in the proposals placed before the State Governments some time ago by the Federal Government. All that honorable senators are now asked to do is to approve of the termination of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments from the 30th June next, and a continuation of similar payments pending au agreement, which we hope and anticipate will be reached before Parliament meets again. Parliament will then be in a position to know whether the States have agreed to meet the Commonwealth in conference, whether, that meeting having taken place, the Commonwealth or the States have adopted an unreasonable attitude, or whether the proposals put forward were such as should have been accepted either by the Commonwealth or by the States. Thus before the end of the financial year 1927-28, the Senate as part of the Commonwealth legislature, should be in a position to know what has taken place, and, if it wishes to do so, to repudiate the Government's proposals and to direct, as it can, any government as to the course which it thinks ought to be adopted in arriving at a financial arrangement with the States. At this juncture, all that we are asking the Parliament to agree to is that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system should end, and that by consultation with the States at a conference, at which every avenue is explored a more satisfactory financial arrangement should be arrived at. </para>
                <para>I recognize that this is a very important matter, and with the indulgence of the Senate, I propose to set out at some length the historical associations surrounding it. First of all we have to remember that ours is a federation which was formed by colonies then in being. As a matter of fact, our Federal Constitution is. the creation of the States, having been drafted by men with long experience in the governments of the then existing colonies. When the leading representatives of the colonies set about the task of framing a constitution for a federation they Bad but few precedents for their guidance. There were, however, a few federations in existence, and we can see how they dealt with this question. In the United States of America Congress was given the exclusive right to impose the Customs tariff - the Commonwealth Parliament has the same exclusive right - but in all other respects the State Legislatures were, given concurrent powers along with Congress. However the Constitution of the United States of America contains no provision corre sponding with section 87 of our Constitution. Apparently the problem of an unmanageable surplus was overlooked by the framers of the American Constitution. In Canada the Provinces were given a subsidy from the Dominion Government, but not on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. The discrimination between the Provinces can be conveniently shown by taking the figure 100 as the average subsidy, and giving the separate provincial subsidies in proportion. They work out as follows : - </para>
                <para class="block">These subsidies are small when compared with the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment, but show that Canada has deliberately avoided the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> principle and adopted a method by which the financially backward provinces are helped. In South Africa there is no such arrangement, as the Union Government receives all the revenue. In Switzerland the Federal Government can call upon the Cantons for levies, which are determined, not by the Cantons, but by the Federal Legislature. It will, therefore, be seen that there is nothing to be gained by studying the South African or Swiss legislation as it is entirely dissimilar from our own. Taking the Canadian legislation, it will be seen that Article 102 provides  that  all duties and (revenues over which the respective legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick before, and at the commencement of the Union, had and have power of appropriation, except those expressly reserved by the act, shall form one consolidated revenue fund to be appropriated from the Public Service of Canada. Article 103, makes the cost of collection, etc., a first charge on the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and Article 104 provides that the annual interest of the public debts of the several provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, shall form the second charge on the fund. </para>
                <para class="block">Under article111 it is declared that Canada shall be liable for the debts and liabilities of each province at the time of the Union, and Article 118 provides for the payment by Canada to the Provinces of 260,000 dollars, plus 80 cent. per head, up to 400,000, " at which rate such grant shall remain." It enacts further that " Such grant shall be in full settlement of all future demands on Canada; but that the Government shall deduct from such grants all sums' chargeable as interest on public debts in excess of the amounts specified in the act." </para>

                <para>Let usnow look at the position as it existed prior to the Convention. The problem was how to adjust the financial resources of the Commonwealth and the States with the obligations which they had to meet. Two points arose out of that consideration. One was that the direct taxation then in force was not sufficient for the States without Customs revenue, and the other, that the then Customs revenue was in excess of Commonwealth requirements. In these cases all agreed that an adjustment was necessary. There were four methods whereby the problem could be settled, and the reports of the Convention debates show how these were considered. They were: - </para>

                <para class="block">In this statement I have endeavoured to put into concrete sentences an analysis of the attitude adopted by the framers of the Constitution, and I think they fairly express it. We come now to the Sydney Convention. It was admitted by publicists and every one taking an interest in the subject at the time that the financial question was, as it was expressed, " the lion in the path." The financial committee was of opinon that the surplus revenue should be distributed according to population, but it realized that such a distribution would be unfair at the time. It, therefore, recommended that the Customs and excise revenue be devoted to Commonwealth expenditure according to population, and the balance returned to the States in such a way that the amount paid by each State for such Federal expenditure, added to the amount returned, should be the amount contributed by each State on the dutiable articles consumed. The constitutional committee drafting the bill dispensed with the population basis, and made contribution the basis, not only for distributing the surplus, but also for charging expenditure. After discussion, in which the financial committee objected to the alteration made by the constititional committee, a clause was drafted providing that the revenue of the Commonwealth should be first applied to the Commonwealth's expenditure, which should be charged to the States according to population, and the surplus, until Parliament otherwise provided, returned to the States in proportion to the revenue raised therein. That is the point at which this question was left by the Sydney Convention. We now come to the Adelaide Convention of 1897. There the draft was treated as reverentially as possible, but the financial clauses were considerably altered. The clause regarding the distribution of surplus revenue was altered to a population basis. Guarantees were also inserted limiting the Commonwealth's expenditure, and fixing the amount of surplus revenue returnable to the States after uniform duties had been fixed. At the Melbourne conference of 1898, these guarantees were deleted, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Braddon brought forward the first draft of the famous clause which afterwards bore his name, associated with the word "blot," providing that of the net Customs and excise revenue not more than one-twentieth should be spent by the Commonwealth in the exercise of its original powers, that four-twentieths should be spent on transferred services, and the remaining three-fourths distributed to the States. The financial clauses, as finally passed, substantially differed from those of 1891 in one respect only - the addition of the guarantee contained in the Braddon clause. Finality, however, was not yet reached. It was found that the Constitution was still unacceptable, and a further effort was made to amend it, so that it would be acceptable to the States. A Premiers' conference was held in 1899, and the financial question nearly broke it up. All were willing to let the Braddon clause go if a substitute could be found, but every cure suggested seemed worse than the disease. The conference limited the clause to ten years and thereafter until Parliament should otherwise provide, and it also added a new clause, empowering the Commonwealth to grant financial assistance to the States during the first ten years and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provided. </para>

                <para>It has been urged that the present Government is unduly rushing this matter through Parliament. The long list of quotations which I have read, shows that the negotiations for a settlement of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, go back to 1910. Prom that year onward, practically every Federal Government has, at one time or another, raised it in conference with the States. How, then, can it be contended that the Government is acting precipitately, or that the States have not had an opportunity to come to an agreement with the Commonwealth? The fact is that there has been no agreement. It is also said that we have no mandate from the people to introduce this legislation. I have here a quotation from the policy speech of the Prime Minister at the last election. It was published in full in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> of the 6th October, and very nearly in full by every leading newspaper in the Commonwealth. In that speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> said - </para>

                    <para>The result of these fundamental changes is that the Commonwealth to-day is raising revenues in order to provide the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States.

The development of Australia as a nation, and the necessity of dealing with many great questions on a national basis, such as that of road transport, also renders necessary, a  reexamination  of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. . . . The Government proposes, in the near future, to invite the States to attend a conference for the purpose of reconsidering the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and dealing with the disabilities suffered by certain States, with a view to laying .down a basis for our national development, in which the Commonwealth and the States will cooperate. At this conference an opportunity will be afforded to consider all questions affecting the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister contemplated that there would be a conference with the States to arrive at an agreement on a different basis. I spoke for the Government during the election campaign in Western Australia, and 1 have here a report of my speech io opening the campaign, in that State, as published in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian,</inline> of 9th October, 192G. I said - 7 pass now to an outline - and it can be only an outline - of some of the proposals in th§ policy for the future. The financial relations existing 'between the Commonwealth mid the States arc becoming extremely intricate and involved. The raising by the Common wealth of a greater amount of taxation than is required foi- its own purposes, and handing back to the States a portion of the money so raised, in the shape of grants for specific purposes, the payment of interest by the States to the Commonwealth on account of .moneys borrowed by the Commonwealth for the States, the per <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> payments, and the special grants, all  need  to come under review in order that a satisfactory and less involved relationship may exist in future. It is proposed, at an early date, to convene a conference of the Federal and State Governments, to deal with these matters.  </para>

                <para>That conference was held, and the States were invited to consider the Government's proposals. Honorable senators know what they were. They have been discussed in the Senate many a time. What was the attitude of the States? They said, in effect, " We will not consider these proposals. We claim that we have a moral right to share in the Customs and excise revenue." An examination of the position will show that the attitude of the States was not ' a reasonable one. I have here some figures showing that the commitments of the Commonwealth for invalid and old-age pensions, interest on war debt, maternity allowances, and the ordinary governmental activities, total over £50,000,000. Wo political party, nor, <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> far as I know, no politician in the federal arena, has ever proposed that those commitments should he interfered with; and, since there is no escape from those obligations, it is clear that the revenue from Customs and excise duties is not sufficient to meet them by many millions sterling. In the circumstances, what is the use of talking about the moral right of the States to a portion of the Customs and excise revenue? The financial obligations of the Commonwealth are clearly set out in the following table : - </para>

                <para class="block">In the face of those figures, how can any person talk about the States having a moral right to Customs revenue? There is no Customs revenue available. Moreover, the Commonwealth Parliament itself - not the present Parliament alone, but previous Parliaments as well - has long recognized that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution is not equitable and does pot meet the position. That is shown, not by the acts of the Government, but by acts that- have been, passed by both Houses of the Parliament. Owing to the special grant that has been made to Western Australia, and the arrangement by which every State contributes towards it, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment works out at £1 4s. lOd. per head of population in the case of every State except Western Australia, in which it is £1 5s. per head. In addition, there is a special grant to Western Australia and Tasmania, which represents £1 3s. 7d. per head of the population in the case of the former and £1 14s. 5d. per head of population in the case of the latter. Then there is the Federal-aid roads grant which works out as follows : - </para>

                <para class="block">The average for the Commonwealth is £115s.8d. per head of population. It will be seen that the Commonwealth Parliament has deliberately, after consideration, broken away from the idea of a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution of the surplus revenue. It has recognized that it is its duty to assist in the development of the weaker States, and by its legislation has given a varying grant to the States. </para>
                <para>It has been said that in this matter the Government is doing something that is not approved by the people. It is very easy for persons to assume that they can speak the mind of all the people of Australia; it is not always so easy to furnish proof of that capacity. There have been some opportunities of testing this question in an informal way. I notice, for instance, the statement that the organizations which support the Government are in every case opposed to the attitude which it has adopted on this question. As a side-light on that assertion,I may tell the Senate that last September the annual conference of the National Federation of Victoria was held in this city. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> being absent from Australia, I was asked by the conference to make one of the opening speeches as the representative of the Commonwealth Government. I did so. Whilst at the meeting I was told that the honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eggleston,</inline> acting for the Treasurer of Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alexander Peacock),</inline> was to speak on the question of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment on the following day. Notices of motion had been sent in by various branches disapproving of the proposal of the Commonwealth Government to terminate the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. When I responded to the vote of thanks, I suggested that it might be as well to hear also the views which the Commonwealth Government held upon the matter. To my dismay, about half an hour before the conference met on the following day I received a note from the secretary inviting me to attend and place before the meeting the views of the Commonwealth Government. I attended under the great disadvantage of not having had an opportunity to prepare a speech. I have in my hand the report of the conference. This body of men had had only the press reports to guide them as to what the Commonwealth Government proposed to do. To illustrate the state of mind in which the dele- gates met, I shall read to the Senate motions that were sent in by different branches. The Wendouree branch gave notice that it would move the following motion :  - </para>

                    <para>That in the opinion of this conference the per <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> payments, instead of being discontinued, should be doubled, and . that the Commonwealth should leave the States to attend to their own roads. </para>

                <para>A further motion by the Wendouree branch read as follows :  - </para>

                    <para>That the action of the Commonwealth in abolishing the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments on the pretext that the taxation should not be imposed by one authority and spent by another, and at the same time imposing a petrol tax to provide money to be spent by the States on roads, is illogical, and a contravention in policy, that it will only result in overlapping and wasteful expenditure, and increase in the burden of taxation, and that no real benefit will result. </para>

I reiterate that the Senate is not being asked to express the opinion that the Commonwealth should retire from the field of land taxation, the entertainment lax, probate and succession duties, or 60 ner cent, of the income taxation field. <inline font-style="italic">lt is</inline> being asked to agree to the termination of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment on the 30th June, 1927. A distinct undertaking is given to the Senate and to the country that for twelve months thereafter the Government will continue to make payments to the States on the existing basis, in the interim seeking an early conference with the States, and informing them that it is prepared to discuss any alternative proposals that they care to put forward. We are prepared to explore the question of whether the Commonwealth should take over either the whole or a portion of the State debts, and the provision of a sinking fund for State debts. We shall meet the States in any way that is reasonable. </para>

                        <para>- We are not bound by that, or any other, arrangement. The whole field is open to be explored without any qualification. We are genuinely anxious to arrive at a settlement of this question which will not leave with the States a feeling of irritation. We realize that anything calculated to create that feeling would be both foolish and unwise. We are not approaching the States in the role of a dictator. But we do say that the present system of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution is inequitable and unwise; that it has already broken down, and that the Commonwealth has in the past departed from it. The view of the Commonwealth Government is that, if it has any surplus revenue, it should assist the States financially, more especially those in which the need for development is greatest and the financial need most pronounced. That is a principle which the Commonwealth Parliament has recognized in legislation that it has passed. </para>

If, in dealing with this question, we were to shut our eyes to the teachings of history we should resemble the ostrich that put its headin the sand when pursued by an enemy. The passage of this bill will show to the States that this Parliament is in earnest in its intention to have a different basis established. The States are very well aware that the Commonwealth Parliament will see that justice is done to them. If at the conference the States advance a proposal that is equitable and just to them and to the Commonwealth, and this Government refuses to give fair consideration to it, it will receive short shrift at the hands of this Parliament. </para>

If the present or any other Commonwealth Government shows a disinclination to meet the States reasonably and fairly, the Commonwealth Parliament can pass a very effective judgment upon it.For that reason, I ask the Senate to agree to the bill and enable the Government to meet the States in such a way that they will realize that they must toe the line and come to a reasonable agreement. </para>

                        <para>- It would be for the Commonwealth Government to decide whether it should proceed with the balance of its proposals. That is to say, if it was found impossible to arrive at an agreement with the States, we would have to tell Parliament when next it met and advise it what it ought to do. This Parliament would still be arbiter, and would have the advantage of knowing whether the States had met the Commonwealth in a reasonable spirit, whether the fault was due to the unreasonable attitude of the Commonwealth, or whether negotiations had failed because of some motive on the part of State Governments or State Parliaments. The present system is, and must remain, a disturbing factor in the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. We have now an opportunity to end it, and Parliament has also the opportunity to see that the Commonwealth Government acts with justice and even generosity to the States in making a new financial arrangement with them. On the assurance that the Government will approach the question in that spirit, and do its utmost to bring about a just and equitable arrangement with the States, I ask the Senate to agree to the second reading of the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment is to bring the provisions of the Inscribed Stock Act into conformity with the usual practice' in regard to deposits in savings banks. When a deposit in a savings bank in the name of a person who is deceased amounts to over £100, it is necessary to take out letters of administration or probate to operate upon it, but where the amount is less than £100 this requirement is not insisted on. This practice obtains in other legislation of a similar character. </para>

                        <para>.- Honorable senators will, I am sure, agree that the Imperial Conference recently concluded has been the most important, particularly to the British dominions, ever held, and that Australia has every reason to be proud of its principal representative at that gathering. In our present Prime Minister, we have a gentleman who has been able to make his presence felt amongst the representatives of other dominions, and make a wonderful impression upon the British people. It is interesting to read the comments in the English newspapers and magazines concerning the personnel of the Australian delegation. I may be pardoned for taking this opportunity to quote the opinion of a writer in <inline font-style="italic">Overseas,</inline> the monthly journal of the Overseas League, edited by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evelyn</inline> Wrench, who met many Australians some time ago. A writer in the <inline font-style="italic">Overseas</inline> says :  - </para>

                        <para>The first time that I heard Stanley Melbourne Bruce, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, I felt in my heart, " Here, indeed, is a man." An Australian by birth, alumnus of Cambridge University, a barrister of the Middle Temple, a soldier, twice wounded and decorated for valour in the Great War, 42 years old, with the verve and vigour of 28, intense, practical, idealistic, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> has won the heart of England. If ever Australia wants to get rid of him - which she never will - we'll take him and keep him, and not let him go. Here is a man with a spirit of Drake and Raleigh, who sees a vision ofEmpire as Rhodes saw it. He comes to us, not for what England can give him, but to learn what Australia can do to help in the common work of the Commonwealth. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> frankly lectures British manufacturers and merchants about their shortcomings - as he does - it is because he wants to help them. And, between ourselves, there are some grounds for the complaints that he makes.  His  speeches, direct, sincere, eloquent, have touched us all. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not think one could reasonably expect to read a more pleasing commentary. I have already said the recent Imperial Conference was, in the opinion of most people, one of the most important ever held. The decisions reached should act as a damper to those pessimists who persist in saying that the Empire is crumbling, if we recall the condition of affairs in South Africa and in Ireland a few years ago, we must admit that the results achieved were miraculous. The writer whom I have just quoted refers to this twentieth century miracle in this way- </para>

Very important issues were considered at the conference, and were ably handled by  our representatives, but it is not my intention to deal with them at this juncture, as many of them will come before the Parliaments of the Empire for consideration. I am sure we all believe that the work performed, not only by Australia's representatives, but also by those of the other dominions, will materially aid the progress and prosperity of the British Empire. </para>

                        <para>That the report from the Joint Committee on Electoral Law and Procedure presented to the Senate on the 3rd March, 1927, be adopted. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">As honorable senators are probably aware, the Joint Committee appointed last year to inquire into matters relating to electoral law and procedure has now completed its investigations, and has presented its report to Parliament. The committee took evidence in every State of the Commonwealth, and in doing so selected places where the conditions differed. The time occupied in conducting such an exhaustive inquiry certainly was not great when compared with that taken by some royal commissions and select committees. Our work, which commenced in June, was completed some weeks ago. The expenditure incurred can also be regarded as reasonable. We found a high degree of efficiency on the part of the officers employed. By men of all shades of political opinion, it was admitted that the proceedings under the Commonwealth electoral law were superior to those under the enactments of the States. It was admitted on all sides that the members of the electoral staff of the Commonwealth were men of high calibre, fair in their dealings, and helpful to a degree; nevertheless, the committee has made recommendations which, it hopes, will further increase the existing efficiency. The report contains a summary of the committee's recommendations.  1  shall not weary the Senate by reading them all, but I ask honorable senators to give the report their careful consideration. They will find it a fund of information, which must be of interest to every elector. I suggest that, published in hand-book form, would find a ready sale. The first of the committee's recommendations was the result of much earnest thought and inquiry. It reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the qualifying period of residence prior to" enrolment be three months instead of one, and that the period for the removal of names from the roll be increased from one month to three months. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The underlying reason for that recommendation was the difficulty experienced by the migratory members of the population in connexion with removal of their names as voters. In Queensland, particularly, migratory workers experience considerable difficulty in obtaining correct enrolment; but the trouble is not confined to that State. The committee's recommendations should remove some of the present disabilities. Another reform recommended is - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the work carried out by the Postmaster-General's Department for the Electoral Department be made part of the ordinary duties of the postal officials and be performed in the usual departmental hours - the consequential financial adjustment to be made between the two departments. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The committee found that, although the work of the department is performed efficiently, there is a feeling on the part of some postal officials that the electoral work interferes too much with their duties as postal employees. Probably the heads of the two departments might not favour the recommended arrangement ; but the committee is firmly of the opinion that much good would result from its adoption. The financial adjustment should not bc difficult. Those honorable senators who are acquainted with the form of the present enrolment claim card will agree that it is cumbersome, and contains much redundant matter. The committee, therefore, recommended - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the amended form of- enrolment claim card submitted by it, providing for all information on one side only, and for only one signature of the elector, be adopted. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The form of card recommended contains all the information which the committee considers claimants should supply, and its use should remove many of the present informalities. A further recommendation is - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the Commonwealth electoral rolls should be reprinted annually, and that the supplementary rolls, which, should show removals and additions, should be printed at least every six months. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The committee, has been assured that its recommendation is practicable, and would entail very little additional cost. As to its desirability, I think there is no difference of opinion. As a result of the consideration given to the question of postal voting at Commonwealth elections, the committee has made several important recommendations, the first of which is - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the minimum distance at which postal votes may lie exercised be 5 miles, instead of 10. lt was pointed out that a voter who lives fi mile's from a polling booth has to make a journey of 10 miles to record his vote. The committee considers that its recommendation in this respect is reasonable. It, also recommends - </para>
                        <para>That provision he made that an application for a postal vote may he witnessed by any elector on the roll, but that the act of voting shall be witnessed by an authorized witness as at present. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That reform is long overdue. At elections for members of shire councils and various public institutions a ratepayer may v.itness the signature of a person who claims <inline font-style="italic">fi</inline> vote. The committee considers that in connexion with Commonwealth elections applications for postal votes should be witnessed in a similar manner. The committee found that the existing provisions in respect of authorized witnesses to the actual postal vote worked harshly in many instances. It therefore recommended - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the list of authorized witnesses be extended to include all legally-certified midwives, all matrons and nursing sisters in charge of public hospitals or public charitable institutions, bush nurses, station owners or managers, overseers or foremen of group settlements, surveyors in charge of survey gangs, persons in charge of railway or other large construction camps, commissioners for declarations, mail contractors, and assistant lighthouse-keepers. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will agree that that recommendation is a step in the right direction. . A further recommendation - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That an extension of time for receiving postal votes of seven days bo allowed, provided that the envelope containing the  ballot-paper  boars the clear impression of the postal dato stamp of a date not later than the polling day, will enable a large number of postal votes which are now rejected to be taken into consideration. As the gMt difficulty confronting the committee in this connexion was that of ensuring that the date of posting the voting paper should be clearly marked on the envelope, the advice of the director of postal services, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> P. Brown, was sought. He informed the committee that very little difficulty would be experienced in making the date stamp perfectly legible. With that safeguard, the recommendation is a .desirable reform. The compulsory signing of leading articles in newspapers received the earnest consideration of the committee. The consensus of opinion among witnesses connected with the newspapers of Australia, both in the cities and in the country, was that the present legislation requiring such articles to be signed should be abolished. That the committee has recommended. But in respect of other articles, it has recommended - </para>
                        <para>That the provisions of the act relating to the signing of ali articles (except leading articles), letters, circulars, advertisements, and dodgers on and after the date of issue and before the return of the writs bc retained. </para>
                        <para>That any reports that contain any comment by the reporter or newspaper, either in the head lines or the report during election time, should be signed. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Under the heading "Polling Facilities," the committee has made a number of recommendations, the first of which is - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para class="block">That the hours of polling be from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The hours of polling at present are from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., which means that the officials on duty at the polling booths are required to work strenuously for a period of twelve hours. after which many of them continue till midnight counting the figures. The committee considers that the long hours impose too great a strain on the electoral officers, and seeing that in Queensland the hours of polling are from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and in some of the other States from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., it concluded that to close the polling booths one hour earlier, than at present would be a desirable reform. For the reason that frequently "How-to-vote" cards are placed in the ballot-box, the committee has also recommended - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That all "How-to-vote" cards should be printed in card form. </para>

                        <para>That organizations issuing "How-to-vote" cards shall print upon them in bold lettering an intimation that this card must not be left in the polling booth nor placed in the ballot box. </para>

                    <para class="block">The evidence in relation to canvassing in the vicinity of polling booths was somewhat contradictory. At present canvassing may not take place within 20 feet of a polling booth. Many witnesses expressed the opinion that the distance should be increased to 100 yards; others that no canvassing should take place on polling days. Honorable senators will realize that to prevent canvassing on polling days is impossible. The committee's recommendation, which it believes will meet the position, is - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That the Act be amended to provide that canvassing or other acts referred to in section 171 shall be prohibited within 50 feet of the polling booth. </para>

                    <para class="block">The committee believes that interested persons are in the habit of telling electors that their names are not on the roll. As in its opinion such persons should not go unpunished, the following recommendation is made : - </para>

                        <para>That the act be amended to provide for the imposition of a penalty on all persons other than electoral officials telling the electors on polling days that they are not enrolled. </para>

                    <para class="block">The enforcement of that penalty may be difficult, but the committee has faith in the ability of the department to deal with the situation. A recommendation which has been made largely in the interest of blind persons reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That section 120 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act should bc amended to provide that if any voter satisfies the Presiding Officer that he is unable to vote without assistance, the Presiding Officer shall permit any person appointed by such voter to accompany him into the voting compartment to mark, fold, and deposit his ballot-paper for him, this provision to be applied to blind and physically incapacitated electors, but not to illiterate voters. </para>

                    <para class="block">AN amendment of the existing legislation along those lines is desired by the various organizations for the blind throughout Australia. Some members of the committee were of the opinion that the Presiding Officer should accompany the blind voter into the cubicle; but leading officers of the different blind institutions, and the honorable member for Fawkner in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell),</inline> strongly opposed any such provision. As the result of its investigations, the committee felt that no harm, but much good, would result from the adoption of its recommendation in this respect. Another recommendation is - </para>

                        <para>That no motor car or other vehicle shall lie hived on behalf of any candidate or any political organization on polling day except for the exclusive use of incapacitated electors, the presiding officer to be informed in writing, not later than polling day, of the number of cars to be employed for such incapacitated electors. </para>
                        <para>That, except in the ease of cars hired or otherwise secured for the use of incapacitated electors, no motor cars or other vehicles shall approach within 50 feet of a polling booth. </para>

                    <para class="block">That will be a drastic alteration about which there is a considerable difference of opinion, and it may or may not be accepted by Parliament. A further recommendation is - </para>

Apparently it is an instruction to presiding officers not to make known the result of the scrutiny locally, but to telegraph the count to the Returning Officer for the State so that, to cite Rockhampton as a concrete example, Brisbane is in a position to know the local count earlier than Rockhampton. This state of affairs should not be allowed to continue. The act clearly intends '.hat local information should be made available as soon as possible.

The electoral authorities stated that the only reason that could be advanced against the recommendation was the possibility of some fantastic party of one being in the field ; but the committee believes that the adoption of the recommendation will reduce considerably the heavy percentage of informal voting recorded at every election.

                    <para class="block">There was a great outcry in Queensland at the last election because of the extent to which the absent voting facilities of the act were availed of. A large number of electors made an untruthful declaration, and improperly voted as absent voters, chiefly because it suited their convenience to do so. We want to check the practice, because it leads to a tremendous amount of unnecessary work on the part of the electoral officials, and will continue to do so unless it is prevented in future. With regard to joint rolls, the recommendation is - </para>

A fourth is preparing to come into the scheme, and I believe that a fifth State is in a reasonable frame of mind; but Queensland, I fear, is adamant in its objection. </para>

                            <para>- Because of the changes made so frequently in State electoral boundaries, a large slice of one electorate being added to another, and large numbers of workers being moved about very freely. Those States that have joint rolls declare that they would not revert to the former system in any circumstances. I hope, therefore, that eventually there will be the same uniformity in all the States. Electoral officials informed us that discrepancies in the divisional or subdivisional boundaries of Commonwealth and State electorates were not an insuperable difficulty. I come now to the suggestion to the committee for improvements in the electoral law and procedure. We recommend - </para>
