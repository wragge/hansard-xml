                                 <para> I approach the discussion of this motion with a feeling of deep regret because, contrary to my anticipations when the Line was founded, its operations have been most disastrous. I was strongly in favour of the establishment of the fleet not only as a war measure, but as a phase of governmental activity which I believed would be of immensebenefit to the people of Australia. All honorable senators are aware that an efficient shipbuilding industry plays a most important part in the development of a nation. I fondly imagined when the Line was established that it would be the nucleus of an important shipbuilding industry in Australia. Like myself, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> knows to what extent the shipbuilding yards on the Clyde have been responsible for the prosperity of the people in that portion of Great Britain.

I was  chairman  of a royal commission appointed a few years ago to inquire into the affairs of the Cockatoo Island dockyard. Those investigations convinced me that the Australian artisan was second to none in the world, and I was satisfied then that under reasonably favourable circumstances the shipbuilding industry could be established in Australia. Unfortunately all my hopes were dashed to the ground. It is of no use for us to shut our eyes to the fact that the affairs of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line have been a complete failure. None of the advocates for the retention of the fleet has advanced cogent reasons why it should be continued. J know all that can be said in favour of the course, but the position of the Line, from an economic stand-point, is so unsound that it is impossible, under Australian conditions, to carry on the business successfully. I was accusedlast night of having changed my opinion concerning the proposal to dispose of the Line. It is with extreme regret that I admit the allegation. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1332</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>-  The honorable senator believes that the Line has nothing to recommend it? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1332</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate></electorate><party /><role></role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>- I do not say that.

They have not brought forward conclusive arguments to show that the Conference Linus would bleed Australia in a matter of freights when they had the field to themselves. We have had a particularly unfortunate experience in connexion with our shipping and ship-building activities. When tenders were invited for the construction of the two cruisers authorized by Parliament a year or two ago, it was hoped that the difference between the Australian and British prices would not be so great as to prevent the Government from placing the contract in Australia. If the artisans employed at Cockatoo Island had come together and had given" evidence of a sincere desire to co-operate with the Commonwealth Shipping Board, it would have been possible to build the cruisers in this country. The Senate, I believe, was willing to indorse the principle of Australian preference to the extent of 60 per cent over British prices. Had that contract been let in Australia it would have been of immense advantage to the ship-building industry in this country. We were hoping, also, that as the result of the building up of a mercantile marine, we should be able to find employment for naval reservists. Under present conditions, it is difficult to persuade Australians to adopt a seafearing life. The majority of the employees on the vessels of the Line are domiciled in Great Britain. This is a regrettable state of affairs. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1332</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K09</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PAYNE, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator Payne</name></talker><para>-  It was an astonishing revelation to most people. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1332</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>- An Australian mercantile marine would be a most valuable aid in the defence of. Australia. It is significant that other countries have had an experience similar to that of Australia. No State-owned shipping Line in the world has been operated successfully. Even in the United States of America, where efficiency and orgnization are worshipped as a fetish, the Government has lost an immense sum of money and it is unable, owing to the  slump in shipping values, to dispose of its surplus tonnage. It was reported some time ago that Henry Ford purchased </para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">A</inline>very large number of Governmentowned . vessels for which freight could not be found, and after taking from them material which was of value to him, he threw them on the scrap heap. It is probable, also, that the Commonwealth Government will experience some difficulty in disposing of its vessels because shipping is in a state of transition all over the world. The Orient Company now has on the Australian run several magnificent steamers of 20,000 tons. How can we expect the limited number of comparatively small passenger liners belonging to the Government fleet to compete on anything like equal terms with those vessels? The purchase of several additional modern ships would involve the Commonwealth Shipping Board in the expenditure of millions.. I do not think that any shipping company ever commenced under such favourable conditions as the board did when these vessels were transferred to it at prices so much below their capital cost. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1333</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">THOMPSON, William</name><name role="display">Senator Thompson</name></talker><para>- The dice were loaded in its favour. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1333</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>- Yes, the ships were written down to such an extent that they could almost be regarded as .a gift.

Prior to the war there was a big slump in the shipping business just as there is to-day, and freights ruling between Australia and Great Britain were reasonable. During the war period, however, enormous profits were made by the shipping companies, and after the termination of hostilities, those engaged in the shipping business seemed to think that the same rate of profits should be maintained. A paragraph in the report of the Public Accounts Committee is to the effect that the Line has been instrumental in keeping down freights; but although shipping is now normal the freights between Australia and Great Britain are not quite so low as those on other routes, notwithstanding the Commonwealth Line. It is, therefore, unreasonable to say that it has been the means of reducing freights. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1333</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>- Does the honorable senator not think that the presence of a shipping combine is a menace to Australian shippers? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1333</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>- I shall deal with that point later. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1333</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>- The report of the Public Account Committee is full of it. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1333</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>- I have read the report. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1333</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>- Then why does not the honorable senator admit it. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1333</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>- I shall answer the honorable senator in my own way.

The evidence of an individual witness is not of much value. The committee had to obtain opinions from different authorities, and then, come to a decision on all the evidence tendered. The Orient Company could not profitably conduct its service to Australia without the mail subsidy. The Commonwealth Government is in as good a position to make a bargain with that company as is the British Government with the Peninsula and Oriental Company. The subsidy paid by the Government to the Orient Company is largely for the refrigerated space which is used almost exclusively by the exporters of primary products. As the number of producers increase and our exports become larger, the shipping companies will have to compete with each other for the freight that is offering. The boards and pools which have been established will doubtless negotiate in the best interests of the producers. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1334</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>- Would the honorable senator like to be condemned by a jury which had no evidence before it? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1334</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>- I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch-</inline></para></talk.start></continue><para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon.

In the past rather higher rates had been quoted from New Zealand and from Australia, owing to, among other factors, the large number of calls which the liners make on the coast of New Zealand to collect cargo. In August, 1026, the New Zealand rates were brought practically to parity with those from Aus. tralia, the reductions amounting to 7J per cent, on the previous' rates for the first three years and to 12} per cent, for the fourth year. </para></quote><para class="block">This is the portion of the article I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to follow : - </para><quote><para>An important feature of the New Zealand trade is that the control of meat, dairy produce and fruit, is now in the hands of boards which makes contracts for the whole of the shipment. The new rates are about 50 per cent, above the pre-war level, while working costs are declared to be still fully 100 per cent, above the pre-war standard. Shipping managers in both the Australian and New Zealand trades have hope that there might be some compensation for the lower rates in larger shipments, but that there can be very little profit, if any, in such terms is now generally agreed by managers, including those who have experience of the cost of carrying produce in other routes. It is to be feared that the. granting of the minimum rates of freight must cause owners to look with extreme care on working expenses. Their natural inclination would be towards even better services than have been provided in  the  past, but with sailings maintained on the basis of at best a very narrow margin of earnings over outgoing the cost of construction and maintenance will have to be considered very closely. </para></quote><para class="block">That is a complete answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1334</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8L</name.id><electorate></electorate><party>NAT</party><role></role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">THOMAS, Josiah</name><name role="display">Senator THOMAS</name></talker><para>- Are the freights from New Zealand to Great Britain cheaper than the freights from Australia to Great Britain? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1334</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>- On some lines they are; but, generally speaking, they are about the same.

It enables them to get full cargoes. I see no need to make a fuss about what is an ordinary business arrangement. A great deal has been said during this debate about the losses sustained by government railways and it has been contended that if it pays a country to build railways and run them at a loss, it should also pay the country to run a shipping line at a loss. When we started to develop Australia we could not induceany one to sink capital in building developmental railways. <inline font-style="italic">As</inline> a consequence, the people themselves through their governments had to build them and once governments started to build these lines they had to keep on with the work. In the case of shipping, however, we have always had ships coming to Australia. We had not to build Commonwealth steamers because there were no existing shipping services.We built them for the express purpose of reducing freights. Therefore, the argument that losses on railways are comparable with losses on shipping lines does not appeal to me.

Of all the other State enterprises, of Queensland, some of them are just about paying expenses. Recently I read in a Queensland paper some remarks addressed to a meeting of public servants by a State minister, a gentleman who was formerly a member of the Senate. I congratulate him on the courage he has displayed intelling the public servants a few truths on the subject of a fair day's work. He said :  - </para><quote><para>I am not going to say that we get it from all by a long way. If you want any evidence of this, take the State enterprises.

In the last two years not one minister has established a new enterprise. These government activities got into such a mess and have sustained such heavy losses, that if you ask a State minister to tell you how they are progressing he will immediately say " Say nothing about it." In my opinion, the people of Queensland are equal in intelligence to people elsewhere, and it seems to me that if State enterprises have failed in Queensland they are bound to fail elsewhere. No private shipping company has been treated more disgracefully than the Australian Commonwealth Line has been treated by the sailors employed by it. The men have the best conditions in the world, but they have done everything they could to hold up the Commonwealth vessels while the ships of other lines were left free to make money for their owners. It seems to me that all that they have sought to do in return for all that has been done for them has been to take advantage of the fact that the vessels are owned by the Commonwealth. We have heard some talk about grumbling on the part of the members of the Australian Shipping Board and that they have fallen out with one another. In the absence of evidence on the point we must take it for granted that this has happened because we are told by the committee that it has. I do not think that any honorable senator, whether he be in favour of nationalization or not, would not rejoice if this line had proved a success, but it has proved a  failure, and I have heard nothing to convince me that it should be kept going.

It is the duty, I think of every honorable senator on an issue of this sort to justify the vote he intends to give and the action he proposes to take. It is an old saying that there are two sides to every question, and we have never had a better example of the truth of that statement than we have on the present occasion. Even the Joint Committee of Public Accounts seems to have realized it. I have before me the marvellous document it has issued concerning the Commonwealth Government shipping activities. I do not think we have ever had presented to us a report which surpasses it, inasmuch as a case can be made out from it with success on either side of the question at issue. The nervous attitude that has been adopted by the committee towards the Australian Commonwealth Line is apparent almost throughout. It is true that at the end, after a great deal of hesitation, fear and trembling, the committee in its majority report, has made a certain recommendation. It says very many nice things about the Australian Commonwealth Line. It points <inline font-style="italic">out</inline> quite a number of good things it has done and in many respects justifies its failure to do better in the circumstances. It has not condemned the Line in the whole-hearted fashion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> would have us believe it has done. On the contrary it has com mended very many things that the Line has done. In my opinion it has only advanced one real reason why thn vessels should be sold, but that reason, I am afraid, is an insuperable obstacle to their retention. I shall refer to it later. The chief reason for disposing of the Line urged during this debate, although it is referred toin <inline font-style="italic">extenso</inline> in the Public Accouncts Committee's report is that certain losses have been incurred. But those losses are not a sufficient justification, even if they have been heavy, for getting rid of the Line. If it had made considerable losses and the business of its competitors had been conducted at a profit there would be some justification for saying that there is virtue in private ownership, but the private shipping companies also have made huge losses. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1336</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">THOMPSON, William</name><name role="display">Senator Thompson</name></talker><para>-  The Orient and the P. and O. companies paid dividends last year. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1336</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN</name></talker><para>- Those dividends were paid out of the subsidy granted by the Commonwealth Government. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1336</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">THOMPSON, William</name><name role="display">Senator Thompson</name></talker><para>-  Â£130,000 would not go far towards the amount paid by them as dividends. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1336</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN</name></talker><para>- During the period that the Commonwealth Line was operating at a loss many of the long established shipping lines of the world also made losses.

In this matter we cannot lay down any general principle because both Government ownership and private enterprise have failed.

I remind him that in 1923 the Line held out for, and secured, a 10 per cent, reduction in freights; that in 1925 it refused to agree to a 10 per cent, increase in freights suggested by the other shipping companies, which all the  time had been agitating for higher rates. Again, in 1926, it refused to sanction a 15 per cent, increase in. freight rates. The value of the cargoes taken from Australian ports during 1924 and 1925 was valued at over Â£160,000,000. An increase of 15 per cent, would have meant that Australian shippers would have had to pay on all shipments more than an additional Â£20,000,000 as freight during that period. Even on the cargo shipped by the vessels belonging to the Line the saving in freight represented about Â£3,000,000 per annum. That considerable sum was saved to the producers of Australia because the Line held out against increased freights. . That is the only conclusion to which we can come in the light of the evidence in our possession. If the position is otherwise, it must be shown in documents which, although made available to the members of the committee, have not been placed before the Senate. It is unfair to place before honorable senators mere statements, not supported by evidence, and to ask them on those statements to give a decision on a matter so important as the retention of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. I have no desire in any way to belittle the members of the Public Accounts Committee. For them I have the greatest respect and admiration. I should be prepared to trust to their judgment in many matters; but, notwithstanding all the information made available to them - much of which has not been placed before us - they were unable to come to a unanimous decision regarding the Line. There was, in fact, a sharp division of opinion between them. One section of the committee has said one . thing, and another section something entirely different. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1338</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">THOMPSON, William</name><name role="display">Senator Thompson</name></talker><para>- We all know the reason for that. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1338</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN</name></talker><para>- That is the trouble.

We know that the policy of the Labour party favours the extension of Government activities, and no representative of that party would be justified, perhaps, in doing anything contrary to the declared policy of the party.

There are other honorable senators in this chamber who have declared time after time their unswerving opposition to government enterprises of any kind whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> has frequently said in this Senate that the Government should get out of the shipping business as soon as it could, and cut its losses. I do not say that he is wrong in that attitude. There is much to say for " his point of view, and I am not singling him out more than any one else. I do say, however, that the members of the committee drawn from the Government side of the chamber commenced the inquiry with minds prejudiced almost as much against the Shipping Line as those who signed the minority report were prejudiced in its favour. It is almost impossible for men who are already committed to a definite line of policy to give an impartial judgment on questions of this kind. This has been a political issue for many years, and it will remain one for many years to come. Under these circumstances it would have been far better had the question of the retention or disposal of the Line been referred to an impartial and independent tribunal. Such tribunals are appointed for other purposes, and judges of the Supreme Court are selected to conduct inquiries into matters of much less importance than this. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1338</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K8P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">THOMPSON, William</name><name role="display">Senator Thompson</name></talker><para>- Then the honorable senator does not believe in parliamentary committees? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1338</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN</name></talker><para>- I do, but in this case the manner in which the committee was constituted precluded the  possibility  of its arriving at an impartial finding. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1338</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KOJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">HAYS, Herbert</name><name role="display">Senator Herbert Hays</name></talker><para>- Did either side of the Senate show any prejudice against this Line Â«when the question of the appointment of a board was under consideration three and a half years ago ? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1338</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN</name></talker><para>- I distinctly remember honorable senators, and members of another place, unhesitatingly giving their opinion that the Government should get out of the shipping business at once, and cut its losses.

Officers in the higher ranks - I refer to masters, chief officers, engineers and others - usually regard employment in any reputable shipping company as permanent. As it will not be possible to offer reasonable guarantees in future, difficulty will be experienced in securing the right type of men to man the vessels if Parliament, at some future time, decides again to place government ships on the trade routes of the world.

While I think that the amendment should be carried, I believe that the Senate should have before it the evidence taken by the Public Accounts Committee, so that it  may come to a decision on the question under consideration in the full possession of all the information relating to it. We are not in full possession of all the information. I should like the amendment to go a little further than it does. I should like the Government to table all the communications that have passed between it and the Commonwealth Shipping Board during the last six months since the Public Accounts Committee ceased to take evidence relating to the Government's shipping activities. They would give us much/ more information than has been disclosed by the evidence taken by the committee. There is a good deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> has said in regard to certain evidence that should not be revealed. It is true that certain witnesses stipulated that their evidence should be taken <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> because they did not want their business secrets revealed. I am aware that the committee did pay heed to the requests of these witnesses and that their evidence was taken <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> But with all due deference to that particular aspect of the case, I claim that when Parliament is discussing &amp; question of supreme importance to the people of Australia, it should be in possession of every tittle of evidence before coming to a decision upon it, even though it might involve the revelation of business secrets of persons giving evidence before the committee. The business of the nation is of the first importance, and the feelings of individuals must, for the time being, take second place. It: has been said during the course of the main debate that the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers is a  losing  proposition. I admit that that is so, but I am aware that there is evidence in the possession of the Cabinet to show that during the last four or five months those losses have been considerably reduced by an alteration to the schedule of the ships. Loss was being incurred by the vessels having to call at different porta in the United Kingdom. These ports of call have now been cut out, and certain documents have passed between the Shipping Board and the Government, proving that a. saving of about 15 per cent, has been made by cutting out these calls. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1343</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KPQ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">KINGSMILL, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator Kingsmill</name></talker><para>- Nothwithstanding that saving the year finished with the biggest loss the Line has incurred. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1343</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">NEEDHAM, Edward</name><name role="display">Senator NEEDHAM</name></talker><para>- I am speaking of recent events and showing that by an alteration to the time table and running schedule of the Line, its position has been considerably improved.

By the time I could get the papers the vital issue with which we are concerned would have been disposed of. I should like to have a further assurance from the Minister before this debate is closed, and before a division is taken either on the motion or the amendment, that if the Senate does give a direction to the Government to proceed with the selling of the ships, Parliament will be consulted before any tender is accepted.

Action was taken under the War Precautions Act, and plenary power was given under that to do anything that was thought fit. Thank God there is no War Precautions Act now. If the ships are sold it will be a bad day for Australia. There are many reasons why the evidence taken by the committee should be placed before Parliament, even at the risk of revealing certain information that should not be made public. A precedent has already been established for such action. There is another committee of this Parliament, the Public Works Committee, before which evidence is sometimes given by gentlemen engaged in big business pursuits, and yet the evidence given is made public. The Senate should not be deterred from carrying the amendment by the objection that if the evidence is tabled certain information might get abroad. That is not the objection which determines the attitude of the Leader of the Senate. I think he is afraid that the Senate might obtain too much information, and that the minds of honorable senators might be changed. As regards the cablegrams, they are pretty well public property already.

Let us see, however, where it will lead to. In my view, such inquiries cannot be called public if witnesses are given an assurance that any information that they give will be treated as confidential. The obvious reason for seeking evidence is that it shall influence the decision of the inquiring body. When evidence is given on the condition that it shall not be made public, that stipulation is made only because the evidence constitutes an infringement of somebody else's rights. If somebody else's rights are infringed, that person should have the right to come before the committee to controvert the evidence given. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1345</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KNF</name.id><electorate></electorate><party>NAT</party><role></role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MASSY-GREENE, Walter</name><name role="display">Mr GREENE</name></talker><para>- The evidence might relate to balance-sheets of companies, or similar matters. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1345</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator LYNCH</name></talker><para>- No witness should come before an inquiring body and ask that the mantle of secrecy be thrown over his evidence when that mantle may conceal infringements of other people's rights. This was a public inquiry at which all citizens were invited to give evidence; yet some witnesses were given an assurance that they might give evidence and make statements secure in the knowledge that they would not be made public. That does not seem to me to be fair play. The respect for private opinion should always be subservient to the consideration of public interest. Honorable senators who are learned in jurisprudence can inform us that the public interest should always be paramount. We are now asked to record a decision on one of the most vital questions that has. ever come before this Parliament, without even being supplied with the evidence on which the recommendations of the committee are based. Apparently secrecy is of greater importance than the public interest. Certain wit4nesses gave evidence on the operations of the shipping line on the understanding that it would not be disclosed. Had I been a member of the committee when such witnesses had appeared, I should have said, " We know the value of such evidence. If you are not prepared to allow it to be combated you had better get out."

The Public Accounts Committee, upon the report of which it is said that the Government is acting, is composed of members of Parliament. They are our representatives, and I assert that the information which is available to them should not be denied to us. The people of Australia, including the members of this Parliament and the members of the joint committee, are shareholders in this Line, and have paid their proportion of the cost of establishing and operating it. Surely the nine members of the committee do not suggest that they, to the exclusion of every other citizen,  are entitled to keep to themselves the information which their inquiries elicited. Is it a business proposition that nine members of a committee appointed by this Parliament should take evidence , <inline font-style="italic">in, camera,</inline> and that no matter what their verdict may be we must accept it? We are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> the  chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee, that the evidence, upon which the committee has recommended the sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, was taken <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> In fairness to the people of Australia the committee should have been instructed to hold its investigations in public. If business is to be conducted in that way in the future, goodness knows where Parliament will land itself. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1348</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator Reid</name></talker><para>-  By legislation we can alter the conditions under which the Public Accounts Committee takes its evidence. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1348</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JYX</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">FINDLEY, Edward</name><name role="display">Senator FINDLEY</name></talker><para>- When the investigation of the Commonwealth Government's shipping activities commenced, did honorable senators understand that the evidence would be taken <inline font-style="italic">in camera,</inline> that the witnesses would be given a guarantee of absolute protection, and that none of their evidence would be printed? </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1348</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator Reid</name></talker><para>-  There is nothing new in that. </para></talk.start></interjection><para>SenatorFINDLEY. - The Public Accounts Committee has never previously had a matter of such importance to investigate. Even in regard to works involving no considerable expenditure, the evidence given before the Public Works Committee is printed, and can be perused by any one. Do honorable senators agree without a protest to the Public Accounts Committee acting as it has done in this case? If this precedent  Ave are  now setting up is established in regard to matters of Government policy we may have in future a committee taking evidence <inline font-style="italic">in camera,</inline> which evidence may later be considered at a party meeting held <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> A decision may be come to on information which may be of importance to the people, but which may not be made known to them. Lastnight I had occasion to visit another place. I heard the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> reading startling and sen sational cablegrams, which I am sure no honorable senator, with the exception of those privileged few who were entitled to get what we are denied - special and confidential information - knew had passed between the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Larkin,</inline> and between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Larkin</inline> and the Prime Minister. To me it seems that the longer this matter is delayed, the better for the majority of the people of Australia. We want to be supplied with the most complete information, not merely the evidence given before the Public Accounts Committee, but more up-to-date evidence. With that information at our disposal we could come to a decision and give a considered vote on the matter before us to-day. Although honorable senators opposite do not believe in the Labour policy, I know that some of them would hesitate before doing that which they conscientiously believe to be wrong. If they give serious thought to this matter they must come to the conclusion that no harm can be done to the people by agreeing to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan's</inline> amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1348</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTR</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>NAT</party><role>Honorary Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLACHLAN, Alexander</name><name role="display">Senator McLACHLAN</name></talker><para>. -  Whether it be right or wrong that a committee should be empowered, as committees appointed by this Parliament are empowered by statute, to grant to witnesses that protection which apparently has been granted to the full by the Public Accounts Committee, I ask honorable senators to pause before they commit themselves to a step which would not only stultify the word of honour of every member of the committee, but also greatly stultify the honour of this Parliament.

A man is brought before one of those committees and is given a pledge that his evidence will be confidential. If this amendment is carried, this Chamber will practically violate that pledge, which is given by an arm of this legislature. The law provides a penalty of Â£500 for an offence such as this Parliament now contemplates. Controversy after controversy has raged about whether evidence given before judicial tribunals or tribunals appointed by Parliament should be heard in private or otherwise; but they are mainly beside the issue. We have to remember that a pledge has been given. I am prepared to abide by the reasoned argument presented by the majority, I am putting the matter on a higher plane. I contend that if we support this amendment we shall violate the confidence in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> himself admitted he had received this evidence.

I do not think any evidence taken <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> carries the same weight as does that given in public. You may get explanations of how a man runs his business, and so forth, but I do not think anything taken in secret has the same value as if it were taken publicly. In this case a very important matter is being inquired into, one which concerns the whole country. I do not think the Public Accounts Committee would, for one moment, try to mislead the Senate in regard to the evidence taken, nor do I think that the Government would lend itself to any such action. The amendment amounts to an inference that information is being suppressed, information which, if brought to light, would alter the whole aspect of the matter. The honorable senator says that unless this information is made available he cannot make up his mind. That is always a difficult thing for him to do at any time, I admit, but there is one thing that I have always regarded aa inviolate, and that is my word of honour given to other people. The mover of the amendment wants members of the committee to divulge secrets confided to them by witnesses, and to dishonour themselves before the public, because one member, for window-dressing purposes, has given out information which he received in confidence. The amendment implies that we should dishonour the members of the committee, and even dishonour our own officials, by asking them to divulge secret information. I will never give my vote in favour of divulging anything given iii private, but I certainly do say that in future the Public Accounts Committee should take all evidence publicly, and put it on the table. I think it would be better for the committee, and better for this Parliament. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1350</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>- We are asking for the main body of evidence, that is all. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1350</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>- The honorable senator is asking that evidence be divulged in this  chamber,  when such evidence would not have been tendered except under a pledge of secrecy. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1350</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>- That is the honorable senator's own construction. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1351</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K2L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">REID, Matthew</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name></talker><para>- It is the only construction that can be placed on the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> He wants this Parliament to dishonour its own committee by divulging secret information.

In some unaccountable way, . however, this report is presented without the evidence. I do not say that any one would read the evidence as light literature - I do not think they would, but I do say that the general practice is for the evidence to accompany the report so that honorable members who feel inclined may study it. In the present case, I would certainly not suggest that the committee, after giving its word that it would treat as confidential the evidence of certain men, should now make that evidence public. I would not be one to hold up my hand and vote that the confidence placed in the committee should be broken. I have seen many slippery amendments like that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> placed before Parliament. There are some people who see light through a small hole. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Duncan  has always reminded me, firstly of a cheer-up society, and in the second place of a man who would slip in with a dirty thing in a  nice  way. There is about this amendment something of the subtlety that was in the devil when he entered the Garden of Eden to confront Adam and Eve. It is unwise for a committee to give an express undertaking to anybody that it will treat information confidentially. I do not accuse the members of the committee of any bad motive ; they wanted to get the strongest and best evidence they could. We all make mistakes ; my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> nearly perfect as he is, will only become more perfect through his mistakes, or through his suffering, but I hope that in the future no such undertaking of secrecy will be given. I do not want to give a vote without saying that I cannot, for one moment, support the amendment. As soon as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> moved the amendment I saw that we had entered into the realms of a mighty discussion  designed simply to keep back the motion. I am sure my friend will not for a moment deny that that was his motive. I have seen many things of this kind during the past eighteen years, and will cast my vote against the amendment. </para></talk.start><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1351</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>- To overcome the difficulty of dealing with the motion for the printing of the report, should the amendment be agreed to, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has consented to alter his amendment to read as follows: - </para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>That the following words he added to the motion "but that further consideration of the question be deferred until after the whole of the evidence given before the Public Accounts Committee has been placed before the Senate." </para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>1351</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXZ</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold">.- Mr. President-</inline></para></talk.start><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1351</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>- The honorable senator has already spoken. </para></talk.start></continue><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1351</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN</name></talker><para>- I have not spoken to my amendment at all. </para></talk.start></continue><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1351</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>- The honorable gentleman spoke for over half an hour, and concluded by moving his amendment. </para></talk.start></continue><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1351</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN</name></talker><para>- I spoke to the original motion. </para></talk.start></continue><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1351</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>- Had the honorable gentleman done wisely, he would have moved his amendment at the outset of his remarks, and have spoken to it.

Those honorable senators particularly who have spoken in opposition to the underlying principle of the report have referred to a change of policy - a change of heart, perhaps - on the part of the committee, since the interim report was presented in August of last year. That was stated in express terms to be an interim report, and it mentioned the fact that the committee had not had an opportunity to take evidence from one of the most important figures in the Line, namely, the  Chairman  of the Board of Directors. The committee sat again in September of last year to hear the evidence of that gentleman. It has been said - I understand by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> - that he was the only witness examined subsequent to the presentation of the interim report.

A great deal of attention was paid to the witnesses who appeared before the committee at this juncture. The evidence taken filled 94 pages, and, strangely enough, 47 of those pages are taken up by the officers of the Line to whom I have alluded, whilst the remaining 47 are devoted to the evidence of the  Chairman  of Directors. I assure honorable senators that the most vital evidence was given after the presentation of the interim report.

It is taken merely in order that members of the committee  may refresh  their memory when they are conferring upon the nature of their report. It is necessary that they should have that opportunity, because they deal with fairly complex subjects embracing a variety of matters, and their deliberations must of necessity be . somewhat lengthy.

It was a lesson well worth learning, even though some of the scorching lava should happen to fall on one's own unprotected head. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has a big moral effect on people, for a little while. During the course of his speech, disturbing doubts careered through my mind, as to whether I was not really that frightful person, who, he suggested, was kicking a sick child to death; the sick child in this case being the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers; or whether I was not a sort of involuntary Faust, who was under the domination of Mephistopheles Inchcape. It was only when I shook myself, after he had concluded his remarks, that I found that my doubts were the result of an imagination which he had conjured up, and of the moral effect which he had had upon me. There are one or two other matters to which I wish to allude. The first relates to the weak child. Its  weakness is increasing to so great an extent that it appears absolutely evident that it cannot be kept in its present location; and the best thing to do is, not to kill it, but to board it out with people who will look kindly upon it, and perhaps save its life, for the benefit of both itself and Australia. That that can be done under the present system I gravely doubt ; and that doubt has been expressed in the report. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1353</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>- It is to be sent to a baby farm. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1353</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KPQ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">KINGSMILL, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator KINGSMILL</name></talker><para>- Both the committee and the Commonwealth Government may claim to have treated this Line with a very great deal of consideration. Every kindness has been shown to it, every opportunity to make good has been given to it. Even the public, who have dealt with it, have treated it kindly. The admissions in the report are very great. I consider that the committee has over-admitted the benefit of the Line to Australia. It certainly has been of great benefit in the past, but I very much doubt its capacity to continue those benefits in the future. I may say that it has outlived its usefulness. Furthermore, the entire position in the shipping world has altered considerably since the establishment of the Line. Since its' inauguration in 1923, a new factor, a new class of ship, and a new class of owner has arisen in the shipping world. I shall take the Swedish vessels as the most advanced type of modern cargo-cum-passenger ships. Their wages cost is something less than one-quarter of what it is in Australia. There is thus very little hope of the Commonwealth Line exercising' an influence in the controlling and policing of freights, because that can be done so much more effectively by the Swedish line. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1353</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>- Does the honorable senator wish to encourage foreign shipping? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1353</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KPQ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">KINGSMILL, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator KINGSMILL</name></talker><para>- No ; but I want to encourage shipping that will benefit the producers and the people of Australia.

That interesting position has to be faced, and it is one of which the committee took cognizance. There are several things which have militated against the success of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Lino. I do not WiSh to be misunderstood, but so long as the Line remains in the possession of the Government, it is impossible for the ships to be manned under other than Australian conditions, which are largely imposed by the  Navigation  Act and supplemented by the decisions of the Arbitration Court. The provisions of the Navigation Act are to govern the coastal traffic of Australia, arid if the coastal steamers, are  run  at a greater cost than those of any other nation, it is due to an Australian characteristic,  and  is an Australian privilege. I should, however, like to point out that if this policy is continued,  A\'e  shall be building around Australia a wall of isolation which will render it impossible for industries - such as  thu  sugar and other industries - to compete in the  world's  markets Avith any degree of success when once the local demand has been met. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1353</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K1P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BARWELL, Henry</name><name role="display">Senator Sir Henry BARWELL</name></talker><para>- It is bringing' about an impossible state of  affairs. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1354</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KPQ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">KINGSMILL, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator KINGSMILL</name></talker><para>-Absolutely impossible.

The trend of the debate has been in the direction of sympathizing with the primary producers in Australia who ship their products by this Line to the markets of the world. Direct inferences, and in somecases, direct statements have been madethat the wheat and wool growers of Australia are vitally interested in the Commonwealth Line. Honorable senators should know that such is not the case. Wheat at all events is carried almost entirely in whole shiploads under charter, and by vessels which are not bound by the Conference Lines regulations or rates. It is true that 1.2 per cent. of Australian wheat is taken away in these ships ; but the board does not go seeking it. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1354</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZR</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">OGDEN, James</name><name role="display">Senator Ogden</name></talker><para>- The freight is low. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1354</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KPQ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">KINGSMILL, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator KINGSMILL</name></talker><para>- Yes.

In this connexion I might refer to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> concerning the rebate system. The committee was informed that such a system is not in operation; but it does not matter very much whether it is or is not because the ships of the Australian Commonwealth Line coming from the United Kingdom to Australia are practically full every trip. The conditions under which this Line is conducted are practically ideal. Notwithstanding the fact that the conditions were better last year than they have ever bebeen before, we find that for the financial year ended 30th June last the Line lost Â£595,000. It will indeed be a difficult matter to make it pay unless the conditions are altered. It cannot be done by the Government, and it is therefore fairly obvious that if the Line is to be a success, the ownership must be changed. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1355</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXJ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">NEEDHAM, Edward</name><name role="display">Senator Needham</name></talker><para>-Would the honorable senator reduce the Australian conditions to the British standard? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1355</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KPQ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">KINGSMILL, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator KINGSMILL</name></talker><para>- I have not the power to do that if I so desired. The committee has made some observations and recommendations, and I should like to ask honorable senators to consider more closely than they seem inclined to do the proposition which the committee has put forward to the effect that an attempt should be made to form an Australian company in Australia, for the purpose of conducting an Australian mercantile marine as is done in other countries. France started out on the same lines as we did. The Messageries Maritime Company was reinforced by the addition of a large number of national ships, which were handed over to and run under its control. Other nations have found it necessary to adopt, so to speak, a line of steamers which they have fostered as national lines. There is the Norddeutscher Lloyd Company in Germany, and also an Italian Line as well as others mentioned in the committee's report. Patriotic instinct enables these countries to control shipping lines, and Australia can best do this in the manner I have suggested. I think it is the duty of the Government to give these people all the helpthey can in establishing a company and in keeping it going with a modicum of help equivalent to that which is given to the various companies I have named. In that way we shall be able to establish a successful mercantile marine. One thing is certain : The Line when disposed of, will not be able to observe the conditions now imposed, but will have to pay the wages which are ruling in the shipping world. It is impossible for Australia to go into this fight with one hand tied behind its back against competitors who are just as keen as it is, and have advantages in which it can never share. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1355</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>- Tell us a single good thing the ships have done? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1355</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KPQ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">KINGSMILL, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator KINGSMILL</name></talker><para>- That is told in the committee's report. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>1355</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KRZ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LYNCH, Patrick</name><name role="display">Senator Lynch</name></talker><para>- The honorable senator has been very quiet about it. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>1355</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KPQ</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">KINGSMILL, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator KINGSMILL</name></talker><para>- Not at all.

                    <para>- On 6th and- 7th October last <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> mentioned the loss of civilian, pay by certain trainees attending a parade at Perth on the occasion of the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York, and the promise by the Minister for Defence that if other trainees were similarly situated to Trainee Foley, who was recouped, by the department, the difference between his military pay and the wages he had lost, they would be treated in a like manner. I am now in a position to advise the honorable senator that only one other similar case has been brought to light, and in connexion with it authority has been given for the necessary payment. The Minister for Defence does not intend to authorize pay for all troops attending the parade, because specific instructions were promulgated locally long before th&lt;&gt; event that' pay would be issuable for mounted escorts and guards of honour only, but not for troops lining the streets, and as far as can be ascertained, the only trainees who suffered monetarily through any misunderstanding that may have arisen, are the two alluded to above, who have been compensated. </para>
