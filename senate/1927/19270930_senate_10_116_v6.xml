                to postpone the question standing in his name on the notice-paper, I desire to point out that, as questions of which notice is given on Thursdays do not reach the departments until 9 o'clock on Friday morning, it is somewhat difficult for the officers to obtain the answers by the time the Senate meets. In these circumstances, I ask honorable senators not to expect on Fridays answers to questions of which notice is given on Thursdays.

                        <para>- At the instance of the Minister for Markets and Migration, the brewers of Australia are now importing not more than 15 per cent. of their requirements of hops, and are supplying the balance from hops produced in Australia. The Development and Migration Commission, in association with the Department of Agriculture, Tasmania, is now examining the general position of the hop industry in that State, which is responsible for the bulk of the production of the Commonwealth. Under the circumstances, it is not considered necessary or advisable to place an embargo on the importation of hops into Australia. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to a point of order and a question of privilege. Yesterday I gave notice of motion concerning the privileges of honorable senators. It has relation to a matter which is very seriously and importantly connected with the business of the Senate. On to-day's notice paper it is placed under " Private Business." It is not private business in any shape or form because, as I have stated, it concerns the business of the Senate. Our Standing Orders provide and our practice always has been to recognize that any question of privilege is the business of the Senate and takes precedence over all other business. The Standing Orders also specifically state that any question of privilege arising since the last sitting of the Senate must take precedence of all other business. My notice of motion, as honorable senators will observe, concerns the manner in which the business of the Senate was conducted on 9th May last. The question of privilege did not arise, or at least it was not obvious, until the motion for the adjournment of the Senate on that occasion had been moved by the then Leader of the Senate, the Right Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce, and when that motion was agreed to, the Senate of course adjourned. There was therefore no opportunity for me or any other senators then to raise the question of privilege. Our next meeting took place on Wednesday last, and again, owing to the lamentable death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh,</inline> there was no possibility of an honorable senator raising a question of privilege. The Senate passed a motion of sympathy with the relatives of the deceased gentleman and adjourned immediately. This, therefore, is the first opportunity any honorable senator has had to' raise the question of privilege concerning the conduct of ' the business of the Senate on the 9th May. I wish to know by what right my notice of motion, dealing as it does with a question of privilege, has been placed on the notice paper not only behind Government business but as private business. I am prepared if necessary to take drastic action to see that the Senate is afforded every opportunity to discuss such issues and to protect its privileges. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that the acoustics of this Chamber are not as satisfactory as we could wish. As I have said, our Standing Orders provide for, and our practice always has been to give, precedence over all other business to any question of privilege. That also is the practice of the House of Commons, the procedure of which is the foundation of all our parliamentary practice. I wish to know by what right my notice of motion has been placed behind Government business and included amongst private business. I have no intention of censuring anyone in connexion with the manner in which the business of the Senate was conducted on the 9th May last. All that I am concerned with is the protection of the privileges, the rights, the dignity, and the honour of the Senate. That obligation rests also upon every other member of this chamber. The order of business on the notice-paper for to-day is an intimation to us that a question of privilege may be regarded as private business. It is not private business in any shape or form. I was not consulted as to the position it should occupy on the notice-paper, and I did not have an opportunity this morning to look the matter up because a notice-paper for the day was not placed in my box nor was it available in the Senate Club Room. I did not know where my notice of motion had been placed on the notice-paper until I entered the chamber this morning. It would appear, therefore, that there is an attempt on the part of the Government to burk discussion on the issue raised in my notice of motion I claim, as a matter of privilege, that my motion should take precedence over all other business. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> rule against me, I shall be obliged to take the only course open to me, namely, to move that your ruling be disagreed with. </para>

            <quote>
                <para>That the manner in which the proceedings in the Senate were conducted at its meeting on 9th May, 1927, was a grave breach of the privileges of the House, and must not be regarded us a precedent. </para>

            <para class="block">Is there anything in that motion to show that it relates to a matter of urgency - to a question of privilege that has arisen since the last meeting of the Senate, and which therefore, under the Standing Orders, must take precedence of all other business? It conveys no intimation of the subject desired to be discussed under cover of it. The officers of the Senate who are my advisers in this matter, and I, also, after careful and thoughtful consideration of the notice of motion, and after consulting the authorities, came to the decision that it did not come within the provisions of Standing Order 426. This question was raised at the meeting of the Senate on the 9th May, and grave charges were levelled against me then, as they have been to-day, the allegation of the honorable senator being that, in my administration of the business of the Senate, I was deliberately attempting to deprive honorable senators of certain privileges. Nothing of the kind has been, or will be, attempted by me. I shall at all times do my very best to uphold the privileges of the Senate just as effectively as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> did when he was in the chair which I now have the honour to occupy. I shall not allow the privileges of honorable senators to be curtailed in any way. In my opinion, as well as in the opinion of the responsible officers who have considered this matter, it does not relate to a question of privilege that has arisen since the Senate last met. If any attempt was made at the meeting of the Senate on the 9th May to curtail the privileges of honorable senators - and I do not admit that there was - it was referred .to at the time, and I hold that the notice of motion has been placed in its proper position on the notice-paper. If the honorable senator wishes, it is open to him to initiate a discussion in any way that he pleases. I have =a desire, however, to debar <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> from taking such action as he is at liberty to take under the Standing Orders. The Senate is at present discussing the point of order and question of privilege raised this morning by the honorable senator - not the motion that stands in his name on the business-paper - and it is competent for either the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Glasgow)</inline> or the honorable senator himself to obtain the opinion of the Senate as to whether the question is one of privilege. It has been ruled that a question of privilege does not arise in circumstances such as these, and I intend to adhere to that decision. The Standing Orders make provision for my protection as well as for the protection of honorable senators generally. I rule that the motion is not one of privilege, and that it, therefore/ should take its place amongst the private business on the notice-paper. </para>

                        <para>- This is a matter about which I have no personal feeling; but I consider that it concerns the dignity, the honour, the independence, and the rights of the Senate. It is for the Senate to say whether the motion shall be dealt with as private members' business or be treated - as I contend it ought to be treated - as a question of privilege, and thus take precedence of all other business before the Senate. It must be apparent to every honorable senator that if this question of privilege is not decided immediately, possibly one, two, or three months may elapse before it is dealt with, and in the meantime the rights of the Senate may be filched just as they were on the 9th May last. I shall briefly relate the occurrences of that day, and I ask for the impartial opinion of the Senate. The 9th' May was a very important and historic occasion. </para>

                        <para>- There may be to-day a repetition of what occurred on the motion for the adjournment on the 9th of May. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow,</inline> as Leader of the Senate, may move " That the Senate do now adjourn"; some discussion may arise, at the conclusion of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> may reply; and, as occurred on the 9 th of May, you, sir, may intervene subsequent to that reply. Honorable senators would have no remedy. Both you, sir, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow,</inline> have admitted that if any question of privilege had arisen since the last meeting of the Senate it unquestionably would take precedence of all other business to-:lay. Honorable senators were not seized of the magnitude and the importance of this matter until the motion for the adjournment of the Senate had been moved on the 9th of May. There could be no intervention until that motion had been disposed of ; and at that stage the Senate adjourned. We were precluded from taking any action on Wednesday last unless we were prepared to do what the Senate had never previously done - agree to the intervention of other business before the motion for the adjournment of the Senate out of respect to the memory of an honorable senator who had died since its last meeting. If the death had not occurred I should have moved my motion of privilege without notice on. that day. I gave notice in order that I should not take unawares either you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> or the members of the Ministry. Honorable senators must realize that I had not an earlier opportunity of intervening. All that I now ask is that the question be decided at the first opportunity. It is exceedingly important that it should be so decided. For that reason I have moved that your ruling be disagreed with. I have no desire to either censure or condemn any person. My sole desire is to protect the right3, the independence, the dignity and the honour of the Senate. I ask honorable senators to consider carefully whether the question should not be decided forthwith. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is to be commended for the action he has taken to preserve the dignity of the Senate. Nevertheless, I cannot see my way to support him. According to my interpretation of Standing Order 118, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> lost on Wednesday his opportunity of making this matter one of privilege and  urgency. It is true that, in explanation of his delay, he has told the Senate that on Wednesday, the first meeting of the Senate after the meeting on the 9th May, the Senate had before it a motion expressing its regret at the death of a member of this chamber. I agree that that would not have been a fitting occasion to raise the question which we are now considering; but I remind the honorable senator that under Standing Order 118 he could have taken action yesterday without notice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who occupied the President's chair for thirteen years, should have known that. Standing Order "118 reads - </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but it may be moved without notice. If the question before us is one of privilege today, it was one of privilege yesterday; and there was nothing to prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> from taking action without notice yesterday. For that reason I intend to support the President's ruling. I shall support it for another reason, namely, that the incident to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has referred has not occurred since the last sitting of the Senate. In my opinion, that entirely disposes df the argument that this is a matter of privilege. Taking all the circumstances into consideration, I think that the privileges of honorable senators have been safeguarded. I shall, therefore, support the President's ruling. </para>

                        <para>- I find myself reluctantly compelled to support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens.</inline> 1 shall do so largely because I desire to clear the way from the straw-splitting arguments that have been brought forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> said that if this question is one of privilege to-day, it was one of privilege yesterday. I remind him that conversely, if it was a question of privilege yesterday, it is a question of privilege to-day. But even if we treated the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> as an ordinary one, we should be right in considering it as we are now doing. As the innocent cause of the whole series of. circumstances which led to this unfortunate position, let me say that, although I have forgiven the circumstances which then arose, I have not forgotten them. It is important that this chamber should arrive at a decision which will preclude the possibility of a recurrence of the incidents of 9th May. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> could have moved his motion yesterday without notice, he very graciously gave notice of his intention to do so to-day. I understand that your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, President,</inline> is that the question before us is not one of privilege. </para>

                        <para>- The Standing Orders are clear that in the event of a breach of privilege occurring during a sitting of the Senate, action can be taken immediately, in which case it has precedence over all the other business of the Senate. They also provide that should a breach of privilege occur after the last day of sitting, action, without notice can be taken at the next sitting of the Senate. If the incident complained of occurred after the sitting on the 9th May, the only time when action could have been taken without notice was the next day of sitting, namely, Wednesday last; otherwise the motion must take its place on the notice-paper as an ordinary motion. Should one honorable senator address abusive words to another, or strike him within the chamber after the Senate had adjourned, that would be a breach of privilege. Action could not be taken that day, however, because the offence had occurred after the Senate had adjourned. But at the next sitting of the Senate action could be taken without notice. If, however, action was not taken on the next day of sitting, it could not be taken without notice, but would have to take its place as an ordinary motion, in which case it would not suspend all other business. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> will agree with my contention. </para>

In my opinion, it is clearly a question of privilege. I understand the ruling to be that, although a question of privilege, it is not a question of privilege which may be brought forward without notice, and cause all other business to be suspended. </para>

I agree that unless it comes within the four corners of either of those Standing Orders, or relates to a breach of privilege occurring during the present sitting it is not one which can be moved without notice to the suspension of all other business. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite right that it should not have been' taken at once. It could only have been taken at once if it related to a breach of privilege occurring to-day or since the last sitting of the Senate. As it is neither of these things it is not a matter that must be dealt with at once. Honorable senators ought to think well before disagreeing with the ruling. I know that every honorable senator is anxious to uphold the privilege <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> of the Senate. But honorable senators are equally anxious to abide strictly by the Standing Orders, and that being so in this case they must uphold the ruling of the  President. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> had raised the question of privilege without giving notice he would have been within his rights in demanding that the motion should take precedence of all other business. But since he has not done so, and has not set out in the motion that it relates to a matter of urgency, thai should take precedence of all other business. I take it that his motion must be treated in the ordinary way as private business. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators seem to have missed the simple, and, indeed, the only point for consideration and decision by the Senate.

                <para class="block">I move it without notice or on notice. My friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition, says that I would have been quite in order in moving the motion when the Senate met on Wednesday, and that it would then undoubtedly have been a question of privilege, the urgency of which could not be disputed. Had I done so the honorable senator would have been perfectly justified in regarding it as grave lack of respect on. my part for the  memory of his late honorable colleague. That was why I did not raise this question on Wednesday. That sitting having intervened, I thought it was only courtesy to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and to the Government for me to proceed by giving notice. To any one who has a knowledge of the practice and Standing Orders of the Senate, it is obvious that a day having intervened, I was precluded from the right of proceeding without giving notice of my motion. Honorable senators seem to think that the sole issue is whether or not your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> should be upheld. The privileges of the Senate, however, are at stake. In the British House of Commons and in every other deliberate assembly with whose practice I am acquainted - and I am acquainted with the practice of all of them more or less - questions of privilege or concerning the rights of Parliament have always taken precedence, and very properly so, of all other business. Our Standing Orders go further than that. They declare that unless otherwise ordered the " business of the Senate " shall take precedence over all other business. Will any honorable senator claim that the matter I have raised is not a question of privilege? Honorable senators must admit that. They may say "It does not matter; we can let it go; we do not care a straw about it" ; but they cannot deny that it is a question of privilege. Again, they will agree that it is not a matter affecting me as a private-senator but relates to the business of the Senate which, under our Standing Orders, takes precedence over all other business. There is no reason why it should not be decided to-day. It would probably have been decided with much less discussion than has taken place if it had been taken in the proper way. No question is of greater importance to the Senate than the preservation of its rights, integrity, dignity, importance and independence. It is an obligation on every honorable senator to hand down to posterity the traditional rights of Parliament for which the British House of Commons has fought through the centuries. The great mother of Parliaments had to fight for its independence against the aggression of the Crown, against the great feudal system, and against the domineering power of certain governments, and it is our duty to hand down intact to those who come after us those sacred rights and privileges thus gained for us. I trust the Senate will disagree with the President's ruling. </para>

I most earnestly protest against the Senate being treated in this way. If the business which the Government has to bring forward is so unimportant, the Senate should not have been asked to meet to-day. It is unfitting and unbecoming the dignity of the Senate that we should be treated in this way. If the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> is not prepared to proceed with the debate on the budget. I, who have rights and privileges in common with other honorable senators, am quite willing to do so. Must the Senate stultify itself merely because one honorable senator docs not wish to speak. I am sure we all wish to pay our last tribute of respect to an officer of this Parliament, who has rendered valuable service to the Commonwealth; but the funeral is not until this afternoon. I again protest against the action of the Government, and unhesitatingly say that it is not facilitating the conduct of public business by proceeding in this manner. </para>
