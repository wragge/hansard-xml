        <para>On the 24th March, 1927, the Senate and the House of Representatives, sitting in Melbourne, resolved that the next meeting of the Parliament should be at Canberra on the 9th May, 1927. Parliament reassembled for the despatch of business on that day, when His Royal Highness the Duke of York opened Parliament House, Canberra, and delivered to the Parliament a message from His Majesty the King. </para>

        <para>At 10.40 a.m. their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York arrived at Parliament House, Canberra. </para>

        <para class="block">Your Royal Highness, </para>
        <para>It is ray privilege to invite you to open the door of this building, the future home of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>We recognize that this occasion marks the beginning of a new era in the history of Australia.We look back on a story of accomplishment that fills us with pride. We look forward with confidence that we shall prove worthy of the great destiny that lies before us. </para>
        <para>In this, an hour of national heart searching, we rejoice at your presence with us.  His  Majesty the King is the visible symbol of our unity. He is the centre of all our loyalties. That he should associate himself with his Australian subjects in this historic ceremony by commissioning Your Royal Highness to represent him is a source of deep gratification to us all.We ask you to convey to  His  Majesty our devoted homage, and an assurance of our loyalty and affection to his Throne and Person. </para>
        <para>Twenty-six years have passed since the King was pleased to inaugurate the first Parliament of the Commonwealth. In those days our national aspirations were vague and almost undefined. Full of high hope and brave endeavour we were launching on an uncharted sea. &#34;We have emerged with a definite national consciousness.We have evolved great policies, which are so embedded in the soul of the nation that they not only govern our lives to-day, but point the course which we, and future generations, must inevitably follow. </para>
        <para>We have played our part in war, and proved ourselves worthy to endure. The sacrifices, sufferings, and untold trials of those who went, and those who waited, have bound us inseparably together. Within this period of little more than a quarter of a century a nation has been born. </para>
        <para>With humility in our hearts we render thanks to Divine Providence for all that we have done and are. We remember with gratitude the fostering care of the Mother Country and the protection we have enjoyed under the British flag. </para>
        <para>To-day it is our solemn duty to reaffirm our faith in our country, and our devotion to the Crown and Empire. </para>
        <para>Great though our progress has been, Australia is but on the threshold of achievement. In the future, millions of the British race will people this continent. In numbers surpassing the Mother Land, standing resolutely for those principles of freedom and justice upon which the Empire is based, who can foretell how great may be the part our nation will play in the years to come. </para>
        <para>To-day we look back and renew our faith by remembering what has been achieved. Thus we shall strengthen ourselves for the greater accomplishment that lies before us. </para>
        <para>Within these portals will be framed those laws which will mould the destiny of a people. May those who enter this open door govern with justice, reason, and equal favour to all. May they do so in humility and without self-interest. May they think and act nationally. May they speak with the voice of those who sent them here - the voice of the people. </para>
        <para>Inspired by those who have gone before us, let us dedicate ourselves to service, and march forward to our destiny with firm purpose and high resolve. </para>
        <para>Having opened the doors with a key presented by the Prime Minister, and returned the key to him, to be preserved as a memento of the occasion, </para>
        <para>HISROYAL HIGHNESS said- </para>
        <para>We are gathered here this morning to open the first meeting of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia in a new Capital City, and I should like, if I may, to try and give expression to some of the thoughts that come to me at this historic moment. It is impossible not to be moved by the significance of to-day&#39;s events as a great landmark in the history of Australia. I say this not only because this day sees the opening of a new Parliament House, and marks the inauguration of a new Capital City, but more because one feels the stirring of a new birth, of quickened national activity, of a fuller consciousness of your destiny as one of the great self-governing units of the British Empire. </para>
        <para>It seems particularly fitting that the inauguration of your new Capital should come so soon after the Imperial Conference, with its recognition of the growth to full nationhood of the members of the British Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>To-day marks the end of an epoch and the beginning of another, and one&#39;s thoughts turn instinctively to what the future may have in store. One&#39;s own life would hardly be worth living without its dream of better things, and the life of a nation without such dreams of a better and a larger future would be poor indeed. </para>
        <para>Standing on this spot, and looking out over the beautiful site that has been chosen for the Federal Capital, I think of those great men who worked for a Federated Australia, and whose aim was realized when my father opened the first Federal Parliament in 1901. We are now building on the foundations which they laid. </para>
        <para>I think we should have in our hearts one other vision. On Anzac Day we commemorated those gallant men and women who laid down their lives in the war. Though they have passed into the Great Beyond, they are still speaking to those who choose to listen, and if Australia listens to the voices of the noble army of the dead, and if the great army of those living, and those yet unborn, is determined to march in step with them towards the ideals for which they died, then the glorious destiny of this country will be assured for all time. </para>
        <para>The PRIME MINISTER thereupon presented to  His  Royal Highness a gold key and casket, and gave the keys of Parliament House to the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. </para>

                Majesty the King, my dear father, desiring to mark the importance of the opening of this, the first meeting of the Federal Parliament in the new capital city of the Commonwealth of Australia, and to show his keen interest in all that concerns the welfare and advancement of his loyal subjects in Australia, has granted me the special commission which has just been read. Unable himself to be present in person,  His  Majesty has by that commission charged me as his representative to perform to-day&#39;s ceremony, which inaugurates the new capital of Australia.
            </para>
            <para>I am commanded by the King to say that his thoughts are with you in this hour. To-day&#39;s historic occasion brings back vivid memories of that other 9th of May 26 years ago, when, as Duke of </para>
            <para class="block">Cornwall and York, His Majesty opened the first Parliament of the Commonwealth. Both he and the Queen retain the happiest recollections of that great event, and of their visit to Australia, of which it formed so memorable a part. They will never forget the manifestations of loyalty and affection with which they were everywhere received. The Duchess and I are proud to be following in their footsteps, and we thank you with full hearts for the welcome we have received, and the kindnesses that have been showered on us in every part of Australia which we have visited. </para>
            <para>How much has happened in the quarter of a century since the opening of the first Commonwealth Parliament! What changes in the world! What revolution in human life and thought ! What marvellous progress in the means of communication and locomotion! For Australia and the whole Empire it has been a period of extraordinary evolution and development. It has been a testing time when, under the stress of the greatest war of our history, the Empire has found new meaning and new strength. Quickened by all these influences, without and within, the British Empire has advanced to a new conception of autonomy and freedom, to the idea of a system of British nations, each freely ordering its own individual life, but bound together in unity, by allegiance to one Crown, and co-operating with one another in all that concerns the common weal. </para>
            <para>It is the King&#39;s earnest prayer, in which I fervently join, that under Divine Providence, the future years may see the same advance in the development and prosperity of the Empire and all its parts, the same spirit of mutual understanding and sympathy, and the same determination to support one another to the uttermost, should the need come. </para>
            <para>It is perhaps peculiarly fitting that we should celebrate the birth of this new capital city just after the close of an Imperial Conference, which represents the beginning of another chapter in our Empire story. May this day&#39;s ceremony mark the re-dedication of this Commonwealth to those great ideals of liberty, fair dealing, justice, and devotion to the cause of peace, for which the Empire and all its members stand. We turn to-day a new page of history. May it be a page glorious for Australia and the whole Empire. </para>

                    <para class="block">After the brilliant and historic ceremony in which we have taken part to-day, it is appropriate that the first business which the Senate is asked to transact in this new home to which the Parliament of Australia has been transferred should be the adoption of a motion in reply to the most gracious message of  His  Majesty the King, and the presentation by the  President,  on behalf of the Senate, of an Address to  His  Royal Highness the Duke of York, who opened this building to-day under such happy auspices. The cloudless skies and glorious sunshine which attended to-day&#39;s proceedings augur well, I think, for the future that awaits the Commonwealth </para>

                        <para>. -  As Leader of the Opposition, I cordially endorse the sentiments expressed by the right honorable the Leader of the Senate, and contained in the Address which, upon the adoption of this motion, will be presented to  His  Royal Highness the Duke of York. Together with all my colleagues of the Labour party, I join in the enthusiastic welcome that has been extended to their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York. Their visit to our shores, and the part they have played in to-day&#39;s historic ceremony, will long be cherished in the memories of  His  Majesty&#39;s subjects in this part of  His  far-flung realm. It seems but yesterday that  His  Gracious Majesty the King, as Duke of Cornwall and York, performed the ceremony of opening the firstParliament of- .the Commonwealth. Twenty-six years, however, have elapsed. In the intervening period much history has been made. To-day, we have reached the portals of that nationhood along the path to which we then took the first step. The Commonwealth was at that time but a political babe in swaddling clothes. To-day it is in the full possession of a lusty vigour. </para>

                    <para>During these 26 years Australia has been tried and tested, not only in the walks and arts of peace, but also in the dread crucible of war. The ceremony today marks an epoch in our history: the beginning of a new era for the Commonwealth. We have established for all time the nation&#39;s Parliament in the nation&#39;s own territory. From now on, the laws of the Commonwealth will be made, its destinies guided, and the welfare of its people guarded, by the Federal Parliament established in Federal territory. I earnestly hope that we in this Parliament, in common with all other Parliaments of the British Commonwealth of Nations, will ever strive to preserve the peace of the world and direct our efforts to the promotion of the progress and best interests of our people. I trust that Their Royal Highnesses will return to their native land in full possession, of health and vigour, and that they  Will  convey from us to our kinsfolk overseas a message of good-will, love, and loyalty. I have much pleasure in seconding the motion. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators are so well aware of the special circumstances associated at present with the conduct of the business of the Parliament that they need very little explanation from me; but in view of certain statements, particularly in sections of the press, it is desirable that, in the interests of honorable senators themselves, I should set out briefly the reasons why the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not and  will not be meeting during certain periods of the current year. It is a unique experience for a young nation governed by a Parliament to have the whole of its administrative machinery transferred from one part of the country to another during the course of one year. By the deliberate will of the people of Australia it was inevitable, however, that the time would come when the Seat of Government must be transferred from Melbourne to Canberra. That transfer is taking <inline font-style="italic">place</inline> during the present year. Members of Parliament, because of their close association with the various departments that enable this Parliament and the executive officers to function, well understand how involved and intricate is the machinery of government; but many people do not. . They do not realize, for instance, that in the central administration of one department alone there are no less than 1,000 officers who will have to be removed to Canberra before it can function here as it has functioned in Melbourne. They do not know, perhaps, that there are ten departments, the central administrative staffs of which, although- certainly not as large as that of the department I have mentioned, must also be removed here before full executive government can be carried on in Canberra. Any one who knows anything at all about the machinery of government will realize, therefore, how impossible it is for the complete transfer to be effected in any one year. Fully aware of this, the Ministry, in. consultation with Parliament, has decided that the removal of the departments shall be gradual, and the transfer from Melbourne to Canberra is now gradually being made. Honorable senators are fully aware of the intimate relationship between Parliament, the Executive, and the administrative departments, and how necessary it is for the smooth working of the parliamentary machine that the departments should be in close touch with Ministers and Parliament. It has been the endeavour of the Government to see that the departments more closely associated with Parliament and the Executive shall be the first to be transferred. When this brief sitting of Parliament terminates, steps will be taken to bring to Canberra the central staffs of the departments of  the </para>
                <para class="block">Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, and the Treasurer, which are the most closely associated with parliamentary government. But while this transfer is being effected, while the departmental files are being packed, conveyed here, unpacked and re-sorted, it will be almost impossible for parliamentary government to function. Any one with the slightest knowledge of administrative matters knows that this is so; but an attempt has been made to throw dust in the eyes of the people and make them believe that this Parliament is not meeting because of a lack of desire on the part of members and of the Government to go on with the business of the country. An essential part of the business of the country is the transfer of the Parliament and the departments to Canberra. This removal was inevitable. Having been undertaken, it has to be carried out in the most orderly and economical way, and - with due regard to the need for avoiding any breakdown or serious interruption in the service - in the speediest manner possible to enable Parliament to pursue its legislative work in its new home. These, briefly, are the reasons for the unusual break I am now proposing in our ordinary sittings this year. It is certainly not due to any desire on the part of the Government or Parliament to avoid any of its responsibilities. I trust that this explanation, which I repeat, is unnecessary to honorable senators,  Will  reach those people who have been misled by statements in the press, so that they may understand the real reasons for the delay that has been occasioned this year. </para>

                    <para>. -  Having had a little parliamentary experience, I recognize that the opinions that have been expressed outside as to the unwillingness of this Parliament to stand up to and perform its duties are but port and parcel of the unfair criticism that iff. generally directed at Parliaments and parliamentarians in this country. I do not know that the motive of these critics is a very lofty one, but I do know that among those who have spoken or written as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir George Pearce)</inline> has described are many who would like to bring parliamentary institutions into disrepute and contempt. It is certain that  their aim is not to extol or place them on the high plane they should undoubtedly occupy. While I agree in some measure with the explanation that has been given by the Minister, it has to be borne in mind that the present Government recently gave an all too willing ear to the alleged claims of particular interests in this country, the effect being to load the industries and the people of the Commonwealth with an impost that in my opinion, at least, is unwarranted. As this necessary obstacle to the functioning of the parliamentary and executive machine - the transfer from Melbourne to Canberra - had to be surmounted, it was the duty of the Government to measure the time and the circumstances more accurately, and not to yield so willingly to the pleadings of certain persons that they should be given an immediate and undue advantage over the interests of others at the expense of the whole community. I refer particularly to the tariff introduced in the closing days of the last session. It does not look well to have a tariff schedule thus presented and, to all intents and purposes, placed on the statute-book of the Commonwealth without the ratification of Parliament, which in the ordinary course of events could have been secured within a few months of its submission. To my mind the Government should have kept better in mind the interests of those people who were bound to be injured as a result of the introduction of these tariff proposals. I trust that it will take the earliest opportunity to consult Parliament and ascertain whether it agrees to or disapproves of what has been done by the imposition in this way of a tariff that penalizes the great bulk of the people of this country. </para>

                            <para>- As honorable senators are aware, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has been pursuing for some time an investigation into the activities of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line. The  chairman  of that committee <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Kingsmill)</inline> intimated to the Government some little time ago that the committee had its report ready for presentation, and desired an opportunity to present it to Parliament. It was the wish of the Government that this should be done in order that Parliament and the public might be apprised of the contents of the report, and so that the Government itself might be in a position to consider what action it should ask the Parliament, at a later stage, to take upon it. When, however, the Prime Minister, in consulting the Leader of the Opposition in another place as to the business to be transacted at to-day&#39;s sitting, made known to him the proposal of the  chairman  of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> took the point that as this would be more or less a formal sitting of the Parliament to enable an important ceremony to be carried out, there ought to be a general understanding that ordinary party politics or anything that was likely to give rise to discussion should for this day be set aside. On behalf of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> intimated that if the report of the joint committee were presented to Parliament to-day certain members of his party would feel it incumbent upon them to debate it at once. The Government, on giving the matter careful consideration, decided that on an occasion such as this, a ceremony so brilliantly begun and so fittingly carried out, might well be permitted to conclude without the introduction of the slightest display of party feeling into the proceedings. It came, somewhat unwillingly, to the conclusion that in these special circumstances it would be better if the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, did not present its report at this sitting. The Government feels that it is unfortunate that this delay should have occurred, but after all we must remember that to-day the eyes of the world are on Australia- </para>

                            <para>- 1 do not know that the Government has any right to prevent the committee from presenting its report. I am not discussing any question of right; I am merely putting it that the Government in the course it has taken to-day has not given the committee an opportunity to present its report. Notices of motion and questions were not called on because of the way in which the Government put certain motions before the Chamber. I am speaking not of the rights of honorable senators, but of what I conceive Do be the wish of the majority of the Senate, namely, that the first meeting of this Parliament at Canberra should close as it began, without any party discussion whatsoever. Regrettable as it is that this report of the. committee is not before us, I believe that honorable senators will agree that it was better to postpone its presentation than have to-day a discussion on a subject which would be likely to bring strong party feelings into the arena. I hope that the Senate will give the Government credit for being actuated solely by that desire, and nothing else, in so arranging the business to-day as not to afford the  chairman  of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts an opportunity to present his report. No blame can be laid on his shoulders. If there is any blame it rests with the Government for arranging the business of the Senate as it has done. I leave the matter in the hands of honorable senators, and appeal to them not to allow this day&#39;s proceedings to be marred by any exhibition of party feeling. </para>

                        GLASGOW.Sir George Pearce is the only original member of the Senate. He was elected a member of the first Parliament, and has retained his seat in this Chamber ever since. From the very establishment of the federation, and particularly during the great war, he has rendered signal service to the Commonwealth. As Minister for Defence he was in control of a department that was responsible for the organization, equipment, training, and transport of the troops that left our shores, for the handling of them during their period of active service abroad, and for the difficult task of returning them to Australia at the conclusion of the war. When subsequently he relinquished the portfolio of Defence he again rendered noteworthy service as Minister for Home and Territories. It is, therefore, fitting that on so memorable an occasion as this  His  Majesty the King should be pleased to confer a particularly high honour on him. Again I offer my right honorable colleague the congratulations of the Senate and its earnest wish that he may have a successful future.

I rose, however, to discuss what to me is a more important matter, namely, the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the Commonwealth Government&#39;s shipping activities, including Cockatoo Island Dockyard, which was to have been presented to the Senate this afternoon. Honorable senators who are familiar with parliamentary procedure will realize that at no time this afternoon was there an opportunity for that report to be tabled; and I desire to make it perfectly clear that that was not because of any wish on the part of the committee. On the contrary, it was the desire of the committee that the report, which had been eagerly waited by the public of Australia for some months, should be laid on the table at an early date. It will be recalled that early in the proceedings in another place this session the joint committee was taken to task for what was said to be its undue delay in presenting a report. It was pointed out by its then <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Sir Granville</inline> Ryrie, that the delay had been caused by the Government having asked the committee to take in hand an additional investigation. That further investigation it undertook and completed. Its report is now ready, and I deeply regret that it cannot be tabled to-day. I disclaim on behalf of the committee, and as its  chairman,  any responsibility for the delay. It cannot be attributed to the committee. We have completed our inquiry, and we are prepared at once to lay the result of our investigations before Parliament and the public. I have nothing more to say except to express my regret that this committee, which was urged by the Government some time ago to complete its labours as early as possible, has not been given an opportunity to lay before Parliament the result of those labours. </para>

                        <para>. - First of all, I desire to join with others who have spoken in congratulating <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and the right honorable the Leader of the Senate on the honours which have been conferred upon them by  His  Majesty the King. I should not have risen but that it appears to me that this Parliament needs to be thoroughly on the alert to preserve its rights and privileges. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> are not merely the custodian of the rights and privileges of the Senate; by virtue of your position, you are also the guardian of them, and it is lamentable that you should have allowed to go unresented  an attack which has been made upon those rights and privileges by the Government on the historic occasion of the first meeting of the Parliament at Canberra. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has told us that the Government deliberately arranged the business of this sitting so that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts should not have an opportunity to present a certain report to the Senate. I want to know from you, sir, what right the Government had to arrange the business of the Senate? It is distinctly laid down in our Standing Orders, of which you are the interpreter, that the first right of all is the right of the people to petition Parliament before it proceeds to the transaction of any business. The second is the right of honorable senators to ask questions without notice or to give notice of questions or notices of motion. N&#169; opportunity was given by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to any honorable senator to do any of these things to-day. It is your bounden duty as the guardian of the rights and privileges of the Senate to see that the Standing Orders of the Senate are strictly observed. We have now a lamentable situation. . A report, of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, for which the people have been clamouring, has not been presented to Parliament,  and probably cannot be presented for another three months, because of the Government usurpation of your functions and the abrogation of the rights of the Senate under its own Standing Orders. It is, I repeat, lamentable that this precedent should be set up on the first day of our meeting in Canberra. It shall not be done without protest. Twenty-six years have elapsed since the first meeting of the Federal Parliament, and for exactly half that period I occupied the position which you now dignify. It was my constant care to preserve every right and privilege of honorable senators, and to afford every opportunity for debate .that was properly due to the Senate. It is deplorable that a violent attack should have been made to-day on the rights of the community and of the Senate in such an important respect as this. In matters of less concern also the same thing has occurred. To-day, when we entered this House, we found that honorable senators were locked out of the room sot apart for their own use. By whose authority that was done 1* do not know. The moment you, sir, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> were banded the keys of this House which  His  Royal Highness the Duke of York had honoured us by opening, the control of this building passed into the hands of its presiding officers. You, sir, as  chairman  of the Joint House Committee, may reasonably be expected to explain some of the occurrences of to-day whereby we have been deprived of rights and privileges that we have hitherto enjoyed in the Senate. I protest against the attack&#39; made by the Government on the rights of the Senate and on the right of a parliamentary committee to present a report, lt is a most lamentable precedent to establish on the first day of our meeting here. </para>

If the Senate gives a Minister leave to submit a motion, the presiding officer cannot disregard the decision of the Senate.

A large number of vice-regal representatives, for whom some accommodation had to be found, if only out of courtesy to them as our guests, were here to-day; and 1 am quite sure that honorable senators will be content to overlook any little inconvenience that may have been occasioned them when they know that it was due to the cause I have mentioned. </para>

Sir John Newlands).</inline> - I thank the Vice-President of the Executive Council for his very kindly references to myself, and in turn I congratulate him upon the mark of distinction that has been conferred upon him this afternoon by the representative of  His  Majesty the King. I regret that, during the closing hours of the session in Melbourne, illness prevented me from attending to my duties as I should very much have liked to do. It would have given me as much satisfaction and pleasure to take my place in Melbourne during the closing sittings of the Senate there as I have experienced in taking part in the proceedings which have marked the opening of the sittings of the Parliament at Canberra. I trust that the kindly expressions of the Leader of the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition will be realized - that my health will improve, and that I may be able to take my place in this Parliament for many years to come. </para>

                            <para>- In regard to the charge that I have neglected my duty, in that I have not guarded the privileges of honorable senators as I should have done, I may say that, as the chief executive officer of the Senate, I can deal only with matters that are brought before me. I had before me a statement indicating that a report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts would be presented this afternoon. I do not know why it was not presented, nor have I, in my opinion, anything to do with the matter. The report was not presented, and the responsibility for its non-submission is not mine. It is complained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> that certain words were not uttered by me before the Senate proceeded to deal with ordinary business, but I remind him there was not a dissentient voice when the Leader of the Government in the Senate rose, as soon as we met, and asked for leave to do certain things. Honorable senators cheered him to the echo when he rose. That, I venture to say, was the time when objection should have been taken to the course proposed. Had that been done, I should have been, in duty bound, to follow a certain course. It was not done, however, and in my opinion the Senate has not stultified itself, has not suffered in dignity, has not failed in any way in the discharge of its duties by reason of anything that has occurred here to-day. </para>
