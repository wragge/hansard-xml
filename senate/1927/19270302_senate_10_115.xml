          <para>- I desire to make a statement regarding the business which Parliament will be asked to consider during the next few weeks of the sitting in Melbourne. The mam business will be the bill for the termination of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. That bill is now before another place, and presumably a week or so will elapse before it reaches this chamber. The other measures are machinery bills, which are necessary but are not of a very important character, and probably will not occupy much of the time of the Senate. It is intended, however, to give both chambers an opportunity to discuss the resolutions of the Imperial Conference. To that end I shall submit later a paper, and move that it be printed, <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> motion which will enable discussion to take place on those resolutions. It is also intended, in the same way, r.o give the Senate an opportunity to discuss the work done at the last meeting   if  the Assembly of the League of Nations. </para>

            <para>&#91;3.12&#93;.- <inline font-style="italic">(By leave)-</inline> Early last year certain areas on the Edie Creek in the Morobe District of New Guinea were applied for as dredging and sluicing leases, and the applications were subsequently approved by the Administrator. Opposition by the miners of the district to the granting of these leases has been more or less continuously manifested ever since the leases were first applied for. The principal complaints of the miners were that the ground covered by the leases was of a rich alluvial nature suitable only for working by box and dish, that it was totally unsuitable for the application of dredging and sluicing methods, and that the granting of the leases had locked up in the hands of four individuals an area that could have been profitably worked by many times that number of miners as ordinary claims. Reports have been furnished by the Administrator of New Guinea in regard to the various phases of the matter, and these, together with the representations made by the miners, have been considered by the Government. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Government has deemed it advisable to appoint a. Royal Commissioner to investigate the complaints that have been made, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> B. MacGregor, a barrister, of Brisbane, has been appointed for the purpose. The terms of the reference to the Royal Commissioner are as follow : - </para>

            <para>. - On the 5th August, 1926, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> submitted a motion for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the moving picture industry generally, and in doing so delivered a very informative speech, which showed that he had devoted considerable time to the study of the subject. At different times other honorable senators have also expressed strong opinions in regard to the operations of the moving picture industry in Australia. The Government, which has now had time to give attention to the terms of the motion, has also been considering some of the facts, and it would be as well if I supplemented the figures submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline><inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the 5th August, 1926, which were then the latest available, by others showing the present position of the industry.

          </para>
          <para>It will thus be seen that the United States of America supplies Australia with 93 per cent, of its feature-film requirements. This applies to practically the whole of the British Empire. This state of affairs is due in great part to the advantage American producers enjoyby reason of the enormous home market available to th em.The average weekly attendance at picture theatres in the United States of America is 50,000,000, or half the annual attendances at Australian cinemas. </para>
          <para>One-half as many people attend pictures in America in one week as do in Australia in a year. </para>
          <para class="block">Thus the American film can earn its profits in the domesticmarket, and is sent abroad to gather in whatever else it can. The British or Australian film, however, has only a very limited field. The number of theatres in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States of America may be taken as 3,000, 1,200, and 15,000 respectively. It will be seen that even if a British or Australian picture got into every home theatre existing, it has little chance of making the same profit as the American film that is shown in only one out of three American theatres. The position is really worse by reason of the &#34; block booking &#34; system, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> points out, many British and Australian films are precluded from exhibition in any shape or form. </para>
          <para class="block">I have also before me the latest report of the Chief Film Censor and the Commonwealth Censor, stationed in Sydney, who censors all films imported into Australia. In this report there are some very interesting points which I should like to bring before the Senate. I shall not quote the figures in his report, which have been given in that which I have just read from the Trade and Customs Department. Dealing with the result of his work, the Censor says - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>These 1,960 films- the number I quoted from the previous report - were dealt with in the following manner: - </para>

          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="115332192703022_5_3.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>As many of these films were scenic or topical pictures of one ortwo reels, whereas it is the dramatic films of five reels and over, forming the bulk of the imports, with which the censorship has mostly to do, the work of the censorship is best understood by having regard not to the number of films, but to the number of reels and feet. The figures are : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The films which chiefly concern the censorship are, as we have said, the feature or dramatic films. Of these 697 were imported in the following numbers with respect to the country of origin . - </para>
            <para class="block">The Censor in his report then proceeds to show what is done with rejected films, and goes on to make this comparison - </para>
            <para>In 1925, 721 picture films were imported. Of those, 322 were passed without eliminations, 331 after eliminations, and 68 were rejected in the first instance. It will be noted that the number of rejected films has increased, while the number passed after eliminations has decreased. This result follows on the censorship&#39;s policy to reject outright films which are radically bad rather than to attempt to amend them. </para>
            <para class="block">He makes some very interesting comments on the present system of conducting the censorship, and expresses some opinions as to what he thinks should be done in dealing with films. I shall quote only one of his statements in this connexion : - </para>
            <para>It is just as well to speak plainly on these matters. We have been told recently that we put the producers to much needless expense, and that the methods we adopt are not &#34; good business.&#34; It is necessary, therefore, to make the position quite clear. What we would plead for is a little more refinement and less&#39; vulgarity. Assuredly, there are many films which give the highest form of enjoyment presenting a good story, dramatically handled, well acted, and beautifully photographed. But there are too many which have none of these virtues. It is the business of criticism to endeavour to reduce their number. </para>
            <para>In this connexion, it may be said that the practice of showing two feature films a night has not a little to do with the multiplication and importation of mediocre films. In by far the greater number of Australian picture theatres the nightly programme includes two features. The first feature shown is invariably of the cheapest kind, and does much to destroy any interest that the main attraction may have. </para>
            <para class="block">The purport of the remaining comments is that, in striving to make a film interesting, those who produce it are, apparently, of the opinion that they have to make it what is vulgarly termed &#34; spicy.&#34; Very often, the good story which the film depicts is spoiled in this way. Moreover, there is a general tendency to appeal to the sex instinct, particularly in dramatic films, those who produce them apparently believing that there can be no real appeal to the dramatic tastes of the people in any other way. Unfortunately, such pictures are generally associated with the lowest form of sex appeal. The Censor points out that pictures in which women who have been made the victims of men&#39;s passions are shown are generally presented in such a way that, instead of inciting pity for the victims, they appeal to the lowest sex instincts of those attending the theatres. The difficulty confronting the Censor is that he cannot say definitely that such pictures are immoral. It is rather that they are vulgar. Yet the effect on the community, and especially on the younger generation, cannot be anything but harmful. That is a serious thing for any community. The vogue of the cinema is so universal, and the pictures make such a strong appeal .to <inline font-style="italic">th&#39;i</inline> younger life of the community that no country can afford to allow the moral sense of its future fathers and mothers to ,be thus sapped or injured. This matter is, </para>
          </quote>
          <para>There is another phase of this question to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has devoted particular attention - the use of the film for purposes&#39; of propaganda. Personally, I have no objection to any country using picture films for that purpose; and, therefore, I do not share the views of those who have denounced picture producers in the United States of America for what is called the &#34; American boost &#34; in their pictures. Those producers have a. perfect right, if they so desire, to boost their own country. </para>

              <para>- Yes. We must cot overlook the fact that, in the first instance, those pictures are produced to meet the demands of the home market of over 110,000,000 people in the United States of America. Australia, with her 6,000,000 people, receives only the spillover, as it were. I do not think that we are wise to indulge in a tirade of abuse against the producers of pictures in the United States of America. They are following the commercial instinct, and appealing to the home market of their own people. </para>

              <para>- We can endeavour to stimulate Australian production without attacking the American films which  come  here. They come to Australia because there is a market for them here. When we realize the powerful propaganda which the cinema makes possible, and the insignificant proportion of British films exhibited in Australia, it behoves us, not to abuse the Americans, but to do something in the British Empire. In criticizing and denouncing other people when we have the same capacity that they have to produce these things within the British Empire we are wasting our time and beating the air. Within the British Empire is a variety of scenery unequalled by that of any other country. Moreover, in historical associations the Empire is unrivalled.

              <para>- The country surrounding Oodnadatta is as suitable for the making of a film as are the deserts of Arizona. Central Australia provides a setting for a film quite as good as the scenes depicted in many of the films shown in this country. Moreover, into such films could be interwoven happenings as dramatic as any of the exploits of &#34; Bill &#34; Hart. Unfortunately, although these opportunities exist, we do not exploit them; nothing is done. This subject has excited interest throughout the British Empire. At the Imperial Conference of 1926 it was discussed. In the appendix to the Summary of Proceedings the following statement appears on page 403 : - </para>

The cinema is not merely a form of entertainment, but, in addition, a powerful instrument of education in the widest sense of that term; and even where it is not used avowedly for the purpose of instruction, advertisement, or propaganda, it exercises indirectly a great influence in shaping the ideas of the very large numbers to whom it appeals.

            <para>. - Honorable senators will welcome the announcement just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that it is the intention of the Government, if this motion is carried, to appoint a royal commission to inquire into this very important subject. The fact that the Imperial Conference, which has so many matters of vast importance to consider, held that the cinema, as well as the general production of films within the Empire, was of sufficient importance to warrant the appointment of a subcommittee to inquire into the subject, should warrant the Commonwealth in taking action on similar lines, although, necessarily, our action must be restricted in scope to Australia and its immediate surroundings.It is natura&#93; to suppose that the Imperial Conference and its sub-committee viewed the matter from the Imperial stand-point more than from the stand-point of those who view or produce films within the Empire. 1 feel certain that every honorable senator is anxious that more Empire films should be produced and shown in the theatres of the Empire, whether it be in Great Britain itself or in the Dominions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has rightly reminded us of the very great influence these films have upon those who view them. Therefore, from a propaganda point of view, and regarding the matter from the standpoint of the Empire itself, the greater production of films within the Empire should bring about an extension of the influence of the Empire and also help to build up a closer understanding between its various parts. Indeed, in that respect, the cinema has a great future, and that, I take it, was the view of the Imperial Conference in appointing &#39;a sub-committee to consider the question. It was clearly one of the objects the sub-committee itself kept constantly before it in making its investigations, and it was undoubtedly the chief object it had in view when it drew up its recommendation. I feel sure that we can all concur in that recommendation. If it is at all possible for Australia to further film production within the Empire, or even within the Commonwealth, then, of course, it is a very necessary and wise thing for us to do. Already an endeavour has been made to produce films in Australia, but the same charge can be levelled against them as is levelled against most of the pictures imported from America. While interesting, they dealt more or less with the sordidness of life rather than with the higher things to which the Minister has referred. The films I have seen produced in Australia were right enough from a photographic point of view. Perhaps owing, to lack of experience they were not acted as well as films&#39; introduced from overseas, and the settings were perhaps not so good ; but as photographic productions they were good enough for people to look at. My complaint, however, is that the subjects&#39; of the pictures themselves were not good enough. As the VicePresident of the Executive&#39; Council has told us, we have in Australia all the necessary facilities for the production of films that will do something towards elevating the moral tone of the community, and educating the people to higher ideals than perhaps they have to-day; but, so far, the pictures produced  in Australia have fallen lamentably short in that respect. The picture industry in Australia is very large. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> placed his motion on the noticepaper, I went to some little trouble to ascertain its extent. I found, as the Minister has shown to-day, that the figures were staggering in their immen- sity.  Unless one took the trouble to inquire into the subject, one would find it almost impossible to realize just what a huge concern it is in Australia. The Minister has shown that the proportion of films of Empire production shown  in  Australia is not nearly as high as it ought to be. He has also shown what is perfectly true, that even in Great Britain itself the production of films produced within the Empire is not nearly what it ought to be. My latest figures show that only 8 per cent, of the total films exhibited throughout Great Britain are produced within the Empire. The rest are made in America, Germany, and other countries. </para>

              <para>- In other lines of commercialism Britain has not been so backward in production as she seems to be in this direction. I do not know that the British  people are keener to look at films that depict American, or even German life, than they are to see pictures of British life; but it is certainly true that only 8 per cent, of the pictures shown in Great Britain are produced within the Empire. If we can only do something along the lines suggested by the Imperial Conference, or some other lines that may be indicated by the proposed royal commission, to increase the proportion of Empire-produced films shown within the Empire, we shall be doing work of a most important nature, and something really worth while. T. want to place on record the figures I have  gathered relating to the extent of the picture industry in Australia. The capital invested in theatres in 1921 was &#163;6,700,000, quite a large amount, but in 1926, only five years later, the amount had increased to &#163;25,000,000. The number of admissions to picture theatres, of which children formed 8 per cent., was 150,000,000 in 1926, and the wages paid in that year, not for production, but simply in connexion with the exhibition of the films, was &#163;2,500,000. The number of employees in the industry, of whom about half are women, is 25,000. In 1921 the number of picture theatres in Australia was 808. As the Minister has already told us this number had grown to 1,300 in 1926. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I propose now to quote some figures to show how the Australian people patronize the theatres. In 1922-23 the total taxable admissions to theatres were 78,641,951, of which picture theatres made up 46,371,690. The total entertainments tax collected in that year was &#163;252,611. In the following year, 1923-24, the tax oh certain admissions having in the meantime been remitted, the total taxable admissions were 69,738,089, of which picture theatres made up 38,433,908. The total entertainments tax collected was &#163;228,873. In 1924-25 the total taxable admissions increased from 69,738,089 to 77,994,064, of which the picture theatres accounted for 44,691,650, and the total tax collected amounted to &#163;261,826. These figures show the enormous extent of the industry, and indicate the important part that moving pictures play in the daily lives of the people. The total admissions to theatres in Australia during 1926 numbered 150,000,000, and since the population of this country is approximately 6,000,000, this means that a number equalling the total population visit picture shows at least once a fortnight. One realizes that an enormous number of people are reached, not occasionally, but constantly, by means of films, and that a tremendous influence is thus exercised on the minds and daily lives of the people of Australia in common with those of other countries. These figures should make it clear to the Senate that it is important that the Government should have something definite to guide it, when it proposes to take action on the lines of either more effective control or ensuring that the right kind of film shall be exhibited in Australia, and a proper sentiment created by them. The willingness of the Government to appoint a royal commission, if the Senate asks for it, is most commendable, because such a tribunal, if it made its recommendations in accordance with the facts placed before it, would enable the Government, without hesitation to proceed along right lines, feeling that it had the support of the great majority of the people. The Minister has told us the number of films imported into Australia, and the number rejected. The last figures that I have are those for 1925, a year earlier than those quoted by the Minister, and I was surprised to learn that in 1926 the total number of rejects had increased. Evidently there is stronger necessity than ever for the maintenance of the censorship over films in Australia. The Censor is doing splendid work, as many honorable senators are aware. Some considerable time ago we had an opportunity of visiting his office, and of witnessing many of the cuts that had been made. The rejection of many of the films was abundantly justified in the minds of honorable senators who saw the exhibition. It would  be  a disgrace to the Parliament, and the people of Australia, if films such as those seen by us were publicly exhibited. The fact that the Censor has found it necessary to increase the percentage  of  films that have to be totally rejected because it is impossible to cut or improve them, shows a growing tendency throughout the United States of America for picture producers to make films of the character referred to by the Minister. </para>

We do not wish the people of Australia to be entertained by means rf American pictures of a questionable character, and I hope the Film Censorship will maintain the stringent oversight that it is now exercising, making it clear that the dirt and muck that American picture producers are anxious to heap upon Australia will be excluded. I hope that the Senate will agree to the appointment of a commission, because much good would result from  it. The cost of completing its work would be small, in comparison with the good service that it would render to the community. The matter is of such importance that the  Government  realizes that it cannot shirk its responsibility with regard to it.

We must leave that phase of the matter in the hands of the Censor, who, I am satisfied, is doing excellent work in excluding undesirable films. If a commission were appointed,  it  could certainly report upon the nature of the films brought to Australia, and the percentage of British and Australian films to imported pictures, but we already have that information. </para>

          <para class="block">My personal conviction is that before we can hope for any improvement in the direction of encouraging Empire films we must, by legislative action, make it worth while for those with the necessary capital to invest it in the British or Australian film industries. No matter how wise the choice of members of the proposed commission might be, I fail to see that any good result could accrue from its appointment, because the report would deal mainly with the desirability of an increased proportion of Australian  and  British films being shown. We are quite aware of that fact already, because it has been found necessary to appoint a film censorship. It would be wise for the Government to consider the immediate necessity of introducing legislation to deal effectively with the situation. The motion, if adopted, would  result  in a  waste  of money, since all the information  we  need is contained in the Censor&#39;s report. Knowing that, we should do all  we  ca.ii by legislation to encourage the establishment of the industry in Australia rather than rely upon recommendations of&#39; a royal commission, which can give us no forth  pt  information than is already at our disposal. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>REID  (Queensland) f&#34;4.20&#93;.I fail to see what good would result from the carrying of the motion, inasmuch as the information which a royal commission could obtain is already available to us. However, I shall not oppose it, because I realize that, amongst a large section of the people of Australia there is a  very erroneous impression about the position of the film industry. I have been in close touch with a number of picture show proprietors, and have been impressed by their anxiety to place before Australian audiences the very best pictures that can be obtained. The Commonwealth Government is producing a series of films entitled, &#34; Know Your Own Country.&#34; These are always most acceptable to the proprietors of picture theatres. There is no trouble at all about arranging for their screening. In fact, most proprietors would be glad to screen double the quantity if it could be made available to them. Because of the importance of these pictures in educating Australians concerning the industries and resources of Australia, the Government is to be congratulated on its enterprise. I have no hesitation in saying that, from the Empire point of view, the majority of picture theatre proprietors are exceedingly patriotic, and on many occasions go out of their way to obtain good British films. Unfortunately, however, the British filmproducing companies are unable to supply all our requirements. We have just been told that only about 8 per cent, of films imported are of British origin. That, I should say, is just about all that the British companies are producing. We should also bear in mind that all British pictures in the past have not been above reproach. Some, I believe, were even more disgraceful than those produced by American companies and rejected by the Censor. The position may be better to-day. I hope it is, because we all know that the tendency of American companies is to produce films with a strong sex appeal, and with all the thrills and excitement that can possibly be crammed into a picture. There appears to be a wave of degeneracy passing over the whole picture world. The producers explain that they must either tu&#171;n out the films that the public demand or go out of the business. The majority of these companies, I believe, would be willing enough to produce a good film of the highest moral tone if it would pay from a commercial point of view; and in my opinion the best way to bring about an improvement is to educate the people to demand a better class of pictures. I said just now that the picture theatre pro prietors in Australia, as a rule, were anxious to show good pictures. One man of my acquaintance went into the business with noble ideals. He was fully persuaded that if he put on the very best pictures obtainable he would do something to educate and uplift the people. He did so; but, unfortunately, found that he was losing money. </para>

            <para>- That is so.  His  financial position became so embarrassing that finally, in conversation with his operator, he expressed the fear that he would soon have to close down.  His  operator, who, apparently, knew more than he did about the public taste, replied, &#34;Not at all. You let me run the show for a month and I will guarantee to make it pay.&#34; My friend agreed to the proposal, and handed over control of the theatre to his operator for a month. This man gave the people the pictures they wished to see - pictures with plenty of &#34;kick&#34; in them - with the result that very quickly the theatre was crowded every night, and it was not long before the proprietor had to enlarge it. We must not lose sight of the fact that the American producers have practically a monopoly of the world&#39;s market, and, with their huge corporations, are in an almost unassailable position. We have been told that 90 per cent, of the pictures shown in Australia are imported from America. That is because America is practically the only market upon which we can draw. Many Continental pictures in their sex appeal are even worse than the worst American productions. It is very regrettable that American films so often entirely misrepresent outstanding features of British history, with the result that the rising generation in every country where these pictures are shown get an entirely wrong conception of Britain&#39;s important historical events. I am sure that if this royal commission is appointed the picture theatre proprietors of Australia will do all they can to assist it: The Australian climate is one of the best in the world for film production. There is, perhaps, just a little too much sunshine - the light, perhaps, is sometimes a little too strong. An advantage en joyed by American companies is the almost unrivalled climate of California for picture making. In England, on the other hand, the atmosphere is so dense that producers have to depend to a large extent upon artificial lighting. This increases overhead expenditure and adds to the difficulties of the photographers. The Minister has done well to remind us that Britain is not only rich in historical events suitable for screen production, but has a vast literature full of strong, healthy dramatic situations, as well as of magnificent scenery, upon which film producers could draw to advantage. It would appear, however, that at present there is a shortage of star artists, and that it is difficult to entice them from America. One British company that started with a substantial backing of capital found that it could not compete on satisfactory terms with the American corporations. Our only chance appears, therefore, to be along the lines of Empire co-operation.  I  referred just now to the unfortunate effects which, from an Empire point of view, American films had on certain peoples of the Empire. This is particularly noticeable in India, where many American pictures give Indian audiences an entirely wrong impression of Western life and Western civilization. These pictures are doing much to injure the prestige of Great Britain in India, because so often they present wholly demoralizing features of . our social life. There is no better means of educating the people from an historical, social, and moral point of view than is offered by moving pictures. There is not the slightest doubt that if the moral tone of the people were raised there would be a corresponding improvement in the pictures produced. The picture companies would . at once cater for the improved public taste. To a large extent the blame for the present unsatisfactory state of affairs rests, not upon picture theatre proprietors, but upon their patrons. Another factor that should not be lost sight of was mentioned by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> Australian audiences demand two feature pictures each night, whereas in other countries the practice is to put on only one feature picture, filling up the programme with other suitable items. This practice of presenting two feature pictures is responsible for the shortage of uniformly good films. There is no doubt, also, that some, at least, of the Australian-made films have not been altogether desirable; they have portrayed Australians as so many cowpunchers and bushrangers. We have magnificent scenery, and good light for film production, and there is not the slightest doubt that, if we could produce pictures with a good background, they would be acceptable to other countries. Pictures filmed in Australia for Australian audiences only will never be profitable, because our own market is too limited. The American companies with a population of nearly 120,000,000 to cater for,, produce pictures for American audiences with the result that other countries have to be content with the class of picture that the home market favours. We cannot expectto fight the American syndicates unless we link up in an Empire project, because American corporations have not only secured the services of almost every artist that is worth picking up, but have a splendid climate for outdoor photography, and, with their gigantic scheme of distribution, are in a position to supply the requirements of the world. But I am not pessimistic. I believe that if we approach the subject in a commonsense way, we shall be able to evolve a scheme for Empire production that will, to some extent, at all events, give us pictures that will take the place of some of the American films. I hope that the commission, if appointed, will be successful in achieving this object. </para>

            <para>. - The few observations that I wish to make on this subject are not in the direction of encouraging the proposal to appoint a royal commission, because I am afraid that that would be not merely costly, but an absolute, waste of money. Rather do I think that the remedies lie along the lines of increasing and tightening the picture film censorship by giving the censors more power, and by providing more funds for the department so as to enable it to exercise its functions much more liberally than is possible at present. I hope it will not be thought that I am complaining of the film censorship. I feel that its work has been exceedingly well done,  but very often it is a matter of trying to make bricks without straw. I believe that the censors want more assistance and more money to enable them to discharge their duties with complete satisfaction to all concerned. The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> omitted to mention one very pertinent point in discussing the quality of the American pictures presented to Australian audiences. I refer to the descriptive language used in connexion with them. It is not a language, but a hybrid sort of thing which is particularly demoralizing in its effects on our young people. I should like the film censorship to devote its energies in a restrictive sense to this descriptive matter. It is not typical of any language with which we are acquainted. We have enough slang of our own without importing in this way the dregs of American slang: Whether a royal commission is permitted to function, or whether we increase the powers of the censorship, some effort should be made to deal with this evil, which is crying out for a remedy. Another objection that I have to American pictures is the liberties which the producers take with the original book, or the historical incident on which a picture is baaed. Those who have witnessed pictures founded upon good stories or historical events will admit that, in almost every instance, extraordinary liberties are taken. I believe the position has now become so acute that English authors in disposing of the film rights in any book written by them are insisting upon an inspection of the picture before it is publicly screened. That, of course, is a matter which we cannot control; the remedy lies with the authors themselves. It is very annoying to readers of a good original story to see it mutilated, as is so often the case, when it is reproduced on the screen. </para>

          <para>I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had to say on the subject of unfair criticism. There has been far too much criticism of that nature concerning pictures displayed in this country. Objections have been taken in some quarters that were not apparent to the average&#39; picture theatre patron. Honorable senators will recall, for instance, the way in which a picture entitled &#34; The Big Parade &#34; was criticized in the Senate last year. I saw the picture, and, in my opinion, the attack made upon it was quite unjustifiable. It was declared to be anti-British, and foreign to British sentiment. As a matter of fact, it was merely a pretty love story. The hero happened to be an American soldier in the Great War, and consequently he had to be depicted attached to an American battalion, and following it through its various activities at the Front. I cannot imagine how the story could be construed as being contrary to British sentiment, or as belittling the British Army. These are criticisms to which I was glad to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> take exception. I have also heard during this debate criticisms levelled against certain Australian productions. The Australian pictures I have seen have been based on good dramatic stories with a good moral tone; they have been exceedingly well photographed, and the women appearing in them have dressed as attractively as those appearing in any American production. I witnessed one a little while ago - at the moment I forget the title - in which there was a mannequin parade, and some of the dresses were very beautiful. I have not seen anything more attractive in any American film. When we can produce pictures of that character, and since our women-folk are quite as attractive as those shown in American films, it is our duty to do all we can to encourage the Australian picture industry. I do not see, however, that any assistance in that direction can be given by the appointment of a royal commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> put his fingers on the weak spot in our efforts to build up the picture-film industry when he said that the Australian picture producers have not the vast distributing area that the Americans have. The Americans secured control of the world&#39;s market during the war, and it will take a good deal of effort to wrest that control from them. Working in conjunction with other portions of the Empire, however, we should be able to secure a wider distribution, and in time should get our share of the world&#39;s distribution. </para>
          <para>I have heard some damaging comments on British pictures; but I have not seen any to which justifiable exception could be taken. I recently saw one based on Ian Hay&#39;s play, &#34; The Happy Ending.&#34; It is one of the most beautiful </para>
          <para class="block">I have witnessed for a long time, and bears more than favorable comparison with the best American films. .British producers are as fully conversant with the position as we are, and are making a determined effort to recapture the place they occupied in the cinema trade before  the  war. That being the case, I hope to see, before very long, a very much wider distribution of British pictures in Australia, &#91;t is open to the States to assist to that end by allowing only a percentage of foreign pictures into Australia. That may be done by the States, although not by the Commonwealth. I understand that efforts have been made in that direction, and if something definite is done, it will be very helpful. I do not think, however, that the proposed royal commission would get us anywhere at all. I suggest that we save the cost, which would be not only considerable, but an absolute waste, and devote a much smaller sum to strengthening the hands of the film censorship by giving it the additional financial assistance which it undoubtedly requires. </para>

            <para>. I feel that something ought to be done to encourage the film-making industry in Australia. Recently, I have been in conversation with some of the American producers, who have told me definitely and clearly that they know of no country in the world where better pictures can be produced than in Australia. They tell me that they expend many thousands of pounds in America in creating artificial scenes that are actually in being in Australia. Undoubtedly, our natural advantages are many, but the point is that we cannot produce pictures without the expenditure of a considerable sum of money. In order to secure a return for the capital outlay, Australian producers require to build up a well-organized method of distribution. There are two important factors to the success of the industry in the Commonwealth. The first is that the technique shall be correct, and the second is a satisfactory distribution. Australian film-makers find it most difficult to arrange for a wide distribution of their pictures when they have been produced; and if the proposed royal commission can do anything to assist in that direction, its appointment will have my support. It is very difficult for an Australian picture producer to arrange for his films to he shown, at a series of theatres. </para>

              <para>- There is no doubt that contracts are entered into twelve months in advance of requirements. Those conducting picture theatres naturally wish to arrange their programmes well ahead, and unless a producer is able to offer a regular supply of suitable pictures, the theatre proprietors are not prepared to negotiate with him. If the picture industry could he successfully established in Australia it would be a great advantage to the Commonwealth, not only from a financial view-point, but also in advertising Australia throughout the world. The difficulty confronting the proposed royal commission is to arrange for Australian producers to enter a scheme of world distribution. The American scheme cost the producers a vast sum of money. If it were possible to get into that distribution, and to show all over the world Australian films depicting life and scenery in Australia and in the islands surrounding Australia, it would be wonderfully advantageous to the Commonwealth. I think it could be done. A royal commission  could decide if it were possible- </para>

I am at a loss to understand how the film censorship alone could ever help to build up tha local industry. If a commission is ap-  pointed, I trust that it will devote its energies to the development of a scheme to encourage the production of Australian films, and their distribution throughout the world. If that could be achieved, it would be of immense benefit, not only to the local film industry, but to the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>

We have been told that many of the imported films shown in Australia are not fit to be screened. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> and other honorable senators said that, generally speaking, many of them relate to sex problems, and are what the Ministei described as &#34; spicy.&#34; 1. do not, however, think that that is so.

I recall, for instance, such pictures as &#34; The Ten Commandments&#34; and &#39;&#34;Over the Hill.&#34; If the commission is to be empowered to inquire into the class of picture shown in Australia, its scope should be extended so that it may inquire into the type of plays produced here. Some of them are in every way worse than any of the moving pictures shown. </para>

              <para>- Yes, the play &#34; White Cargo &#34; depicts the worst phases of tropical life. There is nothing elevating in it. The principal characters are a depraved individual who has spent some time in the tropics, a  drink-soddened  doctor, and a half-caste harlot. If the time has arrived when a royal commission should be appointed to inquire into the class of pictures screened in Australia, then the commission should also inquire into the moral effect on the public mind of the &#34; sex &#34; plays which are finding their way on to the Australian stage. Most of them, by the way, are coming from America. I read in the press to-day that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">Matheson Lang, an actor manager of great prominence in London, said, on returning from <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> York, that most of the plays being produced on Broadway were nothing but filth. Only a few days ago a prominent actress came to this country from America, bringing with her a play that was remarkably well acted, but which, in common with many others produced nowadays, dealt largely with the sex problem. The dialogue in some plays is far more demoralizing than actions depicted on the picture screen. A hostile attack seems to have been made by a section of the community upon picture shows, and picture shows only. The reason, I suppose is that it is the only form of entertainment available to the poorer sections of the community. If it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> intention - and that of others who I understand are supporting him - that it shall be the duty of the commission to inquire into the type of films being screened here, investigation should also be made into the plays which are being produced on the Australian stage. I do not think that the people of Australia are particularly desirous of seeing that class of picture, but, unfortunately, many such films are presented to Austraiian audiences. Yet other films of an  entirely different type have been well supported by the public. In a speech recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart</inline> Doyle stated that two of the most successful films shown in the &#34;United States of America were produced in Great Britain. He added that American showmen were most anxious to obtain British films, so long as they were of the type that the people desired. Producers, distributors, and showmen, are anxious to place upon the screen the type of picture which the public desires to see. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> referred to a picture showman who failed to make a success of his enterprise, but I am of the opinion that his lack of success was due to the class of picture which he xhibited. </para>

              <para>- Evidently, he made a bad selection. While attacks are continually being made on those engaged in the motion picture industry, it must be remembered that they are doing much to provide a cheap form of entertainment for the people. Many persons in the community who are unable to afford the high prices charged for admission to the ordinary theatres, are able to pay the smaller fee necessary to obtain entrance to a picture theatre. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> statement that many of the pictures arriving in Australia are not fit for exhibition, is a reflection on the censors. While some claim that the censorship is too harsh, Others criticize the censors for permitting certain pictures to be shown. Unfortunately, the censorship is sometimes applied in the wrong direction. Some time ago, I had the privilege of seeing in Parliament House, Sydney, a picture entitled, &#34; Fit to Win.&#34; This picture, which was exhibited at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur,</inline> who has been engaged in combating venereal and other diseases in New South Wales, was not produced as a means of entertainment, but to demonstrate the terrible ravages caused by the red plague. Yet, permission to show that picture was refused by the censor. I desire to emphasize that the censorship of picture films is within the control of Parliament. Should it be deemed desirable to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the class of picture exhibited, its scope should be extended to enable inquiries to be made also into the character of the plays acted upon the Australian stage. </para>

              <para>- I am desirous that the moving picture industry should be de veloped in the British Empire, and particularly in Australia, and therefore have noted with pleasurethat recently the British Government introduced legislation making it compulsory for picture showmen in Great Britain to screen a certain percentage of films produced within the Empire. </para>

              <para>- We must remember that they were severely handicapped by the Great War. While they were engaged in making munitions, the great American film making corporations availed themselves of the opportunity to capture the market. The same is true of the film producers of France. I understand that Pathe Freres were the pioneers of the film industry, but the war intervened, with the result that they have practically gone out of business. It is only now, nine years after the termination of the war, that Great Britain is beginning to make any headway towards recovering her lost trade. If the appointment of a royal commission will assist her to do so it should be appointed. Any criticism in which I have indulged has been with the desire that the commission, when appointed, may be able to do something useful. One of the first matters dealt with by the Queensland branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers League of Australia when it was formed was that of picture films. Repeated requests were made that showmen should be compelled to present to their audiences a proportion of pictures produced within the Empire. At that time  it was impossible to accede to their request, for the reason that the British film industry was then scarcely in existence. It was pointed out at the time that the influence of the American pictures shown in Australia was so great that the average Australian child was more familiar with White House at &#34;Washington than with the seat of the Australian Legislature. </para>

            <para>.- The Government is to be commended for suggesting the appointment of a royal commission. The belief is becoming popular in Australia that Great Britain should have its due share of the great industry of picture production. It is no doubt true that America became established iu this particular industry during the war, when Britain was engaged in that great struggle; with the result that it now produces about  90  per cent, of the pictures of the world. If the proposed royal commission can stimulate the production of Australian or even British pictures, it will attain the object we have in view. The statement has frequently, been made that it is difficult to find a market for pictures. It is one of the advantage* possessed by the American producers that they have first of all their local market among the teeming millions of the United States of America, from whom they derive great profit, after which they gather extra profit from the overflow of their pictures to the rest of the world. For these reasons America can produce films on a more expensive and extensive scale than is possible in Great Britain. In the northern portion of Victoria we entered into negotiations for the production of  a  picture relating to our district and our industries, and we were promised  1,000  feet for  &#163;70.  Four reels were to be turned out, one of which was to be displayed in Australia, while two of the others were to go to America, and the fourth was to go to Great Britain. We were practically promised that the picture would have a world-wide display at a cost to us of  &#163;70,  and this fact demonstrates the possibility of Australia developing an overseas market for its films. The popularity of the American film is undoubted; but I think that we can create among our own people a desire for Australian or British films by legislating on the lines that theatre proprietors must display a certain percentage of Empire films. By this means, the business may be developed, and eventually, when the demand for our own pictures is created, it may no longer be necessary to continue the restrictive legislation I have suggested. The proposed royal commission should inquire into the possibility of producing pictures in Australia, and evidence might be taken as to means of stimulating the efforts of those who would care to embark upon this industry. We have magnificent scenery in Australia that could well be depicted on the screen. Dramas could easily be shown in such  a  setting, and thereby pictures of  a  very desirable character could be produced. The royal commission might inquire into many phases of the question, and also, as suggested, into the production of plays, with the idea of purifying the Australian stage and leading to the presentation of plays worth seeing - plays of an educational value, which we would not be afraid to let our children see.  I  commend the Government for its  desire  to build up  and  purify the film industry, and I feel sure that if the Senate agrees to the motion, a considerable amount of good will result. </para>
