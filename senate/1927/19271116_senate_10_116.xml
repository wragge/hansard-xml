            <para>- In the Senate last Friday the Leader of the Government in the Senate was asked whether the Senate would have a further opportunity to consider and discuss the proposed sale of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and in reply he said &#34;Yes.&#34; . In another place, however, when the Prime Minister was asked a similar question bis reply was that as the motion of want of confidence had dealt with the whole question, no further opportunity would he given to the House of Representatives to discuss the proposed sale of the Line. I should like to know how the Leader of the Government in the Senate  canreconcile his  reply  with that given by t  he Prime  Minister, and which reply  we  are  to  take as our guide  in  this  all  important matter? </para>

          <para class="block">It seems to me that this is the best opportunity that presents itself to me to bring under the attention of the Government and the people of Australia, the condition of the timber industry of the Commonwealth. I feel sure that I shall be supported by honorable senators. During the last three or four years the position of the timber industry has frequently been brought before the Minister by members of this Parliament and of the Tasmanian Parliament. Since 1921, when, as the result of an inquiry by the Tariff Board, some assistance was given to the timber industry, no further relief has been granted. Last year, in reply to representations made to him, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> said that sufficient evidence had not been produced to justify the matter being resubmitted to the Tariff Board. Previously that board had reported that, in its opinion, further protection was not necessary. About this time last year a further deputation waited on the Minister, who then stated that he was satisfied that a ca se had been made out for a further review of the matter by the Tariff Board. The Tariff Board instituted an . inquiry and, I understand, submitted its report early this year. We are now almost at the end of the year, yet nothing has been done, nor do we know the Government&#39;s intentions. Unless something is done quickly, an important Australian industry will be lost. The timber industry is entitled to the same protection that is given to other Australian industries. </para>
          <para class="block">Its present unsatisfactory condition is largely the result of legislation passed by this Parliament. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides for the making of awards as to the rates of pay and other conditions which shall operate in various industries in Australia. Under that legislation, Australian seamen and waterside workers have been granted liberal rates of pay. In addition, the ^Navigation Act has conferred further benefits on Australian seamen and has governed the freights which may be charged by vessels plying in Australian waters. I do not say that the awards made on behalf of our sailors and waterside workers are inequitable; but the fact remains that, because of a lack of similar protection to sawmillers, the timber industry, which at one time was flourishing, is now in a parlous condition. Under our national policy of protection, almost the whole of the machinery and other equipment used by sawmillers is made in Australia, with the result that their cost has been increased by from 25 to 50 per cent. Had the same protection been given to the timber industry that has been granted to other industries it would not now be in a languishing condition. </para>

              <para>- Realizing the need for further development in Australia, the Government appointed a Development and Migration Commission to inquire as to the best means of developing our industries, and of making provision for migrants. Yet it has neglected an established industry. The production of Australian hardwoods is steadily decreasing, with the result that the number of mill-hands employed in the timber industry to-day is not more than half what it was in 1924. Probably one-half of our sawmills have ceased operating; yet the quantity of imported timbers imported each year has been steadily on the increase. Australia now imports about 500,000,000 feet of timber annually, whereas in 1921 we imported only 242,000,000 feet. Notwithstanding our increased population and the consequent further demand for timber, the Australian timber industry has not benefited. The increased demand has been met by further importations. The heavy freights on timber from Tasmania to the mainland has militated against the industry. It costs from 30 to 40 per cent, more to convey timber from Tasmania to Australian . mainland ports than to bring it from Baltic ports. Timber from Canada can be conveyed to Sydney for less than it takes to carry it from Tasmania to Sydney. The freight on timber conveyed from Cairns to Melbourne is Ss. 6d. per 100 feet compared Avith 3s. lOd. per 100 feet for timber brought from Baltic ports in sailing vessels, or 5s. if shipped by steamers. Timber in 20-ft. lengths can be conveyed from Hobart to Melbourne at from 5s. 3d. to 5s. 9d. per 100 feet. The rate for 40-ft. lengths of timber carried from Launceston to Melbourne is 7s. per 100 feet; from Sydney to Melbourne it is 4s. 9d. ; from Perth to Melbourne, 7s. 2d.; from Brisbane to Melbourne, 6s. 6d. Prom Canada to Port Adelaide the freight is 6s., and from Baltic ports to Port Adelaide, 3s. 10d. Prom Tasmania to Port Adelaide it is 8s.; and for 30-ft. lengths, 9s.; and 40-ft. lengths, lis. These figures show that the rates between Australian ports range from 25 per cent, to 50 per cent, above freights from Baltic ports to Australia. </para>

              <para>- That might have some bearing on the discrepancy, but usually timber freight is determined by measurement. Recently the Minister for Trade and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> paid a visit to Great Britain and, on his return, indicated that the prospects of establishing new industries in Australia were particularly bright. The Government should also show some concern for the welfare of existing industrial concerns, . such as the timber industry. It is regrettable that the timber industry has practically been ruined as the result of legislation passed by this Parliament. If the protection given to other secondary industries had been extended to the sawmilling industry of Australia, it would have been in a flourishing condition to-day. &#34; </para>

              <para>- Ihave already mentioned the effect on the business of the awards of the Arbitration Court, which of course have been determined by the Australian standard of living. The Navigation Act also has operated against the success of the timber industry, which is further handicapped by the increased cost of imported saw milling machinery due to high protective duties. A considerable amount of capital invested in the industry has been lost. To be consistent, Parliament should extend to it the same measure of protection that is given to other forms of secondary enterprises. </para>

Its position has been under consideration by the Tariff Board for a long time. The report of that body has been in the hands of the Minister for the last nine months, and yet we are not informed as to the nature of its recommendation. </para>

              <para>- That may be so; but if the timber industry is not tor. enjoy the benefits of protection equally with other industries, then our fiscal policy is a very lopsided one. The timber industry means a great deal to Tasmania. Owing to intense overseas competition it is languishing not only in Tasmania, but also in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland. Just before the Senate adjourned in March of this year I asked if it would be possible for the Government to table . the report of the Tariff Board so that those engaged in the industry might know what was likely to happen. The honorary Minister then indicated, perhaps with some justification, that he had not had an opportunity to read the report, which consisted of 100 pages, but said that it would receive attention at the earliest opportunity. In reply to a question asked the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes, he said that the reports of the Tariff Board were not received until September, which to me seemed most extraordinary, as he had previously said that they had been received in March or at the latest, early in April. I have submitted these few facts in an endeavour to place the position fairly before the Senate, and I trust that other honorable senators will express their views on this subject which is of vital importance not only to the State of Tasmania, but to the whole Commonwealth. </para>

All I can say at this juncture is that the Tariff Board&#39;s reports on the timber industry have been received by theGovernment, and are now receiving very careful consideration. Even if a decision had been reached upon this subject, I am sure honorable senators would not expect me to disclose it on a motion of this nature. I can assure honorable senators, however, that the matter is receiving the earnest and sympathetic consideration of the Government, and when a decision has been reached there will be no delay in bringing it before Parliament. </para>

            <para>. - I agree with the premises laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays; but I do not agree with his conclusions as. to the remedy. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)has,</inline> I understand made it. clear that he considers the only way out of the difficulty is to amend the tariff schedule. I do not think that that would be of any advantage. It would only mean increasing the artificiality of the position, and that could not possibly be of any benefit. The coastal provisions of the Navigation Act are the worst enemy which the timber industry in Tasmania and &#34;Western Australia has ever had, and there is no doubt that a repeal of those provisions would result in great benefit to the timber industry. Western Australia has not felt the position as much as Tasmania, because, luckily, until a year ago, the timber industry in that State was extensively engaged in exporting to South Africa. Since the Navigation Act was proclaimed the trade in jarrah with the eastern States, which represented a large proportion of Western Australia&#39;s timber exports, has languished on account of the excessive freights which the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act necessitate. Those provisions have also affected Tasmania&#39;s interstate trade. </para>

              <para>- The Commonwealth Shipping Board has always been opposed to entering into or interfering with the interstate trade. Even if it had not, it is unlikely that any help could have been obtained from that source. Having once been associated with the timber trade of Western Australia, I know as an actual fact that the freights charged between Fremantle and any of the eastern States are absolutely ridiculous and untenable when compared with those charged between Portland Oregon, and Australia, or Scandinavia and Australia. Under these conditions I have again to saythat unless we come to our senses the Commonwealth will be foolishly building up a wall which will eventually isolate it from the rest of the civilized world. If we are to secure our share of the world&#39;s trade we should not create such artificial barriers as we have in the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act. The Public Accounts Committee has found it necessary, in three of its reports, to protest against the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act, and I repeat that if these provisions are retained it will be impossible for Australia to compete on fair terms with the outer world. If the Navigation Act is to remain in operation in its present form., it would be better for the Government to pay the few Australian seamen employed in the coastal trade to remain idle in order that those engaged in commerce should have a fair chance of conducting their daily avocations without restrictions such as that act imposes. I agree with what has been said concerning the state of the timber industry in Australia, and in my opinion the only remedy is the one I have indicated. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Herbert</inline>Hays deserves the thanks of not only those directly interested in timber production in Australia, but the whole of the Australian people for bringing this matter before the Senate. It must be recognized that a valuable asset such as our timber resources should be utilized to the fullest possible extent. I know a good deal concerning the forests of Australia and the saw-milling industry, particularly in Tasmania, and I have no hesitation in saying that during the last few years, Australia has lost millions of pounds owing to handicaps imposed upon the industry. After a tree reaches a certain age it ceases to become a useful commercial commodity. There are in Australia to-day hundreds of thousands of beautiful trees which have outlived their usefulness owing to the widening of the vicious circle referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill.</inline> The conditions imposed have deprived the industry of the opportunity to work in the interests of the community. It is a fact, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays has observed, that more than 50 per cent. of the sawmills in Australia have closed clown. Every effort that was humanly possible was made twelve or eighteen months ago by those who are interested in the preservation of the industry and the welfare of the thousands of persons who are dependent upon its continuance to have a favourable decision arrived at  by the Government so that it would be enabled to continue. Scores of mills within my own personal knowledge were at that time in such a position that the management had to receive a quick assurance of the necessary protection if they were to carry on. Since then many mills have closed, and large numbers of workmen have been added to the ranks of the unemployed. </para>

              <para>- I am pleased to have the assurance of the Minister that this matter will receive the very early attention of the Government. I endorse the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays respecting the fairness of giving a primary industry of this character consideration equal to that which has been meted out to many of our secondary industries, which have been maintained by a liberal measure of protection. So far as I have been able to gather, it has received very much less protection. The future of Australia is dependent upon the maintenance of our primary rather than of our secondary industries. This, of all industries, is conducive to the welfare of the community. Our hardwoods are noted all over the world for their lasting qualities. That should convince  our people of the advisability of using them wherever possible in preference to imported softwoods. At the present time, wherever one looks one finds that softwoods which have been imported from Scandinavia or the United States of America are used for purposes for which Australian  hardwoods  are much more suitable, if they could be produced and delivered on the spot at a price that will compete with importations. Why can they &#39;not be deliveredat this price? Simply because the freight from Tasmania to the mainland is considerably in excess of that which is charged on timber from Scandinavia- or the United States of America and the absence of adequate protection. We have the assurance of those who are at the head of the industry that they are asking for additional protection not with the object of increasing the price, but in order that they may be able to compete with the timber which is imported from overseas, and continue the work on which they were engaged so successfully until a couple of years ago. </para>

              <para>- Many of the purposes to which the imported softwoods are applied could be better served by the use of Australian hardwoods. I hope the outcome of this discussion will be that the Government will take up the matter in all seriousness. We want to know whether the industry is to be saved for Australia, or abandoned. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> that eventually it will be necessary to consider whether there should not be-some measure of relief in regard to freights. But we cannot afford to wait until Parliament has had the time to deal with that farreaching problem ; action must be taken before this part of the session closes, so that Ave  may be assured of the revival of the industry in not only Tasmania but also the other States of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>. - The importance of this matter cannot be over-rated. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays that the onus, lies upon the Government to render every assistance that lies within its power to preserve and to assist the timber industry of Australia. I cannot, however, follow the honorable senator in this argument that the present parlous condition of the industry is the result of awards of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> has introduced a further feature. He has launched an attack on the coastal trading sections of the Navigation Act, and has pooh-poohed the idea that protection - no matter to what extent - would be of assistance to the timber industry.  His  argument appeared to me to be that no matter what protection was given, the existence of the coastal trading sections of the act would prevent the escape of the industry from its present parlous condition. </para>

              <para>- I do not. There are two vital points for consideration - first, the conditions under which men are employed in the timber industry; and, secondly, the conditions of the men employed on. the ships that convey the timber to the markets of the world. The coasting provisions of the Navigation Act have stood the test of time, and I hope that the day is far distant when this Parliament will repeal them. It is true that on one or two occasions the. present Government has interfered with them, and particularly for the benefit of Tasmania; but, in my opinion, their excision would make the conditions of the seamen on the Australian coast worse than those under which British seamen work. I hope, therefore, that whatever step the Government takes to give assistance to the timber industry in Australia it will not be in the direction of evading the awards of the Arbitration Court, which, no matter how much the Government might desire it, could scarcely be done; or in the direction of repealing the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act which afford protection to Australian seamen. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> I think that the real remedy lies between the two courses suggested during the course of the debate. My voice and my vote have always been given for a protective policy to foster and preserve Australian industries; but there is a middle course between the imposition of high protective duties and the course which we are to infer was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays in his reference to arbitration awards; or the other course suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill;</inline> the repeal of the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act. The middle course is, in my opinion, a greater display of patriotism by the people of Australia. Do the people of Australia afford to the timber industry the assistance they should give it? I venture to say that Australian hardwoods are equal to Oregon in any position underground or above ground. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Verran</inline> can bear me out that in mining, at any rate, they are equal to oregon underground. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> touched upon the vital point when he said that the people of Australia do not give sufficient preference to Australian timbers. </para>

              <para>- I have no illusions about what it costs the Australian citizen to give preference to his own products. But if we have that true Australian patriotism and sentiment about which we boast, we ought to be prepared to pay a little more for the timber we use in building our homes, for the commodities we consume, or for the clothes we wear, in order to afford protection to Australian industries. Between the proposal relating to arbitration awards and that relating to the incidence of the tariff there is the factor of lack of patriotism to our own products. </para>

              <para>- I have no desire to misrepresent the honorable senator. All I said was that the inference to be drawn from his remarks, standing by themselves, was that the only remedy was a reduction of wages in the timber industry. I cannot entertain for a moment the suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> that the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act should be repealed. All I can say, in conclusion, is that I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays that if the industry is in the condition he has described the only policy to pursue isto give it the mantle of protection accorded to other industries. </para>

            <para>. - I have a great deal of sympathy with the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays has in view, because Tasmania and Western Australia are not the only States in which a great many timber mills have been closed down as a result of the importation of foreign timber. In the New England, North Coast, and other districts of New South Wales hundreds of mills are closed down from the same cause. I feel, therefore, that I should say something on this matter, more particularly upon the suggested remedies. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> seemed to suggest that the only remedy is to increase the&#39; tariff. But I see very grave danger in adopting that course. </para>

The only reason for increasing the duty on timber would be to make imported timber so much dearer that the people would buy Australian timber because it would be cheaper, or, at any rate, would cost no more than imported timber.

              <para>- If it pleases honorable senators I can put it in another way. In view of the fact that the Government, and the party behind it, in. spite of the Opposition, contemplate embarking upon a great scheme of home building throughout Australia, anything that would have the effect of increasing the cost of that scheme must have careful consideration. The average cost of a home under the Government scheme will be &#163;1,000. I think it is a safe deduction to allow 25 per cent., . or &#163;200 for the average cost of the land upon which the home is built. An increase of 5 per cent. in the cost of timber - it is not an exaggerated allowance to make - would mean adding, in round figures, &#163;400,000 to the cost of a scheme estimated on present prices to involve an expenditure of &#163;10,000,000. </para>

              <para>- The fact that softwoods are competing with hardwoods has the effect of keeping prices down. If the prices of softwoods are increased the prices of hardwoods will automatically increase. An increase of &#163;400,000 in the cost of carrying out the Commonwealth Government scheme would mean that  between 700 and SOO less bornes could be built. In these circumstances, therefore, any suggestion to increase the duty on timber as a remedy for the present condition of the timber industry of Australia, should have very careful scrutiny before it is adopted. The other suggestion that the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act should be repealed so far as the carriage of timber is concerned, or generally, is much more feasible. It would enable the Australian producers of hardwoods to compete more successfully with imported timber. But there is another suggested remedy upon which I should like the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays, who knows more about the matter than I do. My knowledge of timber is culled from various sources and from information disclosed before the Tariff Board and other bodies. But the information I have is that the output per man in Australia, even under immensely increased wages costs, is to-day less than it was in years gone by when&#34; production costs were not so high, and is very much less than the output per man in other countries. If that is true, it seems almost impossible for our timber to compete with the timber of other countries. Evidence has been given to show that the output per man is 1S3 super, feet in Australia, as compared with SOO super, feet in America. Of course, in one case the men are handling softwood, which is easy to work, and in the other case they are handling hardwood. </para>

              <para>- No.&#39; New South Wales does not produce hardwood to the same extent as Tasmania and Western Australia do. The timber industry has reached that stage where those engaged in it must &#34; root, hog, or die.&#34; Every one engaged in it - both proprietor and worker - should get right into the collar and do his best to save the industry. They should not continually approach Parliament or the Tariff Board for further protection, although they would probably be justified in seeking a modification of the Navigation Act. The repeal of certain sections of the act might have a beneficial effect on the industry. In its report the Tariff Board speaks of the &#34; abuse of protection,&#34; meaning that protection causes further charges to be made for goods, resulting in further requests for higher wages, and so on. That policy will not help the timber industry,  which I desire shall be placed in a sounder position than it occupies to-day, so that those engaged in it will not have to suffer further because of heavy importations of timber; but it would not be wise to increase the cost of timber so as to make it more difficult for persons to secure their own homes. </para>

              <para>- I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays say that legislation passed by this Parliament had strangled the timber industry. He said that were it not for arbitration awards and wages boards determinations, the industry would to-day be in a flourishing condition. If I were advocating the claims of an industry, I should not say that those engaged in it were not entitled to the same measure of protection as were workers in other industries. For the timber industry to be established on a sound footing, adequate protection, both to proprietors andworkmen must be given. Otherwise, the proposals of the honorable senator are not worthy of our serious consideration. Are honorable senators aware of the industrial conditions that obtain in other countries from which Australia imports large quantities of timber? The lowest wage paid in Canada is 25s. a week for coloured labour. I understand that Asiatics constitute 26 per cent. of the employees in. the industry there, and that the United States of America also employs a considerable proportion of black labour. The lowest wage in that country is 40s.8d. a week. In Sweden the minimum wage for timber workers is 7s, 7d. per day. In Australia it is 83s. a week of 48 hours. Since we have declared in favour of protection we should doall we can to prevent this continuous flow of imported timber to Australia, particularly from those countries which employ black labour.We have given the highest measure of protection to the sugar industry, because we realize that without protection it. would be impossible for Australian sugargrowers to compete against the product of black labour countries. Having protected the sugar-growers we have also declared that the workmen engaged in the industry shall be given a fair deal. Tasmania is not the only state that is affected by this depression in the timber industry. </para>

          <para>SenatorOGDEN (Tasmania) &#91;4.25&#93;.- Whilst I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that the timber industry is an important one in many of the States, it is relatively more important to Tasmania. I am not a disciple of high protection. I am a low tariffist. Unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> I do not believe that high protection is a panacea for all our industrial evils. I know, of course, that it is a convenient doctrine for Labour to advocate, because high protection makes it possible for wages to be increased without regard to the source from whence the money conies. I am, as I said, a low tariffist, and whilst I am diffident about further increasing the cost of timber by raising the duties, I am forced,  by the general tendency to impose high protective duties on other industries, to support the proposal in order that the timber industry may get its share of the plunder. What will be the effect of an increased duty on timber? Immediately the millers cut it, it will pass into the hands of the merchants, who will increase the price to the consumer. Although we may raise the duty another 5s. or 10s. per 100 super. feet, I question very much whether the millers will reap much advantage from the higher duty. I regret that we cannot discuss this issue apart from the party aspect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> raised the question of wages. It is not necessary for me to defend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays, because I think he clearly indicated that there were other considerations. If we have not only Arbitration Court awards, higher costs, and other conditions of employment, which naturally increased the cost of production in an industry, and that industry is not given access to the Tariff Board and a higher duty, the awards of the Arbitration Court become an injustice to that industry according to our present day philosophy. That was, I think what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays intended to convey. But the awards of the court also had relation to other conditions. I know that in Tasmania timber workers had to get wet pay. If in the morning there appeared to be a prospect of a shower the men did not go to work, and yet they had to be paid. </para>

            <para>-Perhaps it is, in view of the fact that members of this Parl i am en t have nice comfortable seats and are paid, wet or dry. Another condition of the award had relation to sick pay. It was not necessary for a man to produce a medical certificate in order to qualify for sick pay. All that was necessary was for him to say that he was not feeling well, and he need not go to work. These were among the conditions that harassed employers in the industry,in Tasmania, where there is so much rain throughout the year; but the provision for payment, wet or dry, which operated for a considerable time has been wiped away. With all due regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> that the Navigation Act has seriously interfered with the timber industry in Tasmania. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> cannot speak without raising that issue.I do not object to the wages the seamen are receiving; but I do object to the creation of a monopoly. The carrying trade between Australian ports is in the hands of Australian shipping companies, which are immune from outside competition. A couple of years ago we endeavoured to ship a small quantity of hardwood flooring boards from Tasmania to Western Australia. There was no vessel on the direct run, so it was necessary to arrange for transhipment from Melbourne, but the cost was so prohibitive that the order could not be sent. We approached the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Board and asked that body if it would kindly allow one of the ships of its Line, which we decided to abolish the other day, to carry the timber, but the board said - &#34;No; we do not engage in the coastal trade; we leave that business to the local shipping companies &#34;. Thisis one of the difficulties of Australian sea transport to-day. The provisions of the Navigation Act make it impossible for outside companies to compete in the interstate trade. I do notwish to be misunderstood. I know that the timber industry in Australia is languishing, but C am at a loss for a remedy. Some honorable senators declare that it is to be found in higher duties. I shall* therefore, support the move for higher duties in the hope that they will remedy the position; but I shall welcome the day when there will be some evidence of a new conscience in this country, and when we shall reconsider our fiscal policy as it affects not, only the timber industry, but all secondary industies. I hope we shall then get back to the good old  days of lower costs of production, freer intercourse between the States, and &#38; more natural state of affairs in industry generally. Is it fair to ask the sawmillers to pay the high rates they are compelled to pay for their machinery owing to the imposition of exhorbitant Customs duties without giving them some compensation in return? This is due to the vicious circle which we have commenced, and which apparently we have to continue. Effective wages are being obtained by imposing still higher duties; hut we can only secure effective wages and provide better conditions by bringing about a natural state of affairs, which will have the result of cheapening the cost of production. The present system is causing unemployment everywhere. </para>

              <para>- Sufficient timber is grown in the Commonwealth to meet nil om&#39; requirements. If we inspected the buildings recently erected at Canberra, we should find that the timber used in the wooden portions consists entirely of Australian-grown timbers, which has  been  well seasoned, and in connexion with which the workmanship is all that could be desired. Whilst that is so, it is an undeniable fact that  Oregon  is imported from America or Canada and landed at any port in Australia at a much cheaper rate than that at which the locally-grown  timber can be obtained. It is also true that Baltic timbers are landed in Australia much cheaper than Australian softwoods can be shipped to any port in the Commonwealth. Scandinavia has  a  high protective policy, and &#39;there timber grows extensively. This timber is easily obtained and handled, and can be shipped to Australia at very low rates, because the vessels carrying it expect to obtain rein.u iterative back loading. If Baltic timbers are to be excluded from the Commonwealth - which, I think, is desirable - we must supply a substitute. It is an outrage and a scandal that a person  who  purchases a home - most persons only buy one in a lifetime - should be compelled to use Baltic timber for flooring purposes, especially when there is no better timber in the world than our Australian hardwoods. Many persons who purchase small bungalows or cottages find that the floors consist; of Baltic timbers, which is  a  great mistake. For that reason alone it is desirable to entirely exclude such timber from the Commonwealth; but &#39;that can be done only  by  an effective protective tariff. That, however, is a policy which the Government is not prepared to adopt. The Government needs Customs revenue in order to protect the landowners of this country from paying direct taxation. It is anxious to  obtain  large sums of revenue through the Customs House, and has little interest in the in- dustries of Tasmania or any other State. It is true that  Oregon,  is. the most suitable of all timbers for certain building purposes, as it does not shrink or warp, which is not a feature  of  Australian hardwoods. </para>

              <para>- If the importation of  Oregon  were prohibited the price of Australian hardwood would immediately advance. I can remember when  Oregon  could be purchased at from 10s. to11s. per 100 feet, and hardwood at about 9s. per 100 feet, but the price today is more than double that figure. The owners oflarge areas on which timber used for commercial purposes is grown substantially benefit by high protective duties, and if we continue imposing higher duties on  Oregon  and other softwoods those who own these areas will continue to benefit. Some honorable senators are strongly opposed to the retention of the coastal provisions of the Navigation Act under which seamen and others obtain a fair wage. These honorable senators believe that their timber should be carried in vessels on which low wages are paid, and that ships registered abroad should be allowed to engage in the Australian coastal trade. I do not think the Government is likely  to  repeal the coastal provisions  of  the Navigation Act. The unemployment  in  Tasmania is largely due to the stupid attitude of the Government of that State. </para>

              <para>- It has, and is an important factor in causing unemployment in that State. Many active young men leave Tasmania to settle on the mainland because of the ridiculous restrictions imposed upon them. It is time the policy of taxing industry was abandoned, and the up-to-date methods of Sydney and Brisbane adopted. If that were done the authorities would find that the population would increase, and that there would be no need to ask for greater protection. I do not think that even this Government, with all its shortcomings, will consent to the repeal of the coastal provisions  of  the Navigation Act. Those honorable senators who have so many complaints to make concerning the position in which Tasmania is placed, should cease to support this Government, which has not  the  slightest interest in the timber or any other industry in that or any other State. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden,</inline> and other supporters of the Government from Tasmania wish to see some reform, they should cease supporting an administration which refuses to afford the State they represent any relief. The  timber  trade in Tasmania is very important. It is important also to the other States. The <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Book</inline> for  1926, page 6926, shows that the sawmill output of native timber in 1924-25  was, in  New South Wales, 162,423,000 feet,  and  in Tasmania, only 50,799,000 feet. </para>

              <para>- I was referring to the Queensland mines; I am not conversant with the conditions that exist in the other States. Every mine  in  Queensland, but particularly the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morgan</inline> mine, which has one of the finest square set systems of timbering in the world, uses hardwood. Queensland possesses remarkably fine hardwoods; it does not give place even to Tasmania in that respect. A celebrated Swedish scientist, after an. inspection of North Queeusland, informed me the other day that that portion of the State had a prodigality of decorative woods that were not equalled  in  any other part of the world.. The protection of the timber industry, but particularly its hardwood section, must have an immediate reaction upon the price of hardwood in Queensland, and render still more difficult the problem of those who are endeavouring to carry on mining operations. A year or two ago, when a. move along similar lines was- made to obtain protection for the timber industry, the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morgan</inline> Gold- Mining. Company Limited voiced a strong protest against it, and stressed the effect which the suggested protection, if granted, would have upon that struggling mine. To-day, unhappily, the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morgan</inline> mine, although still operating, is faced&#39; with the possibility of having to close down. Efforts are being;  made  to avoid that contingency, but they are not likely to be consummated if a further impost is placed- on timber, because it would be but another&#39; - and that the last - straw on the back of the camel. There is also a further aspect of this matter. The royalty which is charged by the Queensland Government; can be described as nothing less than outrageous. I  have-  the impression that  if  the price of timber is increased&#39; in consequence of the imposition of  an  additional duty, the rapacious State </para>

            <para>. -  I was very pleased to hear the Minister, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays, say that this matter is receiving the sympathetic consideration of the Government. I had hoped that it would have arrived at a decision long since ; but in the circumstances I shall make a few observations in the hope that th&#39;ey may lead to a favorable determination respecting the State that I assist to represent. I cordially agree with the remarks of Senators Ogden and Kingsmill regarding the harmful effect of the Navigation Act upon this industry. In passing, I may say tha.t two or three committees and. commissions have investigated the effect of that act, and a majority of their members have decided that the coastal trading sections ought to be repealed. I hope that, concurrently with its decision in relation to the timber industry, the Government will take steps to deal with that act in accordance with what I believe to be the desires of a majority of honorable senators. Sawmilling, in. Tasmania is an extremely valuable industry. The State is not very prosperous.. It does not possess many industries, and its wellbeing is dependent upon the retention of those it now has. It grows some of the finest timber in the world. Its hardwoods are suitable for the construction of the- roughest type of building- as. well as the finest, quality, of furniture. They are adapted to almost any purpose. I should not ask- for increased protection were; it not for the fact that certain, legislation which, this Parliament has enacted renders- it necessary for such assistance to be given as will enable us to market our timber. We have it on the authority of the Conservator of Forests in Tasmania that at the rate of cutting- which was in force, at the time that he made his statement1  -  50,000,000 super, feet per annum - the- supply was sufficient to last1 for 90 years; Because of the closing- down of the mills that quantity is not now being  cut. During that period of 90 years new growth would replace what was cut. I believe that that rate could be doubled and maintained perpetually, on account of the rapidityof the growth. The other clay I asked an official of the Sawmillers&#39; Association to provide me with particulars of the total number of mills in Tasmania, and the number that had been closed down. He assured me that the total was 192, of which 132 had closed down. Many of the latter hold timber leases on which there is a quantity of timber sufficient to enable cutting to proceed for 30 or 40 years. These facts furnish conclusive proof that there is no scarcity of either timber or the mills to handle it. The wastage of timber in the Australian bush has frequently been deplored. That is what is going on in the Tasmanian bush. It is an absolute waste to allow the timber to remain there when it should be marketed.Wastage can be prevented only by cutting. I trust that the Government will take that aspect of the matter into consideration. Tasmanian timber can be used for practically every purpose for which imported timber is employed at the present time. In our cities one may see factories and other large buildings in which there is hardly a stick of Australian timber. That fact was brought strongly home to me in Sydney the other day. Those city folk who most insistently claim adequate protection for their own industries purchase, in the way of timber, the cheapest imported rubbish that they can obtain. That is neither right nor economically sound. I favour an increased duty, not with the idea of raising prices, but to assist the producers of timber. Recently we have heard a great deal regarding the desirability of assisting primary producers. No industry has a greater claim than the timber industry to the description &#34;primary.&#34; Sawmilling is not easy work. Experts have been brought out to direct the operations of the mills, and thousands of pounds have been spent on machinery which is lying idle and going to rust. I hope that action by the Government will not be much longer delayed, and that when it is taken it will be in the direction of giving protection to this highly deserving and long suffering industry. </para>

          <para>SenatorFOLL (Queensland) &#91;5.2&#93;.- Queensland is particularly interested in any legislation that relates to softwoods, because it is the largest producer of that commodity in Australia. The stage has been reached when it is the only State that has pine in any quantity. Before the duty on softwoods is largely increased consideration ought to be given to the position which Australia occupies in the softwood industry. A perusal of the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Book</inline> which was issued at the end of 1926, will show honorable senators that, relatively, Australia&#39;s forest area is lower than that of any other country.For example, the forest land in relation to total area is - in Canada 26.78 per cent., in India 20 per cent., in Sweden 57 per cent., in the United States of America 24 per cent., and in Finland 55.80 per cent. Australia&#39;s forest land is only 1.29 per cent. of her total area, and its scattered nature adds to the cost of production. But for the huge imports of softwoods in recent years we should have been in a very sorry plight. Unfortunately, the Government that has been in power in Queensland for the last twelve years has done nothing except to profiteer in the softwood industry at the expense of the home builder. Queensland home builders are situated differently from those in the other States, by reason of the fact that practically 99 per cent. of the homes in that State are, with the exception of a number of joists and stumps, constructed of softwoods. Consequently, anything which affects that industry must react seriously upon that State. Practically all the softwood forests of Queensland are on Crown lands. Every time additional protection has been given to the softwood industry of Australia, the Queensland Government has taken the opportunity to increase the royalties paid by the timber cutters in its pine country. The exorbitant price that now has to be paid for Queensland pine is due to the fact that the State. Government, not satisfied with increasing the royalties, has adopted the practice of throwing open only small areas of timber lands quite insufficient to meet the requirements of the people of the State, and submitting them to competition at auction. The Government notifies that on a certain date certain areas will be submitted to auction; an upset royalty is fixed, and the timber merchants compete with one another as to the amount of royalty they will pay. The result is that in many cases the royalties they offer are exceedingly high, and the cost of the timber is so high that a softwood house in Queensland costs practically as much as a brick house in the southern States. </para>

              <para>- To-day the royalties paid on the timber amount to more than the price mentioned by the honorable senator. The figures that I shall now quote will give some idea of the way in which the Queensland Government has profiteered. In the year 1920-21 the Government received in royalties from its pine forests &#163;145,S02. In the same year it spent in re-afforestation, and in the administration of the Forestry Department, only &#163;72,718. In 1924-25 the royalties received amounted to &#163;246,641, <inline font-style="italic">mad</inline> the amount spent in re-afforestation and administration was only &#163;60,542. It is quite evident that the Queensland Government is using its pine forests for purely taxation purposes. Although Queensland is the greatest softwood-producing State in Australia, the only thing that has tended to keep softwoods at a reasonable price in that State is the fa&#60;n that large quantities of Oregon and other softwoods are imported from overseas. Had it not been for this importation from overseas, many Queensland sawmills could not have kept going. In fact it  was  brought under my notice a little while ago that many sawmills were getting large quantities of Oregon in the log and sawing them into building lengths. If an additional duty is to be imposed on imported timbers I think it should be restricted to sawn timber. If the logs could come in without paying increased duties, a tremendous amount of work in sawing and dressing would be afforded ro Australian sawmills. In its report, ordered to be printed on 18th September, 1925, the Tariff Board said - </para>

            <para>Now, having in mind the request from the Queensland authorities that a subsidy be paid to the State Governments for reafforestation purposes, when the Government placed into the Consolidated Revenue Fund the very large sums it receives from these very high royalty charges, spending little or nothing itself on re-afforestation: and, further, having in mind the fact that the ad valorem equivalents of the present duties amount to, on different sizes of Oregon timber, from 50 per cent, to 85 per cent.; on Baltic timber from 45 per cent, to 50 per cent.; and on certain furniture timbers from 12^ per cent, to 25 per cent. . . . the following utterance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swain,</inline> Director of the Queensland Forest Service, at a Tariff Board Conference, 28th April, 1924, would be difficult to match for its amazing divergence from facts: - &#34;If the tariff make a national resource of a country worthless, something should be done. That position seems to arise from the fact that, whereas protection is a general policy, timber has not been protected at all. I would like the board to do something to enable us to make this industry prosper.&#34; </para>
            <para>Further comment on such assertions is unnecessary. In the opinion of the Tariff Board any further increase in the tariff on timber used for structural purposes and for furniture would, as far as the State of Queensland is concerned, simply result in an increased cost of building construction and cabinet making as a result of the additional imposts which would be placed upon the saw-milling industry by the State Government acting through its Forestry Department, and in addition by these other factors already described by the Queensland Director of Forests as &#34; profiteers.&#34; </para>

Tasmania needs thousands of cases for the despatch of apples overseas. There has already been a heavy loss on the transport of apples from Tasmania, and any increase in the  cost  of the cases must tend to increase thai loss. </para>

              <para>- There must be, if the duty on timber is increased. When a duty on any article is increased, the cost of the article that comes into com.petiton with it is naturally increased. An increase in the  duty  on timber will increase the cost of <inline font-style="italic">fie</inline> houses to be built under the Commonwealth housing scheme, and if it should be found to be cheaper to build in brick or concrete, the demand for timber will be considerably less. An increase in the timber duties will increase the cost of furniture, and the cost of  boxing  our canned fruits for overseas markets. If we increase the price of timber we shall increase the price of commodities all round, and make it much harder to place Australian produce on overseas markets. </para>

Twelve months ago 176 timber mills, employing 2,030 workmen, were operating in Tasmania. To-day only 1,145 men are engaged iii the timber industry in that State. In the other states the industry is in a similar Condition. I have never contended, as has been suggested during the debate, that increased duties have not resulted in increased prices for commodities. The accepted policy of Australia is one of protection. In furtherance of that policy most of our industries have been granted assistance. I claim that the timber industry is no less deserving than are those other industries which have been assisted. The Government, by appointing a Development and Migration Commission, is seeking to establish new industries in Australia; yet an industry of such great importance as is the timber industry has been allowed to languish. </para>

I do not consider that that or any other industry should be conducted under conditions which amount to sweating. I have merely said that the conditions applying to the industry today have resulted in higher costs, which, an turn, have had their effect upon the industry.

              <para>- I shall deal with that aspect of the matter presently. In operation this statutory rule may prevent an owner of land from using it as he intended originally, and he may have no redress. I doubt whether the act,&#34; passed in May last, authorized the Government to go to this extent. That measure contains no provision empowering the Government to interfere without paying adequate compensation, and I question very much if Parliament intended that the private&#39; rights of persons in land should be so interfered with. </para>

              <para>- Nevertheless, that is what this Government has taken upon itself to do in peace time. There is another serious objection that may be urged against the promulgation of these regulations. If we allow them to stand, the whole of our Torrens system of land registration will practically go by the board. The several States have built up a system of which they are justly proud. They regard the Torrens system of land registration as the best in the world. Under that law any purchaser of land may readily ascertain how the title stands. If there is any encumbrance on land, or if there is any restriction on it in any way, it is shown on the title. It is not even necessary for a man to employ a solicitor. All that he has to do is to obtain the particulars, apply to the Titles&#39; Office, and upon payment of a search fee examine the title for himself. If, by means of these statutory rules, Parliament authorizes the Governor-General to issue proclamations at large, so vitally affecting the enjoyment of land, as this statutory rule purports to do, the position will be a very serious one. Instead of an owner relying upon the title, he will be obliged to employ a solicitor, whose duty it will be to examine minutely all these statutory rules, sheaves of which are passed every year, and even then one might escape his notice, with the result that after having paid a high price for land an owner might be deprived of its full use. </para>

              <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. Some method should be devised to show in every title any such encumbrance on land. It should be possible to make a satisfactory arrangement with the State governments, under which in every case where a proclamation affecting land has been promulgated such restrictions shall be shown on the title. Otherwise there will be endless confusion. A solicitor may in perfectly good faith advise his client that a title is a good one, and the owner of the land in question may erect buildings on it, only to discover later that the land has been affected by a Defence Act regulation. </para>

              <para>- That is so. If there is any restriction in the Crown grant, or a provision as to minerals or the right to resume for railway purposes, it is set out in the title. It seems a great pity that this splendid system of land registration, which has been in operation in the various States for at least 50 years, should be impaired in this way. I hope, therefore, that the Senate will disallow the regulations. </para>

        <para>SenatorREID (Queensland) &#91;5.55&#93;.- If any arrangement is to be entered into under which the Commonwealth Savings Bank will absorb the State Savings Banks, as has been done in Queensland! and Tasmania, will the Government see that&#39; the depositors in the Commonwealth Savings Bank are paid the same rate of interest as is paid by the State Savings Banks? Depositors in Queensland whose accounts were transferred from the State Savings Bank to the Commonwealth Savings Bank are receiving&#189; per cent. less in interest than is being received by depositors inNew South Wales. This is not likely to induce the State authorities to hand over the savings banks to the control of the Commonwealth. Is there any likelihood of the rate of interest being reviewed ? I understand that when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller was Governor. of the Commonwealth Bank, he did not consider it good policy to enter into competition with the State institutions ; but even if that were the case the depositors in the Commonwealth Savings Bank should not be penalized to the extent of1/2 per cent. </para>

          <para>. - It is not a function of the Government to fix the rate of interest paid to depositors in the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The rate is at present fixed by the directors of the Commonwealth Bank. When this measure becomes law, the interest will be fixed by <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Savings Bank Commissioners. The first sub-section of the proposed section relates to future acquisitions by the Commonwealth Savings Bank . Commissioners, and we cannot lay downany hard and fast rule by which they will be governed. Whilst it may be unfortunate that depositors in the Commonwealth Savings Bank receive a lower rate of interest than depositors in State savings banks, it is a matter which is at present beyond the power of Parliament to adjust. </para>

          <para>.- if am glad that attention has been directed to the anomaly which exists between the rates of interest paid to depositors in the Commonwealth Savings Bank and. in State savings banks. It is desirable&#39; to inculcate thrift in the mind&#39;s of the people who are advised to deposit their savings in a. bank.;but what possibility is there of the Commonwealth Savings Bank&#39; receiving its share of such savings if it pays a lower rate of interest than the State Savings Bank? Surely it is reasonable to suggest that the Commonwealth Savings Bank should pay small depositors the same rate of interest as is paid by State savings banks. There should be no differentiation between the rates as the depositors&#39; money is as valuable to the Commonwealth as it is to the States. </para>

        <para class="block">It would have been only reasonable if, before the measure was introduced to Parliament, the States concerned had been consulted.  Independently of Queensland and Tasmania, the four States that have not an agreement with the Commonweatlh to have the business of the savings bank carried on jointly, ought to have been sounded to ascertain whether, in the event of the measure becoming law, they would fall into line. If they have not been so consulted, and should they not agree to transfer their savings bank business to the Commonwealth authority, are we to assume that they will not be allowed to par ticipate in the housing scheme ? I believe that in another place the question was asked whether the States had been consulted, and that a definite reply was not given. The Minister may say that it will be time enough to consult the States when the bill is law. I think that it will then be too late. The negotiations should have been carried on prior to the drafting of the bill. If the States have not been consulted they have not been treated fairly. If they have, what is their attitude? The scheme, to be effective, must embrace the whole of the States. If any benefits are derivable under the measure which is complimentary to this, every State should participate in them. I should like to be informed whether the Government of Western Australia views favorably or unfavorably the Commonwealth housing scheme. .They have a scheme of their own, and it is working well. </para>

          <para>. - The first portion of proposed section 35n contains an empowering provision which will enable the body that is to be created to take ov.er the business of every savings bank, subject to the parliamentary authority given, and the statutory limitations of the trustees, directors, or commissioners, as the case may be. A similar transaction has already taken place in a rather different form. The object here is to enable that to be done without further parliamentary authority. If some of the States that are not now co-operating with the Commonwealth in savings bank business, should in the future choose to join forces, this provision will enable that to be done. I again point out that subsection 2 makes provision for doing only what a person engaged in commerce would do. It is proposed, by act of Parliamentto transfer to the Commonwealth Savings Bank whatever liabilities have been incurred on its behalf by the Commonwealth Bank. That Bank is already bound in accordance with the obligations it has undertaken ; and the State instrumentalities are in turn bound to the Commonwealth Bank. The figures that were quoted by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Glasgow)</inline> relate to increased deposits over the whole of Australia, not in any particular State. </para>

            <para>- As the honorable senator has pointed out, there is no necessity to consult Queensland and Tasmania, because the Commonwealth Bank is already performing the work for those two States; and I have endeavoured to make it clear that, because sub-section 1 is an empowering provision, it is not necessary to consult the other States. Nothing will happen unless -the State instrumentality agrees to fall into line with the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Under the agreements referred to in the proposed section the Government possesses the right, if it should choose to exercise it, to receive 70 per <inline font-style="italic">cent,</inline> of the increases in deposits. I understand that that right has not always been exercised. It receives 50 per cent, of the increases in deposits over the whole of Australia. </para>

          <para>.- Earlier in the committee stage I said that the Minister who introduced the Housing Bill informed the Senate that 50 per cent, of the inc &#39;ease in deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank was to be set aside, together with other moneys, for the Commonwealth housing scheme, and I drew attention to sub-section 2 of the proposed section :35d of this bill, the purpose of which is to ratify agreements between the Commonwealth Bank arid the Queensland and the Tasmanian Governments. By these agreements the Commonwealth Bank, some years ago, took over the deposits in the State Savings Banks of the two States. The reply which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> made to my remarks convinces me that lie does not understand the terms of the agreement with the Queensland Government. I understood him to say that 70 per cent, of the increases in deposits in the Queensland branch of the amalgamated savings bank would be at the disposal of the Commonwealth. In the agreement it is clearly laid down that 70 per cent, of the increases in deposits in Queensland are to be at the disposal of the Queensland Government, and the remaining 30 per cent, are to be disbursed as the State Treasurer desires. In the circumstances, therefore, not one penny of the increases in deposits in Queensland will be available for housing purposes in any other part of Australia. -I should say that the same applies to Tasmania. When the Minister says that certain increases in deposits will be made available for the Commonwealth housing scheme, are we to understand that only in those States where increases in deposits are available for the Commonwealth&#39;s scheme can money be expended upon this scheme? I am positive that no State Government has been consulted about it. </para>

            <para>- I thought that it was the desire of the Commonwealth Government to co-operate with the States in this matter. I understood, that the Commonwealth Government would not enter a State domain without the consent of the State. Am I to gather from the honorable senator&#39;s interjection that, no matter what the States think of the Commonwealth Government&#39;s proposals, the Commonwealth will go on with a scheme which makes it mandatory that 50 per cent, of the increases in deposits in the different States other than Queeusland and Tasmania, shall be available for carrying it out? I say that the scheme cannot operate without the approval of the governments in the four States concerned. </para>

If we agree to proposed section 35d,under no circumstances can we expect anything for the Commonwealth housing scheme from savings bank deposits in Queensland or Tasmania. The Minister has not made the point clear. All that we are told is that 50 per cent, of the increases in deposits will be available for the housing scheme; but, as no increased deposits will be available from Queensland or Tasmania, the only States that can be expected to furnish savings bank money for the purpose of our housing scheme are the other four States, if they come into the scheme, which now conduct their savings bank business apart from the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

          <para>. - The more I hear this section discussed, the more I am convinced; that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is on the right track. When all the increases in deposits in. Queensland and Tasmania are earmarked for State purposes, where are we to get any money in those States for the alleged Commonwealth house-building scheme?&#39; As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has already pointed out, 70 per cent, of the increases in deposits in Queensland are definitely earmarked for the use of that State, while the other 30 per cent, is to be spentas the Treasurer of the State determines. I believe that mention has been made of a board of advice, comprising the State Treasurer and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank; but the practice- has been to adopt the suggestions of theState Treasurer in relation to the disbursement of the 30per cent. Therefore,. 100 per cent of the increases in deposits in Queensland are earmarked for expenditure in Queensland. The Minister cannot tell me that there is any difference between the agreement with the Queensland Government and that with the Tasmanian Government. There are thus two States out of the running, leaving only four to contribute towards the housing scheme. Honorable senators are trying to find out whether those four States have been consulted. The Minister tells us that there is no need to consult them, because section 35d is simply an empowering provision. That is so; but bow can it become effective without the consent of the States? If the States do not make the arrangements as suggested in 35D, where shall we get the money for the house-building scheme? The Minister has not told us whether the Commonwealth Treasurer has consulted the State Treasurer of Western Australia in regard to the Housing Bill. Western Australia has a very good house-building scheme of its own. T do not know that it desires to abandon its own housing scheme, or&#39; that the Government of Western Australia is prepared to transfer, the assets of its savings bank to the Commonwealth. The Government should inform the committee how far the negotiations with the Governments of the States have proceeded. Without the consent of the States, a Commonwealth house-building scheme will be impracticable and inoperative. 35e. The savings bank shall be managed by a commission composed of a chief commissioner and two other commissioners. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">In my second-reading speech I said that it would be a mistake to have a separate commission to control the savings bank. In my opinion, the business of the savings bank would be better conducted as a branch of the Commonwealth Bank under the management of a superintendent who would be subject to direction by the Commonwealth Bank Board. The proposed amendment which the Minister has circulated would perpetuate a system which I believe to be wrong. Originally, I was under the impression that the Commonwealth Bank Board had refused to have anything to do with the new housing scheme on the ground that the additional duties would impose too great a strain on its members. I thought then, as I do now, that they should be capable of undertaking the control of that work. All that is necessary is for a superintendent, or manager, of the savings bank branch to be appointed, and that he shall be subject to direction by the board as to policy. The principle of appointing a new commission is unsound, and should not be embodied in this legislation. </para>

An institution conducted on those lines is a more businesslike proposition than that suggested in the proposed amendment that has been circulated. While I cannot hope for other than the usual stereotyped reply from the Minister, &#34;I regret that I cannot accept the amendment,&#34; I hope that this will receive the serious consideration of the committee. </para>

An elastic provision- of that nature is better than the rigid provision suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson.As</inline> a result of a discussion to-day with the Commonwealth Bank Board, it has intimated to the Government that it is prepared to undertake the control of its housing scheme.

In the circumstances it is proposed that the Commonwealth Bank Board shall continue to manage the savings bank branch.

          <para>.   -  Time, and the opposition to this bill in another place, as well as in this chamber, are working  Avonders.  It is amazing to find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline> who supported the second reading of this measure, the object of which is to divorce the savings bank department from the general banking business of the Commonwealth Bank, and who also voted against an amendment to refer the bill to a select committee, . now moving an amendment to provide that the Commonwealth Bank Board shall remain in control of the savings bank branch. The Minister has circulated a comprehensive amendment, which is a complete backdown by the Government. When the bill was introduced in another place it was stated emphatically that to carry out the Government&#39;s housing proposals the savings bank branch must be separated from the general business of the Commonwealth Bank. When objection was taken to this course by the Opposition the Treasurer declared that he had been in consultation with the board of directors of the bank, and that the latter had intimated that they could not carry out the proposed housing scheme. We took the stand that the original proposition put to the board of directors was different from that contained in the bill; but honorable senators supporting the Government ridiculed the suggestion. We pointed out that the additional duties imposed upon the board by the adoption of the housing scheme would not materially add to its responsibilities, andcertainly did not justify the course then proposed by the Government. To test the feeling of the Senate we moved an amendment that the bill be referred to a select committee, the object being to give members of the board an opportunity to state their position. The Minister has just informed the Senate that the Government has had another consultation with the directors of the bank; and that they are now prepared to carry on with the scheme. The Government has completely backed down in the face of opposition in. this chamber and in another place. Let me say further that I believe that the Government has not the slightest intention of appointing the commission as proposed. The amendment is merely intended as a barrage, behind which the Ministry can retreat from a difficult position. It will be noted that paragraph (c) of the Minister&#39;s proposed amendment provides that - </para>

            <para>- Very well, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I shall leave it at that. The object of the latter portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson&#39;s</inline> amendment is to excise certain provisions in the bill, and to make provision for the appointment of a superintendent to act under the direction of the board of directors. If that is carried there will still be the separation of the savings bank branch from the general business of the bank; but the amendment forecast by the Minister will obviate that objectionable course. I am glad that the Ministry has altered its viewpoint on this aspect of the proposal. It is obvious that the proposal placed originally before the board of directors was different altogether from that which is in the bill. I welcome the amendment indicated by the Minister, and repeat that ir, is the outcome of opposition in this chamber and in another place to the proposed separation of the savings bank branch from the general business of the ba nk. </para>

            <para>- He had no opportunity to vote on this issue. The amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition during the second reading debate sought to refer the bill to a select committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> and other honorable senators on this side were perfectly justified in voting against it. It had nothing to do with the proposal to appoint a superintendent of the savings bank branch under the control of the Commonwealth Bank Board. We may assume that the Government was advised, in the first place by the board of directors, that in order to give effect to the Government&#39;s housing proposals, it would be desirable to separate the savings bank branch from the general business of the bank. Equally we are entitled to assume that the directors, upon further consideration, believed that they would be able to carry out the work satisfactorily without making the change, and advised the Government accordingly. I shall vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson&#39;s</inline> amendment, because the position is met by the amendment indicated by the Minister, though in a different way. No matter by what name he may be designated, it is obvious that it will be necessary to have a superintendent of the savings bank branch. The Minister&#39;s amendment has come as a surprise, but I have no doubt that my assumption as to the reason for this alteration is the correct one, because, with other honorable senators, I was much impressed during the second-reading debate by the earnestness of the Government in seeking to bring about a separation of the two branches of the bank&#39;s business. </para>

They have reported to the Government that although, as the Treasurer stated in another place, during the debate on the second reading, he freely consulted with them on the principles of those measures, they did not appreciate the exact intentions of the legislation as to the carrying&#39; out of the housing function, and that, on further consideration, they are now of the opinion that under the provisions of the measures, the board could carry out its administration.  To enable the board to do this, an amendment is to be made in the Senate to provide that until the commission is appointed, the board will  carry  on the functions under the two bills. Should it become necessary, at a later stage, for any good reasons to  establish the separation by the appointment of the commission, that course could be adopted. This action is being taken with the cordial approval of the board. </para>

          <para>. - Prior to the last election the Government announced its intention of introducing a measure to provide for a housing scheme. For a period of thirteen months, in which Parliament sat for only three weeks, the Government had ample opportunity to formulate its policy and to prepare its programme for the present session. It had every opportunity to consult and interview those entrusted with the responsibility of controlling the Commonwealth Bank; but it was not until the Commonwealth Bank Savings Bank Bill and the Commonwealth Housing Bill were vigorously discussed in another place, and the former seriously debated in this chamber, that the Government showed any disposition to amend the measure. We pointed out as strongly as possible that, there was no necessity whatever to separate the savings bank from the general bank. We also said that as far as the Government activities were concerned its proposals would not bring into existence a solitary tenement. We- said that it was an insult to the intelligence and the capacity of the members of the board to suggest that their duties were so heavy that they could not hand over to certain specified authorities money which was to be made available under the housing scheme. I am disposed to think that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank were not consulted upon this proposition until to-day. It was rumoured some time ago that the directors were consulted as to whether they would or would not be able to give effect to the Government&#39;s housing scheme, and that they said it was not a function of a banking institution to undertake housing. That is about the only consultation that occurred. I have heard it said that some of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank hinted that they would resign their positions if they were forced to control the housing proposals which were foreshadowed. It now seems an extraordinary- development that a Government supposed to consist of business men should even give way in the slightest degree, and that we should now be informed that an entirely different policy is to be adopted. I understand that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank were summoned to Canberra. An interview between them and the Government took place here this morning, and after this eleventh-hour consultation they have said that they did not appreciate the full extent of the Government&#39;s proposition. Does the Minister expect the members of the committee to seriously believe that these astute commercial men, whose business it is to understand propositions of this kind, were not aware of the actual position. They understood the provisions of the bill as did every member of the Government, and there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that the directors told the members of the Government to mind their own business and not to separate the general bank from the savings bank. The directors, no doubt, told the Government not to appoint commissioners, who would merely hand over money to certain State authorities when the necessary State legislation had been passed. Apparently the directors also informed- the Government that, their duties were not too heavy to prevent  them performing  this task, and that they .are able to do the work. I am satisfied &#39;that they were willing and  able  to do it before this legislation was introduced. Let me repeat and !emphasize that what was expected of them in this respect was merely that they should hand over .money to the State .authorities for the purposes of the housing scheme. Under the changed conditions . I am satisfied that a commission will not be appointed. What does the amendment provide? That until commissioners are appointed the directors will do the work. That is what the members of the Opposition urged from the first that they were able to do, and would do, to the satisfaction of the people of Australia and in the best interests of the Commonwealth Bank. This change of front on the part of the Government is proof of our contention, and the Government now recognizes that our attitude was a correct one. I am glad the Government has seen the error of its ways, and has awakened to a sense of its responsibilities. I am glad that public attention has been focussed on its action. The people of Australia are becoming sick unto death of this Government&#39;s activities in the direction of appointing boards and commissions to undertake that which could be easily handled by the Government itself or institutions under the control of responsible officers. I am as certain as that night follows day that Savings Bank Commissioners will not be appointed, and that the mischief which the Government attempted to do will not be done. This is due wholly and solely to the efforts of the Labour party in this chamber and in another place. I am satisfied that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank will effectively carry on the work which the Go.vernment said they were unable to do because of their heavy responsibilities. </para>

          <para>. - There are occasions, happily few, .when honorable members in opposition in this and in other Parliaments are able, so to speak, to flap their wings and crow. This is one of those occasions. But, honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber find themselves in a rather difficult position. When the second reading of this bill was under consideration the members of the Opposition spoke very strongly against the Government&#39;s proposal to place the control of the Commonwealth  Savings  Bank under a board of commissioners. I feel that some explanation is due to me, to the Senate, and to those who sent me here, because honorable senators on this side of the chamber, including myself, out of loyalty to the Government and in the full belief that it was a well-considered proposition, supported the proposal for the appointment of a board of commissioners. In the speech I delivered I went to a good deal of trouble to justify, so far as possible, the appointment of such a board, and with others I ridiculed the suggestions of honorable senators opposite that such a scheme could be submitted without proper consultation between the Government and the directors of the Commonwealth Bank. I did not believe there was anything in such an assertion. I had been assured that there was nothing whatever in it. On my return to Sydney, however, I found that there was good reason to believe that there was a considerable amount of truth in the statement, and that instead of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank being anxious to be relieved of &#39; the responsibility of controlling the Commonwealth&#39; Savings Bank, to put it mildly, they were not in favour of the appointment of a board of commissioners to control that institution. What is our position? It is straining .the loyalty of consistent supporters of the Government to ask them within two or three days to reverse their decision, and to vote in opposition to &#39;the views they expressed in support of the measure, as introduced,  which we were assured by the Government had  been  well considered and had the  Aveight  of reliable opinion behind it. Those views are recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> We are now asked to say by our votes that what we then said was not justified. </para>

Although I am now just as desirous of assisting the Government as I was when I addressed myself to the motion for the second-reading of the bill, when I justified the proposal that was then made, some explanation is due to my constituents if I support this amendment. </para>

            <para>- What does the Government mean ? Is it intended that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank shall continue to control the operations of the savings bank for only a few weeks or months? I cannot imagine the appointment of commissioners for, at any rate, some considerable time. I believe that very good grounds exist for the appointment of a commission, and that eventually the Government will be compelled, to take that action. Why should it camouflage the proposal in this way? Would it not have been better and more in accordance with the facts that are now known to the Government to have said straight out, &#34; The savings bank shall be managed by the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank,&#34; and to have left it at that? Next year, or the year after, when the work had grown so enormously as to render it necessary to withdraw the management from the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank, and to place it under a commission, it would have been an easy matter to bring down an amending bill for that purpose and to justify it. Under the clause, even as proposed to be amended, it will be open to this or any other Government, at any time, to transfer the control of the savings bank from the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank to a commission, without consulting Parliament. It would have been infinitely better for the Government to have said at once that a mistake had been made, and that for some considerable time the savings bank ought to be under the control of the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank. To an extent that would have obviated the difficulty in which the Government has involved both itself and its supporters. Whilst this may be a convenient method to adopt, it is always better to be quite honest. </para>

It must be admitted that the amendment, if agreed to, will entirely alter many of the main principles of the measure. Unless my suggestion is accepted, the appointment of the commission can be effected as an executive act without consulting either Parliament or the management of the bank. </para>

            <para>- Although it has been stated to-night and on previous occasions that the opinions of the board were sought and obtained, the honorable senator says that the board was not consulted. Those may be the expressions of a supporter of the Government who has friendly intentions towards it, but they do not appeal to me in that way. On the contrary, they appear to me to have been made with the intention to damage the prestige and the good name of this&#39; Government. &#34;Whether or not that is . the intention, they can have no other effect. If the honorable senator had any doubt as to their effect, he had only to study the faces of honorable senators opposite to see with what pleasure they were received in that quarter. I do not propose to discuss the amendment further. The Minister in charge of the bill has made a statement on behalf of the Government. I ask honorable senators to accept that statement. If they are not prepared to do so, they should not continue to keep this Government in office, but should endeavour to secure another Government whose statements they will, be prepared to accept. </para>

          <para>. -  I was rather pleased to hear the squealing of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> and the squeaking of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays. This is one of the- punishments that are meted out to those who find themselves obliged to support a government through thick and thin. On occasions we all have to swallow our convictions, and do as we are told. I rather enjoy the spectacle of honorable senators opposite in that position. The Government, however, is not treating the Senate fairly. Honorable senators, who sit on this side, regarded the proposal to appoint a commission as an indication of the intention of the Government . to separate almost completely the control of the savings bank and the general bank. Honorable senators of the Opposition were opposed to that idea, because, in their opinion, it would suggest that the positionof the bank was weakened, and because they thought that the very small portion of work the commission would be required to undertake could easily be done by the present Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank. I expressed the opinion that the commission would not meet more than once a month, and that I thought it would be a fair thing to pay them &#163;50 for each sitting. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and others thought that the board would meet more frequently. So far as I could see, all that the commissioners would have to do was to allocate, the amount of money to be placed at the disposal of the various authorities in the States. That, in my opinion, was not sufficient to justify the appointment of an additional Board of Commissioners. If the Government has the power, as it will have, to appoint a commission immediately after this bill is passed and becomes an act, it might as well appoint it straight away. It is my belief that it intends to appoint a commission; but, if it is not the intention of the Government to do so, why cannot it do the decent, straightforward thing and delete from the bill all reference to the commission? I shall not vote against the amendment, because it improves the bill slightly and may delay the appointment of the commission for a day or two. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Senator Pearce,</inline>for the Government has tried to reply to my few remarks on this amendment by deliberately misrepresenting what I said. I say &#34; deliberately,&#34; becausealthough I corrected the right honorable gentleman, and other honorable senators also sought to put him right, he continued to maintain the attitude he had taken up. I did not make use of the words he attributed to me. I am quite prepared to accept his assurance that the Government did consult the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank. What I thought I had said and what I certainly meant to say was that, if consultations had been held, there was evidently no agreement between the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank and the Government. The assurance given to Parliament when the bill was before us at the second-reading stage was that there was an agreement between the Government and the Board of Directors on this point. We are now assured that the Board of Directors has had time to think over the matter, and time to examine more carefully the arguments that have been used - presumably by the Opposition and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> - against the Government&#39;s proposal, and has changed its opinion; it has told the Government so, and has also changed the opinionof the Government. That is about the strangest change of front in record time that I have ever heard of, and I have a little doubt as to whether it is exactly a correct statement of the facts. There is plenty of room for reason able doubt in the circumstances. I accept, however, the assurance of the Leader of the Government in the Senate that the Government now knows what it wants, and is prepared to do it, and that there will be no other change of front. For the sake of the supporters of the Government, and for the sake of the Commonwealth Bank, I hope that the Government now does know what it wants and is prepared to go ahead and do it. Despite all the sneers of the right honorable gentleman about my support of the Government, I claim to be a supporter of the Government, and one who is always ready to step into the breach to aid the Government. I am pleased now to be able to support it even though, in doing so, I have to eat the words I spoke only last week. If the Government has good grounds for making this change of front - we are assured that it has, although I cannot see that it has given us good reasons for it-seeing that it has to accept the responsibility for the step it has taken, it is up to us to support it and leave it to accept the responsibility for everything it has done in connexion with the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

        <para>SenatorREID. - I did not say anything last week, nor have I said anything at any time about the bill since it has been before the Senate. I was strongly opposed to the idea of separating the savings bank from the general trading bank, and the proposal to create another board of commissioners; but I preferred to reserve my opinion until we reached the committee stage. I had made up my mind to vote against the proposal to appoint a commission; and many honorable senators heard me make that statement privately. Therefore, I am pleased that circumstances have allowed the Government to bring down the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I do not see that there was any compulsion about it. I do not doubt the word of the Government that the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank thought that they already had too much work to do. I do not think that any &#39;Minister would deliberately misrepresent the attitude of the board by telling us that the Government had consulted the directors and that they thought that it was best for them not to handle the savings bank business. I could quite understand the directors of the bank taking the attitude ascribed to them. For that reason, I said nothing on the second reading of the bill, because I thought that some value might be attached to the views of - the directors on the point, although my own opinion was that they did not have so much work to do that they could not handle the housing scheme. I can also quite understand them discussing the matter and changing their minds. Why should they not seek to strengthen their position, and also strengthen the bank, from their point of view&#34;? Of course, honorable senators opposite would naturally be expected to make the most of the opportunity now presented to them. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> rose to speak, I asked him to speak out, because I knew that he had a very juicy apple to chew, and would make the most of it, It was a delight to us to see him getting through the business so speedily. I was equally pleased to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> start the ball rolling. It was the first time I had heard him leading the Opposition in challenging the Government. He did it well ; I congratulate him. I can quite see what is in the minds of honorable senators opposite. They profess to believe that they have convinced the Government of the need for bringing in this amendment, and they will boast about it when they are before the electors. I do not care from what quarter this amendment comes. I have not the slightest doubt that the present directors of the Commonwealth Bank will find that they can handle the housing scheme; but if they find, later on, that the task does not suit them, they can make representations to the Government. There will certainly be a great deal of worry entailed in seeing how the States spend the money that is advanced to them. We all know what trouble the Commonwealth has experienced in regard to the way in which the States have expended the road grants. If, later on, the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank comes to the conclusion that the task of controlling the savings bank is too much for them, the bill makes provision&#39; for relieving them of the responsibility. I hope that that will not happen, but any one who knows the work entailed in dealing with housing schemes will realize that the directors of the Commonwealth Bank may find the task more difficult than they think. I have no grudge against the Government, and I am pleased that I can vote for an amendment which will make the bill what I think it should be </para>

          <para>. - A few days ago the Governmeut had one settled view as to the control of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Today it holds an entirely different view. No one will challenge its right to change its opinion ; but I hope that it will allow the same liberty to its followers should they at any time feel that circumstances warrant a change. I understand that the change of front on the part of the Government is due to the Commonwealth Bank Board having stated that it is prepared to control the new housing scheme. The Government at first gave us clearly to- understand that it stood for a separate control, of the new institution proposed to be established. From that position it has now receded. I agree with the Government that the Commonwealth Bank Board should be entrusted with the control of the new housing scheme, and, seeing that it is willing to undertake the work, there is no reason why a separate commission should be constituted. I am prepared to accept the frank acknowledgement of the board that at first it was unable to understand the Government&#39;s housing scheme. It does not matter whether that was the fault pf the board or of the Government. The members of the Commonwealth Bank Board occupy theirpresent positions because of special aptitude for the work with which they are entruste&#39;d. In spite of competition they have been successful in their several walks  of life. Nevertheless, they may not be the best men to undertake an entirely new enterprise - that of building homes. I am, however, prepared to take the risk, and to allow them to control the Government&#39;s housing scheme.  The  suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays that the form of control of the savings bank should not be altered except with the concurrence of the Commonwealth Bank Board is a good one. No body of men should he better able to advise the Government in that matter than the men in charge of the institution. The Government&#39;s housing scheme will be subjected to the closest scrutiny, and those in control of it will need at all times to be careful how they act. The venture ou which they will embark, while new to them, is not new to Australia, for already four or five housing schemes are in operation in the States. Persons desirous of acquiring homes will scrutinize carefully the Government&#39;s scheme and the manner in which it is controlled. The board will be required to &#34; deliver the goods.&#34; The Government would do well to give serious attention to the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion. .We are all desirous that this new enterprise shall be successful, and for that reason that it shall be placed under the most capable management. Should the management not be right, the enterprise cannot but fail: I have no doubt that the board will be able to do the work. That it will be possible to compare its work with that done by the States will prove a valuable corrective. The position is amply safeguarded under the proposals of the Minister. </para>

            <para>- As the result of a consultation with the Commonwealth Bank Board, the Government has reversed its decision of a few days ago. Instead of a commission, it now proposes that the Commonwealth Bank Board shall control the savings bank business. The Government may again change its opinion, and, without consulting that board, transfer the business to a commission. It is only right that the concurrence of the board should be obtained before the business under its control is transferred to another body. </para>

          <para>. - At first sight the amendment may appear to be attractive, but if honorable senators will examine it closely they will see that its effect will be to place in the hands of the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank a power that should properly be exercised by the Government. A difference of opinion might arise between the board and the Government. The Ministry might be of the opinion that the provisions of the housing scheme would be better served by the appointment of commissioners, whereas the board might hold the contrary view. If the amendment is carried the Government will he powerless to take action pending a further amendment of the act. It is the duty of any administration to consult with so important a body as the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank in regard to an important matter of policy affecting it. It is equally the duty of any government to take full responsibility for its actions. If it does wrong it is answerable to Parliament. This is the only control which should be exercised over it. The amendment cuts at the root of our system of parliamentary government. </para>

It changes entirely the whole structure of the measure. There was only one principle in the bill, and that was the separation of the savings bank branch from the general business of the bank. It would be much better now to delete the proposed new sub-sections 35p to 35w inclusive. We should then know that the business of the bank would be carried, on by the board of directors as at present. If at any future time the Government thought it desirable to appoint the commission, the act could be amended. In its present form the bill gives the Government <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> to appoint the commission, but I feel confident that that will not be done. For these reasons I ask the committee to vote against this proposed section. </para>

            <para>- I should consider my time well spent if I succeeded in amending this bill in every possible direction. I take it that most members of the committee are wise men. We know that a number of honorable senators are not in favour of the bill either as introduced or with the amendment which has just been carried. In the circumstances, would it not be as well to give the committee an opportunity to have a full-dress debate on this proposal at a later stage. That would be possible if the committee agreed to strike out the words I have mentioned, because before the commissioners could&#39; be appointed the Government would have to inform Parliament that it was its intention to make such appointments. In doing so it would announce the period for which they were to be appointed and the remuneration they were to be paid. I hold very democratic views in regard to the period of such appointments, which in this case is altogether too long. What will their duties consist of if they are ever called upon to undertake any work? All they will have to do, if certain State legislation is passed, will be to hand over borrowed money to State authorities, who will control the housing scheme. It is ridiculous to suggest that commissioners who will have very little work to do should be appointed for several years. Victoria is proud of its railways, which are controlled by three commissioners appointed, not for seven years as is proposed in this instance, but for only three years. Would any one suggest that the duties of the Victorian Railways Commissioners are not in every sense more responsible than are those which these commissioners will be required to undertake. I believe that any three members of the Senate could perform the* work these commissioners will be expected to do as easily as falling off a log. They will be called upon to undertake any intricate work in connexion with the housing scheme, lt is a wonder that the Government does not propose to appoint them for life ! The members of another place, whose work is infinitely more important, are elected for three years - unfortunately for them they are in some instances not required to serve for the full term - and honorable senators, whose duties are as important as honorable members in another place, are elected for a period of six  years.  Does any one suggest that the duties which these commissioners will undertake will be more important than is the framing of the legislation under which the people of this great Commonwealth live? I believe that a great majority of the committee will support my amendment; I know it is possible to convert some honorable senators opposite. The longer we disccuss this provision, and the more we comprehend its importance and significance, the more will it be considered necessary to achieve the objective I have in view. The discussion that has taken place has been beneficial, and has, I believe, strengthened the opposition to the proposed section. I could refer again to the period for which the commissioners are to be appointed without being guilty of tedious repetition. I know that you, sir, with your extensive knowledge of the Standing Orders, and of the procedure in committee, would not accuse me of so  transgressing if I employed different language in a further reference to the subject. </para>

            <para>- I have had longer parliamentary experience than the honorable senator, and know the dirty game that is being played. Caucus has not had an opportunity to discuss the new situation which has arisen, and consequently the Leader of the Opposition and his supporters are. merely dancing round the maypole. Possibly the Government has made a mistake in this instance, but no government can expect to carry on its responsible work without making mistakes. In this instance, possibly, it is preferable that the savings bank should be under the control of the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank rather than three commissioners. There are already too many commissioners, the members of which are receiving high salaries. The age in which we live is one of talk. I hope that its successor will be one of action. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> wishes to negative proposed section 35f. I have read that wise men sometimes change their minds, but fools never do. It is quite possible that the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank foresaw the difficulties that might be created if control of the savings bank was taken from them, and placed their views before the Government. </para>

        <para class="block">The salary of the Chief Commissioner should be named in the bill, as are the salaries of the two Commissioners. The duties of each of the Commissioners will not be important. If the committee is competent to place a value upon their work it surely is competent to place a value also upon the work of the Chief Commissioner. I have never yet, to my knowledge, supported a clause that proposed the appointment of men to responsible positions, but gave the GovernorGeneral the power to fix their salaries. On the original Commonwealth Bank Bill and the High Commissioner Bill I claim that the salary should be stated. Therefore, my present attitude is not a new one. My opposition would not have been so pronounced if each of the Commissioners had been treated alike. The duties of the commission will be extremely light. It will simply be the medium for the transference of certain sums of money from one authority to another. It will not even have the responsibility of securing repayment. But be the duties light or onerous, we should state the salaries that are to be paid. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLACHLAN</inline>(South Austra this measure we follow the lines adopted in the bill which authorized the appointment of the Governor and the  Deputy  Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The salaries of those officers were not stated in that measure. The reason for refraining from mentioning the salary in this instance is that the Government will have to seek out persons who will be qualified to discharge duties of considerable importance. I ask the committee to reject the amendment. </para>
