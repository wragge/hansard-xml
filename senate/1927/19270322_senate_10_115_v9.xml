          <para class="block">There is a general desire which I think is shared by all honorable senators that the Senate should terminate its sittings in Melbourne this week. To enable that to be done, it is necessary to suspend the standing order referred to, so that a number of small bills which are not of great consequence may be dealt with expeditiously. In the exchange of business between the two Houses certain of those measures might reach this chamber after half-past 10 o'clock. Unless we suspend this standing order, we shall not be able to deal with them. Honorable senators would then be called upon to reassemble for the purpose of passing the final, and usually the formal, stages of bills. The course now proposed is intended to meet the convenience of honorable senators as well as of the Government. </para>

I do not mind an all-night sitting if the Leader of the Senate gives us ample opportunity to make the necessary arrangements. Most of us, as we grow older, are not partial to all-night sittings. It is becoming fashionable now to have theatre parties that begin close on midnight, and I understand that arrangements have been made in this city for all-night cafes; but I do not think that the example of a small section of the community, which might be called the smart set, should be followed by a seriously-minded Government such as this Administration is supposed to be. New business should not be taken after half-past . ten o'clock at night, especially after an all-day sitting. I object to all-day and all-night sittings. </para>

            <para>- I rise to order. I submit that the proposed new clause is out of order because - (1) it is outside the scope of the bill; (2) it is irrelevant; (3) it could have no effect; and (4) it is contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. The effect of the proposed new clause is to give a direction to a future government that its treasurer shall submit certain proposals to Parliament. Clearly, then, it is out of order. I have had a fairly long experience in Parliament, and have had the opportunity and the occasion to study the constitutional practice of this and other legislatures. I have never seen in any act of any Parliament a provision containing a direction to a future government. Let us look for a moment at the bill itself. As its title makes clear, it is a States Grants </para>

        <para class="block">Bill. That is the form in which it has been passed by the committee. Is there anything in it which would justify our embodying an instruction to a future treasurer or government? The present Parliament has not, and cannot have, any control whatever over future governments or parliaments. They can act as they please, no matter what provisions we may place in this bill.. There is not in the amendment one word about grants. It is merely a direction to a future government, and, therefore, is outside the scope of the bill. I shall now deal with the second point, that the amendment is irrelevant. I invite honorable senators to read clause6. It is as follows: - </para>

          <para>Amendments are out of order if they are irrelevant to the bill or beyond the scope of the bill, or of the clause under consideration; governed by or dependent upon amendments already negatived; inconsistent with, or contradictory to, the bill as agreed to by the committee; inconsistent with a decision to which the committee has come upon a former amendment; offered at a wrong place in the bill; or tendered to the committee in a spirit of mockery. An amendment which is equivalent to a negative of the bill, or of the clause under consideration, is out of order. Amendments have also been ruled out of order on the ground of vagueness, or because they were trifling. The  chairman  would decline to propose such amendments from the Chair. Amendments to a bill proposing that the address or resolution of one House of Parliament should affect the repeal of the bill have been ruled out of order as unconstitutional, while an amendment proposing that a bill relating to England alone should not come into force until a similar bill should have been passed for Scotland has been ruled to be irrelevant. </para>

Nobody has ever attempted previously to have such a provision inserted in any bill. A future government or treasurer could entirely ignore it. They would know that a previous parliament had no right to instruct them in any measure that it had passed. </para>

            <para>- With a considerable portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens's</inline> contentions I do not find myself in agreement. I do not think that the constitutionality of the proposed clause can be questioned. The Chair is not called upon to interpret the Constitution. Neither do I think that the proposed clause could have no effect. To my mind, the whole question hinges on the relevancy of the amendment. Is it relevant to the subject-matter of the bill? On this point, our Standing Orders are clear. If it can be shown that the proposed clause is relevant to the subject-matter of the bill, it must be in order, but it seems to me that the question must be answered in the negative. This bill is for the purpose of making certain grants to the States consequent on the termination of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States. It is true that it contains a clause which provides that certain payments shall be made to the States, subject to any agreement that may be arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States. The honorable senator bases his amendment on that clause, on the assumption that, if an agreement is arrived at, these payments need not be made, and in the event of no agreement being made, he asks the committee to direct the Commonwealth Treasurer to present to Parliament certain proposals connected with the State debts. I submit that the contingency upon which he bases his clause has nothing whatever to do with the clause itself. By passing this bill, Parliament is saying to the Government, " You shall make these payments to the States until the 30th June, 1928, but if, in the meantime, you come to an agreement with them, you may cease making them." How can we make the taking over of part of the State debts in any way relevant to such a direction to the Government? Clause 6 is merely a machinery provision directing the Government to make these payments to the States under the rates set out in the schedule, unless, in the meantime, it makes an agreement with the States. The whole question is whether a direction to the Treasurer as to what he shall present to Parliament, if there is no agreement, has anything to do with the specific operation of clause 6. </para>

            <para>- To my mind, it is in no way relevant to it. Possibly what the honorable senator suggests may be one of the contingencies that Parliament will have to consider, but honorable senators can gather that only from the speeches delivered by Ministers, and not from the bill itself. Ministers have indicated what they propose to do. For instance, they have told honorable senators that they propose to hold a conference with the States, and that if the conference is not held, or proves a fiasco, they will tell Parliament what they propose to do. That information is gleaned, not from the provisions of the bill, but from speeches delivered by Ministers. I contend that the fact that Ministers have made an explanation of what their future policy may be, does not make <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill's</inline> clause relevant to the bill, which contains no reference to the subject-matter of the clause. I contend, therefore, that we should leave out of consideration the constitutionality of the clause, and the question of whether it would have any effect, if carried, and confine ourselves to the mere matter of relevancy. It seems to me that the clause cannot be held to be relevant to anything in the bill. </para>

            <para>- The point has been raised that my proposed new clause is not within the scope of the bill. This is a States grants bill, aud the provision of interest and sinking fund on  debts  as set out in my proposal, is merely an alternative to the course proposed in the bill. I contend, therefore, that the point that the claude is not within the scope of the bill is fully answered, and that my amendment is not out of order in that respect." In regard to the  point  that it is irrelevant, if honorable senators will be kind enough to read clause 6, with which my proposal is so intimately connected, they will see that, it provides that, subject to the terms of an agreement which has been arrived at, a certain course shall be followed. </para>

            <para>- I do not like to describe as a quibble the point raised by the honorable senator who has had so much experience. Surely he must realize that instructions given by the Parliament of the Commonwealth are followed by action. That being so, if it is proposed to leave the Government entirely free to take what action it pleases in the event of an- agreement not being arrived at - an inference implicitly and not explicitly stated - surely it is most decidedly relevant to the purpose and the scope of this bill for this Parliament to say that, in the event of an agreement not being arrived at, such and such a thing must be done. The argument that has been advanced in opposition to my proposal most certainly does not prove that the taking of such a course would be out of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is endeavouring to connect the proposed new clause with a proposal to which effect could not be given. The best authority in regard to the effect which the proposed new clause would have is the person most interested in this instance, and that is the right honorable the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who little as he likes the proposal, admits that it could undoubtedly have effect. </para>

If the subject-matter of clause 6 is relevant to and within the scope of the bill, .this proposed new clause must also be, because if clause 6 does not operate in the way intended, my amendment will fill the hiatus at the end of that clause. That being so, I submit that the proposed new clause is entirely within the scope of, and relevant to the subject-matter of the bill.

            <para>- I agree with the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that the proposed new clause is irrelevant to, and outside the scope of the bill. These two grounds are closely related. The question of whether an amendment is relevant is decided partly by the title, and partly by the scope of the bill as disclosed by the clauses. If an amendment is relevant, it should be covered by the title; but it should also be relevant to the scope of the bill as disclosed by the clauses of the bill itself. It may be urged that the proposed new clause comes within the title of the bill, which is "a bill for an act to amend the Surplus Revenue Act of 1910, to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue funds for the purpose of financial assistance to the States, and for other purposes," inasmuch as it embodies a form of granting financial assistance to the States; but it is not a form relevant to the scope of the bill as disclosed by its clauses. </para>

            <para>- Because it provides a totally different form in which to grant financial assistance; to be in order, it must be relevant to the form of assistance contemplated by the bill itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> contends that the new clause is relevant, because the bill provides that, subject to the terms of an agreement, certain things shall be done. He said, in effect, that surely if there is a provision under which, subject to an agreement being readied, certain things shall be done, we are entitled to insert a provision to the effect that, if no agreement is reached, other action may be taken. What is proposed is irrelevant to the subject-matter of the bill, because there is in the bill nothing in regard to the Commonwealth taking over the State debts. The proposed new clause is totally irrelevant to the subject-matter of the bill as disclosed by its clauses, and is consequently beyond the scope of the bill. </para>

            <para>- No. The grants contemplated by the bill are in a different category, and, consequently, I think the proposal is irrelevant. It does not follow that, because the title is as I have stated, an honorable senator is entitled to move an amendment in which provision is made for granting financial assistance in other ways. The only financial assistance which can be covered by an amendment, or a new clause, must be in a form cognate to the form of financial assistance which the bill covers. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill's</inline> proposed new clause may be taken to embrace a form of financial assistance, it is not a form of assistance which is in any way relevant to the financial assistance contemplated and covered by the bill itself. </para>

The portion of a section in the Constitution to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has alluded relates to the taking over of State debt" on the basis of the population of the State. That is necessarily what would happen in this case, as the payments by the Commonwealth would be in lieu of payments to the States on a per <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> basis. Therefore, there should not be much doubt concerning the relevancy of my proposal. If it is to be defeated, it should be on its merits, and not on a technicality. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> has submitted that the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> is out of order on several grounds. The first point taken by him is that it is a direction to future governments, and, therefore, not allowable. There can be no objection, in my opinion, to the amendment on that ground, since all statutes are, in effect, directions to future governments. If this clause is passed and the bill becomes law, it must necessarily become a direction to future governments - <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> direction that must be observed until the law is amended or repealed. The second objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is that it is not in keeping with the context of the bill. I find it somewhat difficult to arrive at a decision on that point; but feel that the amendment is not quite consistent with the context of the bill. The third objection is that the amendment, even if carried, could have no effect; that point, in my opinion, is not sustained. A fourth objection raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> is in regard to the constitutionality of the amendment. I agree with the Vice-President of the Executive Council ('.Senator Pearce) that it is not for the  chairman  to interpret the Constitution. I do not intend to rule whether the amendment is, or is not, within the Constitution. I come now to the fifth objection, namely, that the amendment is irrelevant and beyond the scope of the bill. That is a vital objection. It has been submitted that clause 6 already provides for action somewhat similar to that contemplated by the amendment. It does so, however, only in the event of Parliament adopting a certain line of action in the future. I rule that the amendment is out of order on the ground that it is irrelevant and beyond the scope of the bill. </para>

            <para>. - I hope honorable senators will now calmly think over what has been done. Even at this late hour the Government should beat a strategic retreat. There is no reason why a vote should now be taken on the third reading. That the Government has a majority does not necessarily mean that it is right. Notwithstanding the various technical points that have arisen during this debate, the question to be decided is whether the Commonwealth should deprive the States of certain sources of revenue which have been theirs for a number of years, and that only three month's notice of its intention to do so should be given. By agreeing to the third reading of this bill the Senate will have constituted itself a court of summary jurisdiction. The authority of the Commonwealth is to be exercised, in what can only be described as a regrettable manner. The Government has stated arbitrarily that the States will receive compensation for the money taken from them; but  that that will not be so has been made clear during this debate. The Government, even now, should stay its hand, and issue another invitation to the States to meet the Commonwealth in conference. The Prime Minister would then be in a position to say that although the Commonwealth Parliament desired the discontinuance of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, it had stayed its hand pending a further conference to discuss the best means of compensating the States for the withdrawal of those payments. It has been argued that in proposing to vacate the field of taxation on the incomes of individuals the Treasurer is acting generously towards the States. That is not so, because the Commonwealth, by imposing a tax on incomes, is occupying a field of taxation which it ought not now to occupy. When direct taxation was imposed by the Commonwealth during the period of the Great War, it was distinctly stated that it was a war expediency. Nevertheless, succeeding Commonwealth governments have continued to impose it. To say now that by relinquishing its taxation on incomes to the extent of 40 per cent. the Commonwealth is compensating the States is wrong. I hope that there will be a majority of the Senate opposed to the third reading of this bill in order that the States may have a further period in which to submit alternative proposals. </para>

              <para>- I ask you, sir, not to be so impetuous. I intend to connect my remarks with the bill before the Senate. The last election was fought on only one issue. Although the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments from the States was referred to in a general way, the fact remains that the average elector paid little or no attention to any reference to the desirability of effecting a change in the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in this chamber have said that they made perfectly clear the Government's intention in this connexion, and that the vote of the people was equivalent to a mandate to proceed with this legislation. Yet a few days ago the Prime Minister, when addressing a meeting of the Australian Women's National League, said that various views, opinions, and prejudices existed in regard to this subject, and that the people were confused and did not know right from wrong. In the light of that admission, how can it be said that in the heated atmosphere prior to the last election the people were in a better state to understand this question than they are now? </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister's admission that the people could not distinguish between right and wrong in relation to this question was a reflection on the Government, because had it made the issue clear the people would not now be confused about it. In effect, the Government is now saying to the people that the practice which has continued since federation is wrong in principle, that the States have been receiving money to which they are not justly entitled. Recognizing that direct taxation is unpopular, the Government proposes to evacuate certain fields of direct taxation, so that the State Governments will be blamed for having imposed additional taxation on the people. At least, five of them are Labour Governments. If there had been anti-Labour Governments in five of the States, this Government would have hesitated to introduce such a measure as the bill now before us. </para>

              <para>- That is beside the question. Why does the Government propose to abandon certain fields of taxation ? The land tax has realized nearly Â£32,000,000. It is obvious that the same measure of land taxation cannot be imposed by the Victorian or other State Government. The Federal land tax has had a most important effect upon the material prosperity of the Commonwealth. In Victoria particularly it has stimulated activity and increased production. Unless honorable senators have been wholly unobservant they must have noticed the rapid .progress that has been made in Melbourne during the past few years, largely owing to the fact that in 1910 a Labour Government imposed the Federal land tax to which the strongest opposition was taken by that section which now supports this Government in its proposal to abandon it. </para>

              <para>- The transformation in the city of Melbourne, and, I think, the same may be said of other capital cites of the Commonwealth, is largely, if not wholly, due to the operation of the Federal land tax. Large landowners were forced to realize that if they wished to get an adequate return on money invested in city lands, they would have to erect more modern buildings that would bring them in higher rentals. Before the imposition of the tax there were in many parts of Melbourne buildings that had been erected in some cases, for half a century. They were more or less a disfigurement; but with the increase in population, leading to the development of commercial and industrial enterprises, laud values commenced to soar to such an extent that land which was worth Â£600 a foot a few years ago was sold recently for about Â£3,000 a foot. With the rise in values owners found it imperative to erect up-to-date buildings on city allotments. Day after day for months past one has seen old tenements being demolished, four and five story buildings coming down and mighty up-to-date edifices being erected in their place. All this, I submit, is largely due to the effect of the Federal land tax. </para>

              <para>- The same influence has been at work in connexion with large country areas, many of  which  have been subdivided. Considerable areas of land, which prior to the imposition of the tax had been in a more or less virgin state, carrying a certain number of stock, are now permanently occupied by contented and prosperous settlers. The tariff is wrapped up in this question. It has very much to do with the bill. If it were not for the fact that we have, not a protectionist but a revenue tariff, the probabilities are that we should' not have seen this measure, because with a protectionist tariff the revenue from Customs and excise duties should be a declining figure. Can any honorable senator seriously contend that the present tariff, which this year will return to the Commonwealth approximately Â£44,000,000, is protectionist in its incidence? What guarantee is this Ministry giving to the governments of the States that the proposal now before the Senate will be a permanent settlement of the problem involved in the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States? It is true that after the passage of this bill there is to be a conference ; but even if that conference arrives at an 'agreement it will not bind future governments. Who can forecast what the future has in store so far as the parties in this Parliament are concerned ? If, as the result of the next elections, the Labour party is returned, it is as certain as that day follows night that it will enact a truly protective policy, under which revenue from Customs and excise will decrease from year to year. It is certain, also, that it will reimpose the Federal land tax if this Government abandons it. In the circumstances, what guarantee can this Government give the States that the Commonwealth will definitely vacate the field cf direct taxation ? As a matter of fact the Ministry does not propose wholly to do that. It contemplates retaining portion of the income tax, and the whole of the Customs ar-d excise revenue, but  proposes  to abandon the Federal land tax. At whose behest? Did the Government get a mandate from the people to do that? It might have received a mandate from the wealthy land owners of Australia to drop the land tax, but the people did not give them any such mandate. What chance has Victoria of securing anything like the measure of land taxation which operates in the Commonwealth to-day ? It is well known that the Upper House in this State would decline to pass land tax legislation to bring in anything like the revenue that is derived in Victoria from that source by the Commonwealth. If revenue which Victoria has been receiving from the Commonwealth is to be withheld, how will the State Government make good the loss? Since it will be unable to reimpose the same measure of land taxation, the only available field will be income taxation ; and if the exemption be lowered the tax, in its incidence, will impose a heavy burden on every man, woman, and child in the </para>

          <para class="block">State. This course has been hinted at by the Premier, and more than hinted at by the Treasurer of this State. I say definitely, that the people of Victoria are  opposed  to the Government's proposal. The people of this State desire that the bill shall be defeated and that the Commonwealth system of making <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the State, which has operated for 26 years, shall continue. During that period governments of different kinds have been in power in the Commonwealth, but not one suggested or even hinted at proposals such as those which the present occupants of the Treasury bench have advanced. Is it any wonder, then, that the States are up m arms? Every State Treasurer is seriously concerned regarding the future financial position of his State. That can be well understood. I ask any honorable senator to imagine himself. in the position of the Treasurer of a State.- Every State is carrying heavy responsibilities, and is hampered because of the financial stringency that exists. The Victorian Government, anticipating that it would continue to receive the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment from the Commonwealth, mapped out its programme accordingly, and embarked upon huge undertakings. The sudden withdrawal of those payments is bound to cause anxiety and place the States in an awkward position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> tells them, "We shall meet you later and talk over the matter; but under no circumstances can that meeting take place until the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment has been withdrawn." Such a statement is completely at variance with one that has been made by the Federal Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> In effect, the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is that there will not be a conference until the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment has been withdrawn ; that that withdrawal is the beginning and the end of the matter. The Treasurer has said that after the passage of the bill a conference will be held, and the whole matter will be discussed; that the decisions of that conference will be submitted to this Parliament ; and that there is a possibility of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment being restored. If the statement of the Leader of the Senate is to be accepted as correct, what proposals are to be placed before the conference ? Will they embody the principle of "no <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment ; no further imposition by the Federal Government of a land tax ; and partial- withdrawal from the field of income taxation " ? Why should the Government propose to retain 60 per cent, of the income tax? The Commonwealth possesses absolute powers in relation to direct taxation. Why is the Government so anxious to vacate that field? In effect, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that the expenditure of the Commonwealth is mounting </para>
          <para>Hp, and that its responsibilities are becoming greater. That is true; and, being so, 1 cannot understand the proposal to abandon the land tax. The Government has been credited with generosity in having advanced sums to the States for certain specific purposes, such as the purchase of wire netting and the construction of roads. It has also expressed the intention to expend Â£20,000,000 upon a housing scheme. Its desire is to divorce the financial responsibilities of the States and the Commonwealth, and to place upon* the shoulders of the States certain obligations that it is now carrying. Why not be consistent, and allow the States to carry on their businesses in their own way ? What has the Commonwealth to do with wire netting, roads, ,and housing ? They are essentially matters of State concern and responsibility. The argument of the Government is that it is perfectly all right for it to encroach upon the domain of the States in those directions, but that the principle is wrong in its application to the <inline font-style="italic">-per</inline><inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> payment. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> maintains that the system is not right either constitutionally, legally, or morally, and that it should be brought to an end. I expect that his wish will be gratified, because the Government has for the time being made that a part of its policy. The policy speech which was made to the electors did not include the pronouncement that it was intended to discontinue the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. </para>
          <para>I shall not occupy the time of the Senate at any greater length. My reason for rising was to enter a final protest against the measure. It is a bill for which there is no justification or warrant. Its introduction has caused financial unrest among the Treasurers of the States and irritation and hostility on the part of the Governments of the States. If there is one thing that the Commonwealth Government should do after the expiration of 26 years of federation it is to secure closer and more harmonious relations with the States, not introduce legislation that will have the opposite effect. I hope that, when the division is taken, a greater number of honorable senators will oppose the third reading of the bill than was found in opposition to its second reading. </para>

            <para>. - I desire to take advantage of this opportunity to say a final word against the passage of the bill. In the earlier portion of the debate, one would have thought that it was intended to abolish the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment; but when one examined the bill closely and became aware of the intentions of honorable senators it was evident that the idea is to discontinue those payments only in the case of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. Western Australia and Tasmania will continue to enjoy a very substantial grant from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That is an entirely wrong principle to adopt. Had the Government decided to make the abolition complete it would have been on logical ground; but it ought not to expect honorable senators who represent those States from which it is proposed to withdraw the payment to lend their support to it. It has been stated that the Government is actuated by the fact that there are Labour Governments in five of the States; and, furthermore, it realizes that those governments will be able to resort to what is termed unpopular direct taxation. When these payments are discontinued it is obvious that, if those States from which the payment is to be withdrawn are to maintain their existing rate of expenditure they will have to seek other sources of revenue. I do not know whether the different State Governments are fearful of imposing direct taxation. Such a charge cannot be laid against the Treasurer of the State of New South Wales. He brought down a measure which imposed taxation directly upon the most powerful influence in his State - the newspaper influence; but it was declared to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> That is not an indication of fear. The New South Wales Government has introduced a Child Endowment Bill, under which it is proposed to raise the necessary amount of revenue by the taxation of employers to the extent of Â£6,000,000, a year. Those proposals do not indicate any fear on the part of New South Wales to impose direct taxation. As a matter of  fact  the State Government is now seeking to levy a land value tax on estates valued at over Â£10,000. It may be true that other State Governments will be afraid to impose additional direct taxation because the taxpayers are  already  bearing a heavy burden, but time alone will show it. I have some very interesting figures relating to land taxation which ought to be placed on record. One return which was furnished to the Senate some years ago at my request shows that in 1915 the total value of the land in the various States and territories of the Commonwealth was Â£455,876,104. I am afraid, however, that those figures are now out of date, and that for comparative purposes they are of little value. In the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Booh</inline> the land taxation collected in the States and by the Commonwealth in 1924-5 is set out in the following table: - </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">If for no other reason than that the Commonwealth Government has announced its intention to retire from the field of direct taxation, more particularly that of land taxation, I oppose the bill. It is unfair to suggest that the whole of the burden of providing the revenue of the Commonwealth, except that derived from certain nominal forms of income tax, should be placed entirely on the shoulders of those least able to bear it. We have been informed by Senators Greene, Barwell, and others, and it is generally admitted, that taxation through the Customs falls most, heavily on those least able to bear it. We a*e alleged to be living under a protective policy, but there has never been any intention on the part of this Commonwealth Government, or its predecessors, so to arrange Customs taxation, that the revenue from that source will be a declining one. On the contrary, it has been increasing year after year, and we are informed on very good authority that this year we may expect to receive about Â£44,000,000 from Customs and excise duties. It ought to be as clear as noonday that if the goods  which  are taxed, when they come through the Customs provide such an enormous revenue, our protectionist policy, instead of encouraging and protecting local industries, is merely encouraging the landowners of the Commonwealth, and protecting them from direct taxation. But, of course, that is always the object behind Customs taxation; and the proposal to cease collecting from the land-owners of the Commonwealth Â£2,500,000, as some contribution towards the cost of administering the affairs of the country, does not meet with my approval. It may be true, of course, that the States will step into the field and collect a. similar amount through their own land taxes ; but as it will take a considerable time for that to be done, I strongly resent the retirement of the Commonwealth from this field of taxation. If for no other reason than that, I would certainly object to this bill; but, in addition, I regard the measure as absolutely unfair, inasmuch as it singles out for unfair treatment the States of Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland, by refusing to pay them the <inline font-style="italic">par capita</inline> grant, while special grants are paid to Western Australia and Tasmania. </para>

            <para>, - In his address yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> accused the smaller States of holding out their hands foa: doles, and of asking for some form of charity to assist them. He also said that New South Wales did not accept these doles. I should like to remind the honorable senator that the States of Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia have been assisted by the Commonwealth to the extent of Â£2,500,000 to carry out their Murray River waters scheme. To this expenditure the remaining States have had to contribute. New South Wales has also benefited by the bounties on iron and power alcohol, and in other directions. The other States might reasonably ask why they should be taxed through the Customs to give these great benefits to New South Wales. The honorable senator's remark that the smaller States are holding out their: hands for charity was quite besides the question, because New South Wales has participated to a remarkable degree in payments from the </para>

          <para class="block">Consolidated Revenue of the Commonwealth. The direct opposition to this bill has come from State Parliaments, and State parliamentarians. There has been no direct opposition to it from the general mass of the people. I have the honour to be  president  of a Chamber of Commerce, and at the meetings of that chamber not one word has been uttered in opposition to the Government's scheme. La.st week I sat among 250 delegates from various branches of the Victorian Country party, and after the leaders had spoken on the subject there was no further argument on this particular issue. Recently, I had the honour to be the guest of the Wholesale and Retail Produce Merchants' Association in Melbourne, and although 1,900 merchants were represented, during the discussion, not a word was mentioned in opposition to the Government's scheme. I also attended as a guest the conference of the Retail Grocers'" Association of Victoria, at Ballarat, and not one word was mentioned at that conference in opposition to this proposal. I think that this shows conclusively that the people as a whole are not opposed to the Commonwealth Government's scheme. Furthermore, when I met one of the prominent leaders of the State Parliament he told me that he was decidedly against the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> method* of payment, but added, " For God's sake give us some of the revenue you get from" your tariff." On the whole I think that the statement so boldly made that the people are against this bill is entirely wrong. The time has arrived when we must have a more equitable arrangement of the finances of the Commonwealth and the States. Honorable senators have raised their voices against the idea of the enormous revenue derived from Customs and excise duties being solely appropriated by the Commonwealth. But they must bear in mind that the Commonwealth will need at least Â£51,000,000 a year to meet its obligations. The trouble with the States is that they will now be obliged to levy direct taxation, which is decidedly unpopular : that is their reason for opposing this bill. If they could continue to get Â£7,000,000 or Â£8,000,000 from the Commonwealth without having to raise the money themselves, it would lie a beautiful plum for them. But if they have to raise the money themselves by means of direct taxation, they will be  more careful in their expenditure. </para>

              <para>- The point most strongly stressed during the debate is the possibility of the States being financially crippled in consequence of the action which the Government is now taking. The Prime Minister stated in his policy speech that the. Government intended to bring before Parliament the desirability of altering the present financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States, and to summon a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers at which the matter could be discussed. A conference was convened, but when the Commonwealth  proposals  were submitted, the State representatives stated most_ emphatically that they intended to adhere to their moral right. The Government, therefore, had no option but to advise the States that it intended to proceed with its proposal to abolish the <inline font-style="italic">per ca,pita</inline> payment. That is why this measure has been introduced. After the bill becomes law, the State Treasurers are to be given a further opportunity of considering the Commonwealth Government's proposals. This Government has no desire to harass the States in any way. It feels, however that the time has arrived when the whole of the revenue derived from Customs and excise duties will be absorbed by its commitments. When the representatives of the Commonwealth and the States again meet in conference, I believe that a scheme acceptable to both parties will be adopted. Moreover, as the decisions of the conference will have to be ratified by Parliament, the interests of the States should be fully protected. It has been said" that the people of Australia generally, do not desire the proposed alterations; but one newspaper has suggested that the Commonwealth should entirely vacate the field of direct taxation, instead of abandoning land and entertainments tax, estate duties, and 40 per cent, of income taxation. </para>

I stated that in the figures in the bill, which are an estimate, violent fluctuations occur.

I am of the opinion that the amounts should be allocated to the States in such a way that they will not lose. The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments were allocated under the formula used for ascertaining the amounts paid under the Surplus Revenue Act, and we have the assurance that these payments to the States are allocated on the same basis.

            <para>. - Although I am availing myself of my last opportunity to speak on this bill, it is not my intention to repeat the arguments I have previously adduced. We have been told that the main objective of the Government in submitting the measure was to separate Commonwealth and State finances, but although I have no desire to question the motive which prompted the Government, I believe that it is utterly impossible for that to be done. The Minister said that Tasmania and Western Australia, the States with the smallest populations, which are experiencing the greatest financial difficulty, should support these proposals. But those two States, and particularly Tasmania, have been losing population, and, therefore, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system is not of great benefit to them. If these States are, as I have said, losing population, then, under the present proposals of the Government, which I understand, will require the States to impose more direct taxation, they will continue to suffer. The number of taxpayers having decreased, the burden upon those who pay the taxes will be greater. I still maintain that the smaller States will not benefit, and that if the Government vacates certain fields of taxation the States will not be able to obtain the amount the Commonwealth is now collecting. </para>

              <para>-  If Tasmania is to be financially assisted by the Commonwealth, the finances of the Commonwealth and the States will not be separated as the Minister suggests. Why should there be any attempt to discontinue the present satisfactory financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States? State loans are raised through the Loan Council, on which both the Commonwealth and the States are represented - a further indication that there is still a close relation between the two authorities. The more I consider this question, the more I am convinced that it was a mistake to introduce this bill. I shall oppose the third reading. </para>

            <para>. -  To explain my position will take but a few minutes, because my attitude towards the third reading of this measure was foreshadowed in my second-reading speech. I have tried my best to improve the bill in the way in which I think it should be improved. I have done what I could to prevent the Government from committing what, in my judgment, is a very foolish act. Indeed, I have tried my best to give the Government a longer lease of life than I think will be possible with this legislation on the statute-book. But my efforts have been in vain. I regret exceedingly that on an extremely technical point of order the  amendment which I proposed to move was ruled out of order. Had it been accepted, it would hare made much easier the way of the Government in the direction of securing a satisfactory conference with the States. As it is, I very much doubt whether the Commonwealth will ever meet in conference with the States off this matter. Already the States have adopted the attitude of standing still and talking in a mournful tone about their moral right. They are secure for a further twelve months. </para>

But the States will have only a short period of martyrdom, because within twelve months of the 30th June, 1928, when the existing arrangement will cease, there will be a general election. I hope that I am prophesying wrongly when I say that I look forward to that election as being the Armageddon of the Nationalist party. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>. - So far as I can ascertain, the procedure adopted in connexion with this motion is of a novel character. Honorable senators will remember that last year two bills dealing with the Council for Scientific and. Industrial Research were before the Senate. One gave ordinary financial assistance to the newly-established council, and the other established a trust fund. The measure constituting the trust fund appropriated a certain sum of money for the purpose of enabling continuous research to be made along certain lines. It was recognized that, in some directions, it would bo necessary for continuous effort to be made, and, in order that the council would have at its disposal sufficient funds for that purpose, a trust fund was established. That legislation also provided that no money could be taken from the trust fund for the purpose of continuous research without the authority of Parliament, which not only had to authorize the expenditure from the trust fund of the money required by the council for such continuous research, but was also to be made aware of the lines along which such research would be made. It is obvious that the money having once been appropriated under an act of this Parliament,no further appropriation would be necessary. I take it, therefore, that this motion has been introduced with the object of informing the Senate of the directions in which it is proposed that the money from the trust fund shall be spent. In another place, a similar motion has been tabled, so that both Houses of this Parliament may know the lines along which the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research proposes to work. It is proposed to set aside the sum of Â£1,750 for investigation into stock diseases and pests, including cattle tick dips and buffalo-fly. For horticultural,citricultural and viticultural investigations the sum of Â£1,000 is required. Investigations into fruit preservation and cold storage will require Â£1,100, and for the purpose of State committees, sundry investigations and miscellaneous expenditure it is proposed to set aside the sum of Â£6,302. Some objection might be offered to the last item. Perhaps the Minister will inform us how the committees will work, and whether they will travel abroad to make the investigations required of them or whether the item is intended to cover the ordinary expenditure in connexion with continuous research. I admit that the procedure is new, but having referred to the legislation passed last year, I can see the necessity for it. A new appropriation bill cannot be brought in, because, I understand, the money has already been appropriated. We are now informed that the. council requires this additional sum to carry on necessary work. I admit that it is too early yet to expect anything like complete information as to the result of its investigations. The council is, so to speak, in its swaddling clothes ; but later we may expect fairly comprehensive reports concerning the manner in which money voted by Parliament has been expended, and the results of the investigations. If the additional sum asked for were withheld no doubt the work of the council would be crippled because, to he effective, research must be continuous. </para>

          <para class="block">The amendment is merely formal. Its purpose is to put the journals in proper order. As the leader of the Senate has pointed out, the procedure now being adopted is somewhat unusual. The money that was appropriated under an earlier section of the act was paid into a trust account, and it can only be released in conformity with the resolution submitted by the Leader of the Senate. Similar steps must be taken in another place, and to make quite clear what is being done, it has been suggested, and I think the suggestion should be followed, that the amendment which I have submitted should be inserted. </para>

          <para>. - I object to the motion. It refers to the Supply Bill, a copy of which has not yet been placed in the hands of honorable senators. Even if we had been furnished with the print of the bill we should not be asked to suspend the standing and sessional orders to pass it through all its stages without delay. This procedure has the effect of making the Senate a sort of hack for another place. The Supply Bill was exhaustively debated elsewhere, and, as far as I am aware, no motion was submitted for the suspension of the Standing Orders to pass the bill without delay. </para>

            <para>. - I have a few observations to make before the motion for the first reading of the bill is put. Since last we had a Supply Bill before us the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> 'has attended the Imperial Conference as a representative of Australia. I did object then, and I repeat my objection now, that whilst 1 recognized the necessity for Australia as an integral part of the British Commonwealth of Nations being represented by its Prime Minister at that important conference, it was not necessary for Parliament in the meantime to be closed down. There was any amount of work for Parliament to do in the absence of the Prime Minister. The Governor-General's speech at the opening of Parliament shortly after the elections of 1925, indicated that a considerable amount of legislation, some of it important and some unimportant, was contemplated. If the Government had intended to keep its pledges to the people, Parliament could very well have been kept at work to give legislative effect to the Government's pledges.  Instead of that being done the shutters were put up with the result that to-day. nearly seventeen months after the elections, very little of the legislation promised by the Government is on the statute-book. Parliament was not closed down on a former occasion, when another Prime Minister attended the Imperial Conference. Both branches of the legislature continued to function, and some attempt was made to put into operation a policy that had been placed befor&gt;  the people. Could the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">'Mr. Bruce)</inline> not trust his partner in the Composite Ministry <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> ? That honorable gentleman toured the country as acting Prime Minister, indulging  in propaganda work, when he could have utilized his time to better advantage h"7 giving effect in this Parliament to the promises that were made at the last election. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>During his absence <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> made many speeches, some of which were exceedingly interesting. He is reported to have stated in London tha: it would be a good thing if the United States of America joined with the British Commonwealth of Nations in an attempt to preserve the peace of the world. Ho was acclaimed in the press as a saviour, and given the credit of having made an original suggestion. He was not the first man to utter that wish. When he went to the United States of America, however, he made a speech of an entirely different character. He told 'the Americans that they were virtually the salt of the earth. Comparing the speeches that he made in London, New York, and Chicago, with those that he made on the hustings in Australia, one cannot escape the conclusion that with him this country takes second place to the United States of America. On his departure from that country he visited Canada, where he warned the people to beware of the Americans or they would rob them of their trade. He roused the resentment of the leaders of thought in Canada because ho endeavoured to teach them their business. On one occasion the right honorable gentleman spoke also in Glasgow. I worked in close proximity to that city for a number of years, and I am fairly well acquainted with its conditions. A report of that speech appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 29th December, 1926, and it reads - </para>

            <para>We are putting up a plucky fight against the vested interests now dominating our country. "When he appealed to the people in 1925 he did not tell them that vested interests were dominating Australia. What he said here was that the Labour organizations were responsible for that domination, and that it would tend to red revolution. What legislation has been placed upon the statute-book to rid Australia of the dominance of vested interests? None whatever. Since its return to power the only legislation of that nature which, th's Government has placed upon the statute-book is the Crimes Act, that has never been put into operation. The other day I asked how many men had been deported under the provisions of the Crimes Act, and how many organizations had been suppressed. The answer was " none." Yet the Government waa returned to power to carry out the deportation of two men ! It found that it could not deport them. I trust that Australia will not witness an industrial upheaval that will prevent the wheels of industry from revolving; but if there were such an occurrence and an attempt was made to give effect to the provisions of the Crimes Act the Government would discover that that measure is unconstitutional. It is directed solely against those workers of this country who may dare at any time to maintain their rights.

          <para class="block">It will be noticed that there was a considerable increase in the value of the importations during the five years; yet we have been told that the Government is attempting to make Australia self-contained in the matter of defence ! I can imagine in what condition we should be in if, unfortunately, another war broke out, and we were isolated, or in the event of our being attacked by an invading foe. We should have to depend upon the importation of munitions, and risk their loss during transport from overseas countries. It is quite evident that the Government has not paid any attention to the recommendations which were made by the Public Accounts Committee after its investigation into the possibility of Australia manufacturing sufficient munitions to supply its own needs in time of war. Expert evidence was given before that committee which proved that we can manufacture almost every munition that is necessary for the defence of this country. I think it would be wise for the Government to peruse that document carefully to see what may be done to increase the local manufacture of munitions of war for the purpose of Australia's defence. </para>

              <para>- The reason the right honorable gentleman gave us for not having the cruisers built in Australia was the probable cost of construction. We, on this side of the chamber, contended that if cruisers had to be built - which we did not admit- they should be built in Australia by Australian workmen, and as far as practicable from Australian materials. We knew that we had the material, and that Australian workmen had already built the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> It is peculiar now to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> saying that Australia must build her own cruisers at a time when the cost of building them would be no cheaper than it is at present. Recognizing the labour conditions in Australia and the rates of wages paid to Australian artisans ss compared with those paid in Great Britain, we cannot possibly build cruisers here as cheaply as they can be built in Britain. </para>

          <para>I have mentioned these matters in order to show that the Government is not carrying out its promises. Despite the vast amount of money spent on Australian defence, I venture to say that in the event of an attack our defence forces would not be fit to meet it. Since the armistice and up to the end of the present financial year, as much as Â£45,000,000 will have been spent ou defence, not including the Â£4,500,000 set aside for the cruisers. Yet we find <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash only a few months ago saying that our defences are not as they should be. I trust that the Minister, if he replies to this debate, will explain why  the Government is not attempting to make Australia self-contained in the matter of manufacturing  munitons;  why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> has changed front and now tells the people of Great Britain that Australia must build its own cruisers, and that there are reactionary conservatives and no labour troubles here, when during the election he said quite the reverse. </para>
          <para>I wish now to refer to the wireless station on Willis Island, that lonely Pacific outpost, about 800 miles from Cairns, which is so valuable to us foi' meteorological purposes. One of the duties of the three men engaged on the island, who live there for six months of the year without seeing their fellows, is to notify the approach of cyclones. As a result of their work, li,ves and valuable property have been saved. Their timely warnings of the approach of cyclonic disturbances are broadcast in sufficient time to prepare not only mariners, but also people on land to avoid the havoc caused by such visitations. In 1925, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee on its voyage to Papua, I, in company with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> and others, had the opportunity of visiting the island. We were the first white people the men on the island had seen for months. Their only means of recreation was a tennis court, whch  had collapsed, and their library was very small. When we returned to Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> and I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> with a view to asking that something should be done to make the lives of these isolated men a little more pleasant than is now possible. About Â£200 would provide the officers oh the island with a small, up-to-date library, a tenuis court, and possibly a gramophone.. The. officers themselves are not asking for anything luxurious. They are ai fine, type, of Australian manhood,, and, as a matter of fact, they did not put forward any request, for these things that I am suggesting should be. provided for them; but, recognizing their loneliness,. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> and I put the matter before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I believe that the right honorable gentleman did make some representations in regard to the- matter, and I should like to know if anything definite <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> been done. We wi.0 are living in the bcity of Melbourne,, with all' the pleasures and advantages of civilization, a&gt;nd with the' opportunity to indulge in all kinds o-f recreation, should! have some thought for those men who are out on that lonely island, rendering valuable service to the people of Australia. </para>

Because of the opposition raised, or at any rate for some reason or other, those numbers have diminished until, so far as I can ascertain, this police force has almost completely disappeared. I should like to know from the Minister representing the Attorney-General, whether it is still in existence, and, if so, what proportion of the Â£2,980 provided in this Supply Bill, under the heading of Commonwealth Investigation Branch, is used for this particular purpose.

        <para class="block">I direct attention to these figures, as some honorable senators are continually saying that Commonwealth money is being expended on the construction of the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway, towards the cost of which the Commonwealth, New South Wales, and Queensland contribute. The representatives of Western Australia have recently put up a vigorous fight for a subsidy from the Consolidated Revenue to enable the State to pay its way, although it had a surplus last year. For the information of honorable senators, I mention that a sum of Â£3,428,518, out of profits of the Australian Note Issue Fund, was expended on the construction of the east-west line, which,, of course, also benefits South Australia, and that a very substantial sum is not carrying any interest, and has not done so for the last seven years. At 5Â£ per cent., this sum would be returning approximately Â£175,000 a year, which I regard as a very substantial contribution to Western Australia. Although the Western Australian people are assured of a substantial sum such as that provided in the measure which recently passed this Chamber, they also have the use of this sum of Â£3,428,518 free of interest. When reference is being made to a Murray Waters Scheme, and the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway, it is very desirable that an outstanding factor such as this should not be overlooked </para>

            <para>- Then I should like to known how many men are employed, and what progress is being made. 1 have repeatedly urged that the residents of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea should be granted some form of local government; but for reasons which I cannot understand the Government have steadfastly refused to entertain the suggestions I put forward. A somewhat indefinite promise was made some years ago to the effect that the Government had some intention of bringing in a form of local government under which the local white residents would have a voice in the election of members of the advisory council, but up to the present nothing has been done. That is particularly unfair to the white population which has increased considerably since the first sale of the expropriated properties was held. As a form of local government is extended to the white residents in Papua, the men and women in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, who have the same ideals and aspirations as those in Papua, and who, I believe, are more numerous, should be considered. These persons who are carrying out important work far removed from centres of civilization, surely have' a right to elect representatives to the Advisory Council. The residents in the Mandated Territory are very dissatisfied as the regulations and ordinances are framed by officials in Rabaul or in Melbourne. Before the next sale of expropriated properties is held legislation should be introduced giving them the right to elect representatives on the Advisory Council. They should also have direct representation in this Parliament. As the Government has repeatedly refused to give them any form of local government, I understand they have placed their position before the British Government; they rightly contend that they should have a voice in framing the laws under which they live. </para>

          <para>It is quite evident that the Government and the Federal Capital Commission are determined to continue <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> prevent the settlement and progress of Canberra by steadfastly refusing to make available a sufficient number of building sites to meet local requirements. Two sales have been held, but many of those who purchased building sites at the first sale had either no intention of building or acquired blocks with a view to disposing of them to others who might wish to build. According to information supplied by the Home and Territories Department, 252 residential blocks and 104 business blocks had been allotted up to August 1926, and up to the same date twenty residential and three business blocks had been transferred by the original lessees. That information was supplied on the 15th February this year, but it  gives  the figures only up to the date mentioned. I am not acquainted with the subsequent transactions, but, in any case, the Government or the commission, whichever is responsible, by its refusal to make available a sufficient number of building sites, has retarded the progress of the city. Up to date, 356 building sites have been disposed of. Of these many have been transferred at high premiums, notwithstanding that no buildings had been erected on them. In one instance, I believe that a premium exceeding Â£1,000 was paid in respect of one block. It was never contemplated that that would be possible at Canberra. The general belief was that a sufficient number of building sites would be made available  to meet requirements. Were the disposal of land in the Federal Capital City in the hands of private enterprise, leases would be made available to the highest bidder. </para>
          <para class="block">Moreover, the Government, by providing that reappraisement shall not take place for twenty years, has prevented fair rentals from being obtained for the land. Even in connexion with the forthcoming sale early in April, it is provided that a period of twenty years shall elapse before reappraisement takes place. In fixing an upset price for the blocks, the commission has made a mistake. The leasehold of the land should be disposed of to the highest bidder, and a sufficient number of blocks made available to meet requirements. Because of the policy adopted in connexion with building sites at the Federal Capital, greater progress has taken place in the neighbouring town of Queanbeyan than at Canberra. It is true that the commission has built a number of houses, but it should also have made better provision to enable persons desiring building sites to obtain them. I hope that the matters to which I have referred will receive the early and earnest attention of the Government. </para>

            <para>. - I bring before the .notice of the Government the . desirability of increasing the grant for the provision of airways in Western Australia. During last session a deputation, comprising Western Australian members, waited upon <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Howse, with a request that a further sum of approximately Â£7,000 per annum should be provided to enable the existing air service which now terminates at Derby to be extended, via Hall's Creek, to Wyndham. The Minister informed the deputation that no money was available for the purpose. I submit that the importance of that portion of the Commonwealth warrants provision now being made along the lines I have indicated. Residents there are now dependent on a very erratic mail service by steamer; if they are fortunate, they receive a mail about once a month. The people of Western Australia are very proud of Western Australian Airways Limited. Visitors from the eastern States and other countries have stated that the air services in Western Australia tire unsurpassed in any part of the world. It is unfortunate that, for the sake of an additional expenditure of Â£6,000 or Â£7,000 per annum, the people beyond Derby should be without proper means of communication. </para>

            <para>[4.11] .  -  I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> that the meteorological station at Willis Island is of great value to Australia. As honorable senators are aware, a disastrous cyclone recently caused considerable havoc along the coast of Queensland.. The indications along the coast were that conditions were normal; but, in consequence of information received from the meteorological station at Willis Island, it was possible to give 48 hours' warning to shipping and to persons living along the coast of the approach of the disturbance. The honorable senator asked that some comforts should be provided for the officers who man that station. On the representation of some honorable - senators, this matter was considered by the Government during the period of Government control of the station, but at that time the transfer of the control to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited was imminent, and the Postmaster-General was not prepared to authorize the expenditure. The question  is now one which should be dealt with by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. </para>

I can conceive of nothing that would do more to hamper development by discouraging people from building in Canberra than a proposal of that nature, because the lessees would not know from one year to the next what would be the valuation of their leases. </para>

          <para class="block">That the bill be now read a second time. </para>
          <para class="block">The purpose of the bill is to appropriate revenue to carry on the ordinary services of the Commonwealth for the first three months of the next financial year. It is usual for a Supply Bill to be submitted just prior to the end of a financial year, or early in the new year; but owing to the transfer of Parliament to Canberra it is impossible, on this occasion, to follow ordinary procedure. Honorable senators are aware that the first meeting of the Parliament at Canberra will take place on the 9th of May, but it is anticipated that only formal business will then be conducted. The date of the further meeting of Parliament at Canberra for the resumption of ordinary business has not yet been decided. It will require some months to complete the transfer of Government departments and records to the new seat of government. That disorganization will be at its height at the end of the present month, and in the early months of the next financial year. It is highly desirable that the departments should be property settled down before Parliament resumes, and it seems quite likely that this will take three months. In the circumstances it will not be possible to prepare and submit Estimates so readily as has been the practice in recent years. It is therefore necessary that Parliament should now grant supply for three months of the new financial year, as existing appropriations of revenue for the ordinary purposes of government will lapse on the 30th of June next. The amount appropriated by this bill is Â£ 5, 851, 495, made up thus: - Â£2,212,460 for departments and services other than business undertakings and territories of the Commonwealth ; Â£2,566,735 for business undertakings; Â£72,300 for the territories of the Commonwealth; Â£250,000 for refunds of revenue; and Â£750,000 for advance to Treasurer. The items are based on the appropriations by Parliament for the current financial year. Mo new services  are included.  In the case of salaries, the amounts cover the pay-day which falls on the 7th of October. The ordinary services provided for total Â£4,851,49.5, which is slightly less than one-fourth of the total appropriation of Â£19,793,023 for these services for the current financial year. In addition, provision is made for refunds of revenue, Â£250,000; and advance to the Treasurer, Â£750,000. The advance to the Treasurer is in accord with the usual practice, and is necessary to meet unforeseen requirements; also to carry cm works in progress at the 30th of June next, which will subsequently be cowered by the Additions, New Works, and Buildings Estimates for 1927-28. It is hoped .that the budget will be brought down  immediately  after Parliament meets at Canberra in the next financial year. In the meantime I may say that the results for the .present financial year, to date, are satisfactory. The budget estimate of expenditure should not be exceeded in the total, and the indications are that there will be an increase in revenue beyond what was anticipated. This is due to the Customs and excise, particularly to the heavy imports of motor vehicles, and increases under apparel and textiles, and machinery. </para>

            <para>.- I should like to know if the Minister is in a position to make a definite statement in connexion, with the report of the Public Works Committee presented to Parliament last year with regard to the transfer of public servants to Canberra. iU.p to the present there has been no indication of the action which the government proposes to .take upon that report. As far as I can gather the Public Service Canberra Committee is also  in  .the dark. As Parliament will close this week, it is highly desirable that the Government should make a -statement dealing with the rentals, housing accommodation, and other subjects which so vitally affect the public servants who are about to be compulsorily transferred to Canberra. </para>

            <para>. - The cost of living at Canberra was the subject of reference to a special committee. Considerable correspondence has passed  betwen  the Government and the Public Service Board on the subject. Under the Public Service Act it is the function of the board to fix allowances to members of the Public Service. Recently it issued statutory rule No. 22, which was approved by the Executive Council on the 1st March, and gazetted. That rule sets out the  scale  of allowances to be paid to public servants as follows : - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The factors governing the allowances include the following - </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="1.">
              <para>Salary, for the purpose of this regulation, shall be deemed to be the salary payable to this officer on 1st July, 1927, provided that, in the case of an officer transferred prior to July, 1927, salary until that date shall be deemed to be the salary received at date of transfer. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="2.">
              <para>If, in the opinion of the board, the provisions of this regulation should be applied m the case of any officer transferred to Canberra prior to the date of this regulation, allowance as prescribed in this regulation may be paid the officer from a date to be determined by the board. </para>

          </list>
          <para>The preamble to the regulation is interesting. It reads - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whereas the special circumstances attending the transfer of departments to a newly-established city will necessarily involve, at the outset, additional expense to compulsorily-transferred officers of those departments in relation to housing and living : </para>
            <para>And whereas it is expedient that officers transferred to Canberra in these special circumstances should receive special allowances : </para>
            <para>Now, therefore, the Board of Commissioners appointed under the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Public Service. Act</inline> 1922-1924, in pursuance and exercise of the authority conferred upon it by the said Act, and subject to the approval of the Governor-General, hereby makes the following amendment of the regulations, such amendment to come into operation forthwith. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The preamble is to guard against this being taken as a precedent; otherwise it could be argued that when an officer was compulsorily transferred from one part of the Commonwealth to another he should be entitled to a special allowance, if he had to face a higher cost of living. Transfers of officers of the Commonwealth are frequently made, and it often happens that a higher cost of living rules in the part of the Commonwealth to which an officer is transferred. He is not entitled to an allowance because of that fact; but he has a right to show cause why he should not be transferred. In the case of the transfer to Canberra, no such right will exist, because the transfer of whole departments will be involved. Thus this transfer has been treated as a special case, and allowances have been fixed by the Public Service Board. I have not heard of any protest against them. </para>

          <para class="block">I take this step to draw attention to the action of the Government in having caused an award of the Public Service Arbitrator to be disapproved by the Senate. The matter can properly be brought up on this vote, because it includes a provision for the office of the Public Service Arbitrator. An award of that official has been disapproved by the Senate, and its benefits are denied to those to whom it would otherwise have applied. The only excuse put forward by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> when moving for the dis allowance of the award, was that it was opposed to the policy of the Government. He did not show that the Public Service Arbitrator had broken any regulation, or contravened any section of the Public Service (Arbitration.) Act. It would be unwise to allow such a dangerous precedent to pass without challenge. It is true that the matter was determined by a vote of the Senate; but I believe that we can now make a practical and effective protest against the action of the Government in constituting Parliament an industrial court. This is the first occasion in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament that that has been done. Time and again members of this and previous Governments, as well as members of all shades of political opinion, have expressed the belief that Parliament should not be constituted an industrial court, because other machinery has been provided for the settlement of the wages and working conditions of the employees of not only the Commonwealth Government but also private employers. I refer to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, under which has been established an arbitration tribunal before which can appear representatives of the employers and the employees ; and the Public Service (Arbitration) Act, under which the Public Service Arbitrator was appointed for the purpose of hearing applications by employees of the Commonwealth Government. The decisions of both tribunals are made upon the evidence that is given before them. After the Public Service Arbitrator had made an award that vitally affected members of the Public Service this branch of the national legislature was turned into a chamber of industrial review, and summarily disapproved or disallowed that award without hearing any evidence from the people who were directly affected.. </para>

              <para>- I am not concerned with the desirability or otherwise of retreating. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> is prepared to accept the verdict that has been given, I am not. This is the time and the place to register a more practical protest than any which has so far been made. It has been frequently stated that organizations of employees in Australia have rebelled against and refused to obey awards of the Arbitration Court. I believe there are on record isolated instances of such a revolt and disregard of awards of the Arbitration Court. But there are also on record cases of revolt by employers, who have adopted the practice of locking out their employees. Both sides, in that respect, are equally blameworthy. The Government, however, should set an example to those who are engaged privately in the carrying on of industry, and should not summarily exercise its authority to render null and void an award of an arbitrator, based on evidence submitted to him, when the parties affected have no chance to be heard. I repeat that the only excuse of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was that it was against Government policy. That policy, as enunciated by the Leader of the Government, and published broadcast throughout Australia, embodied a proposal relating to childhood endowment. Therefore, the Public Service Arbitrator did not offend against the policy of the Government, bub, on the contrary, acted in accordance with it. I emphasize the fact that a dangerous precedent has been established. The vital point upon which I lay stress is that if it is right that the Commonwealth Parliament should be constituted an industrial tribunal, it is also right that the people upon whom it proposes to pass judgment should be enabled to appear before it and state their case, just as they were given the right to appear before the Public Service Arbitrator who made the award. </para>

In the first place, under legislation passed by this chamber, any award of the Public Service Arbitrator is open to the review of which the honorable senator complains. Statutory provision is made for the disallowance of any awards, and, if an award is out of harmony with the policy of the Government, the step that was taken the other day will be taken again. If the Public Service Arbitrator had proposed to reduce to Â£400 the limit at which child endowment is paid, would we have heard from the honorable senator one word of protest if we moved to disallow ? Despite our violation, as the honorable senator puts it, of a settled principle, no precedent has been created. We have done no more than the law allows in our endeavour to harmonize the position in the Public Service with the policy previously laid down by us. In any case, the matter was settled in this chamber only a few days ago. </para>

For instance, investigating officers are employed to obtain information in regard to invalid and old-age pensions. Of course, at Canberra, it will probably be necessary to have Federal police. </para>

              <para>- The only way in which to arrive at a fair valuation is to take, as a basis, the prices received at auction. I come now to the next recommendation, <inline font-style="italic">(d) "</inline> Reduce cost of fencing." The cost in this direction has been reduced, (e) " Extend period of rental purchase to 45. years." The Government is not prepared to act on this recommendation, as it considers 35 years an adequate period. The depreciation on a wooden house, for instance, in 45 years, would be considerable, and, on the other hand, many public servants are not likely to reside even in brick houses for 45 years. (/) " Arrange for Federal Capital Commission to carry its own fire insurance." The commission has considered the question of fire insurance, but has not yet come to a definite decision, <inline font-style="italic">(g) "</inline> Eliminate at option of purchaser Â£135', charged for extras, leaving occupier to provide them under supervision." That recommendation has been acted upon, <inline font-style="italic">(h) "</inline> Reduce overhead and supervision charges to 2Â£ per cent." The commission is npt prepared to act upon the recommendation, as it considers a charge of 4^ per cent, fair and reasonable. As a matter of fact, the original rate was 7^ per cent., which was subsequently reduced to 4$ per cent. No architect would prepare plans and specifications and supervise the construction of a building' on less than a 6 per cent, basis, and many would charge 8 per cent. (?) " Provide for officials receiving salary of Â£400 and under, brick cottages of the standard of the War Service Homes Commission." Additional provision has been made for houses of a cheaper type to be constructed for officers in receipt of comparatively low salaries, <inline font-style="italic">(j)</inline> "Allow officials in receipt of Â£400 and under to select timber dwellings provided that not more than 5 per cent, of such dwellings are allowed in any brick group." The Government does not propose to interfere with the commission's policy by permitting the construction of timber houses in brick areas. <inline font-style="italic">(k) "</inline> Reduce the cost of smaller types of concrete houses to at least 15 per pent, below the cost of similar brick houses." The UtmOSt efforts are being made by the commission to reduce the cost of construction to the lowest point possible.

            <para>.- From the answers given by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Glasgow)</inline> it would appear that the Government has not realized the importance of these recommendations. For instance, it should be remembered that blocks sold in open competition often carry a fictitious value, the cost of which has to be borne by public servants, who do not purchase with the idea of making a profit, but with the sole intention of securing a home sit?. Under the present system, hovever, they are compelled to pay unduly high prices, such as are paid by persons who may be speculators. The rates paid will be based on the value of the land, which is unnecessarily high, and consequently public servants will be further penalized. These charges are equivalent to a reduction in salary. The value of the blocks should be based on the price at which tha Government acquired the land </para>

              <para>- The public servants are being required to pay fictitious prices for their land. The increased capital value of their holdings will mean that they must pay increased taxes and rates. The public servants will go to Canberra, not with the object of trading in land, but because they will be compulsorily transferred there. They will remain there until they die or leave the service. We should approach this matter as sensible men. What does it matter to a man if the value of the land on which he has his house increases to Â£50 a foot? It is of no use to him. </para>

In that case, why should the public servant have to pay for it in 35 years ? The members of the Public Service were fairly well satisfied with the committee's recommendation that the term should be 45 years.

              <para>- In the case of private architects, building houses of varying types in different localities, 4$ per cent, might be a reasonable charge, but not in the case of standard houses such as are being constructed at Canberra by the commission. Many of the commission's houses can only be described as disgraceful. They are no credit to their designers. Throughout them all there is a great similarity of design. Moreover, seeing they are being built under what may be described as mass production methods, the overhead expenses should be a great deal less than the rate charged by the commission. Two and a half per cent, would be quite sufficient to charge. </para>

              <para>- In the early days of its history, when houses were rushed up to meet the great demand, many of them were badly constructed, but that is not the case with the homes erected -during recent years. The commission also has prohibited the construction of timber houses in certain areas. Some honorable senators approve of the prohibition, but the time is not far distant when in Canberra there will be in operation a caste system worse than that of India. In one area w;e shall find only those officers whose salary exceeds Â£800 per annum, and in another those in receipt of from Â£500 to Â£800 per annum. Those officers who receive between Â£300 and Â£500 will be found elsewhere, in another area, while in yet another district will be found those whose salary is less than Â£300. In one section of the city we shall find the aristocrats, in another the proletariat, and between them  the bourgeois. Is that what we should expect in a city controlled by a democratic Parliament? The Government has made a mistake in acceding to the request of the commission to prohibit the construction of timber houses in certain ai-eas. It will mean that the officers in receipt of small salaries will be forced to reside in some back gully. It would do no harm to permit the construction of a percentage of timber houses among those constructed of brick. The Minister knows that in Queensland there are very few brick houses, and that if properly maintained timber houses will last for 60 years or more. </para>

              <para>- My house in Queensland which is about 45 years old, is practically as good to-day as when it was erected, and that is true of hundreds of houses in the State. The climate of Canberra may be a little more severe on timber houses than that of Queensland, but a timber house at Canberra should last for many years. This prohibition in relation to timber houses will result in Canberra being divided into watertight compartments based on the salaries of the public servants who will live in them. I do not advocate the construction of inferior timber houses among brick houses of much greater value. In this matter a little discretion would overcome all the difficulties. It would be a good thing for Canberra to allow more timber houses to be erected. </para>

            <para>. - I have before me a plan of the latest land subdivision at Canberra. Honorable senators will remember that about six months ago in this Senate I protested against the delay in making available further blocks, and pointed out that the few thrown open caused profiteering on the part of those who had secured leases. In answer to my protest the commission stated there was no demand for a greater number, notwithstanding that I had shown conclusively that high premiums were being paid on blocks which had been leased. However, after a period of twelve months, additional land is being made available. Honorable senators will probably be surprised to know that only twelve blocks are to be offered at the auction. </para>

              <para>- Yes; blocks for retail trading purposes. Evidently the commission  thinks that only twelve persons want to secure business sites at Canberra. I invite the attention of the Senate to the upset price fixed by the commission in respect of those blocks. For blocks measuring 20 ft. by 108 ft. the upset price is Â£1,000. </para>

              <para>- They are in the business area in the vicinity of the civic centre. I think honorable senators will agree that in obtaining Â£20,000 per acre for land which cost Â£4 an acre the Government is making a tremendous profit. It may be said that the land has appreciated in value because of the construction of streets by the commission, but I remind the Senate that twelve months ago land in the same area was sold for  Â£400 a block. It is difficult to see how the commission can justify its action in increasing the upset price by 150 per cent. </para>

              <para>- No; that is the upset price fixed by the commission. There is no private land available there; the commission does not allow a re-sale. As a matter of fact, people, in order to realize a profit, are attempting by a subterfuge to get over the commission's interdiction. In place of a straight-out transfer a mortgage of 90 per cent. of the value of a lease is taken, on the understanding that the transfer will be completed as soon as buildings have been erected. The price placed on these new subdivisions represents a premium on former sales, and will make possible a tremendous profit for those who were fortunate enough to buy at the early auction sales. Under the conditions of sale, the purchaser of a block, say, at Â£1,000, does not put up that amount in cash; he pays only 5 per cent. on the capital value each year. </para>

              <para>- Not necessarily, because a certain number of people are determined to start business in Canberra, and, if the number of business sites available is limited, they will he forced to pay exorbitant prices. They fear, judging by previous experience, that if they do not buy at the approaching auction sale, they will have to wait another twelve months before further leases are available. The policy of the commission is worthy of the most experienced of land boomers in </para>

          <para class="block">Sydney, Melbourne, or elsewhere. Honorable senators should realize what this will mean. High prices for leases must necessarily lead to an increase in the cost of living at Canberra. Imagine a business man, such as a baker, having to pay Â£50 a year ground rent on blocks in their present rough state. In some cases it is necessary to excavate the overburden to a depth of 4 feet before a. brick can be laid. An investor must get 6 per cent at least on his money. It would be unreasonable to expect any man to be content with less than that. </para>

              <para>- That is another matter altogether. I am com plaining about the upset price of the blocks about to be offered, and also because only a limited number will be offered. Apparently business men are to be herded in one particular locality. Because other blocks are not to be made available, it is a case of take it or leave it. Every one knows the position of the Commonwealth Bank. A free site was reserved for that institution, but the building conditions required the erection of premises that would cost about Â£500,000, and the banking chamber, according to one of the officials, would be so large that, to put it in his words, the bank could not afford to warm it, so all the officials would have to freeze in the winter. To get over the difficulty, the Commonwealth Bank bid at auction against the Australian Mutual Provident Society for another lease, and the price went to Â£7,000.When the Australian Mutual Provident Society's representative learned who had secured the lease he said he would have given up the contest much earlier if he had known he was up against the resources of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

              <para>- Some were fortunate enough to obtain leases at the upset price ; but in one case an ambitious squatter, who was anxious to get a particular site, ran the price up to Â£3,000. All this competition would have been prevented if, instead of allowing only a limited number of blocks to be sold in one civic centre, more had been made available at the time. Obviously it has been the policy of the commission to stimulate competition for the limited number of leases that are offered from time to time. I should have had nothing to say if private speculators had been operating on their own account;but I protest against the Federal Capital Commission adopting the policy of the land monopolist. It has control of the entire area. Before a man can put a pick in the ground he must go cap in hand to the commission for permission to build. I shall have pleasure later in introducing a bill to compel every member of Parliament to buy a. lease in Canberra. They will then begin to appreciate the pin pricks on the principle that the toad beneath the harrow knows where every separate tooth point goes. </para>

              <para>- It is the duty of members of the Senate to protect the people from the unfair tactics of the Federal Capital Commission. This plan of subdivision for the next sale of leases only reached me to-day, so that I have not had time to carefully study it; but a glance at the upset prices fixed for the small number of sites to be offered convinces me that the Government would be well advised if it went carefully into the matter with a valuator from Sydney or Melbourne to ascertain if the prices fixed are fair and reasonable. It is not a fair policy that the commission should limit the number of blocks to be offered. </para>

            <para>. -I have spoken several times upon this subject, and the statement just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> who has been supplied with a lithograph plan of leases proposed to be sold shortly, affords me an opportunity to make further remarks. I say, without fear of contradiction, that by acquiescence in the policy of the Federal CapitalCommission the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Glasgow)</inline> and this Government are crucifying Canberra. The commission after a lapse of twelve months, is now proposing to make available only twelve sites for retail trading. Evidently the commission, backed up by  the  Minister and the Government, is  determined to prevent settlement at the Federal Capital. Judging by the prices to be charged for the leases, the obvious purpose is to drive into the bankruptcy court all who dare to commence business in Canberra under such conditions. The date of the sale has been fixed for the 9th April next. The upset price of the several blocks to be made available is shown on the plan. I am not objecting to that, but I do object to the action of the commission in not offering a sufficient number of leases. I am not sure what the Canberra city and suburban area is, but I understand it is about 64 square miles. In that area the Commission proposes to offer at the forthcoming auction only twelve small sites for retail trading. It makes one think that the commission is trying to repeat in Canberra the disgraceful slum conditions to be found in some of our capital cities. The commission should be definitely informed that more leases must be made available, and that the public shall have the right to fix the upset price at auction. </para>

              <para>- That number might prove more than sufficient with the upset price so high. That price need only be fixed high enough and no one will buy. Canberra has been deliberately and persistently crucified by this Government ever since it has been in office. It is impossible for people to pay the prices that are placed upon the blocks by the commission. I have read something of the early history of South Australia when land could be bought for 10s. an acre. As soon as migrants ascertained that fact they ceased to work for others and became land-owners. What was the result ? The men who had charge of the affairs of the State said, " This is no good to us. We want these men to remain in our employment and not to work on their own account." The price of land was increased to Â£1 an acre so as to prevent men from procuring home sites and farms. That objective was successful. At Canberra a determined effort, which has succeeded most admirably, has been made to prevent settlement. Nothing was more certain to achieve that object than the limitation of the number of blocks made available and the placing upon them of a fictitious, exorbitant, outrageous, shamefully high upset price. Since the Federal Capital city has been open for settlement the advance in Queanbeyan has been ten times as great. Why ? Because the land in that town is not held out of use as it is in Canberra. </para>

              <para>- I agree that it is. On the other hand, the only possible way of fixing a price is to follow market values. The Public Works Committee recommended that repayments by public servants should be spread over a period of 45 years. I point out that -under the War Service Homes scheme, which is one of the most liberal housing schemes in the Commonwealth, the period allowed for repayment in the case of brick houses is 35 years. Again I inform honorable senators that originally the overhead charge was 7 per cent., and that it was reduced to 4i per cent. It was not found possible to reduce it to as low as 2$ per cent as recommended. Honorable senators must remember that interest has to be paid upon the money involved from the time a building is commenced until it is completed. Certain other charges have to be met, and the Government felt that it could not go below 4$ per cent. Even if permission were given to erect wooden houses in brick areas, that would not have the effect of reducing the cost, because they would be built in an area where the blocks were dear. Replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> I submit that the commission is justified in obtaining a reasonable price for its land. </para>

            <para>. - I  believe that a great injustice is being done to the public servants who have to remove to Canberra. In fixing the value of the blocks upon which residences are erected, the commission has been guided almost entirely- by the prices that have been paid at public auction by private individuals. That principle is wrong. The commission should differentiate between the person who is compulsorily obliged to acquire a residence at Canberra, in order that he may help in the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth, and the person who settles there of his own free will or acquires land merely for speculative purposes. </para>

              <para>- Does the Minister know of any instance where the War Service Homes Commission has fixed on land upon which war service homes have been built, a value equivalent to the price that the land would have brought in open competition ? At Willoughby, one of the suburbs of Sydney, there is a beautiful soldier settlement in close proximity to the city where the soldiers were charged for fair-sized building lots about Â£70 or Â£80 a block. When the buildings were erected, those blocks would have brought in open competition anything from Â£150 to Â£250. </para>

              <para>- We shall all have to recognize that the cost of living at Canberra will be considerably higher than it is in other places in Australia except, perhaps, the Northern Territory . and other very remote parts. Every move on the part of the commission will accentuate that position. Why should Â£1,000 be charged for a 20-ft. frontage in the business centre when the upset price of those retail trading blocks a year or two ago was only Â£400 ? There should be a limit to that kind of thing. I rose to protest against the exorbitant price of blocks for public servants compulsorily transferred to Canberra. Special consideration should be given to them, so that the rent of the blocks they occupy may be as low as possible. </para>

            <para>. -  I object to civil servants being singled out for special treatment by the Federal Capital Commission. It would be manifestly unfair to give the public servants homes at Â£4 per acre, the price at which the land was originally bought; but it would be far better to do that than to have the land lying vacant. If I were in charge of the Territory, *I would immediately release the whole of the city sites at whatever price I could get for them, always reserving the right to reappraise the rentals at fixed intervals and more frequently than every twenty years. The residents of Canberra should pay to the commission the full rental value of the land they occupy; the commission should be satisfied with a fair rental value, and more blocks should be made available. But that is precisely what it will not do. Apparently it makes residental areas or business blocks available solely with the determination to prevent businesses from being established at Canberra or prevent homes from being erected there. No progress can take place in the Territory until blocks are made available in sufficient numbers and at a reasonable price, but they are not being made available at a reasonable price when the commission asks a rental of Â£50 a year for a block 20 feet by 108 feet. </para>

              <para>- I want to know why the Minister should back up the commissioners in their determination to secure a fictitious price for this land. If more blocks were made available, there would be more settlement. By withholding blocks the commission succeeds in preventing settlement, and I am at a loss to understand why this is done. Is it to make Canberra unpopular ? Or is it to provide an excuse for charging civil servants who are compelled to go to Canberra a higher rental than they would otherwise pay? Whether that he the objective or not, it is most certainly the result of the action taken by the commission. For instance, it is absurd, as in this instance, to make available only twelve retail trading' sites for a city like Canberra. </para>

              <para>- Some time ago Parliament devoted an all-night sitting to the consideration of a proposal to locate the proposed arsenal at a point on the outskirts of the territory where hundreds of blocks were to be offered for sale. There ought to be a desire on the part of Parliament to give Canberra a fair deal. We ought to compel the commission to cease withholding building blocks from the public. What would be thought if a relative of the Chief Commissioner purchased a block such as mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> and the commissioner refused to make further blocks available until that which his relative was holding had been sold at a high figure. I do not suggest for a moment that that has been done. This Parliament would not tolerate such action. Supposing a relative of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Glasgow)</inline> was the lessee of one of the blocks mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> and the Minister directed that no further blocks were to be made available until the one in question had been sold for Â£1,000. The action of the Minister or the commissioner would not be countenanced for a moment. We ought to lay it down clearly and definitely that blocks should be made available at a reasonable rental in sufficient numbers to meet present requirements. There should be no upset price fixed by the commission; blocks should be sold by auction to the highest bidder, and subsequent reappraisements at frequent intervals should be made. If the present practice is continued for 50 years, the rental of blocks, instead of being Â£1 per week, will be Â£100 per week. We should insist upon a discontinuance of this " dog-in- the  manger " attitude in order that Canberra may have an opportunity to develop in a proper and business-like way. </para>

            <para>. - Some days ago I asked the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Glasgow)</inline> a very important question regarding Canberra to which I desired a prompt answer. As I feel that there has been ample time in which to furnish a reply, and as I am particularly anxious that the information should be available before Parliament adjourns, I am taking this opportunity to place before the Minister what appears to be the reliable information upon which I based my question. I am anxious to ascertain the actual facts. I am informed that at Acton, in the Federal Capital Territory, on an area specially reserved for university purposes, a certain privileged public servant has been allotted a building site, and that the framework of his house is at present being erected. Other public servants who have made application for land in this locality have been denied this privilege, but this specially favoured officer has been granted the concession which other public servants have been denied. </para>

              <para>- Yes; it would be a most improper thing to do. I do not see why even a highly placed public servant should be allotted a site on an area 2-eserved for university buildings, even although it may not be required for that purpose for. some years. If an area reserved for educational institutions is being frittered away by allowing certain persons special privileges it is not a proper way in which to conduct public business. If the commission is guilty, it is certainly not doing its duty to the people of Australia. I mention this matter now, because I feel that I should have received a telegraphed reply to an urgent question. If the commission desired to give the information it could have been made available the next day, but I understand a reply has not yet reached the Minister. Is the commission covering up this little bit of business that is going on ? Is it the intention of the commission to withhold this information until Parliament adjourns ? If that is the intention we shall not have the opportunity to properly discuss this matter until towards the end of this year, when this cottage will have been completed and it will be too late for decisive action to be taken. I trust the Minister will again communicate with the commission by telegraph, and urge upon it the absolute necessity of immediately despatching a telegraphic reply to my question. </para>

              <para>- It is an extravagant statement. If the honorable senator believes what he says, he should, as a New South Wales representative, immediately take some action. I think it only fair to say that the Government is very fortunate in having such a capable commission. It is generally conceded that the  chairman  is one of the most brilliant men in Australia. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gorman,</inline> who was, until his death, a member of the commission, specialized in various branches of the work in which the commission is engaged, and was recognized as one of the most able authorities in New South Wales on the subject of land values. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Harrison, another member of the commission, is a highly competent Sydney builder, and has rendered valuable assistance in drawing up the system under which building blocks are made available. A large number of people in Australia over-estimate the present value of Canberra as a business centre. What would be the position if those on the spot, who know the position, did not regulate the number of blocks to be made available. The possibilities are that the bulk of these business sites would be taken up, and certain, ambitious purchasers would endeavour to carry out the special conditions attached to the leases, with the result that businesses would be established everywhere. It would not be long before the persons controlling them realized that the sites were not of the value anticipated, and we would have large numbers of vacant shops, such as are seen in some portions of the metropolitan area. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">It is fitting that the Federal Parliament, before leaving Melbourne, should express to the Government, the Parliament, and the people of Victoria, its appreciation of their hospitality in granting to it the use of these magnificent buildings during the last 26 years. The Commonwealth has been treated generously by the Parliament of Victoria, and the relations between the two legislatures have, on the whole, been of a most cordial character. I believe that I speak for every honorable senator when I say that we deeply appreciate the public spirit that prompted the offer of these buildings to the Parliament of the Commonwealth at the inception of federation, and the maintenance of that spirit in granting us their continuous use ever since. The Government desires to make some recognition of the action of the State of Victoria. It, therefore, proposes to ask Parliament to vote the sum of Â£50,000 to be spent on these buildings in such a way as to constitute a permanent memorial of the fact that for the first quarter of a century in the - history of the Commonwealth, the national Parliament met in them. It is also proposed, with the consent of the Government and the Parliament of Victoria, to place in a suitable position in the buildings a tablet on which will be recorded that important historial fact. We feel that before we leave this city, which for over 26 years has been the temporary seat of the Commonwealth Government, we should invite the members of the Parliament of Victoria to meet us so that we may have the opportunity to convey to them, and thus to the people of Victoria, our appreciation of Victoria's treatment  of the Federal Parliament. To that end it is proposed to hold a banquet in Queen's Hall, to which the members of the Victorian Parliament will be invited. There is no need for me to say more. 1 feel sure that the motion will receive the unanimous support of honorable senators, and that it will be accepted by the Parliament, the Government and the people of Victoria as a genuine expression of our appreciation of the spirit in which their generous offer was made, and in which we have accepted their hospitality during the first quarter of a century of this nation's history. </para>

          <para>in connexion with our occupancy of these buildings. It would have been most discourteous on our part had we vacated them without in some way placing on record our very grateful appreciation, and our thanks to the Parliament, the Government, and the people of Victoria for having made available to the Commonwealth Parliament these palatial buildings at a time when it was houseless and homeless. Without any condition other than that they were to be handed back in good order and repair, Victoria placed these buildings at the disposal of the Commonwealth. In such circumstances, it is only fitting that we should record our thanks for its most generous gift. We leave this place with mingled feelings of pleasure and regret - pleasure at the recollection of having enjoyed the hospitality of the Parliament and the people of Victoria; regret that our association with them, for the time being, will be severed. We shall carry with us the historical associations of these buildings. They have echoed not only the voices and sentiments of the men who were primarily responsible for the federation of the six States, but also the voices of those who preceded them, and within these buildings laid the foundation of Victoria's present prosperity. Every honorable senator on this side of the chamber heartily appreciates the generosity and hospitality of the </para>

When we first entered them the Commonwealth was a nation in its swaddling clothes. Since then it has passed from childhood to youth, and from youth to lusty manhood, until to-day it is in the full noon of its nationhood. We leave these buildings for our own home in our own place. In the nation's own Parliament House history will continue to be made. I hope - and I know that my hope is echoed by every member of this Parliament - that the progress which this young nation has made in the 26 years during which its Parliament has met in these buildings will continue after we gather in our new home. I heartily support the motion. </para>

          <para>.- Complaints have been made that the Federal Capital Commission has not made available a sufficient number of business sites ; but, in my opinion, it is better that an insufficient number of such sites be thrown open than that too many should be offered. Throughout the Commonwealth there are many people who are looking to Canberra with a view to establishing businesses there. The commissioners who know the existing conditions at the Federal Capital are better able to estimate its progress during the next 25 or 30 years than are the members of the general public. They are the best judges of the number of leases of business sites that should be offered for sale. </para>

        <para class="block">We all know how shop property at times depreciates in suburban areas because the supply has exceeded the demand. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> suggested, the commission offered 1,000 business sites, the chances are that, in the course of a few years, a number of leases would revert to it, and we should have the spectacle of isolated empty, or partially constructed business premises, instead of uniformity in development, which the commission is endeavouring to ensure. The commission being on the spot is in the best position to estimate the probable requirements of the Federal Capital, and we may rest assured that when the first auction sale of leases was held the number offered was believed to be sufficient for the time being. Since then the population at Canberra has increased, and to meet the expected increase in business turnover, the commission is now offering twelve more retail business sites in the civic centre. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> was most unfair in his criticism of the commission. We all know that he has taken a personal interest in the development of the Capital; but it is a pity that he should have made a statement that the commission has deliberately done everything in its power to check the progress of the city. </para>

            <para>- It is generally admitted that the Government selected the three men most suited for the position, so it ill becomes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> to make damaging statements such as one might expect from some irresponsible person.  His  criticism receives the fullest publicity, and is not likely to benefit the Federal Capital, or to act as an incentive to the commissioners in the proper discharge of their duties. A few weeks ago I visited the Federal Capital, and was much impressed with the progress made since my previous visit a year or two ago. On every hand there was evidence that the commissioners were carrying out their work in a thoroughly efficient manner. As to the number of business sites to be offered shortly, the onus is on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> to show that sufficient provision is not being made. The upset price fixed is in itself not conclusive evidence that the number is below requirements. In the absence of any evidence, I do not intend to accept the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> that the commission, assisted by the Minister is deliberately endeavouring to delay the development of the Federal Capital. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> criticism gives an entirely false impression of what is being done there by the commission. </para>

          <para>. - I am glad to have this opportunity to reply at once to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll.</inline> I should like to say at the outset that my remarks earlier in the debate were directed exclusively to the action of the commission and the Government in refusing to make available a sufficient number of business and residential leases. That is the point I wish to make. I do not retract a word of what I have said on that score. The Commonwealth has had control of the Federal Capital Territory for many years. During that time the neighbouring town of Queanbeyan, and other towns in New South Wales, have made remarkable progress; whilst in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, and other big cities, the population and value of property have almost doubled. What has been the trouble at Canberra ? </para>

            <para>- As far as my recollection goes, the temporary Houses of Parliament are on the original site; and from my knowledge of the Capital city, I have no hesitation in saying that there would not be very much of Canberra left if that site were covered with water. That is the kind of irresponsible statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> makes. He made another just now when he said that I had uttered a general condemnation of the work of the commission. This is not true. My remarks have been directed especially to the action of the commission in limiting the number of business and residential leases to be offered. Does any honorable senator seriously suggest that twelve retail business sites is a sufficient number to be made available at the forthcoming auction sale? The upset price is very much inflated. This has been brought about through the action of the commission in limiting the number offered at earlier sales. That what I am saying is correct is proved by the substantial profits made by speculative purchasers at the earlier sales. It would have been much better and in the interests of all concerned if the commission had offered a larger number of leases at a reasonable price. Had that course been followed, persons who decided, subsequent to the last sale, to go into business at Canberra, would not have been forced to pay the purchasers as much as Â£1,000 for the transfer of leases. The return furnished by the Minister for Home and Territories recently showed that a considerable number of leases had changed hands since the last auction sale. </para>

If the commission had been equal to its responsibilities, one of its first acts would have been to treble the output of the brickworks. </para>

I can assure him that it has had in mind the fact that many of those who acquired leases some time ago were not able to comply with the building covenant, and in some cases the leases became subject to forfeiture. The commission, therefore, quite rightly did not make available too great a number of blocks, because it did not want to have any thrown back on its hands. </para>

            <para>- The commission has taken steps to try to prevent that occurring, and has granted an extension of time in which to commence building operations. It is only two years since the commission was appointed. In the interim it has had to prepare the Federal Capital city for the removal of the Commonwealth Parliament. Thus extraordinary activity has had to be displayed, and that has extended to the commercial community. Should it be found necessary to lessen that activity, would it be wise to make blocks available to business people who might expect the present rate of progress to be maintained? The commission wishes to obviate the creation of an unreal prosperity. In the building of other great cities there have been periods of prosperity and of depression. The commission has done its best to maintain a gradual rate of progress, and to prevent any reaction. I do not think that honorable senators quite realize the tremendous task which was set the commission. Work had been proceeding in Canberra for ten or fifteen years. Then the commission was informed that it must prepare the Capital for occupation by the Parliament within two years. I can assure the committee that it has done extraordinarily good. work, notwithstanding the criticism and the hostility it has encountered from certain quarters. </para>

What has the commission to guide it in arriving at that price, except the sum which has been paid for the leases of adjacent blocks? After all, who is the best judge of what the upset price should be - I, who live in Melbourne, or the commission, that is always at Canberra? </para>

            <para>- Exactly. If those who wish to lease the blocks consider that the price asked is too high they will not do business. I ask honorable senators to try to appreciate the enormous task with which the commission was faced, and the knowledge it must have gained of the value of land in the territory, and ask themselves whether it is not reasonable to suppose that it is capable of fixing a reasonable price for the blocks that are made available? </para>

          <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Glasgow)</inline> said that the commission, in fixing upset prices, has regard to the prices that have been paid for blocks in the immediate neighbourhood of those that are made available. I doubt very much whether he has gone deeply into that matter. Whilst individual blocks were run up to a very high figure, many were sold for the original upset price. One of the plans shows the upset price of a corner block to be Â£3,000. I know that the block on the opposite corner, which is better situated, remained in the hands of the commission for six months after the last sale, and was finally bought by a speculator at the upset price. After the lapse of six months, the price of the other corner block has been trebled. </para>

            <para>- That may be, if we are to regard this as a huge land speculation. If it is the policy of the Government to extract the last pound it can from the unfortunate people who will be compelled to live in Canberra, let it come out into the open and say so plainly. If that is the policy of the Government I have nothing further to say, but it is idle for Ministers to declare that they are not asking exorbitant prices, and then allow the commission to limit the supply of blocks to twelve. At Blackburn or Surrey Hills, near Melbourne, an auctioneer will sell 50 blocks in an afternoon. In Canberra the supply is limited to twelve for twelve months, or 'an average of one block a month for sale. If the commission is anxious to meet the legitimate demand of those who require blocks it will throw open at least three times that number. </para>

It should also submit for sale at least another 24 blocks. That is the only method of getting a fair criterion of the price that should be paid.

            <para>- If I were a speculator who had bought land at Canberra, the more the commission restricted the supply of blocks the better I should be pleased, but from a broad national stand-point. I say that a continuance of this policy will cripple the progress of the capital, because it will have the effect of forcing the people to pay exorbitant prices for blocks. Where does the honorable senator imagine tenants will stand in a year or two when Â£50 a year rental is demanded for a block of land 20 ft. by 108 ft. ? If the Government would say straight out that its policy is to squeeze the people at Canberra honorable senators would know where they stood, But the Government has not the courage to do so, although it allows the commission to follow this policy. </para>

Canberra is provided with splendid electric lighting and sewerage systems, with a magnificent water supply and with roads second to none. Every piece of ground submitted for sale is disposed of by public  auction to the highest bidder, and if the purchaser holds the land he must build on it within a certain period. There are plenty of unoccupied houses at the Capital, but I suppose they will all be filled when Parliament is removed to its new home. </para>

So far as the building of Parliament House and similar structures is concerned I make no adverse comment on their work, although I am not sure that I could not stretch my comments to cover some of the buildings which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has criticized so unmercifully. </para>

            <para>- So I understand, but at the same time I am sure a great deal of the criticism of the houses is amply justified. When challenged in regard to his statement that blocks had been thrown back on the hands of the commission, the Minister was unable to say definitely that even one block had been surrendered in that way. As a matter of fact, I do not think that he knows of one purchase that has not been completed, because in almost every case those who bought blocks at the original sale have been able to dispose of them at a premium. One has only to go to Canberra and make an offer to purchase a block to discover that such is the case. </para>

            <para>- But the blocks were vacant. They were being held, and the honorable senator had to look  around  to find out who owned the site he wanted. He discovered from local auctioneers that it was available if he would pay a premium of Â£1,500 plus the annual rent for it. The honorable senator was right in declining to pay, but offered Â£750, and a compromise was effected under which he agreed, owing to the manner in which the commissioners were holding the land out of use, to hand over to the original lessee Â£1,000 or Â£1,100. Notwithstanding this and other glaring instances, we are informed by honorable senators that the commission is making a sufficient number of blocks available to meet public requirements. It is not doing anything of the kind. The action of the commission in this regard is worthy of the severest possible censure that could be meted out to it. If it were handling a private estate in that way its services would not be retained for five minutes. Its work in connexion with road construction, extension of the sewerage system, and the construction of Parliament House has been satisfactory.  We have, however, to remember that prior to the commission taking over control of the Federal Capital Territory, approximately 250  miles of first class road had been constructed, the sewerage system was under way, the power-house had been built, and the Cotter dam was constructed, and, I believe, in commission. Very little has been done in private building for the reasons mentioned, although in the capital cities and suburbs great activity has been displayed during recent years. When land is required, it should be sold to the highest bidder. Does it not seem ridiculous that the Government should borrow money at 5 per cent, to be spent at Canberra when it has tens of thousands of vacant blocks, most of which could be leased, possibly in many cases at a nominal sum, which would be better than allowing land to remain idle. It is deplorable to find that the present policy is to construct the city at a snail-like speed. I trust that my comments to-day will be widely circulated, and that the Government will instruct the commission , to make blocks available to the highest bidder. Speculation can be prevented by arranging for re-appraisement every year or thereabouts, so that the Commonwealth would derive the added value instead of speculators. </para>

        <para>On more than one occasion I have referred to what I think is a very great blunder that is being made by the Railway Council in connexion with the construction of the first section of a uniform gauge of railway between Kyogle and South Brisbane. On this line the tunnels are to be wide enough to carry only a single line of rails. I again urge upon the Government the necessity of making representations to the Commonwealth .Railways Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> to have this matter reviewed. I understand that one or possibly two other Railways Commissioners are not at all opposed to these tunnels being of sufficient width to carry double sets of rails. There is a striking peculiarity in connexion with this line which is not to be found on any other railway in Australia. In carrying the line over the McPherson Ranges, it has been found necessary to follow a spiral course, and one of the longest tunnels is on a moderately steep grade. It does not require an extensive knowledge of railway engineering to realize that when a heavy train is passing through the tunnel with a following wind, the smoke and steam from the locomotive will endanger the lives of the driver, fireman, and possibly, the passengers. For that reason alone the tunnels should be of sufficient width to carry two sets of rails. Probably there is no necessity at present to lay down a double line, but the tunnel should be wide enough for that purpose. The Sydney Harbour bridge, which is 169 ft. wide, is probably one of the widest in the world. It also has a clear waterway of 170 feet, a span of 1,650 feet, and a total height from the top of the arch to the high water mark of 455 feet. The engineer who designed the bridge is undoubtedly a man of wide vision, and realizes what the traffic of Sydney will be in years to come. From Sydney to Newcastle, all the tunnels are of sufficient width to carry two sets of rails, but when the main north line is left at Maitland, the first tunnel encountered is only wide enough to carry one set of rails. That is a most serious drawback. We have now the opportunity to take a wider vision than was taken when the line from Maitland to Grafton was constructed. This line, the construction of which is now being commenced, comprises the first section of the uniform gauge of railway, which will eventually be extended through Victoria and South Australia, to Fremantle. I feel sure that before long provision will have to be made for a double line of rails, and as the tunnels cannot be widened, while the line is in use, it will be necessary to discard the single-line tunnels and build double ones, or construct another single tunnel. I am informed on very good authority, that the cost of constructing single-line tunnels is about Â£150 per running yard, whilst that of building a double-line tunnel is only about Â£200 per yard. This is a matter which I think the Minister for Works and Railways should again bring before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell.</inline> I do not think he would offer very much opposition, as it is largely a matter of cost. Quite recently an unfortunate driver nearly lost his life in a tunnel on the New South Wales railway system, in consequence of the density and impurity of the  fume6.  That may occur at any time on the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway if single line tunnels are used. Scattered throughout New South Wales are several single-line tunnels which have been discarded, and which are now used for the production of mushrooms. There should be no repetition of that wilful waste of money. I ask the Minister to consult with the three commissioners with a view to having the tunnels made wide enough to carry a double line of railway. </para>

          <para>The Dried Fruits Export Charges Act was passed in 1924, in order to provide funds to enable the Dried Fruits Control Board to carry out its functions under the Dried Fruits Export Control Act. The Dried Fruits Export Charges Act provides for the imposition of a maximum levy of one-eighth of a penny per pound on all dried currants, sultanas, and lexias, exported from the Commonwealth. In order to obtain sufficient funds to carry on during the first two years of its activities, the board recommended that the maximum levy be imposed. The total amount of levy collected on behalf of the board since the operation of the act to the end of February, 1927, is Â£55,881, of which Â£20,545 has been allotted for trade publicity in the United Kingdom, and Â£16,218 for general administration in Australia and Great Britain. The proposals now before the Senate emanated from the Dried Fruits Control Board. In its second report the board recommends that this amended legislation be passed to permit of the rate of levy being varied for the several varieties of fruit, especially in view of the poor prices realized for currants and lexias as compared with those obtained for sultanas. Over two years ago the board was appointed under the Dried Fruits Export Control Act 1924, after that act had been approved by a very large majority at a poll of producers of dried fruits throughout the Commonwealth. Four of the seven members on the board are elected by growers throughout the Commonwealth. Since the board commenced its activities, it has been recognized by the growers as their representative organization, particularly in connexion with overseas trade, on which the industry is to a great extent dependent for its existence. The members of the board, particularly the growers' section, are unanimously of the opinion that an amendment of the Dried Fruit Export Charges Act is necessary to enable some relief to be made to the growers of currants and lexias in the form of a reduction of, or an entire exemption from, the levy on export, especially as the board has built up a substantial reserve to carry on its activities and contribute to the trade publicity campaign now in operation in the United Kingdom. The board recently decided to recommend that the rates of levy this year on currants and lexias exported be reduced by one-half, namely, one sixteenth of a penny per lb., which reduction would represent a saving of about Â£6,000 to the growers of such fruits, and that next year, if the circumstances warranted it, to further recommend that the levy be abolished entirely on those two classes of fruit. That would mean a total saving of about Â£11,000 per annum to the industry. It is further proposed, in order to inconvenience traders as little as possible, to provide for the exemption of the levy on the export of small parcels, not exceeding 1 cwt. of fruit, to destinations such as the islands in the Pacific. The levy involved in such exemption will not exceed 1s. 2d. The Senate is asked to pass this bill, which, as I have already pointed out, is intended to assist those growers whose currants and lexias, unfortunately, are not at present realizing satisfactory prices on the oversea markets. </para>

I suggest that it would have been better had those responsible for the introduction of this bill given honorable senators more time in which to consider its provisions. I have no doubt that the intention behind the bill is good. The Dried Fruits Export Control Board, no doubt, is convinced of the necessity for amending legislation, but honorable senators are placed at a disadvantage in being called upon to deal with it at such short notice. The Minister has assured us that those engaged in the industry have lost considerable sums of money. </para>
