                            <para>. - When I last had the opportunity of addressing the Senate on the occasion provided by a motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, I directed attention to what I considered we should do in order to place our finances on a proper basis. I directed: attention to the big interest bill to be paid annually on our war debt, amounting to something in the neighbourhood of &#163;17,000,000. Whatever may be done for the reduction of this war debt, by means of a sinking fund or otherwise, the interest bill must continue as a constant drain on the resources of Australia, necessarily cutting inter our power to develop the country. And if we do not develop the country our position will be dangerous, and even perilous. We can provide the money necessary to meet the interest on our war debt of some &#163;350,000,000 only by increasing productivity, and we can increase productivity by adopting a series of policies to which. I was proceeding to draw attention when the Senate adjourned on Friday. I first referred to the necessity of stopping all forms of waste, both public and private. That would help materially. I next referred to the necessity of cutting out of our industrial life all unnecessary holidays. That is to say, we should not idle our time away. I also referred to the chance of securing, some very much needed revenue from a tax on luxurious living. The war is past and gone, and the only thing that stands out as an asset; against the huge expenditure of valuable lives and treasure blown away on the battlefields of Europe is the glorious liberty we enjoy. I refer to luxurious living in the shape of eating and drinking and excessive raiment. The social enjoyment now indulged in almost reminds one of the days of Babylon. The Government could help to meet the interest bill on the war debt by putting a tax of, say, 10 per cent. on all forms of luxurious living. When the Tariff was under consideration in this Chamber I tried to have heavier imposts placed on all articles that were not absolutely necessary to those who lead normal lives. I wanted to have heavier imposts on all useless, vicious, and abnormal forms of expenditure - that is to say, on luxuries. There could be for a start a tax on the excessive cost of luxurious eating and drinking - for instance, on the choice wines which are imported. Then, again, in regard to raiment; look. at the excess to which even young persons in Australia are addicted. Choice dresses are worn, the prices of which I believe range from &#163;8 to &#163;12 each. Some may be even more costly. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite possible. We should have a simpler form of living. If people will persist in living on a luxurious scale, the only remedy is for the Government to place a handicap on them by the imposition of a tax such as I have suggested. I was referring to another form of waste in the field of industry - the loss of time occasioned by men going on strike. I prefer to call things by their proper titles. This loss is brought about by men needlessly going on strike <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> a country where there ought not to be a single day wasted from this cause. The <inline font-style="italic">Tear-Book</inline> shows that the loss occasioned through strikes during last year and the preceding year averaged &#163;1,000,000 a year. This loss, which can never be regained, was brought about simply because men sat down and challenged, in the first place, their employers, and in the second place, society. This was done at a cost to Australia of &#163;1,000,000 a year during these two years, which of the last eight years show the lowest losses in this respect. There is no need for such a loss in a country where the one thing that stands between an unfeeling employer - and he still exists, and is sometimes recruited from the ranks of labour - and his employees is a tribunal which fixes a fair day&#39;s wage. I referred, also, to a greater form of wastage in the shape of unperformed labour commonly known as the &#34; go-slow &#34; policy. I do not propose to speak of the why and wherefore of this insidious element which has crept into the industrial life of this country during the last few years. There was a time when it was unknown here, and when the Australian workman stood at the very apex of superiority as a worker. </para>

He would be a better man if he would &#34; deliver the goods,&#34; and, indeed, now that he has had a fair day&#39;s wage fixed by an independent tribunal,- it is his duty to give a fair day&#39;s work. He is probably getting more than his employer would give him of his own free will, but the employer is made to give a fair day&#39;s wage, whereas there&#39; is no law to compel the employee to give a fair day&#39;s work. What is happening in Australia is shown in a most unobtrusive way in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Year-Booh.</inline> This publication, which is known all over the world, and, has an international reputation, reveals a development in the industrial arena of Australia which is nothing short of disheartening. It is certainly nothing to be proud of, and the state of affairs revealed should cause the average Australian who takes a pride in his country to feel ashamed. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to stick my head in the sand like the ostrich, and say that things are not as they are. I try to find out what is actually happening, and I find it in the <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book,</inline> the only authority worth quoting. It cannot be contradicted. It always continues to bear witness to the truth, caring not on whose corns it treads. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who is a man of many parts, must acquaint his mind with almost every development in the industrial, economic, and political field ; yet this information in the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> may have escaped his attention. I hope that my bringing it under his notice will refresh his memory to some good purpose, not only for himself, but also for the party which he so worthily represents, and for the country of which he claims, to be a native. On page 1035 the <inline font-style="italic">YearBoole</inline> sets out in almost  compendious  form what is happening so far as the productivity of Australia is concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> has made  quinquennial calculations from as far back as 1871, and has adopted the figure .1,000 as the standard by which to judge the productivity of Australia. In 1871 this country was at a rather low ebb, because the standard of efficiency was little more than one-half that attained in 1910. The processes in every line of industry were very backward in those far-off years, but the volume of production gradually increased until the peak was reached in 1910, when  the figure was 1,026. In 1911 it dropped to 1,000 for the standard year. One would naturally have expected that, with the increase in the number of inventions, and application of science to industry on an increasing scale, our productivity would correspondingly improve in the following years, but the record of the present position is about the saddest page in the whole publication. Instead of production increasing from 1910 onwards, it started to go backward until, for the year 1920-21, we had retrograded to the index figure of 689. The productivity of the Commonwealth has been calculated upon the wholesale prices of products and the production prices - two independent guides. This pendulum of ill-fate has swung backwards and forwards, but it shows clearly which way Australia is going, and the standard in both cases has now been reduced to somewhere in the neighbourhood of 800. Why should we be going down ? Australia is sliding almost to its industrial doom. I do not wish to paint a gloomy picture, but I do desire to get at the facts. It will not hurt anybody to do so. Facts are always a corrective that brings us back to the straight line - to the perpendicular - and keeps us on the path of duty. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and so would a bumper year. The scales would be moved either up or down. They are certainly on the level at present, but we should not be content until the indicator starts on the upward trend. In the last year for which the productivity of the Commonwealth has been ascertained, the total amounted to &#163;402,000,000, which, compared with the standard of 1911, meant a reduction in the neighbourhood of 20 per cent. In other words, potential wealth to the extent of  about &#163;80,400,000 was lost. We are producing less material wealth, and the poor are the poorer for it. Although these figures are startling, I stand by them, and I believe they are absolutely correct. </para>

                    <para>What is happening in this country is quite obvious; it almost &#34; barks &#34; at you from every corner. The bad spirit that has for some years been manifested between employer and employee is suicidal, and it must spell doom to Aus-&#39; tralia if the position is not remedied. If we do not produce more, how can we hope- to pay an increasing dividend? If the quotient is lessened and the. divisor increased, the dividend must&#34;, be less. And when things are scarce, they are always dear. Whom production is on the down grade, we cannot expect an increased output;, we might as well try to obtain a quart of&#39; water from a pint measure. I shall leave honorable senators to consider the undoubted wastage that is occurring. It is due in part to the bad and envious spirit that has crept in, and which I deplore and? abominate. Let me tell a story, just as a straw to indicate the trend of the current. I was electioneering in New South Wales some time ago. I need not mention the town, but the story is authentic. </para>

                            <para>- That is right. I heard the tale from the lips of a man who obtained a seat, we will say, in the New South Wales  or Victorian Parliament. As a friend and neighbour, and also as a public man in a minor capacity, he was recognised as an all round good citizen. He had a small&#39; squattage, and was getting on very well with his employees and all and sundry in the neighbourhood. A delegate from the Australian Workers Union came along on one occasion and said to the employees, &#34; How is old Mac. treating you?&#34; The men, who were members of the Australian Workers Union, replied, &#34; All right.&#34; They were then asked whether the log was being faithfully observed, and the reply to that question also was, &#34; Yes, quite all right.&#34; &#34; Are the conditions obtaining quite satisfactory ? &#34; was the next question, and the answer was, &#34; Yes, we have nothing to complain of.&#34; The representative of the organization then said, &#34; You know you must get as much as you can, do as little as you can, and always look upon the. employer as a bifurcated bastinadoed blighter,&#34; or something of the sort. One does not have to travel far to be told stories similar, if not in language, then in action. There may be minor degrees and processes of differentiation, but one can hear similar statements everywhere from far too many. This doctrine which&#39; is being encouraged and fanned into flame  &#34;by those who should not be doing it, .03 reflected in these figures, which show the inefficiency of the country and a drop of SO per cent, in our productivity .during the last ten years. The Leader of the Opposition -may smile, but facts such as these are not disclosed on the public platform by the members of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#39;.Gardiner&#39;s</inline> party. That is the last thing that they would think of doing. My conception of the  duties of a .public man is that he should, when telling the citizens of their rights, which he spells with a .capital &#34;R,&#34; &#39;tell .them also &#169;f their responsibilities. When I speak to the workers concerning their rights I never fail to mention their responsibilities, and I shall continue ito do &#62;so. </para>

                            <para>- They -were until they were ruined &#39;by the poisonous &#39;doctrine which has been poured into their ears. I have been showing where the leakages occur, and how, if -we only behaved as we -ought to do, (the burden of a heavy interest bill which is now hanging around the necks of  the  people .could be  considerably  reduced. The advice that &#163; am giving is only that -we should do what any ordinary practical citizen would do  when  a misfortune struck him *md blotted out, at a stroke, a good part -of his life&#39;s earnings. If he wanted to .recover and rehabilitate himself in the &#39;eyes of his fellows, he would become -more industrious, frugal, and self-denying. By this means, and no other, would he recover the leeway lost and retain the respect of his fellow men. Australia has lost large sums of money in consequence of capitalists declining, owing to the disturbed industrial conditions, to invest their money here. Men prepared to invest .their  money  in the Commonwealth - men who do not desire to crush the workers - have found  that  they cannot get a fair deal in this country and have invested it elsewhere. Instead of offering  every  inducement to such men, Australia has , Deen wedded to a suicidal and foolish policy, hut for which we could have had -more money &#62;and more people here. Although we could easily provide for the mani folding of our present &#34;population, one of the leading parties in the political field is constantly endeavouring to discourage immigration. The representatives of that party may say that they .believe in a qualified form of immigration, which will not bring in new arrivals to compete in the labour market, and so on. The only instance I can recall in which the Labour party adopted a different attitude was when a Labour Government in the Western State voted a substantial sum to encourage immigration. From 1870 until the early nineties the increase in the nott population .from overseas was remarkable. What were the conditions in Australia at that time? I was not here during all that period, but I venture to say that the conditions of the workers were .good. Then came the nineties .and following on from them, as will ,b.e seen from the statistics, the .number of immigrants was reduced to a mere .trickle. I am a living witness to what happened during the early nineties .and onwards. I had to accept a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> per month in my wages&#39;, and during that period an employer in this State was paying 4s. Hd. per day for a man, horse and dray. Did an increase in the population cause ;a &#39;depression in the la-hour market? .It did :not. That is (Sufficient to  show  the -fallacy- which prevails that increased population adds to unemployment. During the time that I experienced the hardest conditions and was more subject to&#39; &#39;the dictates of -employers than at -any other period, immigrants were not arriving here. When the representatives of a party, which takes a leading part in public life and which can do an immense amount of good, blows hot and cold upon a proposal of this -kind I ask them to judge -the future by -lie past. If they do that, they -must come to  the  conclusion that immigration -does not prejudicially affect the workers&#39; welfare. Immigration should be  undertaken  by the Commonwealth and not toy .the States, because immigrants will come to one geographical or political area, as was the experience of -Queensland years ago, and then pass -on to other &#39;areas or States. People who arrived in Queensland under a- State immigration scheme filtered down to* the south, and- the.  Government  of the day in- that Stale, had to&#62; face the proposition) that whilst, it had. to- meet the expenditure incurred, it did&#39; not. derive. any material, benefit. As. soon as the  period  of probation was completed the immigrants came down to Sydney and Melbourne, and their services were lost to- Queensland. &#34;Western Australia is having a similar experience to-day- The central authority alone should be. responsible for carrying out- an immigration policy, because when new settlers arrive. her&#38; they can cross from one State to another and still be within the Commonwealth. </para>

But a remedy for the  various  ills and injuries of mankind! will&#39; not be obtained by merely supporting the platform of the Labour party. It has been suggested that another system would work.. Ah ! but will it- work ? There is one- small detail which makes a difference  such  as- that between daylight and dark. This new social state ha&#187; been, dreamt about, not only by the- Labourparty,, but by all other parties, and doctrinaires. From, the* timer Elate drafted.&#39; the scheme- of his, republic-,.

If a fence required repairing, a special coiumitt.ee meeting was called&#39; to decide who should, repair- the broken rail - and drive the wild animals out of the Indian corn - about the only thing they had to eat. These men were idealists. I contend that a success-fuJi socialistic order  cannot  be evolved in -any  community.  Russia, has- tried to establish a successful communistic order,, but has failed.

The new movement was unsuccessful, as the old Ad&#39;am - that- ghost that can never be- settled, and whose appearance upset all  calculations  -  once  more appeared. The obituary notice of this colony stated that there were too many philosophers and not enough men to hoe potatoes. The same thing occurred in connexion with the New Australia movement. Tolstoi&#39;s only objection to the establishment of an ideal State was that it would not work in practice, and his difficulty was to find the man who would clean out the cess-pit. The war experience is not at all applicable to this matter. </para>

                            <para>- Supposing by some act of necromancy we were to wake up one morning and find the present system changed to that existing in Russia - where industries would be governed by so many commissioners- what would be the position ? What would be the effect of an undiluted form of communistic rule in Australia ? We must ask ourselves what the worker would get out of his industry. That is the point. It is no use making speeches to tickle the ears of the groundlings. It is very seldom that the average man likes to- be told of his shortcomings, but this at times is necessary. In a case of bodily infirmity, when a person is reduced to a bed of sickness, the invalid knows that he is not able to take the part of a man.  Medicine  is prescribed which, of course, is not relished by the patient. No one will take medicine from,  choice,  but when necessary it is taken without complaint; because, nauseous though it may be, it will yield bodily benefit. This applies in a moral sense. A man on occasions needs good medicine for his moral benefit. A foolish doctor might prescribe palatable but ineffective medicine for a patient through fear of giving offence, and consequently the patient would be fortunate if he did not  die.  But the wise doctor would make a proper diagnosis and prescribe suitable medicine to restore the patient to his full vigour. Men shrink from performing unpleasant tasks. When we find ourselves surrounded by a number of workers, all of whom have votes, we tell them everything that is favorable to them. At the same time we should not shrink from telling them what they ought to do. If we insist upon their obtaining what is due to them, we should at the same time tell them what is expected of them.

                            <para>- This is an equal distribution. Mention has been made of the coal-mining industry. I have often referred to that industry in the Senate. The men in New South Wales are on strike at the present time. I see no justification whatever for their action. Those men have dictated their own terms in the past. I hare seen  reports which state that men on the New South Wales fields earn up to &#163;2  a  day. The tribunals which have been appointed by the Commonwealth Government gave the men all that they wanted; they were in the happy position of being able to dictate their own terms, yet they are out on strike again. I have figures showing that if the whole of the profits made in the industry -were distributed among the men engaged in it, there would be added to their wages not more than &#163;1 a week. </para>

                            <para>- I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> - who, I believe, is a fair man - whether he thinks that if the coalmining industry in New South Wales were nationalized, and the coal-miners had distributed among them the whole of the profits made, the miners engaged in the metalliferous mining industry - many of whom earn as low as 15s. a day - would stand silently by and agree to it? I d&#62; not think that they would. These men produce a commodity which is the basis of all industry. They &#34; are holding up our industries, and at the same time are sending letters to the men engaged in the metalliferous mining industry, addressing them as &#34; comrades.&#34; Their troubles about our railways or our steamships or factories, so long as they, and they alone, can get what they are after! What do they care about the wives of the miners on the gold-fields of Western Australia, who are prevented from having a trip by sea or rail because of the excessive freights and fares charged by. reason of the high price of coal? Their idea of comradeship is to help themselves to as much as they possibly can, and let their fellow employees in the industrial field &#34;go hang.&#34; I conceive comradeship to signify a sense of fellowship,  a  readiness and willingness to share equally with one&#39;s fellow employees in the industrial field, not to rob them on every occasion - which is what the miners in New South Wales have done, and are doing. I can see no justice in one set of men getting &#163;2 a day and another set of men, who are going to their deaths at a much faster rate, getting only 15s.  a  day. I describe it as positive inequity. And it must not be forgotten that, if our social order were changed, production would lessen - aye, go back to vanishing point, as in Russia to-day, or in any other place where such lunacy was introduced. </para>

But, taking them a-s a whole, honorable senators on this side of the -Chamber are not out to injure the worker.. In any case, if we were so inclined, we should very quickly be stopped, because there are such, things in this country as the ballot-box, majority rule, and that glorious privilege we enjoy, an adult suffrage, which gives to the meanest unit in the land as much political power as is enjoyed by a man having millions and every social influence at his command. </para>
                    <para>I might succeed in getting some men to rid  themselves  of false impressions, but there ave others whom it is almost hopeless to expect to grow out of that state of mind which leaves them always in the past. There are men whose bodily forms walk abroad, but whose view-point is that of the sixteenth century or earlier. We see repeatedly instances of how men&#39;s minds lag behind. There was, a time when people were not so honest as they are to-day. Before we had an organized society, there were bands of robbers&#39; roaming about the country, and succeeding generations still imagine that they are always in danger of being robbed. Because men&#39;s minds have lagged behind ,and people cannot trust their fellows, we find locks on doors even in the .far interior, where the doors are never closed. When George Stephenson invented the locomotive and had Iris first engine running on rails, an old woman who saw it felt that there must be horses inside it to propel it.  Her  mind having been associated with horses as a means of transport, she could .conceive of nothing moving in any direction unless horses were propelling it. There are a lot of old women nowadays whose minds cannot progress. I &#39;have seen  honorable senators passing out of this Chamber bow instinctively to the Chair, even when the  President  was not in it. They cannot get away from ha&#39;bit. I appeal to honorable senators opposite to bring themselves  .up-to-date mentally, and :to realize  that honorable  senators &#171;mi this side of the Chamber are mat bent on bringing about -the destruction, either materially or otherwise, of any &#39;section of the citizens of  this  .country.

We must invite to this country -hundreds -of thousands of people from Europe. There is room for them all, and only when we have ample population shall we feel secure. There are honorable senators -on this side of the .&#39;Senate who are just as anxious, as our actions in the past have proved, to attain the essential ideals of labour as are -those who call  themselves  Labour men.

                    <para>This Senate is capable of doing a wonderful amount of good. We have here thirty-six men, gathered from distant parts of an island continent. We are sprung from the people, and from them alone. A word from them makes or unmakes us. We, like Ant,mus, spring from the earth, and have been, given a mandate from the majority of the people. We are the trusted of the people, and i hope that no one will ever seek to lower the status of the Senate. Those who attempt to do so are doing the country an ill service. I hope that the press will discontinue its attacks upon this Chamber, and remember that the men who come here, after many crucial tests have been applied to them, are honestly desirous, in their public as well as their civic capacity, of forwarding the interests of the Commonwealth. I appeal again -for unity, and I remind honorable senators that any nation that has its eyes on this country does not want to know what race we belong to, what religion we profess, what our grade in society may be. or what political party we may support. All that it wants is our country, and when it seeks to execute its design, disunion among ourselves will only serve to sharpen their weapons, and give weight to their blows. By making war against each other here we shall not assist ourselves when the time comes to preserve our liberty, but will rather bring about our destruction. Internecine strife and sectional warfare is only playing our enemy&#39;s game. It makes it easier for him to conquer us. . I appeal finally for unity of every description, and let our watchword be, &#34; Let merit foe the measure of the man,&#34; in the firm conviction that without it Australia cannot progress as we wish it to do. </para>

                            <para>. - I claim the indulgence of honorable senators in making this my maiden speech in the Senate, and am confident that the latitude which has been accorded other newcomers will be extended to me. I desire, first of all, to voice the objection of the electors of Western Australia to the sale of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. Considering the enormous profits that the mills have made from time to time, the people of my State consider that they were practically given away. It i3 remembered that they proved a boon to the returned soldiers and others by promoting the establishment of tailoring shops and similar establishments for the retail sale of cloth, blankets, and other woollen goods at reasonable prices. It has been said that the mills were established solely for the benefit of the soldiers during the war, but, since they were opened just prior to the war, they were evidently not intended for that period alone. &#39; Private enterprise recognised the undertaking as a competitor in the production and sale nf woollen goods, and saw fit to use its weight to crush it out of existence. Tweeds were sold to the. returned soldiers at a price of ls. 6d. per yard above the actual cost. As I am in the woollen line myself, I have some knowledge of the subject. The fact that tweeds similar to those produced by the mill and retailed at from 8s. to 12s. 6d. per yard could not he procured in any part of Western Australia under from 18s. to 22s. 6d. per yard proves conclusively that the mills were a boon not only to the returned soldiers, but to their dependants and to the people in general. Speaking from memory, I believe that some &#163;40,000 was set aside to enable the operations at Geelong to be extended, so that increased benefits might be conferred upon the community. No sane person with any business capacity would have given away an establishment that was making the huge profits that the Commonwealth Mills at Geelong were returning, and the fact that they were sacrificed shows that there must be something  &#34;rotten  in the State of Denmark.&#34; The result of the sale was that those who had enjoyed the benefit of cheap woollen goods were forced to obtain their supplies from the Flinders-lane - firms at an enhanced cost, and consequently the price of clothing was raised. If any honorable senator were to place his suit on a pair of scales, he would find that its total weight did not exceed 4&#163; lbs. </para>

Since it has been able to make the large profits that undoubtedly stand to its credit, there should be no room in Australia for any private banking institution. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> established the Commonwealth Bank for the welfare of the people, and it should be apparent that the intention at that time was to absorb all the other banks in the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- Inspectors have been sent out to inquire how pensioners exist, and what income they enjoy, and I believe that some of them have been deprived of a portion of their pension. The payment of the pension to old folks, who have lived in Australia perhaps all their lives, is merely giving them back a little of their own, and there should be no cutting down of the dole. The cost of living is on the increase, and they should receive not less than &#163;1 per week, to enable them to have a little more comfort than they have enjoyed. </para>

                        <para>I have always been in favour of arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes. The miners on the eastern goldfields of Western Australia, over two years ago, were awarded liberal increases in wages, and a fortnight&#39;s holiday was granted them on full pay. The miners were well pleased; but what was the result? In this instance the masters became direct actionists, and forced a great many of the men out of employment, because they thought they were not able to earn the amount of money awarded by the Arbitration Court. </para>

                                <para>- One day last week an honorable senator from Tasmania referred to the value of conciliation between employers and employees, who, he said, should meet around a table and settle their differences. That system has proved not to be as beneficial to the employees as are Arbitration Court awards. Many cases have been determined by conciliation, but where the employees do not see eye to eye with the employers, they become marked men, and are discharged. The system, therefore, opens the way to vindictiveness and victimization on the part of employers. </para>

                        <para>I desire to make an appeal&#39; on behalf of the miners on the gold-fields of Western Australia who are suffering from phthisis, or what is commonly known as miners&#39; complaint. I am glad to learn that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> is having investigations made concerning the Spahlinger treatment. Those conversant with the conditions on the mining, fields know that in many eases,, after a miner has been working underground for three or four years, he develops miners&#39; complaint. Before long he is unable to carry on his work, and has to be, removed to a sanatorium to await what i* known as the &#34;white death.&#34; There is nothing worse than this- scourge, and- although it exists in other&#39; parts of the Commonwealth,. I believe it is more prevalent in Kalgoorlie and the Boulder section than elsewhere. I sincerely trust the Government will make the fullest investigations concerning possible effective treatment, or a means whereby the complaint&#39; may be avoided. If that were done if would he money well&#39; spent. When a miner, has been at work underground for a year or two dust accumulates on the lungs, and! when it becomes crusted and commences1 to break, fibrosis develops. Later the lungs- begin to disintegrate, = and miners&#39;&#39; phthisis, follows. If all the wealth derived from the Golden Mile were divided amongst the miners iti would not be- sufficient compensation for the losses sustained in consequence of the suffering and&#39; death from, this. disease and&#39; accidents, and the Government would be conferring a: great benefit on those: engaged in the raining.&#39; industry if it took, action in the direction I have indicated. </para>

There has been a good deal of misrepresentation in- regard to the deferred! duty on sulphur, and it has been said that the action of the Government in imposing these duties has increased&#39; the cost of superphosphates to the farmers. Nothing is: further from the truth. I understand from the report which the Tariff Board has recently prepared, and which has just been presented to Parliament, that none of the sulphur used in fertilizers at present being sold has Been dutiable. It is rather interesting to trace the- history of this matter in the report of the Tariff Beard. The reason for including in the Tariff, a deferred duty on sulphur was given by the ex-Minister for Trade audi Customs &#39;

                        <para class="block">It was with a view  to  making use  of  that by-product that sulphur duties were first imposed. A gentleman associated with the fertilizer industry,, in company with the representatives  of  the mining industry,, interviewed the Minister for Trade and Customs and told him that, although  they had been opposing a duty on sulphur, they had now come to a definite agreement with the Electrolytic Zinc Company to establish a plant for its manufacture. Unfortunately, the farmers were not represented on that deputation. Under the arrangement entered into, the Electrolytic Zinc Company undertook, irrespective of the price of sulphur outside Australia, not to increase the rate to the fertilizer companies above the actual working costs. Considering that sulphur cost as much as &#163;14 per ton during the war, that was an enormous apparent advantage to the farming community, as it meant that, whatever might intervene, the price in Australia would not be raised. The question of world&#39;s parity was not even involved. The then Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Massy Greene)</inline> went on to say - </para>

I am telling the Committee as much as I may of the terms of that agreement. This is a very important matter from the point of view of the farmers. Here is an agreement under which, if any untoward happenings outside Australia lead to tremendous rise, such as occurred during the war, in the price of sulphur, wo have a definite assurance that it shall not affect the price of sulphur here, so far as it enters into the manufacture of superphosphates. That is a very valuable position from the farmers&#39; point of view. </para>

                        <para>To-day, superphosphate of the same analysis is sold in South Australia at ?5 10s. per ton (lists enclosed). At the meeting to-day, the calculations were based on the Victorian price of ?6 3s. per ton. One South Australian firm advises that the duty on sulphur would mean 7s. per ton increase, not 5s. We consider it no part of the farming community&#39;s duty to bear the whole burden of establishing the industry of sulphur production. Such cost should be borne by the whole community. (Sgd.) T. J.

                        <para>The Committee appointed by you to confer on the above question on 21st April last, and which duly met in conference on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th May, unanimously decided to make a&#39; report, which I duly forwarded to you on 26th May. It has come to the knowledge of members of the Committee, by means of an article published in the South Australian press, that two members of the Committee, Messrs T. J. McGalliard and W. G. Gibson, presented to you a minority report. I have the honour to inform you that the other members of the Committee have no knowledge of this minority report, and that when the conference broke up they were under the impression that Messrs. McGalliard and Gibson had no intention of sending to you any report other than the unanimous report of the Conference. On behalf of the other members of the Committee, I have made every effort to obtain a copy of the minority report, but without success. Perhaps you would be good enough to supply me with a copy, so that the other members of the Committee may know how Messrs. McGalliard and Gibson reported. It is only fair to let you know that when the Conference broke up it was distinctly understood that no report should be presented to you except the unanimous report of the Conference, and if a minority report was presented to you,  this was done in violation of the unanimous understanding arrived at by theConference. </para>

                        <para>On the 28th March, 1922, the Tariff Board recommended that the duty be not further deferred. The full report and the recommendation are as follow: - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>The Tariff Board has very carefully considered the question whether the duty on sulphur should foe further deferred after 31st instant. All the papers on the subject have been carefully perused, and representatives of the mining and superphosphate interests have been consulted. </para>
                            <para>It is clear from the statements made by a deputation that waited on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massy</inline> Greene in November, 1921, that the manufacturers of superphosphate had then arrived at a definite agreement with the producers of pyrites, and assured the Minister that if he would postpone the duty until 31st March, 1922, they would then be in a position to use the locally produced sulphuric acid. As far as the Board can ascertain, practically no effort has been made by the two superphosphate manufacturer - who gave such assurance - to prepare for the roasting of the necessary concentrates to obtain the sulphuric acid required. </para>
                            <para>Therecanbe no question that there are many years&#39; supply of the necessary pyrites already available in Australia, and it seems most desirable that in every possible way the use of such material should be encouraged. </para>
                            <para>The Board has ascertained that the price ruling for imported sulphur is , at present . &#163;415s. per ton, whilst local pyrites can be supplied at an equivalent of &#163;5 10s. per ton. </para>
                            <para>It must be remembered that the price of sulphur in war time went up to &#163;14 per ton, and until last year was still in the region of &#163;8 to &#163;9 per ton. Evidently owing to the proposal of the Government to place a duty on sulphur, the price has decreased very rapidly, and enormous supplies have been obtained by the companies. &#39;Representatives of two companies examined by the Board estimated their present stock is available to meet all their requirements for the next nine months. </para>
                            <para>When it is remembered that the superphosphate companies undertook about five months ago to be ready at the and of this month to use the new system of roasting, it will be seen that the companies can readily get into a position of manufacturing from local material long before their present supplies of sulphur are exhausted. </para>
                            <para>The mining companies interested have given the Board a definite undertaking that they will not take full advantage of the duty of &#163;2 10s., nor will they increase -their price over the present amount unless contingencies arise such as increased wages .or more stringent conditions are imposed. </para>
                            <para>As far as the mining companies earn see, there is rather  a  tendency to reduce .that increase, as the wages and other conditions are likely to become easier. It has been made clean: to the Board that the imposition of the duty will not result in the increase in the price of superphosphate to the farmer. </para>

                        <para class="block">The use of our own sulphuric acid is a very important consideration to Australia because it is the basis of the manufacture of modern high explosives. This consideration cannot be too much stressed. At the outbreak of the war Great Britain had only one establishment at which was being produced sulphuric acid which could be used in the manufacture of explosives. It was necessary to enormously multiply the factories and increase their output in order to supply the explosives used in the war. It is . a well known fact that in Australia we have something like four days&#39; supply of gun ammunition. It is impossible to manufacture in peace time a very much larger quantity of ammunition, because it deteriorates quickly. Unless we are prepared to spend a huge sum of money in making good the wastage, the only alternative is to encourage the production of sulphuric acid in this country. </para>
                        <para>Speaking of sulphuric acid in this connexion leads me to the question of defence. I was very pleased to notice from the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> that there is hope of a return to reason on .the part of honorable senators opposite in regard to the vital matter of our defence. I do not forget that it was due to a Labour Government that universal training was inaugurated in Australia. That system, was of great advantage - one is tempted to say, of incalculable advantage to Australia during the recent war. Our mobilization for that war was carried out, not without difficulty. Had it not been for the institution of com.pulsory military training our difficulties would have been infinitely greater, if not insurmountable. The system provided us -with officers and non-commissioned officers and with &#34;the means of training men as they came forward. It made our army possible. During the course  of the war a change took place in the views of honorable senators opposite - a change which I have been totally unable to fathom. Instead of that support, which&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> promised, of &#34;the last mau and the last shilling,&#34; there was a gradual cooling off, if not an actual hostility towards recruiting, culminating in the branding, -by certain elements of the party, of the men who came forward as recruits, as &#34;six bob a day murderers.&#34; At that very time we were within a hair&#39;s breadth of defeat. Even now - although this fact, I believe, is realized fully - some people do not really grasp what the defeat of the Allies would have meant to us. I have heard it urged that, even had Germany defeated the Allies in Europe and had come to Australia, we should never have been conquered. Let. us assume that that view is correct. </para>

                                <para>- Foolish, indeed, but let us assume its truth. It could only have been demonstrated to the invader at the sacrifice of all our cities, the destruction of our farms and countryside, and the infliction of terrible sufferings upon our people. Such would be the price of victory. Let us, however, consider what would have happened if we in Australia were conquered by Germany. Such a defeat would mean our enslavement for generations. How, with that terrible risk before his eyes, any one could have faltered in his determination to win through on. the other side at any cost, passes my comprehension. Had it been possible for the Labour party to remain united and carry out &#39;their original policy to the end, in my opinion they would have been so firmly established in power in this country that their position would have been unassailable, at any rate, for a very long time. From the time of the split on the conscription issue - right up to the present time - no doubt in order to justify the position which they then took up - the Labour party have consistently opposed any attempt to maintain the system of compulsory training. This attitude and the open sympathy displayed by the party towards those trainees who resist military training have immeasurably increased the difficulties of those who are intrusted with the administration of the Aci. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden&#39;s</inline> able speech seems to betoken a return to sanity in this matter. I trust that his views will prove infectious. </para>

                        <para>I desire to acknowledge my personal debt to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> for his assistance in eliminating from the Defence Bill introduced into the Senate last session features which were considered to be undesirable. The majority of those clauses which last year I deemed to be objectionable have, I am glad to note, been eliminated; and, with the exception of a few provisions, I shall be able to support the measure. </para>
                        <para>One aspect of the Defence question has been referred to with which I am thoroughly in accord. It is now almost two years since I advocated that Great Britain should be approached in regard to the fortification of Singapore and the creation of docks there. I believe that I was the first in Australia to publicly advocate that policy. If honorable senators will glance at a map of the world, they cann&#39;ot fail to see the enormous strategic importance of Singapore to Australia. We can be attacked from two quarters only - the North Pacific and the North Atlantic. In both cases a force proceeding to Australia would be threatened from the flank and rear by a force stationed at Singapore, and would not dare to pass it by without reducing it to subjection. As this would lead to delay in any contemplated descent on Australia, it could not fail to be to our incalculable advantage. With a similar base in New Zealand and one at Capetown, we would be practically unassailable. But Singapore would be the most important of the three posts, and I, therefore, commend the Government for its co-operation with Great Britain in thi3 regard, because it will prove to be the cheapest form of insuring us from invasion. At the same time, there is, in my opinion, no immediate danger. Germany is impotent for the time being, and present reports indicate that Japan is conscientiously carrying out the terms of the Washington Treaty. </para>
                        <para>I join most emphatically in the support accorded to the League of Nations. At the same time, one must realize the difficulties faced by the League. No Court in our land can function without its executive&#34; officers, backed up by the police force, and, if necessary, the army,, to compel the observance of. its judgments or awards-. Similarly,, the League of Nations must have an army at its back to- insure the observance of its decrees;. The question is how that army is to be- provided. The League, must either have its own standing, army, a body of mercenaries stationed at. some, agreed, upon spot,, and ready to- move whenever required, or depend on volunteers from the different, nations. Both systems have their disadvantages. A standing, army might become, an instrument of tyranny and ultimately enslave the world under a vast despotism. In the other ease, it might- be very difficult,, or even &#39;  impossible,  to collect an. army of volunteers in time of need. Suppose,; for instance, there is a quarrel- between Poland and Austria or some other States&#39; over one of those  obscure  issues1 which frequently cause wars. How would Australia, as a member of the League of Nations, regard a request to  call  her young men away from their desks, their  ploughs,  and their looms, to help &#39;keep- the peace between the quarrelling countries? We had an example of that sort of thing recently, when there was danger of Turkey breaking the Treaty of Sevres and starting another war. As one of the signatories to the Treaty, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Hughes, our ex-Prime Minister, loyally promised to support &#39;Great Britain even to the extent of sending our troops overseas again. He was assailed from all quarters for even contemplating; such a thing;, but what difference would there be between that possibility and a. request to support the League of Nations in. regard to some obscure conflict- in tha middle of Europe ? How, also&#62; would  India regard a call from the- League of Nations, to assist Australia against some Asiatic or coloured race in a dispute omer the White Australia policy? The subject bristles with  difficulties;  nevertheless it is a great ideal. N&#169;&#39; doubt, if any one five hundred years ago had suggested- that, the Highland clans! of Scotland or the robber chiefs of the borderland of England and Scotland could be induced to unite even for  common  defence,, much less to. go&#39; overseas to fight side by side for justice and right, it &#34;would have seemed but a wild, impossible dream. But we have progressed and made such a thing possible, and it. may be that sooner or&#39; later the ideal of the League of Nations will, become a glorious reality.. </para>
                        <para>I welcome the announcement that the Government will shortly introduce a measure to liberalize invalid and old-age pensions. Great hardship is. occasioned at times through the administration of the Act. A case brought recently under my attention is that of a daughter who is an absolute invalid. She is so helpless that it is necessary to pay an1 attendant to be constantly with her- to assist- her in every task of nature. She was receiving an invalid pension, but recently, because her father had received an increase in his wages to &#163;4 10s. or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i</inline> 12s. a week, her pension was stopped. The increase in the father&#39;s wages had&#39; put him just above the regulation standard wage which permitted of a pension being paid to a dependant. The withdrawal: of the pension was a terrible infliction on these people. I tried my best to help them to get the decision reviewed, but the Commissioner of Pensions pointed out that under the present regulations he was utterly helpless in the matter. I hope that provision will be made to meet a case such as this. In. another instance a woman with a bed-ridden husband who is utterly helpless and has only a few months to live, has supported&#39; herself and her husband by acting as cleaner and caretaker of- a picture theatre. For this work she- receives <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 10s. a week. When she applied for an invalid pension for her husband, she was informed that he could&#39; not be assisted because she  wa3  drawing a wage of &#163;2 10s. per week.  Her  case was complicated because owing to her heavy work in having, not only to clean out a picture theatre, but also to look after a bed-ridden husband., her own health broke down, and for some time she had) been obliged to pay an assistant to do  her work at the- theatre. However, she failed to state that fact in her application- for the pension . I hope that <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> provision will also be made to meet her case. </para>
                        <para>I trust .that the Government will be able to increase pensions payable to war widows. The utmost liberality has been shown by past Governments to returned soldiers, but there <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> no doubt that war widows, particularly officers&#39;&#39; widows-, have cause for complaint. At first- the pensions provided for officers-&#39;  widows were considerably higher than those payable to privates&#39; widows, but as the ; cost of living increased, public opinion forced the Government to raise the pensions payable to privates&#39; widows to the scale previously allowed for the widows of captains. There was, however, no increase in the pensions of the widows of officers. The wives and children of many of our young doctors who lost their lives at the war were accustomed to a reasonable amount of comfort, but they are now obliged to subsist on the same amount that is allowed to the widow of a private. However Democratic we may be we ought to have regard to circumstances. Educated ladies and their children, who have not been accustomed to &#34; rough it,&#34; feel their present position much more acutely than do those accustomed to living on a lower scale of comfort. </para>

                        <para>That provision was made with the object of preventing a Government insuring support for any part of its policy by providing paid positions under the Crown to members of Parliament supporting it. At that time we had very small Naval and Military Forces, and as far as I can ascertain, no one serving in either the Army or the Navy, was receiving more than &#163;30 a year, an amount which would not even cover the expense to which he was put. Therefore no one&#39;s vote was likely to be influenced by such a paltry allowance. The position, however, has entirely changed. We find that Major-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Bowse, V.C., a member of the House of Representatives, occupies a part-time military job, at something over &#163;800 a year, and a number of other senior officers in the Military Forces, who are also members of the Commonwealth Parliament, are in receipt of sums approaching <inline font-style="italic">, &#163;300</inline> a year, for positions which may, at any time, be brought into line with that which commands the salary paid to Major-General Howse. Surely it is a breach of the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution. Where will it end ? As our Forces develop, it might be quite constitutional to create the position of part-time Admiral of the Navy, carrying a salary of &#163;5,000 a year, in order to take away the sting of criticism from the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan).</inline> I feel sure that even the Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> would not find it in his heart to refuse a flattering offer of &#163;10,000 a year for acting as nine-tenths Permanent Field Marshal of the Australian Forces. I have, perhaps, intentionally exaggerated this aspect of the question, but I have done so for the purpose of opening the eyes of honorable senators to the danger of the continued development of this practice which, I declare, is quite contrary to the spirit of our Constitution. Honorable senators opposite have harped on the subject of immigration, and have alleged that we have no suitable land available on which to place settlers. I would remind them that twenty years ago the &#39;best wheat land we have - the Victorian Mallee country - was classed as unsuitable and useless. To-day the Mallee promises the best reward to the enterprising settler who is not afraid of hard work. The construction of water channels has solved tie difficulty. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. With the provision of the vast water storages in the Murray Valley, and particularly with the development of our railways, we may expect a new ; State or province to spring up intheRiverina. </para>

                        <para>It has been said that the Government have not kept their promise in regard  to  the settlement of soldiers on the land. Speaking for my own State, at least,  I can  say that the Government have carried out their promise to the fall. I think I am right in saying that only some four thousand soldiers, whilst overseas, originally applied for land, but the returned men were stimulated by the prospects of those who took up the land at first. More and more qualified themselves and applied, and up to date about 14,000 have been settled in Victoria. There is surely not the slightest ground for alleging that the Government have not done all that was promised. In some instances the soldiers have made extraordinary progress, and some have paid off every penny the Government advanced to them. </para>

                        <para>I welcome the announcement that an attempt will be made to draw a dividing line between labour disputes that are essentially Federal and those that are local. At the same time I do not think that this will altogether solve the difficulty. I look for a solution rather to the Labour Unions themselves aspiring to own and control their own production - not in the direction of confiscating the works of employers, but by organizing and finding their own capital and carrying ou their own businesses. An example of what I mean is afforded by the action of a number of returned soldiers who were wharf labourers by occupation. They combined and formed the Returned Soldiers Stevedoring Company. They accepted contracts, and I believe that they are now rapidly becoming wealthy men. One ideal of the Labour party has been attained by these men ; in that they control the whole of the product of their own industry. Surely that system could be extended. </para>
                        <para>Much criticism has been levelled against the Government for selling the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. Why did not the labour unions get into the field ahead of the private syndicate and purchase the mills? They could have organized a fund, floated a company, and acquired control of the undertaking, thus securing the whole of the fruits of their industry. </para>

What a splendid chance employees in the building trade have st present to form themselves into a company for the purpose of owning their own brickworks. They could then accept contracts for building houses for all and sundry, and secure to themselves the whole profit of their .labour. There is still some talk of this being done, but the project appears still to be only in the air. I appeal to honorable senators opposite to endeavour. to find a solution of the labour problem to that end. . </para>

Every man and woman, over the age of twenty-one years, has a voice in the affairs of government, and every eligible person should exercise that valuable right, which makes all the difference between a free man and a slave. I have been in the Labour party for about twenty years, and I am not &#34; one of the young men in the movement,&#34; as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> described me the other day. Ever since I have been able  to take an intelligent interest in politics I have been in the Labour movement, and I assisted in putting into the Senate men who, years ago, helped to make <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> a Minister in a Labour Administration. Although I am not very old in years, I am at least old in the work of the Labour party, and I hope that, by the time I reach the age of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I shall still be in it; in fact, I know that I shall be. </para>

The present composite Government, however, seem, for some reason or other, to be afraid of Parliament. Early this year Parliament was called together for a very brief session, and the present session, too, is to b a short one. Then we shall go into recess, while the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> proceeds to England. The Labour party maintain that the first duty of the National Parliament is to Australia. There are men in England who can manage British affairs even better than our Prime Minister, bub he seems to think that he is the only man in Australia capable of conducting the affairs of this country. </para>

                                <para>-He certainly imagines he is the only one who counts. We hear a good deal about autocrats, and the Prime Minister in this connexion reminds me of Cromwell. He will put the key of the Parliament in his pocket, and the parliamentary work of this country will be hung up until he sees fit to return from England. Why should not his twin brother in the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, be left in charge during his absence? The Country party say that they are capable of managing the affairs of Australia. If I were in <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Page&#39;s</inline> position I should consider it a direct insult to suggest that I was not fit to take charge of the Government. It is called the Bruce-Page Ministry, and surely <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Page</inline> can be trusted to carry on, if it is necessary for the Prime Minister to leave Australia. The first essential in a Democracy is to have free and open discussion of all measures appertaining to the government of a country. We are legislating for over 5,000,000 of people, and the least the Government can do is to allow the fullest and most open discussion on every measure brought down. When we go into recess, even some of the followers of the Government will possibly not know the full effect of the legislation that is evidently to be rushed through. I have no doubt that the closure will be used fairly frequently this session. Its application does not make for free and open discussion, but it often &#39; creates bad feeling, and that is not in the best interests of Australia. </para>

                        <para>More than one honorable senator has referred to the sale of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. I regard that act as one of the greatest political crimes ever perpetrated in this country. I have heard men who are now opposed to the Labour party calling attention to the fact that the establishment of the mills represented a great achievement in the people&#39;s interest, and yet to-day they are hand in glove with the salesmen who have handed the mills over to private enterprise. There is something to be learned from this as to the difference between Labour&#39;s objective and the objective of our opponents. My party&#39;s objective is practical socialization, and the woollen mills were a striking example of that. </para>

                                <para>- They were a practical example of what Labour is striving to attain. The Minister has read the Labour party&#39;s platform, and he should know that we advocate the socialization of industries, and nationalization is the first step towards our objective of socialization. We cannot socialize industries within a year, but we can do something in the interests of the people of Australia, by leading up to practical Socialism by a sensible method of nationalization. I am surprised at the Minister&#39;s interjection, because when he was a member of the Labour party he was proud of the fact that he was a socialist. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister was branded, but he now thinks that the brand can be removed. Prior to the last election the Nationalists in South Australia endeavoured to frighten the people by telling them that I was an awful man, but when the electors saw me they said that I seemed to be an ordinary Australian, possessing average intelligence, and that I was not as I had been described  in the newspapers. Consequently the representatives of our party secured a majority of the votes cast in that State, and after the next general election we shall be in a stronger position than we- are to-day. It is well for honorable senators opposite to be prepared,, because I realize that it must be hard to leave these, surroundings after one has been here for six years-. Honorable senators opposite should take time by the forelock and, during the next three years, become accustomed to what they will have to. encounter when that time has expired . </para>

                                <para>- In Adelaide. Strong supporters of the Government said that the Mills had to  be  disposed of Why ?Merely because the material produced was not being handled  by  the Flinders-lane merchants, who were deprived of the big. profits which they obtained when handling imported goods. The Government had the opportunity of showing the people of Australia what could  be  done-, and the good work commenced should have been continued,,  because  it would, apart from other considerations, have been the means of providing employment for some of those coming&#34; from overseas. We produce the best wool in the world and send practically all of it. away to be manufactured into the finished article. Apparently the Government are  not  anxious to protect the interests of the ordinary people  of  Australia, but are out to safeguard the interests of the &#34; fatted &#34; few, and in this instance they have acted  on  their behalf The Government contend that they  do  not wish  to  interfere with private enterprise, but private enterprise has already had. its sway; and the tine is coming when the people will object to further exploitation. Is it to  be  supposed  for  a moment that the Government would hand over other public utilities such as&#39; our railways? </para>

The Geelong Woollen Mills were a sound business proposition showing, a. good return on the outlay. The buildings and plant were valued at &#163;267,000, and the Government, in selling, them at &#163;155,000, sacrificed &#163;112,000 of the taxpayers&#39; money. A syndicate has now been formed to conduct the Mills. I do not blame the men interested in the venture for acquiring shares,, but I know it is likely to pay good, dividends, which should be going into the pockets of the  people whose representatives were responsible for establishing the industry. When Labour is returned to power an- effort will be made to secure the. Mills, and conduct them as a Government instrumentality. </para>

Certain arrangements, satisfactory to- the- pastoralists, have been entered into: between the large land-holders in the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth Government, and when the arrangements are satisfactory to&#62; the big pastoralists, it. is fair to assume that they have secured a wonderfully good deal. If the policy of the Government in this connexion is adopted, development in the Territory will be retarded for the next forty years. </para>

                                <para>- It will be my very great pleasure to do so, and every honorable senator should assist. The Government may rest assured that honorable senators on this side will place no obstruction in the&#39; way of the improvement of the Northern Territory. This vast area of land once belonged to South Australia, but it was1 taken over&#39; by the Commonwealth Government! because it was thought that that Government  could  handle it to better advantage. There are; people who- say that the. South Australian Government should1 not have- parted with the Northern Territory, but I aim not one of them. It can be administered properly if the Federal Government, carry &#39; out the covenant which- they entered into with the South Australian Government. There is- no prospect of developing, the Territory without railway facilities-. A. railway to the Northern Territory is a rational, undertaking, and its- construction will provide extensive employment. Honorable, senators who have been through) the Territory will agree &#39; with me that there are large tracts of land there which can be made productive. I do not believe ia State &#34;frights&#34; or State rights to- any great, t extent;. I place the&#62; rights of the* nation, f  foremost.  When the Bill for the  construction  of a. railway to the Territory is before the Senate, I ask honorable senators to consider that proposal from a national viewpoint, quite apart from any State interest. The Northern Territory comprises one-sixth of the area of Australia, and if it is opened for settlement by means of railway communication, all credit will be due to the Nationalist Government. I commend the proposal to the Government, and hope that honorable senators will have an opportunity of discussing the matter before this session ends; if not this session, then as early as possible. </para>

I prefer the old system of &#34; first past the post,&#34; because it is understood by the majority of the people. In South Australia recently there were over 13,000 informal votes cast for the Senate, and 13,000 people were consequently disfranchised. Under the old system there would have been not more than a dozen informal votes. </para>

                                <para>- I made inquiries and was informed that the number of informal votes at the last election for the Senate was abnormal. I prefer the old system of &#34; first past the post,&#34; because very often people do not know the effect of their votes under the present system. I am told that some people who voted number eight in my case cast an effective vote for me, and I do not think it is a right system of voting. A fair and just system is required, and one that the people will understand. </para>

                        <para>The Labour party&#39;s attitude towards immigration is very often misunderstood. We want more people in Australia but we contend that suitable provision should be made for them in Australia, either before their departure from the Old Country or immediately upon their arrival here. We know it is a difficult undertaking. It is very easy for a person to say, &#34; Introduce 10,000 emigrants from the Old Country, and put them on the land.&#34; I have lived in the Mallee, and I have  seen men from the Old Country settle there, but they could not stick to the work because they were not used to the country. Men taken from congested areas, without experience, cannot work successfully in the bush. The necessary experience could be gained by employing these men on large railway construction works, such as the uniform-gauge project, where extra labour would be required. After this experience, men would be able to enter other avenues of employment open to them, including settlement on available land. Imagine men leaving England in the cold weather, arriving here in the middle of summer, and then being placed in the Mallee, where the temperature is sometimes 118 degrees in the shade. </para>

I do not advocate the wholesale introduction to Australia of men and women from the Old Country to the detriment, possibly, of our people and the lowering of the standard of life here. Honorable senators do not wish to see the standard of living in Australia lowered. In their national pride, they would insist on a decent standard of living, and on a possible improvement rather than a retrograde step. I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> relate an incident concerning an Australian Workers Union organizer. I know something of the Australian Workers Union, and if the union organizer did as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> states, he was acting contrary to the instructions of the organization. I have never known an Australian Workers Union organizer to do anything of that nature. On the contrary, I have known them to prevent strikes at certain camps. The organizers are appointed by the men, and would not knowingly foment a strike. The office is balloted for every year, and if an organizer has brought about an unsuccessful strike he suffers defeat at the next ballot.  His  business is to keep the nien in work, to see that they enjoy decent conditions, and give a fair return for their wage. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was present when the incident he described took place, but if his statement is correct, then the organizer was acting contrary to the constitution of the organization.

                                <para>- Its membership will increase; it is still a very strong organization. Many of these organizations lose their membership for a time. The Labour party lost ground some time ago. In South Australia a few years ago there were only three Labour men ii; the State House. The next year there were a dozen, and to-day there are seventeen. It is very easy to level accusations against a big organization when it has not the opportunity to reply. The Australian Workers Union does not stand for anything that is detrimental to the best interests of Australia. It stands for arbitration and good conditions. Although at times certain members of the organization may cause trouble, its main objective is to keep its members free from trouble. </para>

                                <para>- I . shall be pleased to meet the gentleman who told the honorable senator of the incident. I was very surprised to hear the story. The organization does not stand for that sort of thing. Those honorable senators who are acquainted with the men who &#39;have control of the Australian Workers Union must appreciate the fact that they are common-sense business men. The  President  of that great organization is an honorable senator. I do not think any honorable senator would suggestthatSenator Barnes would do anything foolish or unjust. These organizations must always be judged by those who are in control of them. </para>

                        <para>I impress upon the Government the necessity for finding markets for the fruit which is grown on the soldier settlements. A lot of fruit is being grown on settlements along the River Murray in South Australia. Soldier settlers have been placed on those settlements, and it is the duty of the Government to see that their labour is not wasted. I was up there recently, and I found that the men were working very hard. Their blocks are a credit to them, and they are producing a large quantity of fruit. In another year or so, they will produce a sufficient quantity of fruit on the South Australian side of the Murray to meet Australia&#39;s requirements for two or three years. At the present time they are planting out, and many trees and vines have not reached maturity. If we do not find markets, &#39;that fruit will rot. </para>

The matter is sufficiently important to , warrant inquiries being made into it. The South Australian Government has spent a good many millions of money., the greater part of which has been borrowed through the FederalGovernment. The people are responsible for there payment of that money, and it is therefore necessary that these men should make a success of their holdings. The best way in which to bring that labour is to see that they get markets, and I hope that theGovernmentwilldo somethinginthatdirection. </para>

There has been a good deal of criticism . about the manner in which you were elected on this occasion, and also a certain amount of fault-finding in regard to the way in which you have administered your office. I was rather astonished at the remarks of some honorable senators opposite, because, while I have been in this Chamber., your attitude towards honorable senators opposite has always been more than generous. In fact, if any fault is to be found with you in respect to your attitude towards them, it is that you have been too generous towards them. Your action in defending the rights of this Chamber has also aroused the opposition of the press, and, as a consequence, the press has done its utmost to dictate to senators. </para>

If it had not been for the action of the Labour party in another Chamber in joining hands with the most conservative element that the State of Victoria has produced, and so arousing a feeling in the South against the Government&#39;s proposal, the industry would have been enjoying the protection of a duty that would have been of great benefit to it. The embargo is good as far as it goes, but, as it will last for two years only, it is not sufficient to enable those engaged in the industry to know what lies in front of them. Before the period expires the return from newly-planted ground will not be available. </para>

                                <para>- I should like to see the wheat-growers get a better return, but the local consumption of wheat is not equal to the quantity of wheat produced, and, therefore, wheat-growers are compelled to compete in the world&#39;s market and take the world&#39;s parity for their produce. So far, except in two seasons, our yield of sugar has not overtaken the local consumption. We could not sell our sugar outside in competition with black grown sugar and maintain the&#39; conditions under which sugar is grown in Australia. The industry is based on the maintenance of the White Australia policy. Sugar is grown by white labour in North Queensland on rich land which could be put to very little other use. The outcries in the southern press and the way in which the development of the industry has been interfered with have been very harmful to it Had the sugar-growers been given a long enough period in which to establish themselves without interference greater progress would have been made. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> was in Queensland just prior to the opening  of this session, he said - </para>

                            <para>It is impossible, of course, to deny or overlook the legitimate claims of an industry that pays &#163;6,000,000 in wages to some 25,000 employees, and produces a crop worth up to &#163;9,000,000 per annum. It ranks among the very largest primary producing interests in Australia in any or all of the States. Economically the sugar industry is of even greater importance to the nation than a superficial examination of trade statistics would indicate. For it -should always be remembered that, if sugar were not produced in Australia, from &#163;5,000,000 to &#163;0,000,000 would have to be remitted each year to foreign countries, which buy, in return, scarcely any of our goods. During the Government-control period just expiring over &#163;47,000,000 was thus &#39;kept and spent in Australia in respect of the locally grown tonnage. </para>

                        <para>This is one of the strongest arguments that could be brought forward to show that the sugar industry should be treated with generosity. Coming as it does from a right honorable member of another place who represents a southern constituency, this utterance should impress the people in the south. The industry should be helped either by extending the embargo against black-grown sugar for five years, or by imposing the duty which, during the last Parliament, Victorian Liberals and the Labour party in another place declined to pass. </para>

                        <para>SenatorREID. - The Government are taking a very wise step. Bogus people dressed in scouts&#39; uniforms and wearing scouts&#39; badges have been collecting money allegedly on behalf of the Boy Scouts Association, and the scouts have asked for the protection which the Government are now affording them. By creating a spirit of comradeship, and breaking down class prejudices, the Boy Scouts&#39; movement is proving most beneficial to the youth of the Commonwealth. In a Democracy it is necessary to teach the young self-reliance, and to bring out the best that is in them. Every scout promises to do some kind act every day in his life.What better teaching could we have than that ? The scouts learn to be obedient, and they are taught discipline. It is also very necessary in a Democracy like this that the young should be taught to treat others with respect. The movement brings out the very best qualities in the boys. Therefore, without interfering with the voluntary spirit or with the splendid work the association is doing, I think the Government should give it some official recognition, while not at the same time, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> phrase, putting their crippling hands on it. </para>
                        <para>We have heard a great deal about the results of the last election, and some honorable senators have talked of the defeat of the Nationalist party, but they have forgotten to mention how small the vote was. At elections when the majority of people have voted, the Nationalist party has been returned with thumping majorities. On the last occasion it was the apathy of the electors towards the Nationalist party or its Leader, and possibly the enthusiasm of the supporters of the Labour party, their Royalty to their party, and their excellent organization that led to the success of our friends opposite. No doubt the same enthusiasm exists in the ranks of the Nationalist party, but on this occasion, unfortunately, there was a split amongst them. We remember the treachery of the so-called Liberal section. For example, the Premier of South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Barwell)</inline> adopted an attitude that made him the best organizer that the. Labour party had. He, and men like him, owing to their bitter attack upon the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> made a great many -electors tired of political issues. </para>

                        <para>SenatorREID. - No; I am coming to that point presently. The loss of Nationalist seats was due to the dissension created within the ranks of &#39;the party, and to the fact that the people were weary of politics. It is well known that it is the floating vote that usually decides an. election, and that vote was not cast. Only between 50 and 60 per cent. of the people exercised the franchise. In Queensland, where voting at State elections is compulsory, and where the people largely hold the opinion that voting at Federal elections also is compulsory, there was an 83 per cent. poll. There the Nationalists came back as strong as ever, and the so-called Country member was returned with the help of the Nationalist vote. Had the people voted in all the States in the same proportion as in Queensland, a similar result would have been obtained -throughout the Commonwealth. The people of Queensland are not more intelligent than are those of the other States; but they went to the polls with the idea that voting was compulsory. </para>
                        <para>I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> on having a larger following than formerly. I do not believe that the people have changed their opinion to such an extent that the Labour party would have been returned to power if the polling had been heavy. The violent attacks made upon the Commonwealth Arbitration &#39;Court, and the vendetta of bitterness carried on by the Melbourne press against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> disgusted the majority of the electors, and it was almost impossible to attract audiences. I have- been actively interested in politics for forty years, and I have never seen- so much difficulty in obtaining meetings as was encountered in the last campaign. The only candidate who was able to secure good attendances was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> himself. If the Labour party is gaining in strength, it is perhaps a good thing, because it will make it plain to the so-called Liberals that they cannot return to the old days when they were accustomed to dictating to Labour and putting the brake on the wheels of Democracy. I do not &#39;blame the working men for voting for Labour candidates when they see the so-called Liberals trying to dominate the Nationalist party. I noticed a report in the Sydney press that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> speaking in the&#39; Domain, stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had been sucked like an orange, and then thrown aside when the Nationalist party could- not get any more out of him. I venture to say that some of the party could not get what they wanted out of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and so they turned him down - but not because they had sucked him dry. The Nationalist party owes its very existence to him and to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, hut the brains of the party were those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and without him those who succeeded him in office would never have gained prominence in public life. It was because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was a thorough Democrat that he was attacked. </para>

                        <para>What we have heard about the sale of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills is purely gallery talk, for&#39; the purpose of belittling the Government. I have no objection to the Government carrying on an industry for the benefit of the people if it will pay the country as a whole, but the mills at Geelong had reached the stage that they had nothing to do, as far as meeting Government needs was concerned. Why should a splendid plant and a? large staff of employees have been kept on, when there was work for&#34; only three months of the year ?  </para>

                                <para>- They have their own mill. If the Commonwealth Mills were to be kept going for the whole year, they would either have to sell material at the same rates as private firms, or compete with those establishments, with the probable result that the employees of the private mills would be thrown out of work. What would nine months&#39; output of the Geelong Mills amount to in any case, compared with the needs of the whole of Australia? The Commonwealth Mills could only meet a small proportion of the demand. There was a falling off in the demand owing to retrenchments in the Defence Force, and the interest on the capital sunk in the mills was running up. What has been said about the quality of the cloth turned out is perfectly correct. The material supplied at from 6s. 6d. to about lis. 6d. per yard was as&#39; good as  one  could wish for, especially in the matter of serges and twills. So far, our tweeds are not quite equal to the imported article, but no doubt they will be in time. It must be remembered that the mills at Geelong were not paying State or Federal taxes, and were not subjected to the overhead charges that private companies have to meet. If due allowance were made for that it would be found that the private mills were producing at a price  practically equal to that fit which the Commonwealth Mills were selling their goods. The Flinders-lane merchants, therefore, are simply acting fairly as agents for  the supply of the needs of the people. </para>

                        <para>A good deal has been said about the lack of proper housing accommodation for the people. There are many reasons for the present situation, and some of them should be inquired into. The real collapse took place during the war period. All countries are in much the same position. We have to consider the greatly increased cost of building, and the fact that house rent has practically doubled. All the materials required in the construction of a house, including lime, mortar, timber, and bricks are double the price they were a few years ago. A good deal has been said concerning the inferiority of the homes constructed by the War Service Homes Department, but it is interesting to note that quite recently an effort has been made to produce and exhibit a home suitable for an average person at a moderate cost. An ordinary hardwood house which cost &#163;750 to construct is being shown &#34;at the Ideal Homes Exhibition, but it is not in any sense superior to those constructed by the War Service Homes Department, which proves that those who have been most strong in their criticisms of the work of the Department are not able to produce a better home at a reasonable price. Prom inquiries made at the War Service Homes Department I have ascertained that every returned soldier, including even those who bought at the higher prices, who has sold his house, has obtained more than he paid for it. </para>

                                <para>- No; the information I obtained was in regard to all the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> said that the shortage of skilled workers in . the building trade was only temporary, and that there was no occasion to bring artisans from overseas to overcome it. If the honorable senator is honest, he must admit that there is not a city in Australia in which sufficient skilled labour can be secured for this class of work. That has been the position for the last six or seven years. </para>

There is such a keen demand for bricklayers that contractors are paying more than the award rates, and in some instances are offering 27s. 6d. to 30s. a  day. </para>

                                <para>- There is not a Fair Rents Court in Victoria. In some instances, of course, the rents are higher than the value of the property justifies. There are bad landlords as well as bad employers and employees, but when one  takes into consideration the expenditure involved in meeting rates and taxes, insurance, maintenance, and the renovation necessary when a bad tenant has vacated&#39; a dwelling, the rent does not provide a sufficient return on the capital invested. In some instances, it requires several weeks&#39; rent to meet the cost of repairs. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable senator has money to invest, he should purchase properties and assist in  accommodating  working men who are at present without homes. The decisions of the Fair Rents Courts have brought rents below the rate necessary to cover fair interest on the capital invested and allow for depreciation. A little while ago a young man in Brisbane, who contemplated matrimony, purchased a house, and gave the tenant a month in which to find another home. When the time expired the tenant declined to leave, and the Magistrate presiding over the Court, according to newspaper reports, allowed the tenant eight months in which to find another home. I do not know what the purchaser did, but he was prevented from  occupying  his own home. According to the press reports, the Fair Rents Court has given few sensible decisions, and that is not surprising, because those who hear the cases are inexperienced in house construction, and consequently know little of the expense incurred in maintenance. It was said the other evening that the bricklayers at Canberra were receiving 27s. 6d. to 30s. per day, and were laying only 250 bricks a day. Some time ago it was customary for a bricklayer to lay 700 a day. </para>

                                <para>- I have already referred to that. The timber getters, who previously had not received very high wages, are to-day being paid fairly well. Even in Queensland, the so-called Labour . Government have increased the royalty on timber to their own people by 70 or 80 per cent. A feeling of brotherhood or comradeship between men does not seem to exist, and although it may be said that the rich man &#34; puts it up &#34; on the other fellow, the workmen are; to a large extent, responsible. A man with a family finds great difficulty in renting a home, as one of the first questions asked by the landlord is, &#34; How many children have you, and what are their ages?&#34; If a man has a family of two or three it is practically impossible for him to rent a dwelling. We should deal with hard facts. It is the ambition of every man to have a home of his own. To-day, however, the ordinary working man is unable to obtain a house of his own because of the prohibitive prices. He has to pay rent, and consequently is crammed into two or three rooms, according to the price he can afford to pay. Overcrowding conditions are prevalent, and a great deal of this has been brought about by the working class themselves. Any sensible man who has no prejudice or bias will admit that the housing shortage has been brought about owing to the workers refusing to do a fair thing for the wages received. The men will not do the work, and you cannot even get plasterers to put a face on their work. </para>

I do not care whether a workman is paid &#163;2 or &#163;5 a day; but whatever he gets he must return to the industry an equivalent in labour, otherwise it will be ruined.

                                <para>- I will tell my honorable friend how millionaires grow. The other night he told us a yarn about eggs and whisky, and described in a dramatic manner how one man had brought the whisky and eggs together. On being asked by the person who supplied the eggs how the drinks were furnished, the man with the brains proffered the information that he was the middleman. That is the key to the Labour situation. The working men are alright in their own particular line, but they have not the experience and brains of the other fellow. The man who brought the eggs and whisky together had more intelligence than had the publican and the man with the eggs. The man with brains initiates, and his creative faculty accomplishes things which the general community do not attempt. The men with the eggs and whisky would never have come together without the aid of the man with initiative. The average worker in all spheres of life follows one routine. He does not launch out in business for himself, as he has no self-confidence. My honorable friend opposite has been told what to do by his employer, and he has done it. to the best of his ability. He entered the Senate intending to relieve his fellow workers of as much work as possible: They did not have his particular faculty for expressing opinions to enable them to emulate his example-. Captains of industry have the ability to seize opportunities and to take advantage of them. </para>

                                <para>- I am not ashamed of it; but experience and common sense has taught me that a lot of things I once advocated are empty fads. The position was clearly explained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> this afternoon, when he said that it was all very well to have Socialistic ideas, but when the experiment developed to a certain stage the old Adam in human nature asserted itself; therefore one can easily understand why many of these fads have disappeared. The ruination of the State industries of Queensland has been brought about by the very men who work in those industries. The industries have not been properly managed; a fair return was not given for the wages received. That is the position in a nutshell. </para>

Progress in any civilization can take place only from pressure, and it is the pressure of population that will develop Australia.No one deplores more than I do the sight of a person trying to sell his labour and ability, and being turned down every time. There is no more distressing or heartbreaking experience to a man who knows his ability, than to continue day after day looking for work, only to be turned down, and to go home to a starving wife and children: Other countries of the world are ten times worse off in respect of starvation than is Australia. </para>

                                <para>- Australia can only be developedbyimmigration.Every immigrant that arrives in Australia has a certain amount of money, and is eager to work and. go ahead. When the pressure of population is applied throughout Australia, the hands of the State and the Commonwealth Government will be forced. Inspite of the possibility of suffering caused by an influx of population, I maintain that we should bring as many immigrants as possible to Australia. &#39;The best lessons we have learned have been taught through suffering. A policy of immigration will not only relieve Australia financially, but will fill the vacant lands. There is plenty of room for all in Australia. This country depends largely upon its primary products, and markets have to be found in other parts of the world for them if Australia is to be properly developed. It will be difficult for us to export our secondary products, because the high wages paid and the conditions under which they are manufactured will saddle them with such a cost that we shall be at a disadvantage in the world&#39;s markets. If we devote our best attention to the question of secondary production and the finding of markets we. shall eventually solve the difficulty because of the quantity of raw material we possess. At the present time we have to devote our energies mostly to primary production. Even some of our primary products are getting beyond the outside demand. We know that the markets for dried fruits are choked up. We cannot export our sugar and compete successfully with that which has been grown by coloured labour. If a large number of immigrants are brought to Australia it will lead to a greater consumption of our primary products, and the building up of our secondary industries in order to supply the people with the commodities they require. We have everything to gain by bringing population to the country. The Commonwealth Line of Steamers ought to provide us with cheap freights. I hope that that Line will expand and eventually control the whole of Australian shipping. We must remember that we are a long distance from the countries that consume our products. The Commonwealth Line of Steamers pays the highest wages and operates under the best conditions. The employees have not responded in a proper manner to the excellent treatment they have received, but on the contrary have done everything they possibly could to ruin the Line. </para>

                                <para>- That will be done when we have the population. Queensland possesses thousands of acres suitable for cotton growing. The industry could be carried on on small farms, insuring a good living for those engaged in it. It is a family job, which does not require a great deal of physical labour. The industry is capable of absorbing thousands of immigrants. So long as the price remains at the present figure it will be possible to work the industry profitably with white labour. We must not overlook the fact that in other countries cotton is grown mostly with black labour. The scarcity of the commodity at the present time is responsible for the splendid return that is being enjoyed. Those conditions, I think, will continue for a long time. If our population continues to increase, why cannot we grow the cotton, have it manufactured here, and export the calico? We grow&#39; the best merino woo! in the world, yet we send it away in the raw state and have it returned in the shape of woollen goods. By introducing capital and population we shall be able to develop our resources to the fullest extent. If any of those engaged in the industry of cotton growing become millionaires, I shall say &#34; Good luck &#34; to them. </para>

                                <para>- The sugar industry would never have been interfered with had there not been the cry against black  labour. Legislators interfered with, it, and did more harm than good. Cotton can be grown in many of the States. Queensland has thousands of acres suitable for its growth. Given good seasons and a favorable market, it can supply the requirements of the world. The only really serious problem that Australia has to solve is that of the seasons. If means can be found of coping with the dry spells that are experienced in Australia, all our difficulties will disappear. Water conservation is proceeding in many of the States, and already has done a great deal of good. There are miles of country in Australia, however, where water cannot be conserved. It is not possible to dam water in central Australia or on the huge plains that are to be found in many of the States. Once . this problem is solved, Australia will hold its own with any other part of the world, and millions of people will be settled on the land. Our friends opposite should refrain from preaching class prejudice and class hatred. </para>

I have stated a few facts, which no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> does not like. Until the working class, or any other class, recognises its duty to the rest of the community, and realizes that it has to render a service proportionate to that which it receives, Australia will not progress. When our friends opposite advocate anything with which I agree, I shall support them. I do not care what a person gets out of an industry so long as the industry is capable of bearing it. I object to the activities of the crusted Tory type of man who is trying to destroy the good legislation that has been placed on the statute-book. The worst enemy of that legislation is the working class, which will not recognise the facts and act up to them. </para>

                            <para>. - During the last few years there have been remarkable changes in Federal politics, and in some respects a complete transformation. Since I was last a member of the Senate there have been many changes in this Chamber. In fact, standing as I am now, facing you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I find that there have been changes to the right of me, changes to the left of me, and if I may be permitted to say so, changes in front of me. Apparently the impossibility of yesterday is the reality of to-day. A few years ago, the Labour party had a substantial majority here and in another place, and associated with that party were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> - Leader in this Chamber of the six-equals-five and five-equals-six composite Government - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch, Senator Newland, Senator Russell,</inline> and others I need not mention. At that time the Labour party favoured co-operation as against competition. It opposed rings, trusts, and combines, and advocated the nationalization of monopolies; its objective was the nationalization of the means of production, distribution, and exchange. To that policy all members of the Labour party, including those honorable senators whom I have named, subscribed. But we were handicapped in the furtherance of our policy by the limitations imposed by the Constitution, arid in order to overcome those limitations we submitted proposals for the alteration of the Constitution. Those proposals were submitted to a referendum of the people in 1911, and. were defeated. They were again submitted to a referendum in 1913. On both occasions booklets were issued headed, &#34; For and Against,&#34; in which we gave reasons to the electors why they should support our proposals. Both pamphlets were indorsed by these gentlemen, who say they have not changed their views. It will be interesting to other senators associated with them to hear the opinions expressed by them at the period to which I am referring. In regard to the Constitution, we, and they, said - </para>

The mills were established in peace time because it was the Labour party&#39;s policy; and in order to satisfy ourselves, and convince the community in general that the manufacture of woollen cloth and the making of uniforms could be undertaken in the interests of the people, a Committee was appointed in 1911, consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pethebridge</inline> and Lieut.  -Colonel.

                            <para>Having fully considered the whole question, and given due weight to the views expressed <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the several witnesses examined-, the Committee is of opinion that it would be a distinct advantage to the Commonwealth Service if a clothing factory were established. The reasons which influence the Committee in forming this conclusion are as follow: -Better uniforms would be obtained at no greater, and probably less cost;uniformprices for similar garments would obtain throughout the Commonwealth; in all cases materials and workmanship would be subjected to a standard test; Australian manufacture of material would be insured ; the labour conditions and rates of wages of employees would be strictly under the control of the Government; the Government, in providing for its own requirements, would be able so to arrange and regulate delivery that any inconvenience would be reduced to a minimum. </para>

                        <para class="block">When the Government Departments were being exploited by private enterprise, the Departments themselves and the soldiers were not supplied with uniforms just as they were required. When the Commonwealth Woollen Mills were established, and the Clothing Factory was brought into existence, there was regularity in the supply of uniforms, and they cost about half what the Departments had previously paid for them. WhenSenator Pearce, who took a prominent part in the establishment of these mills, was in England, he specially selected <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> from among a number of other applicants, because of his high credentials, to be manager of the mills. He was also recommended by the High Commissioner. In order to show our opponents that we knew no boundary line or geographical limitations in Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail,</inline> when he came to Australia, was directed to tour the Commonwealth, and to recommend to the Government - it was a Labour Government then - the best possible site for the mills.

The buildings alone cost &#163;81,000 in peace time, and they were erected on the most up-to-date lines. I venture to say, without fear of contradiction, that if those buildings had to be put up to-day they would cost as much as the Government have received for the whole undertaking. </para>

                                <para>- If 3d. per yard had been added to the selling cost of the material, the mills could have paid all taxes, and yet made nearly &#163;100,000 profit in two years. But honorable senators opposite, who formerly belonged to the Labour party, have the temerity to say that they have not completely changed their views. As a matter of fact, they have &#34;boxed the compass.&#34; They are opposed to everything that they formerly advocated, and1 the sale of the mills at Geelong is evidence of it, if further evidence be needed. Is there not the same necessity for the mills now that there was when they were established? </para>

                                <para>- If the mills were necessary in 1911, there is even greater necessity for them to-day. One can understand their sale by a Government who are opposed to Government enterprise, but it is hard to understand the attitude of those honorable gentlemen who formerly belonged to the Labour party. It will stand to the everlasting discredit of the Government that they disposed of a public property at an altogether insufficient price, considering the value of the plant and machinery. The Government did not proceed in a business-like way* and it ill becomes any Government to admit that they were so incompetent in coming to a decision concerning a certain tender that the ex -Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Massy Greene)</inline> had to interview <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> a supporter of the Government, for his advice as to what should be done with this property. </para>

The Nationalist party had a policy, as also did the Country party, and overtures were made by the then Leader of the Nationalist party to the Leader of the Country party, but they were turned down. The ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. M. Hughes)</inline> said that unless the members of the Country party formed an alliance with the Nationalists he would unsheath his sword and fight the Country party to the death. That party refused to form an alliance, and the political battle continued. During the course of the campaign the then Federal Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> had a few complimentary words to say concerning the Country party and their capacity to govern this country. Speaking at Maryborough, in Victoria, he said - </para>
                        <para>The present Prime Minister is the only man who can lead you in Australia at this time. I have looked around to see if possibly there was another leader. There is only one man who has the ability, but he has not the courage to lend the country. There is only the little man, who has the courage and ability. I say without hesitation that, if the Prime Minister is thrown out, it will be the end of Nationalism, and will be a poor look-out for Liberalism. </para>
                        <para>The ex-Federal Treasurer, who is now the Prime Minister, also said - </para>
                        <para>The people, or rather the great bulk of those who support the Country party, are all right, but they are a little misguided, perhaps. The only trouble is that the party is led by the most paralyzing leaders - men who are incapable of leading. If they obtain power, they will lead the country to disaster. </para>
                        <para>That is what the present Prime Minister said of the present Treasurer and other members of his Ministry. I wonder what his opinion is now, when he has given members of the Country party office and clothed them with responsibility. The representatives of the Country party say that they are in charge of all the spending Departments, and, in that happy position, they imagine that they are ruling the country. The present Prime Minister continued - </para>
                        <para>If you get rid of the Prime Minister against his will he could wreck you to-morrow. . . . If he be thrown out, as some cheery optimist&#34; suggest, I may say, incidentally, that I will go out too, and I think that we will put up a stiff fight against those who attempt to run the Government of this country. &#34; If he goes out, I will go out too.&#34; The ex-Prime Minister went out, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> came in. </para>

He cooed and wooed with the Leader of the Country party for a long time, and when the present Prime Minister said for the first time, &#34;Wilt thou?&#34; the Leader of the Country party said, &#34; No.&#34; However, in response to an urgent <inline font-style="italic">billet d&#39;amour,</inline> the Leader of the Country party travelled as fast as the express would convey him to North Melbourne, where he left the train heavily veiled.

                                <para>- It would be interesting to have the information. The Commonwealth Government stated that there would be no dislocation of the labour market consequent upon the arrival of many thousands of immigrants in Australia. It would have been better had that statement not appeared in the Governor-General&#39;s policy speech. What guarantee can the Government give that there will be no dislocation of the Australian labour market? Last year, the late Government voted over a quarter of a million of money to relieve the then unemployed in Australia. To-day, throughout the Commonwealth there is an army of unemployed. The Prime Minister, at a commercial travellers&#39; function the other evening, apparently pleased the ears of the assembly by stating that, after the conclusion of the Economic Conference, he intended to tour Great Britain, visiting the principal cities, to encourage wholesale immigration to Australia. I wish to know what provision has been made, or is being made, to find employment for new arrivals? If the State Governments can guarantee employment to new arrivals, why cannot they do the same for the Australian born? If they can guarantee farms for new arrivals, should not preference be given to Australians when land is available? </para>

                                <para>- If these men have been assisted, then too much care has not been exercised- in their selection. The Labour party&#39;s policy on immigration is the same as it was when that party was in power many years ago.. If Australia were made sufficiently attractive there would be no occasion to engage recruiters or  &#34;spruikers&#34;  and to spend thousands of pounds of the taxpayers&#39; money to induce people to. come .here. They would come of their own free will. The present system of immigration will cost the people of Australia millions of money, and there is no guarantee that employment or farms will be found for the immigrants. Of all the schemes in respect of immigration there is only one sound and sensible business proposition, and that is the one adopted by the Queensland Labour Government. </para>

Until they reach manhood the Government will, in a measure, be responsible for them. They are to be clothed, &#38;nd two-thirds of their earnings placed in a bank. When they reach the age of twenty-one, their accumulated savings with interest, less a deduction for clothing and the money advanced for the passage, will be handed to them. </para>

Many of these men hurried to answer the appeal of the Government for assistance in 1914, and the succeeding years, only to find now that there is no assistance for them when they so urgently need it. </para>

                            <para>As the Reverend Ainslie Yates, of the Mission of St. James and St. John, said when addressing a meeting of the unemployed at the Labour Bureau yesterday, it ls a great pity that some members of the Government could not be forced to share for twenty-four hours the life of some of these men. If they did so, there is not the faintest doubt that relief in some form would be instantly forthcoming. No one could view unmoved such scenes. </para>

                        <para class="block">It is a daily occurrence to see large numbers of men seeking in vain for employment. Last Saturday honorable senators who were in Melbourne and walked the streets witnessed a sight they will long remember. At every street corner there were unemployed with collection boxes. Many of the collectors wore the badge of the returned soldier. They were soliciting as much as they could get from the kindly-disposed people to help to tide them over their difficulties. I conversed with one man who had a box. He told me that he had been out of work for some weeks. I asked him if he were a married man. He said, &#34;Yes.&#34; I said, &#34;Have you any family?&#34; He said, &#34;I have three young children, and our breakfast, dinner, and tea yesterday consisted of bread and dripping.&#34; He asked me if I knew anybody who could employ him. </para>

Although the Commonwealth Government have voted the money, and the States have agreed to back the amount and begin certain work, so far as I have been able to gather those works have not been commenced in earnest. The result is that a large number of people are still out of employment. Until the men in the different cities are found employment, it is a wrong policy for the Government to bring thousands of others in and swell the unemployed market. </para>

                            <para>When the buying frenzy was at its height one manufacturer received an order for over 1,500 of a special plumber&#39;s brass fitting. Knowing it was a line not allowed by the Metropolitan Board ,of Works, he interviewed the Department and mildly suggested that fifteen, and not 1,500, would be sufficient. He -&#187; was told that the Department knew its own business best, and the order must be filled. The citizens of Australia still own these fittings. </para>

                            <para>There is another strange line to be found at the stores. On a notice-board where the list of material is displayed is one notification referring to cement wash troughs. Across it is the significant announcement, &#34; Not approved by Metropolitan Board.&#34; These troughs were made to order of reinforced concrete, and cost about 40s. each. Their exact number cannot be ascertained, but there were several hundreds of them, and they were ordered and made with outlets smaller than the Metropolitan Board will allow. They cannot be altered, and they cannot be used anywhere in Melbourne. </para>

The material in question was manufactured in Melbourne from paper felt, saturated with tar, and was used in the soldiers&#39; homes. ... A builder&#39;s comment was to the effect that a black line painted on the wall would be as effective. . . . There were other lines in sewerage brassware that had an interesting history, and might have &#39;been bought, at a very reasonable price had not the Metropolitan Board of Works been disagreeable about allowing them to be used. It is stated that they were eventually sold as scrap brass. </para>

                        <para class="block">Apparently there were thousands of pounds&#39; worth of material in that exhibition that now have little or no value. The Government ought to make the closest inquiry into some, at least, of these allegations. They ought to find out by whom the material was ordered, and from whom it was purchased. Apparently orders were given haphazardly, by men who did not understand their business; otherwise the materials would not have been rejected by the Metropolitan Board of Works. Everybody knows that builders have to comply with certain health regulations, regulations of the Metropolitan Board of Works and other institutions. If those regulations are not complied with, then the materials, no matter what they cost, are not permitted to be used in a building. It is necessary that those regulations should &#34;be enforced. These people apparently did not care what sort of order they gave, and would not accept advice from men who knew their business. The name of the officer who was advised to order fifteen, and not 1,500, brass fittings, ought to be ascertained. I hope, that the Royal Commission will be given the opportunity to go into this and other matters that are of moment to the taxpayers of Australia. </para>

                        <para>This is the first opportunity I have had since I &#39; entered- this Chamber to enter a vigorous protest against the action of the late Government in hold-  ing the elections, on the 16th December last. Some honorable senators say jokingly, &#39;and others seriously, that the Labour party wants to achieve its ends by other than constitutional methods. That is not correct. We are essentially a Constitutional party, and because we respect the Constitution we want to see that those who occupy positions of trust and power also respect it. The late Administration did not do so. As a matter of fact, it showed an utter disrespect to the wishes and mandate of the people. When the Deakin Government were in power in 1906, strong representations were made against the holding of Federal elections in December. The Constitution provided that Senators, should retire at the end of December. hut it was pointed out that the holding of elections during that month was a serious handicap to those engaged in rural work. Their occupation prevented them from attending election meetings, &#39;and even from recording their votes. The representations on their behalf were so strong that the Government asked the people at a referendum to alter the Constitution and provide that senators should retire at the end of June. The votes cast for the alteration were 774,000; those cast against the alteration were 162,000. Therefore there was a&#39; majority of 612,000 against the holding of ejections in December. </para>

But the Nationalist Government then . in power seized what they considered to he the psychological moment when their stocks wore high in the political market, and forced an election some months before Parliament would have expired by effluxion of time. They succeeded in winning many seats, and, no doubt, spurred by their victory, they chose the 16tsh December, 1922, as the date &#39;for the next election. </para>

                                <para>- I speak ae a citizen of Australia. The effect of holding the elections in December was that successful senators had to wait until the 1st July before they could enter this Chamber. - I do nob mean that they could have entered the Chamber earlier than the 1st July if the elections had been held later than they were. My point is that if the elections had taken place during that part of the year when the people, in voting for the alteration of the Constitution, intended them to be held - if they had been held about April or May, defeated senators would not have been able to take such a prominent part in the proceedings of Parliament, and in passing legislation, &#39;as they were in a position to do in consequence of the election taking place in December. </para>

                        <para>The Government have a long programme. I do not  believe,  and neither do they, that they will be able to carry it through. It will be a. matter  of  impossibility. However, we shall play our! part in the discussion of measures brought forward. We shall criticise them when it is necessary to do so. We shall support those measures we deem worthy of support. But at all times we shall do our level best to strengthen our position, both within this Parliament and - outside. We are satisfied that whether the present Government remains in power for a short period only or for the whole term of this Parliament, the longer it holds office as a composite Ministry the stronger will our position grow, both within this Parliament and outside. We are satisfied, also, that when the next appeal to the people takes place, we  shall  com&#169; into our own again and have a majority in both Chambers. We shall be what we were in the past, a force and power in Federal politics, and the legislation we shall enact when the administration of affairs is again intrusted to our hands will be for the advancement of Australia, and  the  happiness and betterment .of the majority of its citizens. </para>

                        <para>. - Two years ago, the Government of Australia decided that traffic in the plumage of birds of paradise was to cease, and they have since taken strong measures to suppress what we may call this nefarious trade. I was rather surprised, therefore, to notice in an article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> that one of the leading actresses, in a theatrical show called &#34; Rockets,&#34; appears on the stage wearing bird of paradise plumage in her head-dress. This lady&#39;s attire occasions a great deal of comment among those who witness the performance, and I should like to know whether it is a fact that members of the theatrical profession can obtain permission to wear plumage that others are forbidden to wear. Is there any way- in which members of that profession can get behind the law, as it were, and take advantage of the good nature of a Minister, or his desire to assist a theatrical performance of this sort? I suppose that numbers of women are not yet educated to a standard that will enable them to realize the brutality entailed in obtaining these feathers, and there are many of them who desire to wear them. But this they are forbidden by the law of the Commonwealth to do, and I think the Government should also insist that people engaged in the theatrical profession, who appear nightly decked in this plumage, should be called upon to offer some explanation as to how they have become possessed of these forbidden feathers. </para>
