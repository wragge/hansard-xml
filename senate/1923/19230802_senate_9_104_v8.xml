                        <para>.- Although it is considered to be the duty of an Opposition to oppose Government Bills, I do not think this Bill will be very seriously opposed from this side of the Chamber. I am pleased to be able to support it. To develop the Northern Territory we must provide means of communication for settlers, and facilities for them to get their products to market. I would be more pleased if I were asked to support the extension of the southern end of the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. The Bill does not provide for that, but I shall not on that account oppose it. Cattle, and perhaps sheep, raisers, will be benefited by the northern extension, but the other line would provide for closer settlement. The natural advantages of the southern line are so great that there is, obviously, some motive for extending the northern line first. I have no doubt that the Government's attitude is based upon the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, but the report of that Committee distinctly states - </para>

                    <para class="block">It seems to me that 'undue influence has been brought to bear to take the railway to Camooweal. The object appears to be to benefit the Meat Combine, which, with the advantage of this railway and the meat bounty, will be on a good wicket." I wish to point out to the Senate the extraordinary burden that is being shouldered by the extension of the Northern line. The cost of the existing line is very heavy, and it is a question whether the Commonwealth should saddle itself with an extension which, in the opinion of the Committee that investigated the matter, will not do what we want to do, namely, extend settlement in the Territory. I quote the following figures to show the enormous' annual loss on the existing line. The results each year of the working of the line from 1st January, 1911, to 30th June, 1919, are - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">The total loss to the Commonwealth since taking the line over thus represents £513,092. Excluding interest on capital, £416,940, the loss is £96,151. The position is very unsatisfactory. The extension of the line is not likely to result in an increase in the net receipts, because, while the revenue may be more, the working expenses will be correspondingly heavier. It is probable that when the line is carried .to the point for which this Bill provides, the annual loss on working will be over £100,000 a year. I believe a well-established motor transport service, with improved concrete roads and provision for petrol stations, would be cheaper and more satisfactory, but that is a question to be considered on another occasion and in another place. I stated previously that I would support any Bill that had for its object the improvement of the conditions for the settlers. This will be one means. The question of defence has no&gt; bearing on this subject. We are not likely to induce closer settlement in the Northern Territory, and therefore, the problem of its defence must be approached from a point other than that of the actual manpower resident in the Territory. I regret that the Government have not seen fit to put in hand railway construction from the southern end. When we took the Northern Territory over from South Australia there was a definite understanding as to what we should do. The Commonwealth railway from Quorn to Oodnadatta in South Australia is being operated by the South Australian Government on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the loss in working is so heavy that it is necessary for the Government to do something without delay to improve the position. One proposal is to extend the line to the Macdonnell Ranges to tap the good pastoral country there, and by that means insure additional revenue. .It is essential also that there should be some variation in the agreement with the South Australian Government., The arrangement provides for the number of trains to be run, and stipulates the freights and fares to be charged. Since the line .was taken over, the South Australian Government have raised rates on all their lines by 50 per cent; but under the agreement with the Commonwealth, no alteration is permitted on the Quorn-Oodnadatta section, which is linked up with the main South Australian railway-system, with the result that during the years 1911-19, the loss on that section was £933,979 8s. lid. During the year prior to the railway being taken over by the Commonwealth, the South Australian Government neglected to maintain the line in an efficient condition, and consequently the Commonwealth Government, in the . first year, was obliged ' to spend a large sum in repairs and in relaying throughout the entire section. In stormy weather certain portions of the line become covered with sand drift, which has to be cleared away at heavy expense before traffic can be resumed. Cattle-owners are also antagonistic. They threaten that if the Government raise rates on stock they will boycott the line, and bring their stock down by road. We seem to be in the grip of another combine. Costs m every other direction have mounted considerably in recent years, but it would seem that certain pastoralists want the taxpayers of the Commonwealth to assist them to market their stock. In all the circumstances, I think, we must support the Bill to extend the Northern Territory Railway to Daly Waters. The section of the line to Katherine River is absolutely useless. I have been as far as the present terminus, and so far as I can judge, the land through which the line passes is almost valueless, except perhaps for cotton growing. I suggest that the Government carry out experiments in cotton-growing. If it proves suitable for the Northern Territory we may then be able to settle a number of small holders on land adjacent to the line. In this way we may be- able to increase the population of the Northern Territory. A standard gauge of 4 ft. S£ in. has been decided upon, and the longer we delay converting our existing lines to that gauge, the greater will be the cost. When the first portion of this line was constructed, arrangements were made for sleepers of sufficient length to be used to allow the line to be converted to a broader gauge at very short notice. The sidings and necessary bridges were also constructed in such a way that if the gauge were widened expensive alterations would be unnecessary. I understand that no such provision has been made in connexion with this proposed extension. </para>

                            <para>- It is useless to increase the width of the bridges if the  steel sleepers to be used are of insufficient width to carry a gauge of 4 ft.8½in. In opposing invaders, all our railways would be required for military purposes, and possibly rolling-stock would have to be transported from the south for use on our Northern Territory lines. Leading military experts, including the late Lord  Kitchener, have stated that our first line of defence is a uniform railway gauge. I do not know what extra cost would be involved in supplying sleepers of a greater length, but perhaps the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> will give that information. In constructing the proposed lino, the Government will be carrying out the compact previously entered into with South Australia. The Government of that State are now endeavouring to bluff the Commonwealth Government by suggesting that they are prepared to take over control of the southern portion of the Northern Territory, but there is little likelihood of any of the States shouldering the responsibility of a section or sections of the Territory when they have so much of their own to develop. The control of the Northern Territory, together with the construction of railways within its boundaries is a national question, and one which should be handled only by the Federal Government. I do not object to the Government incurring expenditure in necessary railway construction, and I am not concerned whether the line is eventually extended into Queensland or South Australia, but we should not allow it to remain at a dead-end. When the Bill is in Committee, I shall move an amendment to provide that the length of the sleepers be increased to enable the gauge of the line to be broadened at the proper time. If we are ever called upon to defend Australia - rpersonally, I do not think the occasion will ever arise - a uniform gauge will be essential. The gauge of the line from Port Darwin southward should be widened. An effort should also be made to reduce the heavy losses which are at present incurred, and it is to be hoped that the extension of the line will assist in that' direction. I support the Bill. </para>

I have reason to doubt the purpose of  this Bill, in view of the Minister's remarks last week when introducing it. In effect, he said that the proposed railway would cross the Barkly Tablelands, and that it would link up later with the Queensland railways in order to develop the pastoral country of north-western Queensland. "When the Bill is in Committee, I intend to submit amendments which, to my mind, will make the purpose of the Bill and the intention of the Committee clear. </para>

Later I shall quote reports showing that, for a long time, there has been a decided intention that the Northern Territory railway shall link up with Camooweal. The Government, in selecting this route, have not followed the trend of the evidence which was taken by the Public Works Committee. I doubt very much whether the Government have read the report. I know that, for some time past, there has been a feeling on the part of railway officers in the Commonwealth Service that this railway should extend to Camooweal; if not, then to Birdsville, and thence in the direction of Bourke. The evidence taken by the . Public Works Committee during their travels through Australia shows that that is the last direction the railway should take. I shall not quote extensively from the evidence. It was impossible to keep the evidence separate, and the witnesses were questioned as to the North-South railway and the Eastern railway, that is, the railway to Camooweal. The Committee commenced 'their inquiries early in January, 1921, and the first evidence was taken in Western Australia. I particularly draw attention to the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Durack,</inline> one of the great pioneers of the north-west of- Western Australia.

                        <para>I consider that we require railways to connect Derby, Wyndham, and the western side generally with the Northern Territory line - with the North-South railway. . . . The construction of the proposed railway would be an ' advantage to Australia generally.  . . Another point is that the North-South line would bring the Northern Territory within a couple of day's of Adelaide or Melbourne, instead of a fortnight. . . . </para>

                    <para class="block">Dyke, an ex-South Australian. He had been engaged in railway construction in South Australia, and on survey work in the Northern Territory as far north as Tennant's Creek. He stated -  . . I . was on the construction of the Alice Springs line, and I was five years in the Macdonnell Ranges for the Government. . . . If I were constructing a railway north and south, I would go the direct route to Alice Springs after leaving Oodnadatta; this direct route would serve all the western country; it is magnificent pastoral country. . . . Supposing we had a north and south railway, it would serve the pastoral country east for at least 150 miles; and, if there were stock waters, it would reach right up to the west, into the Kimberley country, and east into the Queensland Gulf country . . . </para>
                    <para> I would certainly say the railway should be run north and south as nearly as possible along the transcontinental telegraph lines. This would not run through a large area of poor country; that is a fallacy on the part of people who have not been through that part. . . . </para>
                    <para>I am quite familiar with the northern portion of Australia as high as Tennant's Creek, which is nearly half way to Darwin from Oodnadatta. . . . </para>
                    <para>I am quite definite in my opinion that the North-South route is the preferable. . . . I am certain that the country to be travelled by the North-South railway will carry stock all the way, from one end to the other, provided there is water and means of getting the stock down, and water can be got there. . . . </para>
                    <para>It would not be a good scheme to connect the railway to Port Darwin from Camooweal instead of down from Oodnadatta. . . . </para>
                    <para>There is certainly not better land in the north-west of Queensland than in the centre of Australia;, the land in the centre of Australia is better than in the north of Australia. I am talking about ordinary cattle country, and there are cattle stations there now. </para>

                        <para>A railway built for 207} miles from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs would do more to develop the Northern Territory than the whole of the efforts. of South Australia and the Commonwealth up to the present have succeeded in doing. It would open up a corridor to and make accessible, the valuable country in the Macdonnell Ranges. It would decrease the cost of freights in the whole of the southern half of the Territory. It would enable it to be stocked with sheep, and would give access to that great mineral field to which I have referred! ... </para>
                        <para>I have read everything I can find to read in regard to the rivalVoutes for the railway. The conclusion 1 have come to is that a North-South line is necessary, because it will bisect the great mineral field of the Territory as well as serve the pasteral country, better than would a line from Camooweal to Powell's Creek. . . . </para>
                        <para>I think a line from Oodnadatta would serve the bust interests of the Territory better than would a line from Queensland. If the proposal were to build one section of the line only, would build the stretch from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, because it would open up proved country suitable for sheep, cattle, and horses. ... It would open up the biggest unexploited mineral belt in Australia at the present time. . . . </para>

So far I have been quoting evidence taken from persons who to some extent have not seen the centre of Australia.

                            <para>- In good seasons stock can be travelled almost as easily as they can be trucked. The journey would take more time, but the stock would very likely arrive in better condition. We took evidence at Avon Downs, at the other end of the Territory, to the same effect I do not intend to quote too much of this evidence. It is mostly a repetition. From "one end of the route to the other, the witnesses all told the same tale. I desire now to quote evidence taken further north than Alice Springs. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The suggestion has been made to build a line to Oodnadatta and Alice Springs from Kingoonya, on the East- West line. Such a route would be further west than the existing Quorn-Oodnadatta line, but witnesses declare that it would tap the best country. It would certainly avoid a certain range of hills ; and it is a matter for inquiry to ascertain whether it would run through better country. The. trouble is that over 300 miles of the existing railway, from Quorn to Oodnadatta, would have to be pulled up. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brcadon,</inline> of Todmordan, gave the following evidence :  - </para>

I have allowed him very considerable latitude. The measure before the Senate is "a Bill for an Act to provide for the extension of the railway in the Northern Territory by the construction of a railway to Daly Waters." That is definite. It refers to a railway running between two points. There is nothing in the Bill about a railway from Oodnadatta. The honorable senator is inviting other honorable senators to trespass, by discussing something that is not within the four corners of the Bill. I hope he will confine himself to the specific proposal in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to quote that evidence further. Some time ago, when speaking on the Address-in-Reply, I referred to this matter, and quoted certain clauses from the Northern Territory Acceptance Act. Paragraph 2, sub-paragraph c of the schedule of that Act is to the effect that South Australia shall do certain things. It may be within the recollection of the Senate* that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> interrupted me, 'and pointed out that these were the things that South Australia should do. South Australia has done them all, and has done them on condition that the Commonwealth shall " construct, or cause to be constructed, a railway in South Australia proper from any point on the Port Augusta railway to a point on the northern boundary line of South Australia proper, to connect with that part of the transcontinental railway to be built in the Northern Territory." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> pointed out that South Australia was supposed to do certain things, but the State of South Australia was not supposed to build this railway, either to Alice Springs or Daly Waters. Provision was made for the Commonwealth to take over the Territory and build the line. The people of South Australia have carried out their part of the contract. They have handed over the existing railway and the required area of country, and have in every way complied with the provisions of the Act. I do not know how a lawyer of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman's</inline> shrewdness and acumen can say that one portion of this Act shall apply to one thing, and another portion to another thing. I maintain that I was quite right in saying that the Northern Territory Acceptance Act binds the Commonwealth to build the line to which I have just referred. I am at a loss to know whether I should endeavour to insert a clause in the Bill to provide for what I want, or whether I should content myself with voicing a protest. The cost of constructing the proposed railway will be very great. The bridge over the v Katherine River will alone cost, according to the estimate, £95000. I would not pit my opinion against that of engineers, but I doubt whether that bridge can be built for £95,000. Whatever it costs, and whatever route the railway takes, it will have to be built. In my opinion it will take three years to build the bridge across the Katherine River. There is a chasm there 50 feet or 60 feet deep, so that when the river is in flood, and this happens frequently, work will have to be suspended sometimes for four or five months. Necessarily, work on the line will also be hung up during that period, because it will not be possible to get much material across the river until the bridge is built. At any rate, the railway itself could not be worked until the bridge was completed, and, as I have shown, that will take a considerable time. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; one can tell, almost to 'the day, when the monsoonal rains will begin, and when they will end. I recognise the value of the country to be tapped by the railway, but I contend that die people on the western side, over towards Wave Hill, have just as much right to consideration as have the pastoralists on the Barkly Tableland and east towards Camooweal. The country on the western side, although of a different; class, is just as good, and an abundant supply of water is obtainable at shallow depths. I do not "object  to the construction of this section of the line, in view of the fact that the Committee; of which I was a member, reported favorably upon it; but I have a perfect right, as one of the representatives of South Australia, which has been waiting for so many years for the construction of the North-South line, to enter my emphatic protest against the Government for not giving full effect to the recommendation of the . Committee, or at least outlining their intentions with regard to that railway. It is only due to members of this Parliament that the Government should define their position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> suggested that it was only so much " bluff " on the part of South Australia to talk of taking over the southern part of the Territory. I am not in a position to speak for the Premier of South Australia, and, therefore, I cannot say whether he was indulging in " bluff," but I can, at all events, say that, in my humble opinion, it would have been in the interests of all concerned if the Premier of South Australia had kept out of this squabble, for the time being, at all events. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me to be impossible to do so; even if it were seriously thought of, it is mischievous to talk about it now. I suggest that members of this Parliament both here and in another place are capable of dealing with the Government if they are not prepared to honour the pledge given to South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Barwell has not much influence in this Parliament, but unfortunately his interference in the controversy is having an unsettling effect upon the pastoralists, and also upon certain members in this Parliament. I am not going to move for the inclusion in the Bill of any provision which might retard the progress of this work. I look upon it as the first instalment of the line to connect with South Australia, but if I had as much faith in the Government as I suppose I ought to have,, since I am a supporter of the Ministry, I should be more satisfied as to their intentions with regard to the eastern swing of the proposed railway into Queensland. I hope that my fears may prove unfounded, and that in a very short time we shall have an announcement of Government policy concerning the route to which I have referred. I 'regret very much that we have not been informed already. I should be very sorry, after what has been said as to the possibilities of the country, and the reports that have been furnished, if its development should be left to the " say-so" of a Minister of the Crown, who might pay a flying visit to the Territory, but would not be able to get evidence on oath, as the Public Works Sectional Committee did, from people who have been living there for very many years. </para>

                        <para>. - There seems to be a tendency to regard this Bill as one peculiarly affecting the South Australian members of this Chamber. As a fact, it concerns us no more than it concerns representatives of other States, because of our interest in the Northern Territory as a portion of the Commonwealth. As a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia, I was a representative of the Northern Territory for many years, that portion of South Australia being then included in the Legislative Council Northern District, an extensive constituency as large as very many European countries. I am afraid I must confess that I, perhaps, neglected, my responsibilities, in that I did not visit that portion of my constituency, but I always took a great interest in Northern Territory affairs. I remember being a member of a Commission that inquired into the possibility of extending the railway line from the South Australian end to connect with- the Queensland railway system, and in connexion with this matter I should like to say that I do not think there is any objection on the part of the representatives of South Australia to railway connexion with Queensland or Western Australia, so long as the solemn compact, entered into when the Territory was handed over, that the main trunk line should be constructed, is honoured by the Commonwealth. With the limitations which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have, no doubt, very properly placed upon honorable senators taking part in this debate, the ground which we may cover is somewhat circumscribed. Therefore, my remarks  will te brief. I support the proposal to extend the existing railway ^ to Daly Waters because I think it is necessary for the development of the northern portions of the Territory, and because, also, it may be regarded as a section of the transcontinental line, which I hope to see proceeded with at a very early date. I indorse what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> has said, and regret that the Government did not fully carry out the recommendation of the Committee which inquired so carefully into the subject, and collated such a large amount of evidence, the' tenor of which indicates that the most urgent portion of the trans-continental line is the section from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges. However, I think that the northern section is also necessary. In this Chamber last week we devoted a good deal of attention, in the debate on the Northern Territory Crown Lands Bill, to the terms of leases for the further settle- , ment of the Northern Territory; and this proposed railway will traverse for a considerable distance country that will be affected by those leases. It is not likely that the proposed line will be profitable from the point of view of earning sufficient revenue to pay working expenses and interest on capital cost, but we have to regard it as a national undertaking for developmental purposes, and useful also for defence. An extension to the Macdonnell Ranges on the southern end would develop a large area of fertile country, and perhaps result in important mining developments. There is always the hope that, as we push our railways into that country, we may discover another Broken Hill . or Kalgoorlie, in which event the line would be justified, not only from the point of view of development, but also as a revenue-producing investment. I have nothing more to say, except that I think the Government have begun at the wrong end ; but at the same time I support the Bill for the construction of what I believe is the first part of the transcontinental line, which will also aid in the development of important pastoral areas in the Northern Territory. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the Bill for the extension of the line from Mataranka to Daly Waters, not because it will open up a large area of good country, but because when it gets down to Daly Waters it will be going in the right direction to tap eventually the Barkly Tableland, which is properly regarded as the richest portion of the Northern Territory. The land there is incomparably the best in the Territory from every point of view, whether for sheep, cattle, or horses. In view of the fact that the Government have in mind the standardization of gauges in Australia apparently to 4 ft. 8^ in., it seems strange that the sleepers for this railway axe not to be in "conformity with the culverts and bridged - that is to say, long enough to carry a standard gauge line when the conversion is made. In the circumstances, the policy of providing for 3-ft. 6-in. steel sleepers is a waste of money. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that steel sleepers will last for fifty years. Surely, if we are going to standardize the railways of Australia the work will be undertaken within that time. Personally, I do not think that the North-  South Line, especially along the route advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> will be built within the next half -century. 1 do not think it would be warranted. I am supporting the proposed extension to Daly Waters, because I think public opinion will eventually be so strong, both from a developmental and defence point of view. that what is termed the North-South railway will deviate ' easterly towards Queensland, and thence down to Oodnadatta, or Marree, in South Australia. In making such a deviation it will have to go <inline font-style="italic">vid</inline> Camooweal, and link up with the railway systems of Queensland and New South Wales, which extend westwards from the coast where the population is located. Desirous as we are of developing the central portion of Australia, it is very unlikely that it can ever be used for other than pastoral purposes, as it is country which can be held only in large areas with any prospect of success. I am a liquidator of a large property through which the proposed line will pass, but I am not advocating the construction of the. railway, because I think it would be a gross waste of public money. People rearing cattle and horses in Central Australia could not afford to send their stock by rail to the Adelaide market, to a Darwin market, if there happened to be one, or by rail to Darwin for shipment to Singapore, as the whole value of the stock would be absorbed in railway freight. They will still have to travel on the hoof, as they do at present. For the last forty years cattle from the Barkly Tableland have been brought, down <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Boulia, the Georgina, and Birdsville to the Adelaide market. That has: been successfully done with cattle for the last thirty or forty years, and. with sheep in certain seasons. I quite agree with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> that a line coming down to Birdsville,, and thence on to Marree, would pass through exceedingly poor country. It would be difficult to construct a line over the Georgina" and other waterways, as in good seasons huge areas are- under water. In that country it is either a feast or a famine. It is almost useless in a dry year. In a good season it is flooded, and the floods then cause the growth of good grass on which stock can be fattened. It is, however, very unsatisfactory country through which to construct a railway. </para>

                            <para>- My people were closely associated with sheep breeding in the Northern Territory for thirty or forty years, and after a most extensive trial found' that it did not pay, even on a picked property like Avon Downs. Sheep breeding. was" also tried at Carandotta Station thirty years ago, but it failed, and more recent efforts have not been attended with success. The country grows beautiful wool, but will not breed sheep. I do not wish to condemn ' the Territory, but I am merely stating facts. If the railway system 'were extended to Camooweal - as must be done - it might eventually be possible to successfully raise sheep on the Barkly Tablelands. Up to' date, however, it has been a failure. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that if a railway is to be built at all, it must connect with the western extensions of the Queensland and New South Wales railways. Every one realizes - and the evidence we have before us confirms it - that if Australia were attacked in the north, and we wished to send troops,, horses, and munitions to Port Darwin from Townsville, Rockhampton, Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, or any part of Eastern Australia, it would be foolish to first transport them to Adelaide and send them away north through the centre of Australia on a line which has breaks of gauges, starting from one dead end and finishing at another. In the event of an invasion from the north - which God forbid! - all our troops, horses, and munitions despatched from the eastern portion of Australia, where all the population is, would have to be sent over those lines already running out towards the Northern Territory. It would be absurd to adopt any other course. Moreover, the military experts have said that it would be utterly impossible to concentrate our forces, equipment, guns, munitions, and so forth, in Adelaide, and endeavour to transport them through the dead heart of Australia. I can only support a proposal for the extension of a line which will develop . the Barkly Tableland country, the best in the Northern Territory, and will eventually link up with the railways already constructed in Queensland and New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is not the only one who knows the Territory. There are others equally competent who should be entitled to express their, opinions. Even honorable senators cannot agree, and those on this side of the chamber hold different views on certain matters. Unfortunately, in South Australia we have another gentleman who has become completely obsessed with the building of a North-South line, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> will agree with me that the attitude that gentleman is taking is not assisting the construction of the line over a direct route. I refer to the Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Barwell, who is making all sorts of wild threats as tp what he intends to do. Every sane man knows that South Australia has quite enough country to develop at present, without assuming control over the southern portion of the Territory, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Barwell. My vision is sufficiently broad to enable me to consider this project from an Australian, and not a South Australian, point of view. I am anxious to see every portion of Australia developed to the fullest possible extent. I do not object to Queensland deriving benefit to which it is entitled so long as the other States receive a fair deal. A binding agreement has been entered into between the Commonwealth and South Australia that a line shall be . constructed from the north to the south within a reasonable time. A learned King's Counsel in another place, who does not happen to be a South Australian, said that he thought the South Australian Government had a good case against the Commonwealth Government, and would be successful in an appeal to the High Court over the construction of a North-South line. That gentleman - I refer to the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> - said that he was not in favour of the railway, but he believed in an agreement being honoured. </para>

                    <para>The Commonwealth Government should carry out its part of the contract. I do not suggest that it does not intend to do so, because, in reply to an interjection by me, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Crawford)</inline> was good enough to say that if there were two good sections of country that required development, it did not mean that, because one was to be developed immediately the other would be overlooked. The Minister for "Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> will visit South Australia shortly, and take a trip as far north as Alice Springs. Notwithstanding the more or less evasive reply given by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> to a recent deputation, I am sufficiently optimistic to think that, after the visit of the Minister for Works and Railways, the Government will realize that it is time to construct a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. The experts who have been through the Macdonnell Ranges tell us that there is untold mineral wealth waiting to be tapped. </para>

                            <para>- By continuing the present Commonwealth-owned line in the south to -the rich , territory in Central Australia, its losses would be considerably reduced. I hope that the Government will take note of what several honorable senators - have said on the subject of the gauge.I am strongly in favour of a uniform gauge throughout the Commonwealth. It will be- a great mistake to' build more lines on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge unless provision is made for their conversion to a standard Commonwealth gauge of 4 ft. 8½ in. I hope that within ten years the Commonwealth gauge will be adopted throughout Australia. I should like to see the Queensland railways converted from the 3 ft. 6 in. to the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge, and the South Australian and Victorian lines from the 5 ft. 3 in. to the Commonwealth gauge. </para>

                            <para>- Seeing that the North-South line is required for defence purposes, I object to any particular section of the community trying to divert the line to its own advantage. Neither the pastoralists of Queensland nor any other section should be allowed to do that. I have read the expert evidence of military men, who say that the line should certainly be constructed by a direct route. Australia may have to be defended some day, and the railway should be built so that troops could be moved from one part of the continent to another in the most expeditious manner. . "I commend the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> for the fair tvay in which he introduced the measure. If the Minister for Works and Railways is accompanied on his trip by experts, and if he thoroughly examines the country between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs, I have no doubt that it will not be long before the whole of the route of the North-South line is surveyed. </para>

                        <para>. - The fine speech on the Northern Territory by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> convinced me of the desirability of the proposed railway. I have also had the advantage of a long conversation on Northern Territory matters with a very old friend of mine who has interests there, and who has recently visited the country. He expressed the opinion that a line to Daly Waters would have the effect of bringing a lot of country into profitable use. He stated that the country in which he is interested has no cattle or sheep upon it at present, because the cost of -marketing stock is prohibitive. He said, however, that as soon as the line was opened to Daly Waters he and others would have sufficient inducement to spend large sums, in stocking the country, not with cattle, but with sheep. I should like to impress upon the Government the advisability of extending the line, when the time is ripe, to Newcastle Waters. Such an extension, in the opinion of my friend, would have a far-reaching effect. This would be another instalment of the North-South railway that must ultimately be constructed. The present proposal represents the first instalment of the North-South line, and my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> ought to be happy to know that the construction cf this section is now proposed. It will certainly give South Australians a "leg in" towards the adoption of the recommendation of the Committee of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> was  chairman.  An extension of the line, as the next step, to Newcastle Waters would prove a great boon, and would not violate the principle of a line running through from north to south. It would then be open to the Government of the day to continue the line, either by a direct route, or by going into Queensland as far as Camooweal, and thence down to Birdsville, or even to Bourke. As far as the deviation into Queensland is concerned, this would seem to be the line of least resistance, and I have no doubt . that such a line will eventually be constructed. It is many years since I discussed the matter with the late Lord Forrest, when he visited Central Queensland. He was a strong advocate of the line coming into Queensland at Camooweal, and then going south through Birdsville. I am not one of those who consider that such a diversion would greatly benefit Queensland. If this diversion is made, who will reap the benefit - Adelaide, or our far distant ports on the coast of Queensland? I venture to say that Adelaide, in addition to getting the trade of the South Australian territory through which the lino will pass, will also get a great deal of the trade which now goes to Queensland ports. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The trade of that, portion of Australia is bound to go to Adelaide, and that is why I cannot understand the opposition of the people of South Australia to the proposed diversion of the line from Daly Waters or Newcastle Waters to Camooweal, and then south through Birdsville to Marree. I hope that the Government will keep solidly in front of them the need for ah extension of the lino to Newcastle Waters. Another point that has struck me is that, since the bridges are designed to carry a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line, the sleepers should also be long enough to carry the same gauge. I do not regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> as an expert, but if his estimate of the life of a steel sleeper is correct - fifty years seems an inordinately long time ; half that time would be a long life for a sleeper - it is a strong argument in favour of providing sleepers for the wider gauge. However, I am not an advocate of the 4-f t. 8½-in. gauge. We' have such a vast extent of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge railways in Australia that I think it would be well for us to adhere to that gauge for this line. I do not think that the railway will affect the question of defence, nor does it according to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White. It is, therefore, a negligible matter from that aspect whether the gauge is 4 ft. 8^ in. or 3 ft. 6 in. People may disagree with this view, but certainly it does not establish any argument for departing from the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, which is less costly to build, and shouLd be quite suitable for all purposes for many years to come. </para>

                        <para>.- I regret very much that we have this Bill before us at the present time. I give place to no one in my desire to further the interests of the Northern Territory. It is a no-man's land to-day. Apparently, it has not been the serious business of any Government to undertake its proper development and people it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who has had a long and varied experience of a portion of the Territory, has told us distinctly that the pastoral propositions in the Territory are almost unthinkable for individuals who have . not- almost inexhaustible banking accounts, and that they are suitable only for companies with big capitals. I go further and say that the proper development of the Territory cannot even be undertaken by big financial companies, and that the Government alone can properly develop and people it. We  have had an attempt by the present Government to do something in that direction, and their first step has been to frame an Ordinance to extend the terms of the pastoral leases in the Territory. I am sorry that the Bill for the building of the proposed railway was not submitted prior to the Northern Territory Crown Lands Bill, because we should then have had a better opportunity to discuss the Government's policy for developing the Territory. It is perfectly true that when  we  took over the Territory from South Australia we committed ourselves to the construction of a railway line from north to south,  or  south  to  north; but how far have we advanced  in  the matter o'f railway construction and development? We have extended the Pine Creek railway to Katherine River, and now we are asked to further extend it to Daly Waters. The railway in . the Northern Territory is now, and has been since the Commonwealth took it over,  a  losing proposition. To the 30th June, 1919, according to a report of the JointCommittee of Public Accounts, the Commonwealth had earned in revenue on that line £198,000, while working expenses absorbed £294,000. The net loss on working the line was thus £96,000, and this, added to interest on the capital cost, makes a total loss of £513,092. We are told that the extension to Daly Waters will also be a losing proposition, that there is little or no population along the proposed route, and that the approximate annual loss, including interest on capital cost, will be £79,950. The estimated revenue  is  £24,000, and the working expenses are estimated to be £26,700 per annum. This additional loss of £79,950 has  to  be added to the total loss of £513,092. Is  it  a good policy to continue building railways, knowing that there is no prospect of their paying? According  to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> these lines will never prove  a  payable proposition. Would any private company undertake such  a  project? Would any single individual, no matter how wealthy he might be, undertake  it? </para>

                            <para>- I believe in that policy. I have never been opposed to Governments undertaking railway construction, but side by side with railway construction by the Commonwealth Government in the Northern Territory, there must be an effort on the part  of  the Government to people it. The only authority capable of properly developing and peopling that Territory is the Commonwealth  Government.  The  proposition  is  too  much  for  any individual or company. The development and peopling of the Territory are matters of the greatest importance to every citizen of Australia. I am not haunted by the fear that we are likely to be invaded, that Darwin will be the first port seized, and that from that point the enemy would make his way southwards ; but I am conscious of the fact that the Territory has been neglected too long. Much has been said in regard to its possibilities and resources, and honorable senators representing the different States contend that certain routes for railways should be chosen in the best interests of Australia. I am not worrying about whether the line from the Northern Territory is taken across to Camooweal, on the Queensland border, or whether it is continued straight down to Oodnadatta, but what I am concerned about is that nothing has been done in the Territory. . Nothing should be done there in the shape of railway construction until we are satisfied that any line proposed to be built is in the best interests of not only the Territory, but the people of the Commonwealth as a whole. I hold no brief for any route, but when I hear those who are familiar with the Territory saying that this proposed railway will never be a payable proposition, and that an alternative line would never be a payable proposition, I think it is time we put on our thinking caps and asked ourselves how we can make both lines payable, if not now, at any rate in the future. It is a waste of time to discuss a proposal to merely construct a non-payable railway, which will involve the Commonwealth in a net loss of £79,000 a year, without having a sound and business-like policy to back it up. It is a mad proposal to construct railways for the sake of constructing them. Such a policy is like digging a hole to fill it up again; it does not commend itself to me. The Government ought to take in hand the task of properly developing the Northern Territory. It ought to formulate a policy for that purpose. If that is beyond it, it ought to hand back the Territory to South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister evidently has in mind the ultimate extension of the line to Oodnadatta. " Oodnadatta " to him means " success."' Some honorable senators have said that it would be better if the Government constructed the line to a standard gauge of 4 ft. 8^ in. I agree with that view. It is not a business-like proposition to make the gauge 3 ft. 6 in., even though provision is made for its subsequent conversion to 4 ft. 8£ in. If the line must ultimately be converted to 4 ft. 8 J in., why not make it 4 ft. 8½ in. now? </para>

                            <para>- That would be so unless the gauge from Darwin to the Katherine River was converted. It would be more business-like, and less costly, to convert the existing line than to construct the proposed line to a narrow, gauge and convert it later to the standard gauge. One argument advanced against this proposal is that the existing rolling-stock would be useless. If the rolling-stock has not improved since I was there, it is obsolete now, and could well be scrapped. If the Government wishes to further the interests of the Territory, it should scrap the rolling-stock and make the gauge of the line 4 ft. 8£ in. throughout Every one is agreed that the unifying of the railway gauges of Australia is of serious moment, and that they ought to have been unified years ago. We hesitate to do it. Why? Because of the cost. Has the Minister any idea what would be the cost of converting the line from Darwin to the Katherine River? </para>

                            <para>- It would be moro than that, but it would be money well spent. Later a Bill will be introduced to provide for the further extension oi the line.. If the same Minister is in charge of it, he will advance the same arguments for constructing the line to a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, while making provision for conversion to a 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge. Ultimately, the line may reach Oodnadatta, when it will probably become necessary to convert the whole line. If a business man were constructing that line, he would say, " The standard gauge will have to be adopted sooner or later, and- it is better that I should begin here and now, than wait for ten or fifteen years before commencing," I do not believe that the railway will open up much, if any, additional country. I do not believe that it will add materially to the population of the Territory. The Government needs a Northern Territory policy. Without a definite policy we may continue to build railways that will make heavy losses while conferring no substantia] benefit upon the Territory, or the people of Australia. I support the Bill in a half-hearted way, not because I can see that any great good will come from it, but because I am anxious to help, in any way I can, to further the interests of the Territory. If the Bill will help the Territory, I shall be pleased, but I have my doubts about that. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the Bill, but with the same feeling of regret and disappointment which has been expressed by my colleagues from South Australia. The best way to populate and settle the Northern Territory is to start from the South, by . building a railway . from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. That would also be the most economical. It would certainly be easier and cheaper to construct locomotives and rolling-stock in the south and to transport them and the rails to Oodnadatta than to take them to the Katherine River. I remind the Government that, in 1921, a deputation of South Australian members of the House of Representatives and the Senate waited upon the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Hughes, and obtained from him a pledge that when the Public Works Committee had reported upon the matter a railway would be constructed from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, anil simultaneously, a line from Mataranka to Daly Waters. Two members of the present </para>

                    <para class="block">Government were members of the Hughes Government.  Members  of the present Government are in the direct line of apostolic succession. They are the lineal descendants of the Hughes Government, and it is up to them to honour the promises of that Government. I do not wish to reiterate the arguments put forward, so eloquently and ably by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland.</inline> He has stated the advantage of providing for the continuation of the North-South railway. I shall vote for the measure with very great regret. There is a considerable amount of indignation in South Australia that the Government has adopted this method of constructing the line. The people of South Australia think the line should be constructed from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. I agree with them. The Bill, however, means an instalment of the North-South railway, and I shall vote for it. </para>

                        <para>. - I, like the previous speaker, being a South Australian, am somewhat disappointed with this Bill. The Government went to the expense of sending a Committee to inquire which was the best route for the railway, but it has not followed , the advice given by it. The Committee went to the Territory and examined witnesses. Evidence was given by men who had lived for many years in tha't part of Australia, and they certainly knew what they were talking about. Ordinarily, it would be taken for granted that the Committee's report would be adopted. Now, as a sop to the South Australian people, the Government proposes to send a  Minister  to inquire whether the railway should be constructed from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. Will the Minister know the difference between salt-bush and bluebush? If he does not, some one who does know should accompany him. </para>

                            <para>- The previous Government, which sent the Committee to the Territory, seemingly intended to act upon its report. In the various States many lines have been constructed, not to pass through the best country, but because of a political " pull " exerted upon Ministers. I could name quite a number of such lines in my own State. I would not go so far as to assert that they will never pay; but it will be a long time before they are profitable, and I can safely say that they should never have been constructed along the routes selected. I trust" that in connexion with the Northern Territory there will be no reason to complain of any political "pull" in railway construction, but that, on the contrary, all lines built will be along routes calculated best to serve the interests of Australia. We must have a uniform gauge throughout the Commonwealth. The necessity for this is, I th'ihk, generally admitted, and therefore the Government should have made provision in this Bill for a standard gauge line. </para>

                            <para>- The Government in this measure should have made provision for the standard gauge, 4 ft. 5½ in. In Australia we have three gauges, 5 ft. 3 in., . 4 ft. 8½ in., and 3 ft. 6 in. It has been urged that for defence there should be a uniform gauge, so that troops may be moved from one part of Australia to another without inconvenience or unnecessary delay. In view of this fact, I think it will be an absolute waste of money to construct this proposed extension to Daly Waters without making provision for the conversion of the line eventually to 4 ft. 8½ in. We have been advised that the bridges and culverts will permit of the widening of the gauge to 4 ft.8½ in., but, apparently, the sleepers are to be suitable only for the 3-f t. 6-in. gauge. This will be a great mistake. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> emphasized the point that in the event of a hostile force landing in the Northern Territory it would be an advantage if Australian troops could be sent across lines linking up with those of Queensland and New South Wales. I agree that defence should not be lost  6ight  of, bub, on the other hand, we should also keep in mind the possibility of pastoral and agricultural development. The people should follow the railway, not the railway follow the people. It is imperative that railway facilities should be . provided before we induce people to settle in that portion of the Commonwealth. When the transcontinental line to Kalgoorlie was under construction the people of South Australia were assured that immediately following the completion of that railway, the North-South line would be put in hand by the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                            <para>- I do not forget that; but I hold that the solemn compact made with the Government of South Australia should be honoured. There is ample evidence from experts' that if the line were started from the southern end, it would open up an immense area of valuable pastoral country. One. witness before the Parliamentary Standing Committee stated that there was a good pastoral country for 100 miles on each side of the route, and that the mineral potentialities within the Macdonnell Range country were practically limitless. It may be said that South Australian representatives are biased, but we are only urging that the Government should have recognised the report furnished by the Committee to which I have referred, and have made a declaration of policy with regard to construction from the southern end. </para>

                        have emphasized that there should be no suspicion of political "pull." in connexion with railway construction. I absolutely join with them in that view, and I suggest that  this matter be submitted to an absolutely unbiased committee of experts to say in which direction the line should eventually go. The honorable senators have suggested that if the railway does not go due north and south, the Commonwealth will be breaking a solemn' agreement entered into with the Government of South Australia.

                        GLASGOW.Well, the honorable senator urged that the agreement will be violated if the railway is not constructed absolutely within the boundaries of the. Northern Territory, and if it does not cross the southern boundary of the Northern Territory. On this point I suggest that the best judges of what the agreement means were those, who were parties to it. I refer, of course, to the responsible Ministers and members of the South Australian Parliament, when the Northern Territory Surrender Bill was passed by that Legislature. I have looked up the debates in the South Australian
                        <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                        and I find that not one member urged that the Commonwealth had not a perfect right to construct the line along what route it pleased, provided the railway crossed the Northern Territory boundary of South Australia proper. The then Commissioner for Crown Lands (Hon. L. O'Loughlin), who introduced the Bill, said -

Every member who took part in the debate in the South Australian Parliament on the Northern Territory Surrender Bill expressed the same view which, I remind the honorable senator, was indorsed, only the other day, by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harper</inline>
                        of Adelaide. That gentleman declared that it. would be an advantage to the Commonwealth generally if the line bore to the eastward. As a Queenslander, naturally I feel keenly interested, but I say that the proper course is to submit the question of the route for any further extension to an independent committee of experts, who should have the responsibility of deciding which direction the line should take, to serve the best interests' of the people of Australia. I feel, of course, that if this were done, the line would not go due north and south. I do not wish to delay the measure. I am in favour of the Bill. I only rose to answer the arguments advanced by the South Australian representatives in this Chamber, and to point out that the consensus of opinion in the South Australian Parliament, when the Northern Territory Surrender Bill was being discussed, was that the agreement did not bind the Commonwealth to any particular route.

                            <para>- The Committee  Collected  a mass of evidence and, after careful consideration, also recommended the construction of a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. I was a member of the Senate when the route, and later the construction of the Trans-Australian railway,  Was  fully debated, and at that time it was understood that a direct line of railway from the North to the South would be constructed as early as possible. I was also a member of the .Senate when the first section of the railway from Pine Creek southwards was under discussion, and we are now asked to support an extension of the line. ' Although I am supporting the proposal, I  feel  that we are pursuing a very foolish policy, as we are endangering ourselves, from a defence point of view, and not assisting .the development of the Commonwealth. In the event of an invasion of the Territory from the north, I. cannot imagine anything being of more value than a railway from the south over which we could transport our troops. From a defence point of view, therefore, our policy is entirely wrong, and the existing line from Oodnadatta northwards should be extended. If that were. done the products of the south could be carried to the North, and the Northern Territory brought into closer touch with civilization. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> reminded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> that war had intervened since the arrangement was entered into between the Commonwealth and South' Australia. </para>

                        <para>. -  I believe the proposed line to Daly Waters will eventually be- continued to Newcastle Waters, and link up with Camooweal and Cloncurry, which would give the Territory direct railway communication with Townsville. Queensland senators have been particularly alert in looking , after the interests of that State, and it would undoubtedly be an advantage to Townsville if the traffic from the Northern Territory went in that direction. It would be preferable, however, if efforts were made to develop Port Darwin. A majority of the Australian people favour decentralization, and instead of transporting goods over miles of railways to Adelaide, a determined attempt should be made to attract the trade of the Northern Territory towards Port Darwin. I am not opposed to the construction of the line to Daly Waters, but I strongly protest against the proposal to build a line on a 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. Irrespective of what State Governments are doing, the Commonwealth has definitely laid it down that the standard gauge shall be 4-ft. 8£-in. As the proposed line will be 160 miles in length a change of locomotives every 100 miles will be necessary, and it would be a convenience to effect such a change at the present terminus of the line. In addition to constructing bridges and culverts sufficiently wide to carry a line on the 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge, the rails should be laid to that gauge. It has been said  that if the proposed line is constructed on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, from the present terminus to Daly Waters, that gauge must be retained when the line is continued; but I do not think the majority of honorable senators are hopefully anticipating an extension for a number of years. I am quite prepared to assist in honouring the compact entered into with South Australia, and believe that a connexion should be made with Oodnadatta at the earliest possible moment. There should be no objection to the expenditure of public money on developmental railways, and a proposal for the construction of a line from Geraldton, through Wyndham to Daly Waters, would have my approval. I do not support the adverse comments made concerning the possibilities of the Northern Territory, because I believe that that country is similar to large areas in New South Wales, which were once condemned as useless. Some of 'the  land may be unsuitable for settlement, but other portions are similar to Western Queensland, which is fairly good country. We were assured by the Honorary Minister that the pro-posed line would pass mainly through Crown lands, and, although I accept his statement, I have a haunting suspicion, which may be quite unfounded, that some leases are abutting on the route. The large sum of money to be expended will not return interest for a number of years, and provision should be made for the lessees to contribute towards the cost of construction in proportion to the value of the areas they are leasing. It is my intention to move an amendment to provide that the lessees shall contribute something- it should not be too heavy - towards the cost. Railways, roads, and bridges have a direct effect on the value of adjoining land. The construction of the Sydney Harbor Bridge, which has just been commenced, involves the expenditure of a very large sum of money, and before the project was definitely decided upon the land-holders on both sides readily agreed to contribute towards the cost. The revenue derived from this source will meet the expenditure on construction for the next three years. We should insist upon this proposed section of the line being constructed on the 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge, although it is not the gauge of the Queensland railways. Later extensions <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Oodnadatta should also be laid «n that gauge, and eventually connect with the trans-Australian line. </para>

                    <para>I support the Bill, and I shall move in Committee for the insertion of amendments to provide - for a gauge of 4 ft. 8½ in.,' and. to require the lessees to contribute towards the cost of the line. </para>

In my opinion, the Commonwealth has either ; to face the heavy expenditure of railways and other improvements in the Territory, or let the country remain in its present undeveloped state, which everybody agrees is dangerous to Australia as a whole. Much discussion has taken place on matters beyond the scope of the Bill, 'and I do not intend to make more than a passing reference to them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> has expressed a doubt as to the Government's sincerity in arranging for the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> to inspect the route of the suggested line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. </para>

                            <para>- This Government has been in office for only a few months. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> knows, a permanent survey has not been made between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs, but there has been a permanent survey of 77 miles of the. section now proposed to be constructed, and a trial survey of the balance. It is therefore possible to go- on with this work, while a permanent survey-^if it is considered right that it should be undertaken - is being made of the section between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs. The Government haa proved its sincerity in regard to its obligations in the matter by presenting, at the earliest opportunity, th? present Bill, which provides for the construction of 160 miles of line in the Territory, at a cost of over ?1,500,000. I cannot imagine, that honorable senators are serious in the contention that this length of line should be built on any other gauge than that already in existence between Darwin and ' the Katherine River. It is not at all a reasonable proposition that there should be a break of gauge in 360 miles of railway. Such a break would involve two sets of rolling-stock. The matter has been carefully considered by the experts of the Commonwealth Railway Department, who state that it would cost at least ?1,000 per mile extra to provide sleepers for a line of 4-ft. 8?-in. gauge over the 160- miles required, as compared with the proposed gauge of 3-ft. 6-in. The sleepers are to be of steel, and the first cost will be very high, but if the longer sleepers were used the road-bed would have to be widened proportionately. </para>

The section dealt with by this Bill is to be built on the route originally proposed. It approximately follows the Overland telegraph line, and it connects a couple of important centres of trade in the Northern Territory.

                    <para>.- I desire to add a few brief remarks to conclude my reply to the debate on this motion. When "boiled down" the argument of the Minister was that the officer had a tribunal to which, under the regulations, he could have applied, but that he failed to do so. My answer to -that is that the evidence discloses that he did his best to bring his case before the tribunal, and it was, in fact, brought under the notice of the officer who controls the summoning of the Military Board. He failed to take any action to call the tribunal together. The proceedings show an entire lack of judicial handling of the case. An adverse report on Warrant Officer Allen was religiously rubber-stamped by all the officers up to the Minister, through whose hands it passed, and not an official concerned thought of summoning Warrant Officer Allen to ask for an explanation. </para>

                            <para>.- It is indeed gratifying to receive from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> an assurance that the position of Tasmania will be taken into favorable consideration by the Government. Tasmania to-day is not the Tasmania of twenty or thirty years ago. Owing to the enterprise and energy of its people, it now occupies a very prominent position as an industrial State. The time has arrived when special consideration should be given to the question of improving the present means of communication between Tasmania and the mainland. The motion has my hearty support. I feel sure that if the Government give the question that consideration which it deserves, and which has just been promised by the Honorary Minister, they will see the force of the contention that because of their insular position, the people of Tasmania have good reason to expect to be placed on the same footing as citizens in other portions of the Commonwealth. Recently there has been a great expansion of industries in my State. We are quite prepared to do our part towards building up the industries of the Commonwealth. I shall have an opportunity later, I hope, of bringing under the notice of the Senate a very large undertaking which it is contemplated shall be established before long to add to the already important industrial concerns of Tasmania. If Tasmania were at a standstill, from the point of view of development, one could understand a certain amount of opposition to the improvement of its shipping services. But Tasmania is progressing, and the possibilities are very great indeed. The fact that the largest concern of its kind in Australia - I refer to the hydro-electric scheme - has been established there, is proof of the enterprise of our people. We are assured that if we keep plodding away, and utilizing every avenue open to us, the developments following the establishment of those great works will . be such that eventually we shall reap the reward we deserve. In the circumstances, I think it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government, backed up by Parliament, to agree to the spirit of the resolution. I am satisfied that the Commonwealth will share in the added prosperity that will come to Tasmania as the outcome of improved shipping facilities with the mainland. </para>

                            <para>.- This is about the first opportunity I have had to join with other honorable senators in a proposal to confer a direct benefit upon Tasmania. I am glad to be able to support my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ogden).</inline> In view of the fact that Queensland is getting its meat bonus, and that Western Australia has been linked up by a railway at a cost of a million pounds, this request from Tasmania for improved shipping services is quite reasonable. I understand there is another very good reason why the motion should be passed- I believe the Tasmanian Government are losing money by their shipping ventures. It is just as well, in the circumstances, that they should approach the richer mainland States with a suggestion to cover any future losses in this direction. I merely rose to remark that the motion will enable the Commonwealth Government to show a truly Federal spirit. Some day, I hope, New South Wales will be in a position to make a special appeal to this Parliament. Heretofore her part has been to pay for about one-half the cost of everything. </para>

                                <para>- Well, the prosperity of New South Wales warrants such an attitude. Her industries are so enormous, and her enterprise so noteworthy, that she is quite satisfied to be able to pay about half the cost of meat bounties to help to keep the banana farmers going, and to subsidize sugar companies. However, one would be very narrow in outlook if one denied to Tasmania an improvement in the existing shipping facilities, and as I am in a truly Federal frame of mind, I think that in view of what we have done for the other States, we may very well- support this motion wholeheartedly. </para>

If it is pressed to a division, and carried in its present form, it will be practically a direction to the Government, and whilst the Government are prepared to recommend the Shipping Board to give this question of improved shipping facilities with Tasmania serious and friendly consideration, we may not be disposed to give a direction to the Board. I trust, therefore, that as the honorable senator has achieved his object, and the subject has been well ventilated in debate, he will withdraw the motion. </para>

I am in this difficulty, however, that if the. resolution were carried, the Government might please themselves whether or not they did anything. I am prepared for the time being to accept the assurance of the Minister that, something definite will be done to provide better shipping facilities between Tasmania and the mainland. If the Ministry fail to observe the spirit of the motion in the way that I think is justified, I shall renew the appeal in this Chamber. I believe that Ministers recognise that the majority of honorable senators are inclined to support the motion, but in view of the definite promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson'</inline> I ask leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

The Navigation Act was designed to insure better accommodation, better wages, and better working conditions generally for seamen engaged in the Australian coastal trade. We all agree, I think, that this is a very desirable object, and that the reform was long overdue. No one desires to have those provisions eliminated from the Act, but, unfortunately, we find that there exists something like an unholy alliance between the seamen, on the one hand, and the representatives of local shipping companies on the other. The local shipping companies are the most strenuous opponents of any alteration in the existing conditions. I should like to ask the members of the Labour party if they are prepared to bow to the desires of the steam-ship companies which are penalizing the people of Australia and elsewhere by charging high shipping freights? The present arrangement is all very well for the local companies, as they have practically secured a monopoly of the trade in consequence of the operations of the Navigation Act. We can quite understand, why they should strenuously fight any proposal to break down the monopoly. </para>

                            <para>- They do; but at the same time I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> that legislation, however well it may be framed in the interests of the shipping companies, or of the seamen, should not inflict hardships upon the rest of the community. No ship, unless it complies with the restrictions imposed by Part VI. ' of the. Act, may carry cargo or passengers between one Australian port and another, and I should like to ask the seamen, whether, in the exercise of the rights and privileges they enjoy they are treating fairly another section of the community. The provisions of the Navigation Act certainly inflict hardship upon the Tasmanian producers. I have always held that the men who toil on the farms and in the orchards should receive special consideration from the Labour party. The man who labours in the orchard or on the farm works a good deal harder, and probably receives a much lower remuneration, than many industrialists. I understand that the supporters of the Labour movement have as much regard for that class of worker as for those who are engaged in manual work of any kind. How does, this part of the Navigation Act affect Tasmania? Its position is different from that of any other State in the Federation . It is separated from its sister States by Bass Strait. Its producers have to place their produce in ships, which carry it to the markets of the world, and their interests are seriously affected by the difficulties experienced in disposing of their perishable products. Fruit and potatoes are the main items of export, and the fruit-growers of Tasmania were, until last year, compelled to pay a freight of 5s. per case on the fruit shipped to the markets of the Old Country. The Commonwealth Government Line last year reduced the, freight to 4s. per case, and immediately that was done the private shipping companies reduced . their freight, to 4s. 6d. The fruit producers have to dispose of their products in a very short time. We have agreed to the payment of a bounty to 'assist the meat producers in Queensland. A deputation recently waited upon the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Austin Chapman),</inline> and asked fora bounty upon dried apples; but if we could get a further reduction of one shilling per case . in freight on the whole of the fruit we export a bounty would be unnecessary. If such a reduction were made, the Tasmanian apple growers would save £114,000 a year on the crop of the State. </para>

                            <para>- The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> is referring to the export to England only, and has made no allowance for the trade with the mainland, which brings the total quantity up to that which I have stated. .Prior to the Navigation Act coming into operation the Orient and Peninsular and Oriental liners which called at Hobart for fruit, were allowed to carry Inter-State passengers on their vessels, and that to some extent, reduced their expenditure. : The overseas vessels, which now call there - they are only few in number - are not allowed to carry Inter-State passengers. If an exemption were granted to enable the overseas steamers to carry passengers between one State and another, it is quite possible that these companies could carry our fruit for 6d. per case less, which would be of great advantage to the Tasmanian apple-growers. Moreover, the Navigation Act has deprived us of a regular service which existed between Hobart and the Bluff, New Zealand, and in consequence of this Tasmania has almost lost her timber trade with New Zealand. We produce a large quantity of hardwood sleepers, for which it is difficult to get freight, and the proprietors of timber-mills and the timber-getters are affected. Honorable senators representing Western Australia will doubtless be surprised to learn that firms in the timber trade could do considerable business with Western Australia in the export of dressed hardwood flooring boards. . Remarkable as it may seem, a considerable trade with Western Australia in dressed hardwood boards could be established. </para>

                            <para>- I have already stated that no other vessel, was procurable. Dressed flooring boards can be carried on deck. The business has been lost, and in consequence of the Navigation Act, Tasmania has been unable to do business with Western Australia. If tramp steamers calling at Fremantle and Hobart were enabled to lift our timber, the difficulty would be overcome. As I have already indicated, I should not for a moment dream of removing the provisions of the Act that apply to the seamen. I know that I am between two fires, but the exemption I ask for would not affect, the seamen in the least. One of the effects of the Act is that Tasmanian timber workers are out of employment. Under my proposal there would be more wharf labourers engaged. Surely the seamen have a right to consider the interests of their fellow-workers, and not impose conditions that inflict a hardship upon them. </para>

I say, "A plague on Doth your houses!" - both on the seamen and the shipping companies - if an injury is to be done to my State and its people. There was a provision in the Bill as originally drafted exempting Western Australia from the operation of the coastal provisions until such time as that State was connected by railway with the eastern States; but as the construction of the East-West line was sanctioned prior to the Act coming into force, effect' was never given to that clause. Surely Tasmania, which can never have such a benefit as a transcontinental railway, is entitled to similar consideration. I realize that Western Australia, when that clause was inserted, had the advantage of being represented by an exceptionally strong personality in the late Lord Forrest, who probably had some influence with the Government of the day. </para>

The same number of Inter-State ships would be engaged, although they might do a little less trade and carry a slightly smaller number of passengers.

                            <para>- Five-sixths of the manufactured products that we require are imported from the mainland, and yet  Tasmania pays Customs duties to help to, support industries in the other States. Prior to Federation, my State, in Customs duties alone, collected about 50s. per head of the population, and now we receive only 25s. per head. If we were not in the Federation we should now be getting probably from £4 to £6 per head of the population from such duties. Victoria is the distributing centre for Tasmania for goods from the Old Country, and we do not receive credit for as much as we should in connexion with Customs duties. </para>

                                <para>- The reason is apparent.We have to ship our products to market, whereas the other States have not to do so. Apples can be carried as cheaply from Victoria to Queensland by rail as they can be conveyed by water from Tasmania to Queensland. We have lost the Hobart-Bluff trade. We cannot get our timber to the markets of New Zealand or Fremantle without heavy transhipping charges. </para>

                                <para>- No. But the ships that used to call at Hobart do not visit us now, and it is entirely due to the operation of the Navigation Act. They cannot carry passengers, and it probably does not pay them to call. I shall probably be told that the motion should stand over until the receipt of the report of the Select Committee inquiring into the effects of the Navigation Act. </para>

                                <para>- I quite agree with the honorable senator. It is outrageous that the Senate is not represented on the Committee. The report may not come to hand for twelve months. In the meantime, the Tasmanian fruit season is approaching, and we are anxious to have an exemption from the coastal provisions of the Act pending the report of that Committee, so that some measure of relief may be granted to the fruit-growers of Tasmania. I hope that the Committee's powers will be extended. It should be made a Royal Commission, and the Senate should be represented on it. The people of Tasmania want a declaration from the Government as to the justice of this request. We do not wish to wait until the report of the Select Committee on the Navigation Act is received. We want an immediate exemption which will afford relief to the Tasmanian fruit-growers during the coming season,, commencing about March next. The Committee is hardly likely to report before that date. It will probably take twelve or eighteen months to conclude its investigations. I trust honorable senators will give my motion serious and close consideration. </para>

                                <para>- The Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers reduced the freight to 4s. a case, and the other shipping lines thereupon reduced their charge from 5s. to 4s. 6d. a case. Notwithstanding the reduction brought about by our own steamers, the quantity of apples offering and lifted by them at Hobart was only 269,000 cases this year, and 197,000 cases last year, the percentages to the total apple export of Tasmania being 17 per cent, in one year, and 14 per cent, in the other year. </para>

                                <para>- The Manager of the Line assures me that he was willing and ready to cater for the whole of the trade. After the reduction in freights was made, the total quantity of apples shipped from Tasmania this year was 1,561,000 cases, of which only 269,000 cases were carried by our own steamers. I am exceedingly anxious that the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers should secure all this class of trade while it is catering for it, but despite the operation of the Navigation Act the figures show that other shipping lines get the greater proportion of the business. The Select Committee which has been appointed by another place to inquire into the operation of the Navigation Act is now at work. Every State is represented on that Committee, and its purpose is to make an exhaustive inquiry, and bring up a report for the guidance of Parliament. Of course, I cannot give honorable senators an assurance of what the Government will do when the report is presented, but I am sure that the Committee will take all the evidence available relative to the requirements of Tasmania, as well as those of other States. A proposal such as we have before us to delete a section of the Navigation Act is certain to open the floodgates of debate. </para>

The Commonwealth Government Line will provide plenty of steamers to lift next season's apples, and at this juncture I do not know what further assurance I could give. </para>

He was quite correct in thus stating the position, but to-day the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers has brought Tasmania closer to the eastern portion of the mainland than even the Trans-Australian Railway has brought Western Australia. We all know that transport by land is dearer than transport by sea. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden,</inline> having secured the passage of his other motion, ought to be content. There is something more in that which he has now submitted than the mere bringing of Tasmania nearer to the main-' land. I refer to the wages of the men employed on the ships. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden.</inline> has assured us that it is not his intention to come into conflict with the seamen, but I am very much afraid that an exemption of Tasmania from the operation of the Navigation Act would be a clear invasion of the spirit of that Act,. namely, that men employed in vessels trading in Australian waters shall be paid a proper rate of wages, and shall work under the very best conditions. I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> has no desire to alter that. </para>

                                <para>- We are told in the public press, and I believe it is true, that some of our Commonwealth vessels are idle. It is certain that there are ships available, and we should not lightly carry the motion, because if we do we may as well repeal the Navigation Act for all the good it will be to the seamen. If the motion is carried we shall see Peninsular and Oriental steamers, manned with black labour, trading between ' Melbourne and Hobart. Then we shall violate the vital White Australia policy for which we, as a nation, stand. I am much more concerned about the White Australia policy than about the shipping companies. An honorable senator interjected while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> was speaking, that if the concession asked for was granted to Tasmania, it would have to be granted also to other portions of the Commonwealth. The vital principle of the Navigation Act is the preservation of the White Australia policy. </para>

                                <para>- Two wrongs do not make a right. The Commonwealth has ships lying idle, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has stated that the Government Line will take all the business that any of the States can offer. The Senate has already affirmed a resolution by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> in that direction. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> presses the motion to a division, I shall vote against it, because it will impair a very vital principle. I do not want to see black labour encouraged on steamers trading on the Australian coast. The people of Western Australia are suffering from too many of these exemptions, and the State executive of the Australian Labour party has made repeated representations to this and the preceding Government in that regard. We object to the exemptions being granted, because seamen who could be employed on the exempted ships are walking the streets of Fremantle. One of my Western Australian colleagues in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> agrees that these exemptions have affected the employment of seamen in Fremantle. I hope that the Committee which is now inquiring into the operations of the Navigation Act will present a. report which will have some effect. I do not want to see the door opened any wider. It is wide enough open now. I would like to see it shut, barred and bolted, so as to insure that the Navigation Act would be carried out in its entirety, and that our own people would derive the benefit of it As we have a Commonwealth Government Shipping Line, and as the Minister has assured the Senate that the facilities which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> seeks will be provided, I oppose the motion. </para>

                            <para>.- I have listened very, attentively to the reasons assigned. why the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> should not be accepted. I was particularly interested in the statement made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> that the Commonwealth Government Line had not received the support that it could reasonably expect when it entered into competition with the private steam-ship companies to remove apples from Hobart to the Old Country. I wish to refer briefly to one phase of the injury - I use that word advisedly - which has been done to a very important industry in Tasmania by the  operation of the Act. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden's</inline> motion was accepted, and section 286 of the Act was put into operation, that injury would be removed. It has to be borne in mind that the produce which is mainly under review at the present time is perishable. .The apple -crop has to be marketed at a certain time of the year, and it is absolutely essential, in the interests -Of the orchardists, that the shipments should be so arranged as to avoid glutting the English market. Prior to the operation of the Navigation Act, the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient companies had the opportunity, during the apple season, of carrying tourist passengers from the mainland ports to Tasmania. Their vessels paid regular visits to the port of Hobart, and participated in the trade of carrying fruit overseas. No other vessels engaged in the trade carried the fruit so well. Neither of those lines took a very large quantity at a time, and that is where the practical advantage came in 'for the orchardists. The fruit arrived in London in excellent condition. I have never heard of an instance in which it suffered by neglect on the voyage. Orchardists could always rely upon getting a higher price for fruit shipped by these than by other boats, for the reason that the shipments were small, and were landed where the market was clear of the larger shipments carried by slower vessels. The Act provides that no vessel which does not comply with the Act shall be entitled - except by a special permit to -carry passengers between the ports of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator knows all about them. They relate mainly to the rates of wages paid to, and the class of accommodation provided for, the crews. The Peninsular and Oriental and Orient boats do not come within the requirements of the Navigation Act, and are, consequently, excluded from carrying tourists to Tasmania. Because of that the orchard industry in Tasmania has suffered very considerably. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has stated that the Commonwealth Government Line could have carried the whole of the Tasmanian fruit crop to the London market this year. He stated that 1,561,000 cases of fruit were exported to the Old Country, and that of that quantity the Commonwealth Government Line received only 269,000 cases. The apple export season lasts but a little over three months, and at the outside only fifteen weeks. The Commonwealth Government liners, which are suitable- for carrying fruit, and are so equipped as to insure its arriving in a condition that will command a fair price, leave Australia every three weeks. Only five vessels would he available during the apple season, and to lift the whole crop they would have to carry 312,200 cases each. Imagine what a disaster it would be to the orchard industry of Tasmania if a steamer arrived in London and placed on the market a cargo as large as that. What return would the Tasmanian orchardist receive in these circumstances? It is absolutely impossible to comply with the Minister's suggestion that five boats should be permitted to carry that enormous crop. About thirty vessels ' have called at Hobart this year to carry fruit. They have loaded what, in comparison with the figures I have- quoted, were Small -consignments. Notwithstanding the large fleet of ships engaged in this trade., orchardists last season, particularly in the beginning of it, received, instead of payment for their fruit, debits from agents for the loss sustained on it. The lot of the orchardist to-day is not enviable. I can understand  the honorable senator moving this motion. He lives in the southern portion of the State; I live in the north-west. I am as interested in this question as is any one in the southern part of the State. In the north-west, the orc harding industry is being developed. The whole of Tasmania is vitally interested in the question. There is also another point of view. The number of tourists having diminished as the result of the withdrawal of the mail boats the primary industries of the State have been affected: There are so many less mouths to feed in the State each year. The limited amount of space available in the mail boats fitted exactly the orchardists' requirements. Quite a large number of returned soldiers have gone on the land in Tasmania as orchardists. I know the calibre of these men and the difficulties they have had to face. I know what a difference of 6d. or ls. per case in the not returns means to them. Only the other day, one of these returned soldiers engaged in apple growing told me that his first three shipments to London had resulted in a dead loss. </para>

                                <para>- Yes ; from 8s. 6d. to 9s. is, I think, the amount; so that if the London market yields 10s. a case, the grower gets about1s. per case for himself, and then has to pay for his cases. I have no wish to delay consideration of the motion. The industry, I think, deserves all the consideration that can be given to it. I claim that the Navigation Act contains a provision to permit relief to be given under certain conditions. It has been suggested that, if certain portions of the Act are suspended, in the interests of Tasmania, similar requests will be received from other portions of Australia; but I know of no other part of Australia from which fruit is exported that is in the same position as Tasmania. The Peninsular and Oriental and Orient companies' vessels call regularly at other Australian ports; and, if fruit is offering, they will accept shipments from any of the ports of call. But the position in Tasmania is entirely different. The mail steam-ship companies do not care to send their vessels to Tasmania for the comparatively small quantity of fruit which they are able to take. They require an additional inducement in the form of passengers, who, prior to the operation of the Navigation Act, were in the habit of making what was known as the " apple trip." I support the motion, and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden's</inline> statement of the position, and my plea for special consideration to be given to those engaged in the fruit-growing industry, will be sympathetically received by the Government. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit the amendment in order to place before the Committee the desirability of constructing this proposed section of the Northern Territory line to the standard gauge of 4 ft. 81/2 in. I realize, of course, that it may be some time before the Commonwealth will be in a position to seriously consider the question of unifying the railway gauges in Australia. I am aware also of the immense mileage in Queensland on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and of the difficulties encountered in Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia owing to the breaks of gauge. I know how serious, from a financial point of view, is this problem of securing a uniform gauge for the Commonwealth. But it must be tackled some day, and the sooner the better. If this section of the Northern Territory railway were constructed to the  standard gauge, the existing line from Darwin to the Katherine River would have to be widened. That should hot be a matter of very great difficulty. In my opinion, we should not construct any more Commonwealth railway lines to other than the standard gauge. Even if the wider gauge for this section of the line cost an extra £1,000 per mile it would be money well spent. </para>

                        <para>- Even if it did cost more, we could have no more favorable opportunity than the present for the construction of the line according to the standard gauge. All New South Wales lines are built to that gauge. One branch line extends as far up as Bourke, and another as far as Walgett. It is about time that the representatives of New South Wales in this Chamber took a leaf out of Tasmanian or Queensland senators' books, and did something to insure a fair deal for their State. There is no reason why a branch of the Northern Territory railway should not come down from Avon Downs to either Bourke or Walgett. This is more likely to result if we insist on the Northern Territory lines being built to the 4-ft. 8½-in. gauge. But that is not my main reason for submitting the amendment. I believe that the 4-ft. 8½-in. is the best gauge. It is recognised all over the world as the standard gauge, and since it has been adopted by the Commonwealth, all new lines should be built to it. </para>

                        <para>-  I am not considering that for a moment. To construct the proposed line on the broader gauge and convert the existing 200 miles of railway, would involve an expenditure of at least £250,000, quite apart from the expense incurred in altering the rollingstock. The annual interest at 5 per cent, would be equal to £12,500, and the present and probable traffic would not be sufficient to meet such a heavy outlay. It would probably cost less to convert the existing line at some future date. Additional lines will also have to be constructed before the Territory can be properly developed, and any substantial increase in the cost of construction must inevitably hinder development. </para>

                    <para>.- I did not expect the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> to accept the amendment. We have been informed by the Minister that if the gauge of the proposed line were broadened as proposed an additional expenditure of £250,000 would be involved, and that further railways will have to bo constructed in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory will not remain in its present state, and doubtless the gauge of the proposed line will eventually be broadened. It would be infinitely better to deal with this project in a business-like way and construct the line on the standard gauge of 4 ft. 8½ in. The line, when completed to Port Augusta, will extend for, approximately, 2,000 miles. Is there any reason why this piecemeal policy should be adopted ? Is there any justification for the Govern- ' ment submitting a proposal for the construction of a line on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge when it admits that 4 ft. 8½ in. is the standard gauge. If the line were constructed on the broader gauge, the Government would set an example to the various State Governments. The Minister stated that a unified gauge for Australia has never been seriously discussed, but prominent railway officials and various State Governments have given the matter close attention. When  a  Labour Government was in power  a  few years ago, it was extremely anxious that the work of unifying our several gauges should proceed without delay, but owing to the difficulties which arose the policy then outlined could not be given effect to. I do not know of anything more wasteful, or any greater handicap to trade between the various States, than the varying gauges now in existence. The Northern Territory is now under the control of the Commonwealth, and I cannot understand the Government opposing such a reasonable proposition, even if it means the expenditure of a fairly large sum of money. </para>

                        <para>- Probably the rolling-stock would have to be scrapped, and it would not be at all disadvantageous if a new line were constructed from Darwin to Daly Waters, and new rolling-stock provided, as useful employment could then be given to very large numbers of men who are now out of work. I do not suggest that the Honorary Minister is favouring the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, so that eventually the line may be linked up with the Queensland system. He is, I hope, too big an Australian to look at it from that point of view. I am supporting the amendment, not because I am opposed to the Bill, but because the broader gauge will eventually be adopted throughout the Commonwealth. When the construction of the trans-Australian railway was under consideration some years ago, some were under the impression that the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge -should be adopted, but no one has since questioned the wisdom of adopting the broader gauge-. </para>

                    <para>. - I was in error in stating that to construct the proposed line on the 4-ft. 81/2in gauge instead of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and to convert the existing line would cost £250,000. To convert the line from Port Darwin to the Katherine River from the 3-ft. 6-in. to the 4-ft. 81/2-in. gauge would cost more than £250,000. The extra cost of constructing the proposed line to Paly Waters on the broader gauge would involve an additional expenditure of £165,000. The whole cost would probably be well over £600,000. The annual interest at 5 per cent, on this extra capital expenditure would amount to over £30,000. </para>

                    the interest on this additional expends ture had to be paid for thirty years it would amount to nearly £1,000,000. There would also be the extra cost of maintaining the wider road. In view of this I hope that the amendment will not be pressed. There may not be sound reasons for converting the line to the wider gauge for a generation or two. The Government should not be asked to incur unnecessary expense, which would make the construction of railways in the Territory very costly, and delay the provision of the necessary lines for the development of that country.

                    <para>. - I am astonished that the Government should . attempt to spend public money in building a railway on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. Twelve years ago a Government embarked upon the construction of 1,100 miles of railway to link up lines in South Australia and Western Australia, which are both of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. That work was largely brought about by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and it was constructed on what is to be the uniform gauge for Australia. In those days <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> thought 'as an Australian, and he realized that it was . necessary for the East-West line to be built on the 4-ft. 81/2-in. gauge. Surely the present proposed line, which is only 165 miles in length, should be of the same width. We are now very much nearer the attainment of a uniform gauge than we were when the East- West line was built. It is. practically a certainty that the standard gauge of. Australia will eventually be 4 ft. 81/2 in. If only for military reasons, the sooner there is uniformity the better. . Personally, I am not anticipating foreign aggression; hut that is not the question at issue. We should remember that we are legislating for all time. Then, again, since the construction of the East-West line there has been an. invention in New South Wales by which, rolling-stock can be transferred from the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge to the 4-ft. 81/2-in. gauge. A successful test has been carried out with a waggon bearing a 5-ton load of wool. Surely the Government will not now revert to the bad old system and perpetuate the present breaks of gauge. Australia is bearing a huge burden because of the many changes of gauge. . This, is not a party question; it is a matter of using ordinary intelligence. . We ought to be far-sighted enough to profit by themis- takes of our forefathers. It is now proposed to spend £1,500,000 on a new line, and the extra expense of providing for the 4-ft. 81/2-in. gauge would be comparatively small. I should like to see thorough tests made with concrete sleepers. I do not know that it would not pay to build even a concrete road, linking up the Northern Territory with the capitals of the southern States. A railway track costs thousands of pounds a mile to construct, and can be used for one class of traffic only, whereas, a concrete road, say 12ft. wide, with a suitable number of sidings, could be utilized for all classes of traffic, and particularly motor vehicles. There is not much doubt that motor traction will provide the transportation of the future. On one of the most difficult roads in New South Wales, where the heavy grades in the Blue Mountains have to be negotiated, a motor service is competing successfully with railways for a distance of 200 miles. We should certainly obtain an estimate of the cost of concrete roads. If, however, we must have a. railway, let us show as much courage and. patriotism as we did when the East-West line was. authorized, and let us adopt the same gauge. This Parliament should set. its. own house in order,, so that there may soon be a uniform gauge for Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Then I cannot understand why the Government refuse to make the same provision on this further extension of the line. The work done in this respect on the Pine Creek-Katherine River section is rendered valueless, because the Government decline to spend another £60,000, to do on the Daly Waters extension what has already been done on the portion of the railway already in use. The extra cost, is a mere nothing. My proposal is to provide for what the engineers had in mind, namely, the future conversion of the line to the 4-ft. 81/2-in. gauge. « I think it is a suicidal proposal to provide sleepers on this new section which will not permit of the conversion, to the broader gauge. </para>

                    <para>. - We are assured that the steel sleepers to be used on this section of railway will have a life of fifty years. Evidently the Government will not be in any hurry to convert this line to the 4 ft. 81/2 in. gauge. The Minister speaks of the extra, cost of cuttings and embankments if longer sleepers are used, but I do not suppose that upon this section of line there will be any cutting aver 4 ft. deep, or any embankment ever 6 in. high. I have not seen the country myself, but I am. given to understand: that it is very similar to that through which the East-West railway passes where the  conditions are just as I have described. For hundreds of miles there are few cuttings more than 4 ft. deep, and there is no embankment more than 6 in. high It seems to me that the Government do not intend to unify the railway gauge. </para>

                <para class="block">It is recognised that the construction of a railway, or the expenditure of public money on public improvements, has a direct and permanent effect in increasing the value of land in the vicinity. The latest instance of this that has come under my notice is an Act passed by the New South Wales Government, containing a section of this description, relating to theSydney Harbor bridge, which is, in fact, part of the railway. The whole of the land on one side, and part of the land on the other side, of the harbor has been made subject  to a tax of?d. per ?1 per annum. It is a pleasant duty to pay such a tax, because any one who pays it knows that other people have to pay it also. It takes away nothing that a person has earned, but something which has been given to him by the community, and is really communal property. As such, the community is entitled to it. I recognise that in the Northern Territory the value of the land is not so high as in other parts of the Commonwealth. I have not the slightest doubt that in a few years, and perhaps very much sooner, the Northern Territory will be thickly populated, will be a hive of industry, and will make rapid and permanent progress. There is not the remotest doubt in my mind that the construction of this line will substantially and permanently increase the value of all the adjacent lands. The further the line is constructed south, the greater will be the value of the land adjoining the section now under consideration. I do not propose that the Commonwealth should annex the whole of the added value. The land is not worth very much per square mile, and the tax will not be heavy. I understand that most of. the country is leased to various people at a few shillings per square mile per annum. </para>

                    <para>.  - Although it may be permissible for the amendment so be accepted in the folia of a request, I think, honorable senators will agree with me when I say that it Would be a departure from the practice of this Chamber and of Parliament to convert such a Bill as that which is under consideration into a taxation measure. Taxation Bills are necessarily complicated, and a great deal more than the few words contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> amendment would be necessary to achieve the object he has in view. It is undesirable to include a provision of this nature is a RailwayBill, because it can only apply to the section of line to be constructed under the Bill in which the principle is included. If Parliament is in favour of a betterment tax it should be incorporated in a Bill dealing exclusively with that class of taxation. This proposed line will pass through land much of which at present is unoccupied, and the remainder is held under lease. As the rental value will be re-appraised at intervals, the appraiser will take into account any increased rental value added to the leases by 'the construction of the lore. As the honorable senator's object will be achieved in that way; there is no need for this special provision. </para>

                    <para>- I amgladthat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has submitted this amendment. There was never a better opportunity for testing the principle, because this Bill deals with territory in which the States have no concern whatever. We shall be spending public money upon a railway that will enhance considerably the value of all property through which the line passes. The suggestion that this laud should be subjected to a betterment tax of½d. in the £1 is so reasonable, and the principle is so just, that I am surprised that the Minister should hesitate to accept it. It is thoroughly in accord with the principle adopted by intelligent Australians thirty years ago. No one would venture nowadays to go on a public platform and deny the soundness of the principle that values created by the expenditure of public money should not be levied upon for the purpose of the Government. As the land at present is of comparatively little value, the tax would be correspondingly light ; but as the land increased in value through the construction and operation of the line, So also would the amount of taxation derived from it increase. The principle has been well laid down by Henry George that values created by the presence of the community and the expenditure of public money are always a legitimate, source of revenue for the purposes of government. I am thoroughly in accord withSenator Grant in this matter, and if he calls for a division I shall support him. </para>
