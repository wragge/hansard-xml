                        <para>- The expropriation of properties in the Mandated Territories arises from the Treaty of Peace of Versailles, and, as such, concerns Australia&#39;s relations with other countries. Therefore, the matter is more properly under the control of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> who is also Minister for External Affairs. The question of internal administration is a separate one, as Australia derives its powers from the Mandate. That is the reason why the distinction has been made. </para>

                        <para>Yes. There is no intention to in any way disfigure the lounge cars on the trans-Australian trains, which have been so universally admired. The idea is to - by attractive views, with the minimum of advertising matter - illustrate to the overseas travellers and others by the East-West Railway, the growing importance of Australian manufacturing and producing interests, which it is thought would be more instructive to them and more advantageous to Australia than mere scenic views. The illustrations accepted, if any, will be strictly confined to representations of great Australian national industries. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are anxious to travel at express speed. They are scurrying to recess-their haven of safety. Why must this session close next week? Why are the Government so anxious to suspend Parliament when matters of the greatest importance to the people of Australia are calling for consideration? Of course we all know the reason. It has been published by the Prime Minister himself. At Maryborough, anterior to the last election, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> who was then Commonwealth Treasurer, referring to the respective parties in the field, declared that the Country party was led by the most paralyzing of leaders - men who were incapable of leading - and that if they obtained power they would lead the country to disaster. Well, the Country party have attained power. They are now associated with the Nationalist party, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> in the present Cabinet. They have equal power in that Cabinet. But the Country party are not to be intrusted with the government of the country, because, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> they would lead the country to disaster. And so the Prime Minister has decreed that, during his absence from Australia, Parliament shall be closed. So far as the Nationalist party are concerned, that is the end of it. Members of that party are mere cyphers. </para>

                            <para>- Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> is going, as it were, to enjoy himself. I anticipate that the trippers will be economical in their tastes and habits when abroad. The Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who represented the Commonwealth at the Washington Disarmament Conference, is a man of frugal habits, he cannot be regarded as parsimonious; yet he is not extravagant. He is not a spendthrift, but his expenses amounted to nearly &#163;9,000. If the gentlemen to comprise the delegation to the Imperial Conference are as economical in their expenditure as was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> their expenses will amount to &#163;75,000 or &#163;100,000. That may be a mere bagatelle to honorable senators opposite; but I trust that when they return a statement of the expenditure incurred will be published. I do not wish any members of the delegation to go as other than official representatives of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> Russell is, we are informed, to be the unofficial secretary to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce).</inline> I do not know this gentleman ; he may be one of Australia&#39;s best citizens, and one of exceptional capacity, but I do not think it is right that he should go as the unofficial secretary to the Prime Minister. I would take no exception to his going as private secretary to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> the citizen; but I have a decided objection to his going as unofficial secretary to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> the Prime Minister. We should know in what capacity he is going. Matters of the greatest and gravest importance are to be discussed at the Imperial Conference, and a gentleman who occupies the position of private secretary to the Prime Minister should, in these circumstances, be an official of the Commonwealth Government, and responsible to the Commonwealth. The questions to be discussed are of such serious consequence that any one outside the Commonwealth service should not be allowed to fill such a position. </para>

It had to be prepared and presented earlier than usual to allow the shutters of Parliament House to be put up next week. It is an interesting Budget in many ways. At the end of the next financial year the accumulated surplus will amount to &#163;7,475,726. For the financial year  just  closed the surplus was &#163;1,020,000, but it is anticipated that next year the surplus will be only &#163;47,152. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has stated that it is estimated that next year the returns from Customs and Excise duties will be in the vicinity of &#163;29,000,000, instead of &#163;32,000,000, as they were in. the year just closed. No one is more pleased than I am to know that there is likely to be a falling-off in the revenue derived from Customs duties. At present that is the main source of revenue. Too much revenue is received from Customs duties, many of which are not protective, but merely revenue duties. </para>
                    <para class="block">During the next four years our liabilities will be heavy, and loans totalling about &#163;203,000,000 will mature. With a falling . revenue, increased expenditure, the likelihood of additional taxation, and loans amounting ta &#163;203,000,000 falling due, any one who- can take an optimistic view of Australia&#39;s position for the next few years is very sanguine. Dark clouds are overhanging, almost every country in the world. In some countries the clouds are heavier than in others, and it may be some time, perhaps many years, before the sunshine of prosperity is again with us. Irrespective of what is happening in other parts of the world, there are some who consider that Australia&#39;s position is satisfactory. But Australia cannot be right if the rest of the world is economically wrong. In Australia we produce more than sufficient for our requirements. We export our surplus, and the prosperity of the Commonwealth depends fca a large extent upon favorable markets being found for our exportable surplus. Those oversea markets are more or less: closed against us, and until the doors of opportunity are opened, the millions, of people in Europe fully employed and credit restored, the, future of Australia,, notwithstanding the optimism displayed in this Chamber and elsewhere, cannot be regarded as very bright. There are. some who say that, although there is. a larger army of unemployed in Great Britain than ever before, and, although their trade is in a bad way, all that is needed is a wholesale immigration policy, and the prosperity of Britain and Australia will be assured. There are some persons- - surface-minded in my opinion; - who entertain the belief that a large population means prosperity. If a large- population was synonymous with prosperity, those countries with the biggest population would be the most prosperous and the most contented. As a matter of fact, the reverse is true. Where there- is&#39; a big population there is,, as a rule, wealth on the one hand and poverty and misery on the other. Ever since I can; remember, a. section of the people of this country, who are not associated! with the Labour party, have lipped,&#39; and lipped vigorously, the view <inline font-style="italic">that</inline> Australia needs a &#34; sound, sane, vigorous immigration policy.&#34; </para>
                    <para>We are told that unless we pursue such a policy Australia will soon be well within the danger zone. One hundred and fifty-three years ago Captain Cook discovered Australia ; one hundred and thirty-five years ago the first settlement was established in this country. Nearly seven decades have -come and gone since responsible Government was instituted; and nearly a quarter of a century has passed since- the Commonwealth was established. During that long period of time we have been at peace with the earth, seeking quarrel with no one outside our own domain. We have never been invaded. But those persons to whom I have referred say, &#34; If you do not people and develop this country here and now, we shall be invaded.&#34; Some Australians are haunted, by the fear that unless we get millions of people into Australia and prepare for defence, we shall be undone. Who will attack Australia? Who is our enemy? Against whom have we a quarrel ! For over a century and a half we have been free from invasion. During that period of time we have not been idle. We have blazed the track. We have pioneered the bush. We have developed our resources. We have established industries, and have set up a standard of living equal, if not superior, to that of any other country. Now that we have done this, there are some people -and they ought to know better - who are directly or indirectly inviting people who have nb right to come here to take possession of that which we have established. If there is anything that I hate tq hear, it is the expression of the fear that Australia is likely to .be invaded, and that we must prepare for war. I hate war. I detest it. I have no time for it. </para>

We are prepared <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> make the necessary arrangements for the defence of this country. There are some who say that the expenditure involved would impose such &#39; a great strain on the financial resources of Australia that it would eventually bring ruin to the Commonwealth. In the first place, we are assured that we shall be invaded if we do not do a certain thing, and secondly, if we do it as it should be done, the strain will be so great that we shall ruin ourselves in the effort. That is the reasoning of honorable gentlemen opposite. </para>

                            <para>- We are told, in effect, that Australia is too poor to meet the expenditure necessary for its own defence, and that it must approach the Mother Country and ask for assistance from the workers there, although 1,500,000 of them are unemployed today, and probably a similar number are only partially employed. </para>

                            <para>- What is meant by the Defence vote ? Personally I think that there is very little reason to fear an invasion of Australia, but as a member of the Labour party I am not prepared  to take any risks. Many years ago,  before  aircraft had been proved practicable, I hazarded the opinion that excursions through the sky would soon be as frequent as motor car trips through the country. I also made the statement, prior to the outbreak of the late war, that if there was another conflagration - and I hoped it would not be in my time - it would largely be decided in the air and under the water by means of aircraft and submarines. I contend that if we are to have an up-to-date Defence Force, we could very well defend ourselves by air-craft and submarines. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but the next war will probably be more deadly than any previously experienced, and there will be no question of whether or not we should have conscription. If another war does take place, lt will probably result in the annihilation of cities, and the decimation of men, women, and children by thousands. </para>

                        <para>Leaving that matter, I desire now to deal with some of the remarks made by certain honorable senators opposite. We had an interesting and informative speech from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill.</inline> I do not always agree with what he says, but I am in entire agreement with him on the subject of afforestation. Looking through the Budget speech, I notice that the present Government and their predecessors have planted a number of trees in the Federal Capital Territory, no doubt for commercial purposes as well as for beautifying the&#39; capital. The next honorable senator on the opposite side who spoke was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and he dealt with a variety of subjects. He stated that there were more unemployed in Queensland than in any other part of the Commonwealth, and he declared that this was due to the mismanagement and bad administration of the Labour Government there. That statement is absolutely incorrect. No Government could last any time if it mismanaged or misgoverned a country. There have been Labour Governments iu Queensland for twelve years.  </para>

There are a greater number of seasonal occupations in Queensland than in any other State, and a great deal depends upon the period for which those figures were compiled. Even if they be true, the statement has been made by gentlemen occupying important official positions, that because the opportunities in Queensland are greater than they are in any other State, the unemployed from every part of the Commonwealth make their way to Queensland, where they know they will get kindly and considerate treatment from the State Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> also said that the workers were being misled by paid agitators, who realized that their comfortable billets at &#163;5 and &#163;6 a week would be endangered if conditions approximating to industrial peace were allowed to prevail in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable gentleman went on to say that there would be little or no industrial unrest but for the activities of those whom he called paid agitators. I know in what sense he used the words &#34;paid agitators&#34; - it was intended to be an offensive, and not a complimentary, reference. I inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that the paid officials of trade unions and labour organizations generally are men who have the respect and confidence of their organizations. They have been appointed to fill those paid positions because, in the opinion of the majority of the members of the organizations to which they belong, they are well qualified to fill them. It is a reflection upon those men for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> to say that they would not hold their jobs if they did not create strife and be responsible for strikes. That is the inference to be drawn from the statement which that honorable senator made. These officials are always anxious that there should be industrial peace. </para>

                                <para>- I am glad that the honorable senator has made that statement. I know it to be a fact that the trade union secretaries in every State of the Commonwealth do all that they possibly can to prevent the occurrence of strikes. They are men of wide experience and mature judgment. They know the suffering and misery that are often endured when men strike to uphold a principle. Many strikes have taken place against the advice and the wishes of the secretaries of organizations. </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is a most disinterested man in regard to the woollen industry ! He is one of the few patriots that Australia possesses - and we have very few. He is anxious to see the furtherance of the industry; but not in the manner of some people, who put their money into an enterprise in the expectation of getting a substantial return! He is, according to his speeches on the woollen industry, more or less a philanthropist! He told the people that he wanted to be one of the syndicate which would purchase the Commonwealth Woollen Mill, if it were sold at a reasonable price. It was sold at a reasonable price. It was practically given away. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is one of those who are interested in this mill. He is interested in the Stawell Mills, the Mount Gambier Mills, and the Lincoln Mills. He says, in effect, that the duties on woollen goods are too high. He is not a high Tariff man. He says he favours the imposition of lower duties. He says, also, that too many goods are coming into Australia just now. According to his line of reasoning, in order to prevent their coming into Australia in such large numbers, the duties ought to be lowered. He said that those goods were coming in too cheaply ; that some of them were being imported at less than they cost to produce in the country of origin, and that they were entering into competition with Australian goods. A short time ago he Said that Australian woollen goods were sold to an importer iri Flinders-lane at 4s. 3d. per yard, and the Flinders-lane man charged 27s. a yard. He objects to the importer selling imported goods at a cheap price. Naturally, he also objects to that man selling Australian goods at too high a price. He says that there are mills to-day that are under-capitalized, and others that are over-capitalized. We know that there are mills that are neither under-capitalized nor over-capitalized - mills that are established on a sound, firm, business basis, and are signal successes. There are mills to-day the shares of which are, according to the share market reports, from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent, above par. Those mills are paying 10 per cent., 15 per cent., and 17 J per cent., by way of dividends and bonuses. Can it be said, therefore, that they are in a bad way? It cannot. </para>

                                <para>- Difficulty may be experienced in the flotation of a company in Western Australia. There will be difficulties in connexion with the flotation of, not only woollen, but many other companies, if I am a judge of coming events. To show the inconsistency and the illogical attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> let me quote a statement which was made by him later in his remarks. He said, in effect, that the woollen industry is being more or less ruined to-day because dumping is taking place, and because certain mills are in a somewhat parlous state. I repeat, for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who has just returned to the Chamber, that the mills which have been established on sound business lines and which are being managed efficiently and economically, are paying, in dividends and bonuses, from 10 per cent, to 17$ per cent., and their shares are quoted on the market at from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent.&#39; above par. </para>

Only those which apparently are not being run on proper lines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> says that we not only produce the best wool, and make the best blankets in the world, but that we send our blankets overseas, and compete successfully on the American market Where, then, is his consistency? First of all he tells us that we are going to be ruined unless a greater measure of protection is given, while in the next breath he says that it does not matter  what other people manufacture, Australia can find a market in America for its wool and blankets. / </para>

                                    There is no doubt that the Government, backed up by big financial and business organizations,- are extremely anxious to flood Australia, net with thousands, but with millions of people during the next few years, irrespective of whether land or employment is available for the new arrivals.

                                    the other day quoted certain figures to show that the workers of the Commonwealth were never better off than they are to-day. The honorable senator also suggested that this improvement in their position was due to the fact that we had a composite Government in power. I dispute that statement entirely.

                                <para>- I admit that the working man in employment is to-day in a better position than he was half a century, a quarter of a century, or even, perhaps, five or six years ago. But this is not due to the composite Government. The improvement in the conditions of the working classes have been won in spite of Governments such as we have in Australia to-day, with the exception of the Queensland State Administration. The credit must be given to the existence of efficient labour organizations - trade unions, Labour representatives in Federal, State, and municipal spheres of government - and the force behind those organizations. Where are these golden opportunities for immigrants which honorable senators opposite so glowingly describe ? In New &#39; South Wales, notwithstanding that the conditions there, in &#39; common with those -in the other States, are better than they were a few years ago, at the present time at least 30,000 trade unionists are out of employment. In round figures there are 280,000 trade unionists in New South Wales,, and of that number 11 per cent., according to published statements, are out of work. In Victoria the number of unemployed must run into thousands. </para>

When the Government came into office, we were told that they were going to get out of business, and amongst the Commonwealth activities to be disposed of was the Williamstown dockyard. According to a published statement, the dockyard was sold by this Government, composed, we are told, of business men, who claim to know how to conduct the business of the country on sound lines, for &#163;150,000 on the walk-in walk-out basis. After the yard was disposed of to the Melbourne Harbor Trust, Commonwealth officials went to the yard and claimed plates valued at &#163;50,000, which they said belonged to the Commonwealth, and of which they desired to take possession. The honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> who is in control of the Department may laugh and sneer, but it is not a laughing matter for the taxpayers of Australia. I desire to know who is responsible for the sale of the yard at that price, and if. the published statement is correct that the Government sold it to the Melbourne Harbor Trust on a walk in walk-out basis. Are the taxpayers to he asked to compensate the Trust, and </para>

                                <para>- Yes; the honorable senator included in his attack the representatives of the Nationalist and anti-Labour parties from that State. These lilliputian legislators were told in effect by this statesman that it was their duty to travel. This statesman, with ripened and matured judgment, has toured the major portion of Australia, and in doing so has visited parts of Western Australia. He has seen apparently what these lilliputian legislators have not seen, and has come to the conclusion that the people in that State are too poor to develop its resources ! The honorable senator suggested that the Commonwealth should do for Western Australia what the Government of the State is unable to do, and declared that he was willing to assist them. When the honorable senator was referring to Canberra, an honorable senator on this side remarked, &#34; Why this haste to go to Canberra?&#34; Then this statesman replied, &#34; The honorable senator is new to political life. When he has been in public life as long as I have, he will realize the serious and deadly influence exercised upon members of the Federal Parliament which now meets in this awful city of Melbourne.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> concluded by bestowing blessings upon the Government, and wishing it along life. I cannot join with him in extending my blessings to the Government, nor do I desire that it shall have a long life. I do all I can to destroy it, because it is a weak and anaemic Government. It is, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> said at Maryborough, composed of paralyzing and incapable men, who will lead the country to disaster. For these reasons, if for no other, the Government does not deserve to remain in office. The longer it remains in power, the worse it will be for the Australian people. It is evident to every one that a change will be made at the next elections. So far as those Ministers who are going abroad are concerned, I wish them personally a pleasant voyage, although I am opposed to them politically. I trust that they will return to Australia safely ; but that when they come back their days as Cabinet Ministers will be numbered. </para>

                                <para>- Churchill suggested it, but the proposed operations were not properly considered by the British Cabinet, and consequently the  necessary preparations were not made to insure its success. I have been to some trouble to look up the records of those gentlemen, who, I was informed, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare,</inline> were greater authorities than I am ever likely to be. I do not claim to be an authority on Empire defence, but I can support the opinions of some very great men in regard to the proposal for a naval base at Singapore, I have every justification in believing that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash is firmly convinced of the value to Australia of the Singapore base, and Admiral Beatty, who was more than any other man responsible for the destruction of the German naval power, has definitely expressed an opinion in favour of its establishment. Lord Jellicoe is iu favour of a Pacific Fleet, which must have a base somewhere, &#39;and Singapore appears to be the most natural spot from which such a Fleet could operate. The honorable senator referred to Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Percy</inline> Scott, who is now verging on extreme age. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; but although his views are deserving of respect, we must remember that he did not actively participate in the Great War. The views of Admirals, such as Beatty and Jellicoe, who have, had recent experience should carry greater weight. The principal authority quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> was Lieutenant-Colonel Charles A&#39;Court Repington. It is astonishing to find a man of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare&#39;s</inline> views quoting such an authority. This man is one of tile idle rich, who was nurtured at Eton, Cambridge, and Sandhurst. The honorable senator has nothing in common with him, but in order to discredit the Government, affects to hold him up before the public of Australia as the highest authority to which an appeal can bc made. I remind my honorable friend that this gentleman was tried during the war, and&#39; punished, for disclosing military information to the injury of his country. He obtained that information, as far as we can discover, by underhand means, through some person at the General Staff Office in Great Britain. He disclosed it for his own aggrandizement \nd glory, by publishing it in the <inline font-style="italic">Morning Post,</inline> of which newspaper he was a special correspondent. </para>

                        <para>To this conclusion, so damaging to Robertson, converge the many forms of proof supplied, quite involuntarily, by Repington; it is Repington&#39; s destiny to give evidence, in the intoxication . of his vanity, against the very party in whose favour he comes&#39; forward to testify. If this supposition, that Robertson was the informant, seems shocking, it is no more shocking than the fact that Robertson approved of Repington &#39;s disclosures, both by his words and his acts. The difference in culpability between applauding and instigating such conduct is faint and shadow}&#39;, if it exists at all. The same censure applies to Maurice, who is so hardened to these practice&#39;s, that even now he writes as if unconscious that disclosure of one&#39;s country&#39;s military plans to the enemy in time of war is wrongful, however obtained and whatever the object. &#34;Wo find that, while we were fighting for our lives,  Colonel Repington  occupied himself with trivialities. The principal subject of discussion at a dinner party which he attended, he tells us, was whether a cow&#39;s horns grew over or under its ears. Those present differed in their views except the Minister for Agriculture, who refused to commit himself. That is very entertaining, but a man who wrote it when his every thought should have been immersed in his country&#39;s difficulties, should not be quoted in this Chamber as an authority. </para>

That was before he devoted himself entirely to journalism. I have read carefully through the diaries in which he detailed his daily life during the five years of the war, and the most striking feature of them is that he bitterly opposed the combination of the British and French commands under General Foch. He prophesied disastrous results if British troops were subjected to the command of a foreigner. All his forecasts proved wholly false. That is the man who- is quoted in this Chamber, and in another place, as an authority regarding the strategy of  establishing  a naval base at Singapore, I leave him at that. </para>

                        <para>There is another aspect of military defence to which I wish to direct attention, and. that is the intention of the Government to abolish the duties on sulphur. We may have submarines, aeroplanes, guns, and men, but unless we have explosives, we can achieve nothing. The foundation of all explosive manufacture is a simple chemical substance known as sulphuric acid. It can be obtained direct from sulphur, or from the pyrites produced from the mines of Tasmania. Sulphur was practically unobtainable in Australia during the war, and in order that we might not be placed in that position again, the Government urged certain companies to start manufactories, which would produce, at least, sulphuric acid. The Government promised them, -if not by written agreement, at least in effect, that they would be adequately protected. That protection, at the behest of the farming community, is being swept away. I understand the difficulty the country people have, and their desire to obtain manure cheaply. I agree that they should be supplied with cheap manure. It is said that the removal of the duty will be compensated for by a bonus, but compensation by a bonus is not a very good way of protecting industries. If an industry has an opportunity of securing the whole market, it can develop in a way which is impossible if it is subjected to competition from outside ,the country. It is said that the duty on sulphur adds 5s. a ton to the cost of superphosphate. Suppose the Government paid that 5s. a ton as a bonus to the Commissioners in Nauru, on the understanding that the price of superphosphates would be reduced by that amount. At the present time they supply phosphates at cost price, and successive reductions have been made with the idea of providing the farmer with manure at the cheapest possible price. Let us go further than that and, while retaining the duty on sulphur, make up the loss to the farmer by paying a bonus or subsidy to the Commissioners to enable them to supply phosphatic rock below cost price.. In that way, while keeping the home market open for the superphosphate manufacturers, the farmer would not suffer, and would have no ground for complaint,; That would be. .a reasonable way of meeting the situation. In this connexion, I would remind honorable members that during the Tariff debate I opposed the reduction of the duties on imported explosives, which are made chiefly in black-labour factories in Africa, but the influence of those interested in mining waa strong enough to get the duty abolished. In that direction, also, we are rendered destitute of any source of supply for munitions. I think the removal of that duty was a grave mistake, which ought to be rectified as soon as possible. The Government is endeavouring to put the matter right by establishing its own munition factories. It is no use, however, attempting to build up a huge store of ready-made munitions, which deteriorate and become dangerous if kept too long. The object should be <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> establish factories which can support themselves on the ordinary commerce of the country. If war broke out they could be commandeered for military service, as hundreds of them were in England during the last war. </para>

                            has urged that we should depend upon submarines and aeroplanes for our defence. But I venture to point out that aeroplanes have very little effect against troops in trenches. They are very annoying, but they accomplish little. Undoubtedly, against towns and objectives of that kind, they are paralyzing, and their power in that regard will tend to become greater as they become more efficient. Against ships they may or may not prove dangerous; but this has not yet been absolutely demonstrated.

The projectile that causes the most damage to men in trenches in the high velocity shell, which penetrates the earth, and blows them to pieces. Dropped from a greater or less height, explosives may have a wider destructive effect laterally, but they have no power of penetrating downwards into dug-outs or shelters of that nature. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. With the development of the control of electricity, it may become possible, without really engaging an aeroplane, to cause from the ground the combustion of the explosives that it carries, so that we ought not to pin our faith to one method of warfare. I remind honorable senators opposite that the submarine, towards the end of the late war, was steadily becoming less effective. We had invented all manner of means of dealing most drastically with it. There was a wonderful instrument by which the approach of a submarine could be heard while it was yet miles away. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> tells of his experience in listening to submarines in that way. With the advancement of science it may soon be just as easy to trace a submarine under the sea as a ship on the surface, and to deal with it effectively by means of depth charges, which practically reduced the German undersea craft to impotency towards the end of the last war. I think, therefore, that it would be a false policy to rely wholly and solely on submarines and aircraft for our defence. Honorable senators remember the destruction that was caused by the single raider, <inline font-style="italic">Emden,</inline> the light cruiser that dashed about in the Indian Ocean, destroying oar commerce right and left. Although Japan has, under the Washington Treaty, ceased its construction of major battleships, it is building many light cruisers. Do we wish the seas to be swept clear of our commerce? </para>

                                <para>- While I am a strong Protectionist, I rather think that would be too strong a measure to adopt; it would amount to prohibition. Our ships would be captured, and we should be unable either to import or export goods. It is necessary to have other means of defence than submarines and aeroplanes, because these cannot operate at any great distance from their base. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> stated that honorable senators on this side were inconsistent. He said that in one breath we urged that Australia was too poor to maintain a fleet, and that in the next he said that we must for our safety maintain a huge fleet. That is not a fair representation of the situation. We say - and I think quite properly - that if we endeavour to engage alone in the mad competition with Japan we must fail hopelessly, but we contend that in partnership with the various parts of the Empire it is quite possible, without crippling &#39; either ourselves or Great Britain, to maintain a fleet adequate for our protection. </para>

                        <para>Whilst Still on the subject of defence, I wish to complete a phase of the matter with which I was dealing on another motion, a few days ago, when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> ruled me out of order. I was endeavouring to impress upon the Senate that, if we were to cooperate heartily with Great Britain, our Army and our Fleet should be independent of those of the Motherland, because British officers and our men do not understand one another, and there are many grave defects in the British system. In order to connect my remarks, I shall be forced to repeat a portion of my speech on that occasion. I was reading an extract from a book by Captain Peter E. Wright, secretary of the Supreme War Council, who urges the necessity of keeping the Imperial staffs under strict Parliamentary control. Great Britain attempts to &#39;do this in a very peculiar manner. It does not pass a Defence Act once and for all as Australia has, but every year it re-enacts the Army Act. The British staffs, therefore, have to be very careful of their steps, to avoid giving offence to Parliament or the Ministry, because, if they did so, all Parliament would need to do would be to refrain from re-enacting the measure, and then their pay would stop automatically. </para>

When the Parliament found that it could not trust the King, who was the paymaster of the Army, it feared a repetition of the experience under Cromwell, and that the Army itself might became so strong as to destroy the liberty of Parliament. Captain Wright points out that in modern times the armies and their commanders tend to become so powerful that there might be a re-birth, as it were, of that danger. This is how he puts it - </para>

The armies and their leaders have run away with the Government, and thus we have the present dreadful difficulty in the Ruhr. There are fears that the army will use its power there to set up an Imperial form of government, or a monarchy. Captain Wright continues - </para>

                            <para>Through their huge patronage they lay hands on the Legislature and the press. But above all, public opinion is theirs to shape it as they please; for that great two-handed engine of deception, the censorship which conceals the truth, and propaganda which creates the false, is in their hands. This machine, created originally for one purpose, to deceive the enemy, had come, perhaps unavoidably, to be used for deceiving everybody, soldiers and civilians. Keeping up the morale, in the jargon of the war, is the purpose of this second deception, as if men who give their lives with such generosity, without hesitation, needed lies as a further inducement to do so. It is an easy and efficient engine to work, for people are left far more uninstructed, and are far more misled by newspapers, in our enlightened period than ever they were by rumour in the past, before the spread of education had made it possible to induce people to believe anything by printing it. Germans were sure half London was burnt and in ashes; and we have never heard of German victories, like  Pilkallen,  when they took as many as 100,000 Russian prisoners. </para>
                            <para>But falsehood, however indispensable (and perhaps in this case it is unavoidable), exacts its price; and here it recoils in an unexpected direction. Generals can have great reputations which are entirely artificial. They do not have to win victories or .campaigns; the subject press bureau and the tame herd of special correspondents or special press agents do it for them. </para>
                            <para>It is in the High Command, and not in the line, that the art of camouflage is most practised, and reaches to highest flights. All chiefs everywhere are now kept painted, by the busy work of numberless publicists, so as to be mistaken for Napoleons - at a distance. Canny Scots soon &#39; discover that having the brother of the editor of the leading newspaper of the majority party of the Legislature as a chaplain-general is a greater piece of luck than breaking the German line, and a long visit from an influential newspaper proprietor preferable to a good plan of operations. Criticism and doubt  become  scandalous or illegal outside the armies, and (quite rightly) indiscipline and insubordination within them. It ceases to be necessary for generals to win even wars; they will be almost as victorious if they lose them. This is not fanciful, for almost the whole German people believe Hindenburg unvanquished and invincible; they believe he never was defeated, but broke off the fight and submitted because Germany&#39;s allies deserted her. In spite of the Armistice, he is just as much a conqueror to-day as when his authority extended from Dunkirk to Kief; and before we deride them as dupes, it is as well to remember that a great many sensible people here are sure that the retreat of the Fifth </para>
                            <para class="block">Army in March, 1918, was an ingenious manoeuvre, and most people consider that what the Germans call the Bloodbath (das Blutbad) of the Somme was an Allied triumph, though, being almost twice as strong as the Germans, they could Only gain a few miles of ground at a stupendous cost. Joffre, whose mistakes in the first weeks Of the war nearly lost it, remains seated in the hearts of the French as a national hero, however much Commissions of Inquiry may expose him. No doubt if Haig bad been driven into the sea in April, 1918, as  seemed  likely, he would have remained just as immortally glorious and some one else would have been to blame. A&#39; new doctrine has come to prevail that commanders-in-chief can do no wrong and are not responsible. </para>
                            <para>Statesmen, of course, know the truth. Any one in the&#39; room at the Supreme War Council who knew these heroes remote from their godlike state, bright pomp of swarming obsequious staff officers, millionaire A.D.C.&#39;s, and attendant major-generals, motors and mounted orderlies, secretaries and cooks, with the fountains of official eulogy playing on them in ceaseless glittering streams, could measure their real stature, in all its naked and tragic mediocrity; naked, because the working of their confused, slow and narrow minds revealed itself without chance of concealment in those keen debates with masterly &#39; heads like Sonnino or Foch; and tragic, because these  incapables  and intriguers, thus decorated and exalted, disposed haphazard of all those brilliant young generations that were being mowed in swathes by the German scythe. </para>
                            <para>It becomes almost impossible to displace these Napoleons, whatever their incompetence, because of the enormous - public support created by hiding or glossing failure, and  exaggerating  or inventing success. </para>
                            <para>This is probably true of every belligerent.  Salandra,  for example, the Italian Prime Minister, was overthrown in 1916&#39; for daring to doubt  Cadorna,  though Cadorna had never done anything but fail. Salandra the politician ventured to think Cadorna the soldier was not invincible, on no other ground except that Cadorna was always beaten. So Cadorna continued muddling away thousands of lives in his blundering offensives, and his bubble reputation continued to grow bigger and brighter till Caporetto burst it; even then his sycophants in the press clamoured that the defeat and the loss of half-a-million men was not due to Cadorna, but to something else. </para>
                            <para>But the most insidious and worst effect of this so highly organized falsity is on the generals themselves; modest and patriotic as they mostly are, and as_ most men must be to take up and follow &#39;the noble profession of arms, they themselves are ultimately affected by these universal illusions, and, reading it every morning in the paper, they also grow persuaded they are thunderbolts of war and infallible, however much they fail, and that their maintenance in command is an end so sacred that it justifies the use of any moans. These various conditions, of which this great deceit is the greatest, at last emancipates all General Staffs from all control. They&#39; no longer live for the nation; the nation lives, or rather dies, for them. Victory* or defeat ceases to be the prime interest. What matters to these semi-sovereign corporations is whether dear old Willie or poor old Harry is going to be at their head, or the  Chantilly  party prevail over the Boulevard des  Invalides  party. So much is this the case that two branches of a staff can get more hostile to each other than to the enemy, and, for example, at the Grand  Quartier-General,  Intelligence and Operations spent their time thwarting each other. The Central Powers (as can be seen very clearly from Count Czernin&#39;s Memoirs) suffered from these conditions even more than the Allies; the German General Staff treated Emperors and Chancellors as if they were valets, claimed to control everything, even the birth-rate, and ruined their country by overriding BethmannHollweg in the winter of 1916-1917. &#34;The misfortunes of Germany and Austria,&#34; says Czernin, a temperate judge, well placed to see things as a whole, &#34; arose from the acts which the military party imposed upon the Government.&#34;  Bernstorff,  the able German Ambassador in the United States of America, also attributes failure of Germany to its soldiers, who ought to have been kept &#34; more thoroughly within bounds, just as they were by Bismarck.&#34; </para>

                        <para class="block">While I advocate that Australian Forces should be controlled according to the provisions of the legislation passed by this Parliament, I advocate also a strict control by Parliament of the Army in all its. branches. It is to enable honorable senators to understand the dangers of an uncontrolled military power that I have ventured to read these long extracts. I refer the Senate for further information to the works from which I have quoted. I desire merely to refer to one phase of the question by means of an illustration. A number of our staff officers were sent for training during the war to staff schools in England. &#39;One of those officers brought back to me a staff brochure, which was handed by one of the Generals on the staff to the officers of the school to read and to study. It contained a striking story urging the necessity for the staff to cling together in opposition to outsiders. It is a most remarkable story, and demonstrates how difficult it may be to discover the cause of a disaster. The officer in the story said, &#34; At a certain battle I had under me a young staff officer who had committed a blunder whereby the lives of 300 men were lost. What was my action in regard to that officer? What should your action be in like circumstances? Did I dismiss him ? Not on your life. If I had dismissed him it would not have brought to life those 300 men who had been killed. By concealing his blunder, and keeping him on my staff, I made him my devoted servant for life - a man who wo aid readily lie for me. If any trouble should arise in future with any politician, or with any Government, I can count on his influence and that of his family to keep me in my post.&#34; He said that that was the proper attitude to adopt when any subordinate got into trouble. </para>
                        <para>Thatthis attitude is pleasing to our own general staff is illustrated by what happened, when a young staff officer under me made a great blunder, which, had I not detected it in time, would have involved my whole brigade in disaster. I requested his dismissal. That dismissal was carried out, it is true; but I found it seriously recorded against me as one reason why I should not receive promotion - that I could not agree with my staff. </para>
                        <para>I turn from Defence to the question of preferential trade. Despite the opposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I believe that preferential trade would be a good thing for the Empire. I believe also that, although we raise certain barriers against Great Britain, the additional barriers which we raise against outside countries are exceedingly valuable to, and are greatly valued by, England, and that the people of England would be very loth to see us wipe out those barriers. However, our own industries come first. I know that there is grave apprehension amongst members of the timber trade that, in our endeavour to secure preference in Canada for our fruits, our valuable timber industry - particularly in Tasmania - will be jettisoned. I hope that the Government will exercise a very wise discretion, and will deal very cautiously with this matter. </para>
                        <para>Honorable senators opposite adopt a hesitating attitude towards immigration. The way in which I look at the matter, in my purblind fashion, is that if we had in Melbourne and Sydney cities as big as London there would be a demand for more than Australia could produce. All our surplus products at present are taken across the seas to England and other countries. </para>

                                <para>- No matter what steps are taken, there will always be unemployed. That position is due to various causes. The very humanitarianism of which honorable senators are so proud, tends to bring about unemployment. We nurture and rear persons who obviously are unfit from birth to battle in life&#39;s struggle. If we could steel our hearts to take the necessary action, it would be better for those persons and for the nation if they were out of the world. Such action, of course, is opposed to our religion and our sentiments. Weak and sickly children, consumptives, and the like, are kept alive as long as possible, although they will never be able to support themselves. </para>

If work were provided this year for every person in Australia, the increase in the number of people would double the quantity of labour available. So, in accordance with the doctrine of Malthus, the increase of population presses on to the verge of subsistence, and until people exercise restraint and self control in that direction, it appears to me that there will never be improvement. </para>

                            was inclined to gibe at the Government for its introduction of a cheaper rate of postage. He said that the merchants of Flinders-lane would benefit to the greatest extent. Those merchants are the honorable senator&#39;s pet aversion. I remind honorable senators that if additional burdens are placed upon industry they re-act on the working classes in unexpected directions. If by a decrease in the rate of postage the cost of living is decreased, even in a small degree, by traders being enabled to reduce their prices - and undoubtedly they will do so, because they are not blind to their own interests, but realize that bigger trade follows a lowering of prices - that will benefit the general community. When an impost is put on an article, the man who produces it and sells it adds that impost to the cost, and on that bases his percentage of interest and profit. He must do that in order to exist. So the price is increased to the consumer, not to the extent of the impost only, but by that  amount, plus the profit of the -person on whom it has been placed. Reversing the process, by cutting down the impost, you bring about a reduction, not only to that extent; but to the additional extent represented by the profit of the trader on that sum.

I should not have referred to this matter, but I have been given the &#34; tip &#34; that owing to the early closing down of the Parliament the motion will be stillborn. I protest against the other place allocating to itself the rights attaching to Parliament as a whole. The Senate must not be ignored, nor must the privileges of honorable senators be whittled away. I hope that other honorable senators will express their views on this matter. </para>

                                <para>- I have looked at , the report of the Public Works Committee. I find that a number of resolutions were moved in that Committee, all tending to show that the Committee was almost unanimously in favour of proceeding with the erection of the nucleus of the permanent House of Parliament, instead of indulging in useless expenditure by building a provisional House of Parliament. We should nob incur expenditure in the erection of temporary Houses of Parliament, which, after a few years, must be scrapped. </para>

                                <para>- My view is that we should start on the permanent Parliament House buildings, and carry, on as if we intended to finish them. This brings me to the question of costs. According to the estimate furnished to the Public Works Committee, the temporary1 structure will cost about &#163;200,000, but from information which has come to my possession I am inclined to believe that the estimate will be very largely exceeded. I understand that at Canberra a four roomed cottage for a workman, and with rooms on the small side, costs &#163;1,500. </para>

I have visited many of these settlements. No doubt, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has also, and he must be aware that some of the men in one season have cleared the price of their holdings. At Warracknabeal recently, one settler assured me that he obtained his land for &#163;6 an acre, and would not sell it for &#163;12 today. He could secure that price in the open market. Surely this is something for which the State may claim credit. I know that on a number of settlements the soldiers are delighted at having had the opportunity of their lives under the Repatriation Act. </para>

The land at Warracknabeal cost the soldier settlers &#163;6 per acre, and to-day it is valued at &#163;12 per acre. Further up in the Mallee, where there are no water channels, scrub land quite as good as that at Warracknabeal has been made available to soldier settlers at 10s. per acre, and they are quite satisfied. With water channels made available, it will ultimately approximate in value the Warracknabeal land. </para>

                        <para>I shall close my remarks by passing reference to the question of health. There has been much criticism at times of what has been described as the Commonwealth interference in health matters which hitherto have been considered peculiarly a State concern. Very good work has, however, been done up to the present. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, which are a branch of the Commonwealth Department of Health, were established in 1918 in response to representations made from various influential sources to the effect that it was of the greatest importance that Australia should be self-contained in respect of remedies of bacterial or biological nature for human use. I understand that members of the medical profession made strong representations to the Government on this subject, and that the Commonwealth Serum. Laboratories were established in response to their request. Commencing in a small way the laboratories have, in response to external demand, increased rapidly, until now they supply a large proportion of the total requirements in this direction &#34; in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and New Guinea, and also find a small market in both Asia and Africa. So successful have they proved, that well-known manufacturing firms in England and America are beginning to get anxious, and to clamour for their suppression. This is too grave a matter to permit of interference by private commercial interests to the detriment of the public weal. </para>

                                <para>- I did not inquire as to the profits. I shall be content if they prove an effective safeguard of the public health. The laboratories produce the whole range of sera and vaccine, and extracts of body glands which are used in human medicine, and are now producing the preparation on a commercial&#34; scale of similar products used . in veterinary medicine. The quality of the remedies produced is equal to that obtained in any laboratories of the kind in the world, and has been commended warmly by a wide circle of doctors throughout the Commonwealth and  abroad. I believe that in the working of the laboratories no loss is involved. They were established not for the purpose of returning a profit, but solely for the benefit of the people of Australia. Such an institution is of the utmost national importance, forming, as it does, an. assurance against any epidemic which may occur, and against the possibility of Australia being isolated by war from other sources of supply. It is most important that we should not be left, as in 1914 we were threatened to be left, without a supply of these valuable sera. The satisfactory result recorded has been achieved by a staff composed entirely of public servants, the importation of &#34;business experts&#34; not having been found to be necessary. The importance, as an instrument for the protection of the public health, of this establishment, and of the branch laboratories which are being established in the important country centres throughout Australia, has been proved in a number of ways during the last three years. An important campaign against diphtheria has been completed at Bendigo, with the result of markedly reducing the extent of diphtheria in that city. An investigation is now proceeding into the epidemic occurrence of typhoid fever, and a programme of scientific research has been outlined for the forthcoming year which will prove of the greatest value in connexion with the work of the other branches of the Department in preventing disease throughout the Commonwealth. At the laboratories it has been possible, by careful foresight, to build up a reserve of products amounting to approximately eighteen months&#39; supply, so that any emergency is well provided for. With regard to this particular group of medicinal remedies, any variation of quality is of the utmost importance in the treatment of the sick, and a patient&#39;s life may dep.end on the remedy being of the quality and potency stated on the label. Moreover, as these remedies are of so great importance in the prevention and treatment of disease, they should be as little the subject of commercial profit as possible, and should be closely under national control. It is considered important, therefore, that the preparation and sale of these products should not be left to private enterprise, but should be closely under governmental control, should be of guaranteed purity, and should not be the subject of financial profit by any private individuals. </para>

                            <para>. -  I realize that at this stage of the debate it is scarcely possible for an honorable senator to say anything that might be regarded as original in connexion with it, but I desire to make a few remarks concerning the manner in which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has placed his Estimates before the Parliament. I have never before known a Treasurer to take credit for remission of taxation made in a previous year. Yet in this Budget, the Treasurer has helped himself very lavishly to the good work done by his predecessor. And strange to say, I have never known the press to be so generous as they are to the present Treasurer in claiming for him credit for having effected reductions in taxation, with which, as a matter of fact, he has had nothing whatever to do. I am not going into details, but I feel that I should fail in my duty if I did not call attention to this matter, and say that the credit for a reduction of taxation by nearly &#163;3,500,000 very largely belongs to the ex-Treasurer. Not satisfied with claiming credit for this remission of taxation, the Treasurer has gone on to speak of other prospective reductions. He has taken credit to himself for a remission of duties on wire netting, traction engines and other agricultural requisites which was agreed to last year. He also claims credit for the proposed reduction in the letter postage rate. I hope that Parliament will have the right to say whether or not this reduction shall be approved. I agree in the main with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said the other day. This reduction in the postage rate will not prove a substantial benefit to a large section of the community. Many people in the rural  districts are content to write, on the average, one or two letters a week, whereas some big business firms probably post thousands, and perhaps hundreds of thousands, of letters every year. This concession, therefore, will benefit them rather than the general community. Under the&#39; altered financial arrangements, the Post and Telegraph Department will have to provide interest on large sums of borrowed money, and as the postal and telephonic facilities in the country need considerable extension, all the revenue at present available will be required. It would, therefore, appear that in their endeavour to remit taxation, the Government should have sought some other means than that of reducing the postal rate on letters. Personally I am against the proposal. </para>

                                <para>- Certain metropolitan newspapers appear to be so favorably disposed towards the present Treasurer that they have seriously taken to task certain honorable senators and members of another place, who have dared to criticise the Budget. It is deplorable if representatives qf the people cannot criticise the actions of the Government in a fair and legitimate way without being condemned by the press. If we remain silent we are condemned, and if we question the proposals of the Government we are also wrong. Personally, I am quite indifferent as to whether or not the representatives of the press take any notice of what I say; I shall not be deprived of my right to express my opinions. It would be unfortunate, indeed, if the rights of the representatives of the people in the national Parliament, irrespective of the parties to which they belong, were, in any way, interfered with. </para>

                        <para>It is proposed to remit duty on sulphur to the extent of &#163;80,000. During the war period considerable inducement? were held out &#39;to certain companies to establish or extend sulphur-producing plants in Australia, and approximately &#163;2,000,000 was expended at Broken Hill, Port Pirie, Wallaroo, and in Tas mania, on the distinct promise of the Government that a protective duty on sulphur would be imposed. The&#39; word of the Government was accepted and, under great difficulties, plants were erected or improved; but now, just when the works are nearing completion, and those requiring this product will be able to derive a considerable amount of benefit from their establishment, it is proposed to break faith with the manufacturers. I am rather in favour of the payment of bounties, on a sliding scale, to encourage industries so that, at the end of a specified period, assistance would be unnecessary. Bonuses were not mentioned when the establishment or extension of these industries was commenced, and it is difficult  to  understand why the Government &#39;have broken their promise in this respect. If the present policy continues in operation, companies which undertake to erect expensive works will not accept the word of a Government. Prominent men, engaged in important industries, have informed me that they are afraid to accept the word of the Government, because before the works are completed the promised protection may be withdrawn. They are not . willing to undertake work . under these conditions and the Government should give a definite guarantee to those investing large sums in this and other industries, that the duties imposed will remain in force. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> said that, if the duty was removed, the users of sulphur would derive benefit equal to 5s. per ton on superphosphate, but I do not think the sulphuric acid contents of that commodity would represent such a difference in price. </para>

                                <para>- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> in his Budget speech, indicated that the Government intended to provide for a remission of duty amounting to &#163;80,000, and a payment of &#163;70,000 in the form of bonuses. The Government appear to waver as soon as pressure is brought to bear upon them, and, instead of defending their . actions, quiver before every wind that blows. </para>

                        <para>Two years ago it was proposed to spend over a period of three years &#163;9,000,000 in extending postal facilities, but I am somewhat at a loss to understand exactly what has been done. In the cities, new post-offices have been erected, and telephonic installations carried out; but I believe the Government are a long way behind in their programme. We were told that wireless installations would be undertaken, to enable the man out back to he brought into closer contact with civilization, and that the necessary instruments would be provided, but apparently nothing has been done. The people living in the more remote parts of the Commonwealth are not receiving the benefits to which they are entitled. I trust that the question of additional facilities for rural settlers will be given closer attention, even at the expense of those residing in the city and the metropolitan areas, who, although they experience inconvenience, are in a much better position than are those in the outback districts. </para>
                        <para>I am sure we are all delighted to learn that the Government, intend to increase the invalid and old-age pensions. Although the additional amount to be granted is not as large as many desire, it will at least afford some relief. In the Bill that is to be submitted I trust that provision will be made for removing anomalies which now exist. The Treasurer said that &#34; invalid and old-age pensions were a very heavy burden upon the taxpayers.&#34; That was a very unfortunate expression to use. I refuse to believe that the taxpayers look upon such pensions as a burden. I am in favour of the imposition of a tax for this specific purpose. If that were done a taxpayer would know that he was paying so much a year for invalid and old-age pensions. I am sure that the taxpayers of Australia, however much they may grumble at general taxation for Government purposes, would not complain if they had to pay directly for invalid and old-age pensions. I should like the Government to consider that proposal. There are certain anomalies in connexion with the payment of invalid and old-age pensions which I should like to see removed when the proposed Bill is brought down. There is far too much &#34; red-tape &#34; connected with applications for an old-age pension. While I have been a member of this Senate I have had to deal with a number of such applications. A form has to be filled in, with the statement of particulars in proper order. After the applicant has sent in the form, the next thing that happens is that a policeman calls at his residence, and subjects him to a cross-examination. He has already sworn that the statements in the application are true. After that he has to go to the Pensions Office, where he is again put under a very strict cross-examination, usually by a magistrate. These magistrates are often not very sympathetic. Many of our old-age and invalid pensioners have previously occupied good positions, and they feel very keenly the indignity of the cross-examination. They should be treated more sympathetically. I do not think that would open the door any wider to fraud, but it would make it very much easier for old people to secure a pension. In South Australia we have the Minda Home for Weakminded Children, and I suppose there are similar institutions in other States. This institution takes in weak-minded children practically from their birth, and some of its inmates are over sixty years of age, and have been there for many years. No pension is allowed to the institution for the maintenance of an inmate until that inmate has reached sixteen years of age, and unless the inmate applies for a pension before entering the institution, one is not afterwards granted. If he goes out of the institution in order to secure a pension, the Department makes elaborate investigations to prevent the pension being paid when he goes back. I hope it will be made possible for inmates of this and similar institution&#39;s to get a pension. The State Government subsidizes that institution, and the public of South Australia con tribute liberally to its support. I have further details which I shall place be fore the Senate when the Bill is under consideration. </para>
                        <para>There is at the present time a .great shortage of timber in South Australia because the ships which usually trade between Bunbury and South Australian ports have ceased running. The coal strike in New South Wales has stopped the colliers which &#39; ordinarily go to Western Australia. Ships are now bun.kering with Collie coal, to the benefit of Western Australia. It is an ill wind that blows nobody good, but while those engaged in the coal industry of Western Australia are benefiting, South Australian builders and others are suffering because they cannot obtain timber. Large quantities of hardwood are required in South Australia. A deputation last week asked the South Australian members of Parliament to do what they could to induce the Government to supply a few cargoes of timber from Western Australia. The Western Australian mills are almost blocked up with timber ready for removal, while building operations in South Australia are hampered for the want of it. </para>

The Commonwealth Railways Department proposes to make them look like tram cars. My views have been put in a nutshell by Messrs.

                                <para>- Yes. This sort of thing is expected in  tramcars,  but not in a train such as that which runs on the Trans-Australian railway. It is stated in the Treasurer&#39;s Budget speech that &#163;385,990 will be spent on the Commonwealth railways this year, including &#163;100,000 for new rolling-stock, &#38;c, on the East-West line. It is proposed to spend other amounts on residential accommodation. I should like to know whether that accommodation will be provided at the rail-head at &#39; Port Augusta - not that it is not required there - or for the men who live along the line. I have travelled over that line many times, and on every occasion I have felt ashamed of the residences provided for the workmen. It is a disgrace to the Commonwealth Government that wood and canvas humpies should be used so long for the accommodation of our railway employees on the East- West railway. I can understand that in the early days, before the locality of crossing places had been fixed, the men had to live in temporary residences. The railway, however, has now progressed beyond that stage. The position of the residences has been determined, and the men should be provided with reasonable, homes. </para>

                                <para>- The State Government had nothing to do with the railway to which I am referring. I am speaking of the railway between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. The men on the Oodnadatta line are well housed. On that line there are stone station buildings and stone residences. The State Department never treated its employees as the Commonwealth has done. # It is intended to spend &#163;218,000 &#39; for rollingstock for the Oodnadatta line, and it is stated that the Commonwealth intends very shortly to take over the working of the line from Quorn to Oodnadatta. I advise the Government to be very careful in that regard. In normal times there is not much traffic on that railway, but during the stock season, when there are large numbers of cattle and sheep transported, railway men are transferred from different parts of the South Australian railway. They remain on the line for two or three months in the year. Not only men, but rollingstock and engines, are transferred from Adelaide, Quorn, Peterborough, and Port Augusta. The Commonwealth Railway Department would be well advised not to spend money in purchasing rolling-stock to meet that rush of traffic for only a few months in the year, at least until the railway has been extended through to Port Darwin. I understand that the working of the railway is not satisfactory to the Government. Neither is it satisfactory to the people of South Australia, but better arrangements could surely be made. If sufficient rollingstock were provided to meet all requirements, most of it would be lying idle for nine months out of every twelve. I believe that the railway officers will not attempt to justify such an expenditure after they have considered it carefully. </para>

                        <para class="block">A Bill was recently passed, providing for an extension of the railway in the Territory a few miles further south. I hope that that does not cover the whole of the intentions of the Government in regard to providing for the development of the Territory. This area is the particular charge of the Commonwealth Government, since the people there have no local Parliament to look after their interests. The members of the Public Works Committee who recently visited the Territory made certain recommendations upon the evidence submitted to them. I emphasize the point that those recommendations did not represent the individual opinions of the Committee. It will be an unfortunate day when members of Committees express their own biased views. If that time ever comes I shall be opposed to intrusting such work to Parliamentary Committees; but I am satisfied that Parliamentary Royal Commissions and Committees are still anxious to do in an honest way the work intrusted to them by the Legislature, and to report according to the weight of the evidence presented to them. I was greatly annoyed by the attempt made in this Chamber on Friday afternoon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> who was one of my companions on the Committee that visited the Territory, to abuse honorable senators from South Australia-, and to traduce South Australia as well. </para>

When it was decided that the Committee should proceed to the Territory, I found that the then Minister for Works and Railways, the Railways Commissioner, the Chief Engineer of Railways, the Railway Superintendent at Port Darwin, and the Administrator in the Northern Territory, as well as three members of the Committee, came from Queensland. It is a wonder that I, the one poor South Australian, was able to secure any consideration at all for my State. The remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> will not read well in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in South Australia. In speaking on the Budget, I read portion of a report respecting the North-South railway, furnished to his Minister by the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> as long ago as 1920, and any one reading the report of the Chief Engineer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler,</inline> will see at once where his sympathies lie. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler</inline> used every influence he could to divert the railway to Queensland, and then through the district between Birdsville and Marree, where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has said scores of times he would never agree to the construction of a line. If there were a proposal before Parliament to-morrow to build a railway from Birdsville to Marree, I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> would vote against it. I have before me the whole of the evidence from Queensland, and practically every witness admitted that if the line were taken to Camooweal&#39;, it would indefinitely delay the construction of the direct North-South line. They further stated that a line through Queensland, whether taken to Birdsville or Bourke, would never, develop the Northern Territory. Of course it never would, because the suggested line to Camooweal would pass over a portion of the country that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has never seen. The honorable senator remarked that South Australia was a spoon-fed State. I do not know what has gone wrong with him. </para>

The construction of that line has made it possible for people to travel from Western Australia to the eastern States in something like a reasonable time; but South Australia does not derive anything like as much benefit from it as does Western Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> also said that South Australia was being spoonfed because Government money was being spent along the River Murray.

                                <para>- Yes. Queenslanders, as well as settlers in Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia, will be able to obtain land on the Murray. Here, again, the charge that South Australia is being spoon-fed falls to the ground. I have no recollection of South Australia ever asking for a penny in the way of special consideration. </para>

                        <para>Not long after I returned from the Northern Territory the Queensland sugar agreement came up for discussion. I proceeded to the Northern State, and saw the pioneers working like galley slaves in the forests clearing land for the cultivation of the sugar cane. I formed the opinion that the workers in Queensland deserved the best consideration that Australia could show them, and, although it was a very unpopular attitude to adopt in my own State, I advocated the renewal of the sugar agreement. Queensland has not obtained a renewal of that agreement, but whenever the opportunity offers I am prepared to give my vote to help the hardy pioneers in the sugar industry, and thereby assist iu the &#34; spoon-feeding &#34; of Queensland. Not long ago honorable senators were discussing the granting of a bounty on beef for export. Every man, woman, and child in Australia who eats beef will now have to pay more for it than they would have paid if that bounty - designed largely to assist the cattlemen of Queensland - had not been granted, thereby still further &#34;spoon-feeding&#34; that State. </para>

                                <para>- I recollect nothing of the sort. That is .as reckless a statement as was made by the honorable  senator  last Friday evening. When Parliament was asked to place a duty on bananas I very foolishly, it now appears, agreed to a little  moTe  spoon-feeding of Queensland at the expense of the people of Australia. Queensland now is asking for a duty on maize, and if it is imposed,  die  people in South Australia who purchase this commodity, will  be  called upon to pay more for it. All their lives the people of Australia are being specially taxed for the purpose of spoon-feeding Queensland, which is described constantly as a wealthy State. I dislike drawing comparisons between the different States, but I consider I should be lacking in my duty as a representative of South Australia if I allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll&#39;s</inline> remarks to go unchallenged. Queensland has become great and wealthy, just as a mendicant amasses wealth, by passing round the hat among the people. Yet an honorable senator from Queensland has the temerity to accuse South Australia of adopting the attitude of a mendicant and asking for special concessions from the Commonwealth Government. I hope that we shall hear no more regarding the claims of individual States. It matters not in which State money is spent; I am satisfied if the expenditure is in the interests of the Commonwealth. I have no objection to Queensland securing as much protection as it possibly can for its industries, but I do find fault when accusations are made such as were made the other day against the State which I represent, and against me as a representative of that State. As one of the representatives of South Australia, it is my duty to defend it. I am just as proud of that State as SenatorFoll is of Queensland. There were quite a number of other matters to which I intended to refer, but I think I have said sufficient to put myself and the State I represent right in the eyes of those who read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and who are sufficiently interested in our discussions to compare the statements of one honorable senator with those of another. </para>
