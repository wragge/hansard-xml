He fixed the date on the assumption that the Loan Bill to authorize the expenditure on this work would previously have been passed by Parliament. The Loan Bill has. not been passed', and, accordingly, the ceremony has been postponed for a week. The postponement will enable both Houses of Parliament to register their will in the matter. </para>

There is, of course, a great deal of similarity between the people of the United States and ourselves. They have sprung, very largely, from the same stock. Their legislative machinery was the progenitor, to a large extent, of ours, and their ideals and' ours have much in common. I would remind the Senate, also, that our destinies approach each other on that great ocean - the Pacific - which laves our eastern shores. We have much: m common there, and we have much in common, too, in that great cause in which the late  President  distinguished himself so highly - the cause of the preservation1 of the peace of the Pacific. His passing away, therefore, is not without deep significance to us in Australia. All. of us, I am sure, have followed with the deepest interest his work in the cause- of peace. We have been stirred by his straightforward, manly,, and simple actions at that great Conference in Washington, a Conference which was unique, I think, among the diplomatic councils of the world, in that all the cards which, in diplomacy, are usually concealed, were placed upon the table. I doubt whether there was ever a previous Conference in which the nations treated one another with such frankness, and I attribute that very largely to the example set by the United States in convening the Conference, and particularly to the opening speech made by the late  President  on behalf of that country. I should like to direct the attention of the Senate to one extract from that speech. Speaking to the representatives of the assembled nations, he said - </para>
                    <para>We are met for a service to mankind. In all simplicity, in all honesty, and all honour, there may be written here the avowals of a world conscience refined by the consuming fires of war, and made more sensitive by the anxious aftermath.. I hope for that understanding which will emphasize the guarantees of peace, and for commitments, to less burdens and a better order which will tranquilize. the world. In such an accomplishment there will he added glory to your flags and ours, and the rejoicing of mankind will make- the . transcending music of all succeeding time. </para>
                    <para class="block">As Earl Balfour said subsequently, the;  President  gave the Conference a motto, and that motto was, " Simplicity, honesty, and honour." If, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that became- the motto of the nations in dealing with one another, what a tremendous benefit would be conferred on the world! What a change there would be in international relationships! It is. because the late  President  so distinguished himself in those particular qualkiesj and took such a leading part at the Conference, that I feel sure the Senate will agree to the carrying of the motion, and will be proud to have it placed on the records. Of the. late  President,  personally, I think we can all say that the words of Tenny-i son in his <inline font-style="italic">Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington,</inline> are very <inline font-style="italic">apropos.</inline></para>

                        <para>.  - In seconding the motion, I feel sure that all honorable senators deeply deplore the loss of the  President  of the United States of America. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harding's,</inline> death the world has unquestionably lost a friend of peace* The seriousness of such losses in high places at the present period in the world's history cannot be accurately computed'. There has always been, to- my mind, a close link between the people of the United States of America and the people of Australia. The spontaneous outburst of enthusiasm on the part of the Australian public, when the United States Fleet visited these shores some years ago, came as a surprise to most of us. No one could have anticipated that the Australian people would give such a warm welcome to the Navy of the United States of America. The heartiness of the greeting exceeded all expectations, and it was a tangible expression of the warm feeling existing between Australia and the great nation across the Pacific. Just as Australia rejoiced upon the occasion of the visit of that fleet to these southern seas, it now sympathizes with the people of the United States of America in their great sorrow due to the loss of their  President.  With all its advantages as a great Democracy, the United States of America also has its disadvantages. In the number and wealth of its people and in its material progress, it is the greatest of all the nations, and yet in world politics it does not take first place. The summoning of the Washington Conference certainly did put the United States in its proper position - that of a leading nation leading the other nations to peace and harmony. I join with the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in the motion expressing our deep sorrow and sympathy with the people of the United States of America in the death of  President  Harding. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minster in charge of this Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> did not give the Senate very much information in his second-reading speech. The impression left on my mind by his remarks was that it was merely a machinery measure containing some necessary but unimportant alterations of the principal Act. On looking into the matter, however, I find that some of the proposed amendment's are of considerable importance, and liable to give rise to some differences of opinion. The Customs Act is a very bulky measure, and I notice by the Bill before us that there is a proposal to repeal a provision as far forward as section 271. It seems to me that it would have been preferable to follow the usual practice in regard to important amendments of an existing Act, and to furnish a memorandum showing the provisions of the principal measure dealt with and the amendments proposed. Such information would have been of very great assistance. . It would be of great advantage if honorable senators had the original measure and the proposed amendments side by side. </para>

                            <para>- I think the  Minister will find that it would be of considerable advantage. Comments on the proposed amendments have been made by the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce. It is pointed out by that body that the tendency is to deal by regulation with matters that ought to be the subject of legislation. It is urged, for instance, that the alteration with respect to warehouse fees in clause 15 is unnecessary. The principal Act definitely sets out the fees to be paid, whereas the proposed  amendment states that the fees are to be as prescribed - a comprehensive manner of shifting responsibility from Parliament. With regard to clause 32, it is held that the proposed alteration of section 228 will throw a very great responsibility on the owner or master of a vessel, but I judge that, in the passage of the measure through another place, some of these objections were dealt with, because the Bill now before the Committee contains no reference to certain specific alterations which form the subject of a protest from the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce. </para>

                            <para>- Those are the main points that have been raised by the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the administration of the Act to say how far they are justified, though on their face they appear to establish a <inline font-style="italic">jirimd facie</inline> case for a careful examination of the pro posed amendments. I put this view before the Minister, and hope that when replying to the second-reading debate he will deal with the points raised more fully than he did in his second-reading speech. </para>

                        <para>. -  I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> in taking exception to the clauses of the Bill which he has mentioned. This measure is a continuation of the system under which the government is drifting into the hands of Departments. This practice of legislating by regulation threatens to break down all our parliamentary safeguards. The position was bad enough before, when regulations had to be laid on the table of Parliament for a certain number of days before they became effective, but it will be infinitely worse in future if they are to take effect from date of publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> I do not know whether the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> will be prepared to explain the reason for the proposed alteration. I know he followed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> very closely, but possibly it may be thought not to be within the province of the Labour party to have any regard for objections to legislation raised by a Chamber of Commerce, since there is believed to be a natural antipathy' between persons representing the respective parties. </para>

We were informed by the Minister that this was merely a machinery measure, and I believe it passed another place with very little discussion in the belief that its provisions were unimportant. Any one who is at all alert must realize that several clauses, which doubtless have been framed to assist the expeditious administration of the Customs Act, need careful consideration. </para>

                        <para>. -  This measure has been primarily designed for the purpose of providing that goods imported into Australia by aircraft shall be dutiable at the same rates as imported goods discharged by seagoing vessels. It is deplorable to realize that goods imported into Australia during the financial year 1922-23 have been taxed to  the extent of £32,872,109. The Government believe that the carriage of goods by aircraft will develop very considerably, and now wish to collect revenue from importations of foreign goods manufactured in . countries where the wages are low and the operatives sweated. Some honorable senators, and a number of honorable members in another place, believe that under a Protectionist policy local manufacture is encouraged, but such is not the case. It has never had that effect in any country. It has been stated by enthusiastic Protectionists in this Chamber that large numbers of capable and honest workmen in Australia are still unable . to secure employment. Many who are saturated with Protection do not realize the true cause of unemployment. In America and other Protectionist countries, large numbers of men are vainly seeking work. </para>

                            <para>- No,, and the supplies from Queensland . and northern New South Wales . are of an inferior q-uality. There . are large numbers of unemployed in the Commonwealfch, . despite our Protective policy. Although the . Government are . taking further precautions to '.prevent the importation of goods without -the payment of duty, foreign-made goods will still continue to . come into Australia irrespective of the duties imposed. After years of arduous toil a tunnel between Switzerland and Italy, which is the longest in the world, was constructed in order to facilitate trade, but immediately the work was completed Customs barriers were established to prevent trade between the two countries. Quite . recently -a tunnel connecting the eastern and western portions of the southern island of . New Zealand was completed, but in that case Customs officers were not stationed at each end. It does not matter whether Customs officers are stationed at the ends of a tunnel or at the port where goods are discharged ; we cannot disregard the fact that Customs duties are imposed in order to secure revenue, and not to provide additional employment for the workers in the country in which they are collected. When one sees enthusiastic Nationalists and ardent Labour men joining forces one may be . quite sure that somebody is on the . wrong side. . Surely there can be no doubt in the mind of any person that foreign goods are still coming to Australia. To the extent to which they come the so-called Protectionist policy has no effect in increasing the -volume of work in Australia. </para>

Honorable senators opposite, wh'o believe in the policy 'of Protection, 'know very well that as long as the Exchequer is filled by the revenue -received from Customs and Excise duties, there will be no necessity to ask the wealthy people to pay taxation. That is the basic reason why, in . all countries to-day, the wealthy people are found advocating high Protection. There are tens of thousands of honest workmen who favour that policy also, but I believe that they are mistaken in  their views. </para>

                        <para>. - When introducing this Bill I stated that it was largely a machinery measure; and so it is. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> has referred to the particulars which have been supplied by the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce in a. letter which, I think, most honorable senators received on 28th July last. When I received that letter I looked up the Act, and became somewhat confused on account of the fact that a number of sections have been incorrectly stated. I discovered that, although the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce is usually a live body in watching the legislation that is passed by this Parliament, on the present occasion it is a little behind the times, inasmuch as many of the amendments which they suggest are in the original Act, and others are incorporated in this Bill. Clause 15 of the Bill proposes to amend section 80 of the principal Act. It is a desirable amendment which will permit the Department to adjust the fees as circumstances may require. It also obviates the necessity for cancelling licences, and requiring the renewal of a licence in the event of fees not being paid by the prescribed date. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Clause 20 relates to the clearance of ships and aircraft. The insertion of sub-clause 3 will meet the objections which have been raised by the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce. Clause 32 repeals section 228 of the principal Act. Sub-clause 1 applies to any person who knowingly contravenes the law in the manner indicated. This provision already appeal's in the principal Act, and the amendment provides only for the inclusion of aircraft. Clause 35, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred, was drafted to meet the difficulty which arose on account of the judgment" given in a Customs case. A limited' company was charged with an attempt to defraud the revenue, but the Judge held that under the provisions of the section) the defendant, company could not ' be convicted of an attempt to defraud the revenue. It is very undesirable that this condition should be continued, and the Crown Law officers have accordingly advised the insertion of clause 35 to remedy the difficulty. </para>

It is proposed to sweep away the definite provision relating to what the parties are to pay, and to substitute for it the comprehensive clause under consideration. The parties will have no means of knowing where they stand. The clause is too wide and too vague. </para>

                        <para>. - Departmental officers have carefully considered this question, and when doing so they had before them the letter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> has referred. Clause 15 abolishes the fixed schedule of fees payable by licensees of warehouses, and makes provision for prescribing the fees by regulation. This will permit of the fees at present fixed in schedule 2 of the Act being fixed by regulation and altered as circumstances require. The present procedure under section 80 also gives rise at times to considerable trouble owing to the dates of payment of licensees fees being specifically mentioned. If such fees, through oversight, are not paid on, say, the first day of January, the licences and securities have to be cancelled and fresh ones issued. A regulation will be issued prescribing the fees and dates of payment. It is more a matter of meeting the wishes of the agents than conferring an advantage upon the Department. The matter has been thoroughly investigated, and, had it been reasonable to do so, the request would have been granted. </para>

It will apparently place Commonwealth ships- in an advantageous position in - competing with other vessels in Australian waters. The clause is therefore an infraction of a principle laid down and boasted of by the Government. </para>

We may take it, therefore, that the deletions are intended to provide uniformity, and to simplify the measure. If the provisions that safeguard the interests of the people by requiring the regulations to be laid on the table of both branches of the Legislature are deleted, will there be the same opportunity as previously existed for Parliament to consider the regulations? </para>

The Minister has told us that the Department has experienced some difficulty in getting convictions under the law as it stands. Possibly that was because the Customs Department did not have a good case. Similarly drastic provisions are not contained in any other Act. It is a principle of British justice, if I may be permitted to use a hackneyed expression, that the person accused shall be deemed innocent until proved guilty, and this  provides that the mere averment of the prosecutor shall be <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence of the guilt of the person accused. I feel inclined to vote against the clause. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister's explanation is not very convincing. Section 255 of the principal Act contains in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> the safeguard that when an intent to defraud the revenue is charged and in all proceedings for an indictable offence, or for an offence directly punishable by imprisonment, the guilt of the defendant must, be established by -evidence. In -all our Customs legislation we have gone a great deal farther than is permissible in connexion with any other Department, but we should be careful not to do away with all  safeguards. In . searching for dutiable goods, the Customs officials necessarily must have a good deal of latitude, but that is quite a different matter from presuming that the averment of the- prosecutor must be regarded as <inline font-style="italic">primd facie</inline> evidence of the guilt of the person accused. The evidence of the prosecutor should be taken for what it may be worth. I see no good reason for any alteration of the existing provisions, merely to make it easier for the Customs Department to obtain convictions, because, even if convictions are obtained, the person convicted may -be quite innocent. I shall require a better explanation from the Minister before I consent to the elimination of a safeguard which the Parliament, in its wisdom, placed in the original Act. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I know that we have objected to proposals to include similar provisions in other Acts, because it is an inversion of the well-known principle of British law that an accused person should not be required to prove himself innocent. The' onus of proof must be on the prosecutor. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> should be more explicit when replying to questions asking for information on important questions . like this. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> intends to vote against the clause. I hope that the Minister . will withdraw it, rather than risk having it struck out of the Bill. I direct attention especially to paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> andb of sub-clause 2, and placing myself momentarily in the position of a defendant, I ask what hope would I have of escape, no matter what answer I might have to the averment of the prosecution. I shall oppose this amendment of the law, as I would prefer the whole clause to be deleted. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has just quoted sub-section 1 of section 255, and paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of subclause 4 of clause 35 of the Bill. The ordinary rules obtaining in Courts apply unless amended by this measure. The onus of proof is on the Crown unless we alter it by Statute. We are providing that in certain cases the averment of the Crown shall obtain, and the fact that it has been averred, unless proved to the contrary, must be accepted except in any proceeding for an indictable offence or an offence directly punishable by imprisonment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is attempting to re-establish the principle that in a criminal charge a simple averment is not sufficient, and that the Crown must prove its case. If sub-clause 4 were not embodied in the Bill a simple averment would be sufficient, but the insertion of this subclause re-establishes the position which exists in the original Act, and which obtains in common law. I am just as keen as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that in all criminal matters, particularly where a person's liberty is at stake, the Crown should not place the onus of proof om the accused. I believe the position is covered in its present form as much as it is in the original Act. </para>

I direct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> attention to the mixed averments which involve law and fact. In such a case the averment' of fact is to stand, whereas it will not follow that the averment of law. shall do so, consequently the position has been relieved. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> fears are not well grounded, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has already pointed out that sub-clause 1 sets out the position very clearly, and, therefore, the existing law will apply. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that common law is quite as good as Statute law. I am endeavouring to have this amendment accepted, because I fear that the Government is attemping to alter what has been the common law, and to have a special law for Customs officials. Even in the 'most trivial matters that system is altogether wrong. Why do we permit it in our Customs laws? Because Customs officials find it difficult, to carry out their duties if they have to stick to the old common law. I do not favour making things easier for officials in the Customs Department, and harder for the persons who trade through the Customs House. Those whom I represent have very little to do with the Customs House; they have never been fined large sums of money for defrauding the Customs revenue, as have some of the people whom honorable senators opposite represent. T desire to retain the wording of the old Act because in my judgment it is so clear and plain . that it cannot be mistaken. If it does not conflict with this clause, no harm will be done ; on the contrary, we shall make assurance doubly sure. If it is not in accordance with the clause, strong reasons should be advanced for striking it out. Notwithstanding the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> and the excellent case made out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,I.</inline> still fail to see why there is any occasion to interfere with the wording of the old Act. I am very suspicious. The trend of legislation during the last ten years has taught me that every Parliament in Australia is working at breakneck speed to make things easy for the Departments, and is forgetting the old safeguards of liberty. For twenty years this sub-section has done good service. Suddenly a new Minister, who has not had much experience, asks us to alter it. What difficulties have occurred during its operation which make necessary its repeal ? </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> put the position very clearly when he stated that the provisions of the clause meet the whole of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> case. The Crown Solicitor has gone into the matter very carefully, and the clause has been drafted in such a way as to facilitate the work of the Customs Department, having due regard to the necessity for meting out that justice to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred. I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment, and I ask the Committee to negative it. </para>

                        <para>. - I quite agree with the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> that the clause as it stands amply protects all parties. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> first raised the question, I thought he had discovered that something had been done to which the Committee could not agree. Further consideration of the matter and a careful examination of the clause led me to the conclusion that there was not as much in his contention as I at first supposed. The clause deals with three kinds of offences against the Customs Act. Subclause <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> refers to an offence in which there has been an attempt to defraud the Customs Department. In a case of that description it would be necessary to call evidence to prove intent. Then there is a reference to proceedings for an indictable offence or an offence directly punishable by imprisonment. In such a case it would be necessary to call evidence to prove the guilt of the person charged. There is a third class of offence, in which there is no intent to defraud the Department or to bring into Australia contraband goods. That is the small offence committed from month to month by the commercial community, more particularly by clerks. A clerk goes to a Customs House to pass an entry. Without any intent to defraud the Department, he unknowingly makes a false statement which may have a .very serious effect upon the Customs revenue. When it is discovered the Customs Department decides to institute a prosecution, in view of the amount of revenue involved. If the clause remains as it is at present drafted, it will be sufficient for the Department to produce before, the Court the entry made by the clerk; there will be no necessity to call evidence. There would be no evidence which they could call. </para>

                            <para>- Only so far- as those proceedings were concerned ; but if the firm was still of opinion that some one else had passed the entry in their name with a view to prejudicing them in the eyes of the Department or the public, it could always appeal'. I do not know of an instance where such a difficulty has arisen, but I have known numbers of cases where false . entries have been passed unknowingly by clerks. They have made the usual declaration that everything . contained in the- entry was " true and correct,''" and it has turned out afterwards- that- something was incorrect. They have been haled before a magistrate and fined, a nominal amourufc. Not the ,  firm, but, the. person passing the  entry, would be fined.. It is quite suffi cien.t,. in these, cases, to produce the entry which tha clerk attempted to pass. There is no necessity to call, other evidence. The clause- will save time and money, and no harm can result to any one. Cases in which there is an intention to introduce "contraband or to defraud the Customs Department of large or small sums of money are not identical. These are covered already; they cannot be dealt with by a mere averment, and evi'dence mast be tendered; in support of the* charge. </para>

He said that a Customs clerk might go to the Customs desk and unintentionally put in a statement which was afterwards discovered to be false*. There is- a vast difference between the words "false"  and . " wroniSf'."  The honorable senator has said that an error might be made: in presenting tha statement,; and that it might be committed, by a.. very junior clerk under instructions from the. head of the firm.. Such a statement could not be :*'faise ''" if it were made in error. There might be no intention to defraud, but if the clause is passed a man can be fined <inline font-style="italic">ari</inline> the "mert averment of a Customs officials Evidence should be- called to- prove that the defendant wilfully made a wrong or false entry, with intention to defraud. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman-</inline> has- said that the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is not necessary and that the- common la,w already protects, the individual. If the- clause- is passed the common law will be- no protection to- the individual,, because he may be fined - I will not say he can be imprisoned - without evidence being, called. The very fact that a man is haled before a court of justice and fined means that a conviction is recorded against him as a citizen.

                        <para>. - The Minister has stated that he is- concerned about the Department,, and has asked the Committee to pass, the clause in. ordier <inline font-style="italic">t&amp;</inline> convenience it. I am concerned about the mercantile community of Australia. There is no- danger from the clause- in capital cities like. Melbourne and Sydney, where Customs Act procedure' is well understood, but it would be very undesirable in distant places if a magistrate- could decide against a man- on the mere averment of a Customs official. There might be differences of opinion between an honorable firm and the Customs Department, and they might result in a prosecution. The magistrate, if the clause is passed, would probably take the departmental statement for granted. I want to avoid that sort of thing. The clause should be deleted and the section of the Act allowed to remain. We appear to be reverting to the principle applied to the mercantile community of Australia by the first Minister for Customs. He decided that they were all rogues unless they could prove themselves honest. The clause says that the Customs Department is quite correct, but those opposed to it may not be correct. I urge the deletion of the clause. </para>

                        <para>.- I cannot understand the object of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in moving the amendment. If he admires the law as it stands, he should adopt the simple expedient of voting, and persuading honorable senators to vote against the clause. The provision is exactly the same as that contained in the Arbitration Act. I am not prepared at the moment to argue definitely that it is a good provision, but there are certain classes of offences which are commonly regarded as being extremely difficult to prove. Some of these are offences against the Customs Acts, and others are offences against the Arbitration Act. In order to make the law effective, Parliament decided to place upon the- defendants the burden of disproving their alleged guilt. That is a very drastic change in our law, but, nevertheless, in these two classes of cases, the principle has definitely been adopted. If on a is in favour of that change, it seems to rae that one should support the clause, because it makes no drastic change in. the- law, but merely attempts to» make more effective a change, which has already been agreed to. The Courts have held that the provision in the Arbitration Act has a very limited application. For example, it was held that the section had no application where a question of mixed law and fact was involved. The clause seeks to improve the law in that respect by providing that, although there is a question of mixed' law and fact involved, the section shall apply, but to tha extent only of the averment of fact, and not as to the averment of law. That is the meaning of paragraph 6 of sub-clause 2,. </para>

                            <para>- It will make the existing law more easy -of- application. The Court having held that where mixed questions of law and fact were involved, the whole section in. the principal Act went by the board, the Customs Department received no benefit in those cases from the section. The clause provides that it shall get the benefit, in so far as the facts only are concerned. The Court also held that where the Department did not rely strictly on the averment, but proceeded to strengthen it by calling evidence, it then waived the benefit of the section. Having once given evidence, it had to&gt; go the whole length and prove the case throughout. There seems to be no reason why, if the Crown elects to strengthen its cas.e by calling evidence, it should lose the benefit of the section.. Honorable senators, need not feav that they will be making the law more drastic by agreeing to the. proposed change. On the general question whether we should interfere, with the common law to the extent of throwing the . burden of proof upon the defendant in all similar cases, including industrial cases, I am not at present prepared to argue but having adopted the principle, we should not be averse to going a step farther and making the section which deals with it workable. </para>

                        <para>. -  Before rejecting the clause with a view to restoring the section in the principal Act, let us consider what the adoption of that course would mean. It was the intention of Parliament that in certain cases, where prosecutions were instituted by the Department, the averment of the Department should be sufficient, protection having been provided for in those cases where punishment by imprisonment followed conviction. In a case before the High Court where the averment was a mixture of law and fact, the Court held that averments as to facts only could be made. Honorable senators can readily understand that it is impossible very often to make an averment intelligible unless it is one of mixed law and fact. The present clause is intended to cover the position, so that an averment of mixed law and fact may be made. </para>

                            <para>- The averment of course, is capable of being rebutted. The principle is contained in the principal Act, but it is so worded that it is unworkable in many cases. I suggest that the wise thing to do is to adhere to the principle, not as it is stated in the principal Act, 'but as it is now set out in the Bill. The principle has been established for many years, and the clause is intended merely to make it workable in view of the recent decision of the High Court, so that averments may be made in an intelligible way. The law as it stands to-day is liable to abuse. The principle may be wrong but it has been established, and no honorable senator has suggested that we should alter it. </para>

                        <para>. -  I cannot follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman's</inline> argument. This is not a question only of mixed law and fact. The clause seems to me to be a violation of  a  principle of British justice, and I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin's</inline> suggestion. The principle in the original Act is perfectly clear. Before  a  person is deemed to be guilty he is to be proved so, but the present proposal practically condemns him before he opens his mouth. It is a well-established principle of British law that no man is bound to incriminate himself in his own evidence, and, whether on a question of fact or of law, I object to the proposal. I have seen this principle violated in South Australia, and I do not intend to support its violation in Commonwealth legislation. </para>

The case is mentioned in 20 <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports,</inline> in which it is stated that where an information was laid, say, under section 33 of the Customs Act, that A.B. did, without authority in accordance with the Act, interfere with certain goods subject to the control of the Customs, in that he did, without the authority aforesaid, remove from No. 10 Wharf at Melbourne certain specified goods which had been imported, but had not been delivered for home consumption or exported to parts beyond the seas, then in the words of Griffith, C.J., in <inline font-style="italic">Symons</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">Schiff man, "</inline> the allegation that A.B. had interfered with goods subject to the control of the Customs is an allegation of mixed fact and law." In averring that the goods were subject to the control of the Customs, it was implied that the existence of certain facts made the goods subject to control of the Customs within the meaning of the section, and in averring that they had been interfered with, it was again implied that certain facts amounted to interference with such goods within the meaning of the section. Even though the general averment of the offence was followed by words describing the particular act complained of, the averment was not, as section 255 stands at present, evidence of any facts stated therein, as then the actual facts were placed before the Court and must be proved by evidence. </para>

                        <para>. - The principle to which certain members of my party take exception is embodied in all our Customs Acts, and I take the stand that, no matter what our opinions may be on other matters, we ought to be exceedingly jealous concerning the receipts from Customs. It is easier, under this provision, for a person against whom an averment has been made to prove his innocence than for the Department to prove his guilt. </para>

Certain difficulties have arisen in cases where questions of fact and law are involved, and apparently as the result of a decision of the High Court, we are asked now to tighten up the provisions of the Act. I intend to help the Government, because I know that some persons are only too prone to take advantage of any flaws in our Customs legislation. It is not the duty of the Department to prove guilt, but for the person against whom the averment is made to prove his innocence. </para>

                            <para>- But this clause will not make matters any worse. On the contrary, it will improve the position. In man}' cases it is practically impossible, without this provision, to prove guilt, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has said, it is relatively easy for a defendant to disprove an averment of his guilt. He has simply to produce his books in Court, and reveal the whole position. I point out also that, for serious offences punishable by imprisonment, sub-clause 1 will have no application whatever. </para>

The principal Act is so badly worded that it was held that it could not cover certain cases which the present proposal is clearly directed to include. The fact that the legal phraseology has been somewhat changed involves no change of principle. I am just as anxious as are other honorable senators concerning the liberties and rights of citizens, but as we have deliberately adopted the principle, it should be made workable. It is proposed to delete from the principal Act these words - </para>

That section provides that all regulations which, are made shall be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament, as the honorable senator has stated. The repeal of that section will not make any alteration in practice, because an amendment of the Acts Interpretation Act which was made subsequent to the enactment of the Customs Act contained the same provision with regard to regulations as is contained in Section 271 . There is no necessity to include that provision in this Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - If an assurance given by a Minister would be accepted in a Court of law I should most gladly accept the assurance which the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> has just given. But Judges and juries deal with the law as they find it. The control of the Customs has practically passed out of the hands of Parliament, and has been placed in charge of a Board, which can impose and remove taxation. It is quite in keeping with the spirit that animates honorable senators opposite to make sure that nothing shall be left in the Bill which will interfere with the operations of the Board. I am opposed to government by Boards, and I want to provide every possible safeguard. The Minister gave us to understand that this Bill was introduced merely to make the existing legislation apply to aircraft. The few matters brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> have given rise to discussion that will convince most people that the Bill is entirely different from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> said it was. 1 think that we ought to have in this and in every Bill the provision that regulations shall be laid upon the table of the Senate for a certain number of days. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that if the Minister remains in charge it will be done. It seems to me a very strange thing that such a provision is not contained in this Bill. A Chamber of Commerce can bring to the consideration of matters an intelligent and practical frame of mind. The Adelaide Chamber of Commerce has put forward very grave reasons for changes to be made in this measure. The Minister should mention some of the Acts that have been passed in recent years without this provision. The Acts Interpretation Act has been in existence for a number of years, but notwithstanding that fact I could point to a dozen Acts passed since I came into this Chamber which incorporate this provision. I protest against its exclusion from this Bill because the whole of the Customs business has been handed over to a Board. </para>

                <para>This measure is by no means new to the Senate. It is practically the same Bill that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> once? presented to the Senate, and it was again presented to the Senate and explained in a lengthy speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in the dying hours of the last Parliament. The Bill must be classed among the measures that relate to finance and trade, such as bills of exchange, trade marks, patents, and banking, and such other matters in respect of which the Commonwealth Parliament has already passed legislation. The constitutional authority for the Bill is to be found in Part V. of the Constitution, section 51, which states - </para>

                <para>This is one of the subjects that affect the whole of Australia, and it is very clear that only Federal legislation could put on a satisfactory basis a matter affecting the whole of the population without regard to State boundaries. Trade and commerce should not be trammelled by different laws and different, practices in the several States, and the advantages conferred on trade and commerce throughout the Commonwealth, for example, by the Bills of Exchange Act, should also be conferred by an Act to simplify and consolidate in a single measure the most useful provisions relating to bankruptcy find insolvency law. The different Bankruptcy Acts and rules and practices in the States as they now exist are a distinct hindrance to trade and commerce, especially between the residents of one State and another. Further, a uniform bankruptcy law will facilitate commercial relations between the United Kingdom and overseas Possessions. I find that only recently no less distinguished a person than Judge Moule, of Victoria, speaking of the value of the Insolvency Court, said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>If the Insolvency Court is working properly there is little danger to the commercial prosperity of the country, as this Court is the guide  which  stops it from going, astray, . . . If the Insolvency Court is not in a vigorous state there is a chance that the community will slip into a state of commercial dishonesty. </para>
                    <para>This Bill has involved an enormous amount of labour and research and the consideration of over twenty bankruptcy or insolvency Acts of the United Kingdom and the States. I shall mention some of them, namely, the English Bankruptcy Act 1914, the English Bankruptcy Act 1890, the New South Wales Bankruptcy Act 1898, the Victorian Bankruptcy Act 1915, the South Australian Insolvent Acts 1886 and 1915, the West Australian Bankruptcy Acts 1892 and 1898, the Queensland Insolvency Act 1874 and 1893, the Tasmanian Bankruptcy Acts 1870 and 1899, the English Deeds of Arrangement Acts 1898 and 1914, and also Part XI. of the South Australian Insolvent Act 1886 relating to compositions and assignments without insolvency. </para>
                    <para>Some inferences may be drawn from the dates of these measures. It will be noticed that, where trade and commerce were in the ascendant, the Acts are of most recent, date, and contain the most up-to-date provisions, and, further, accord more closely with the latest bankruptcy provisions of the English Bankruptcy Acts. The bankruptcy legislation  of  Victoria, having received recent revision, is most nearly in accord with the English legislation in respect of the latest innovations, especially in relation to trustees and bankruptcy offences and private deeds of arrangement. </para>
                    <para>The Bill contains fifteen parts and over 200 clauses, so that the explanations of the parts and clauses is essentially a matter to be done in Committee.. </para>

                        <para>- No; that would be asking too much. But to understand the general principles of the Bill and the general scheme, a brief historical and analytical examination is necessary, as the measure is founded largely on the latest English legislation on bankruptcy and the best material to be found in the State Acts. The mercantile community in each State will not easily appreciate at first sight the uniform law in place of their existing laws, but it can be said without hesitation that nothing complicated, but much that is simple, has been introduced to secure uniformity, and that much that should be enacted to simplify procedure and to secure protection for both creditors and debtors' and prevent, irregularities has been ' provided for. Further, the main principles' of each main State Bankruptcy Act are continued, as they are, as will be shown, based more or less on English legislation. </para>

                    <para>To show the common source of most of the State Bankruptcy Acts and points of' similarity and difference, I shall cite a number of leading measures. The English Bankruptcy Act 1883 succeeded that of' 1869, and was amended by the Bankruptcy Act 1890, and consolidated by the Bankruptcy Act 1914. This latest Act is the chief measure on which the Bill is framed. The New South Wales Bankruptcy Act of 1898 is a consolidation of all existing Bankruptcy Acts in force in the State in 1898, being based mainly on the English Bankruptcy Act of 1883. The Victorian Insolvency Act 1915 is  a  consolidation of the Victorian Insolvency Act of 1890, as amended by the Acts of 1897 and 1903. It is based principally on the English Bankruptcy Act of 1869, but it contains provisions adopted from the English Bankruptcy Acts of 1883 and 1890 and the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1898. The South Australian Insolvent Act of 1886- is an Act to amend and consolidate the laws relating to insolvent debtors. These laws, consolidated, were all passed from 1855 to 1882, and, therefore, were framed prior to the English Act of 1883. The provisions of these Acts are, to some extent, based on the English legislation prior to 1883, but Part XI., " Compositions and Assignments without Insolvency," was passed in an amended form in South Australia in 1886 - or rather an up-to-date scheme  was  invented for " Compositions and Assignments without Insolvency." </para>

The Western Australian Bankruptcy Act of 1892 is adopted from the English Bankruptcy Acts of 1883 and 1890, and the Western Australian Act of 1898 is practically a copy of Part XI. of the South Australian Insolvent Act of 1886. </para>

                            <para>- There is a curious use of the words " bankruptcy " and " insolvency." The title " Bankruptcy Act " is used in the United Kingdom, the States of New South Wales, Western Australia, and Tasmania. Victoria and Queensland use the expression " Insolvency Act," and South Australia " Insolvent Act." The term " bankruptcy " is the better term, and therefore is adopted for the Commonwealth Bill. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the question of the application of bankruptcy laws. The Bill will, as in England and Western Australia, apply to the Crown, and to foreigners, and married women; it does not apply to corporations in respect to which winding up provisions are made. The administrative provisions of the Bill are to be found in Part II., and follow closely the English scheme. The system of control is centred in the Attorney-General, and provision is made for an Inspector-General, registrars, and official receivers. Their duties aTe set out in the respective sections relating to them. The administration will be simple and effective, and will take the place of the existing State Administrations, which are hard to define, but which, together with the English system, may fee summed up as follows : - In England the administration (apart from the administration conducted by the Judges and registrars) is carried out by the Board of Trade. There is a special Department of Bankruptcy, which exercises . an active control. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Board appoints and removes the official receivers; calls for and audits their accounts; where there is no Committee of Inspection, acts, through the official receivers, as a committee; exercises general and effective control over trustees; and examines the receipts and expenditure of trustees of private deeds of arrangements.. </para>
                    <para>The control of trustees by the Boar-d and the creditors is a special feature of the system, and it has been said, " What with the jealous scrutiny of creditors ranging at large or focussed, and the Committee of Inspection on the one side, and the strict official supervision of the Board of Trade on the other, it demands genius of no common order on the part of a trustee to perpetrate any irregularity." </para>
                    <para>In the States there appear to be no separate Departments of Bankruptcy. The officers appointed to carry out the execution of the Bankruptcy Acts, generally speaking, belong to the permanent staff of the Crown Law Department. In some States there are officials, whose work may be said to appertain wholly to bankruptcy 'business, who exercise administrative functions similar to the officials and official receivers performing bankruptcy duties under the Board of Trade. The number of such State officials are few; most of the other officers who perform duties in regard to insolvency attend also to the business of the Supreme and other Courts. </para>
                    <para>Jurisdiction is provided for in Part LTL of the Bill. In England, bankruptcy jurisdiction is- vested in (1) the High Court; and (2) in certain local Bankruptcy Courts (County Courts). In New South Wales, bankruptcy law is administered by the Supreme Court in its bankruptcy jurisdiction " by Judge in Bankruptcy," subject to appeal; and by the Registrar. In Victoria, bankruptcy jurisdiction is exercised by a " Court of Insolvency," with powers of Supreme Court, and the County Court Judges of the Insolvency Court, with assigned districts. In South Australia, the bankruptcy jurisdiction is vested in a Commissioner of Insolvency, and, locally, in Stipendiary Magistrates. In Western Australia, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy business being transacted under the direction of one of the Judges assigned for  that purpose. In Queensland, the jurisdiction is vested in the Supreme Court, with power to the Governor in Council to appoint any District Court to be a Court of Insolvency. In Tasmania, the insolvency jurisdiction is administered by a Supreme Court Judge at Hobart and a Commissioner in Bankruptcy at Launceston, all powers of the Commissioner in Bankruptcy being exercisable by a Judge of the Supreme Court. The Courts on which bankruptcy jurisdiction will be conferred are such Federal Courts as Parliament creates for the purpose, and such State Courts or Courts of a Territory as are specially authorized to exercise that jurisdiction. No new Courts are created by the Bill. The Courts invested with bankruptcy jurisdiction under the Bill  Will  have that jurisdiction throughout the Commonwealth or any specified district and proceedings may be transferred from Court to Court or from place to place. Any question of law arising in any bankruptcy proceedings may be referred to the High Court for its opinion. With the exception of certain specified matters, the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy Judge may be exercised in chambers. Officers of the Court exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction are to a more or less extent intrusted with statutory powers and jurisdiction in bankruptcy matters. The jurisdiction provisions of the Bill will be found simple and elastic so as to meet all requirements, and to secure simplicity and prompt transaction of business over wide areas. I refer honorable senators to Part III., which also provides for procedure and evidence. </para>
                    <para>Divison 1 of Part <inline font-style="italic">TV.</inline> deals with acts of bankruptcy, and the law in each State on this important matter fortunately shows a great deal of uniformity. The States follow very closely the English provisions. The New South Wales Act practically only differs from the English sections by the addition of some consequential amendments and two additional acts of bankruptcy, viz., being an uncertificated bankrupt according to any Court of competent jurisdiction in or out of New South Wales, and non-compliance with a request to file petition when that request is made by a majority of convened creditors after admission of inability to pay debts. In Victoria, the acts of bankruptcy closely follow those of the New South Wales Act. In the South Australian Act of 1886, the acts of bankruptcy may be said to embrace the principles of the acts of bankruptcy mentioned above. The Western Australian Act is a copy of the English, with consequential local variations. The Queensland and Tasmanian Acts follow the English Act of 1869, which, in respect of acts of insolvency, has been reproduced without any material alteration in the latest English A.cts. The Bill follows closely the English Act of 1914. </para>
                    <para>As regard procedure, there are some noticeable differences between the English and some of the State practices. First, as to the English Act, the petition in due form having been presented, a receiving order is made. It is not a divesting, but a protecting, order. The official receiver is constituted receiver of the property of the debtor pending the appointment of a trustee. On the receiving order being made, one of three courses may be followed : - (1) The creditors may, without the debtor being adjudged bankrupt, accept a composition or scheme of arrangements; (2) the debtor may be adjudged bankrupt; or (3) the creditors, after adjudication of bankruptcy, may accept a composition or scheme of arrangement effecting the annulment of the bankruptcy. The scheme of arrangement referred to here is distinct from the private deeds of arrangement referred to in Parts XI. and XII. In New South Wales, on a valid bankruptcy petition being presented, the Court makes a sequestration order, whereupon - (1) the debtor becomes bankrupt and continues bankrupt until a certificate of discharge is issued or sequestration is annulled; (2) the property of the bankrupt vests in one of the official assignees until the appointment of a trustee, when the property vests jointly in assignee and trustee. All these cases prove conclusively the necessity for a uniform bankruptcy law. The six different States have different laws in relation to bankruptcy which seriously interfere with the Inter-State trade and commerce. On the sequestration order being made, one of two courses may be taken - (1) composition or scheme, and on acceptance and approval by the Court, the bankrupt may obtain release; or (2) general administration and distribution by trustee. As to the composition or scheme ?i  arrangement, New South "Wales has followed, although not absolutely, the English Bankruptcy Act.. In Victoria,- ou valid bankruptcy petition being presented, the Court makes an order <inline font-style="italic">nisi</inline> placing the estate of the debtor under sequestration in the hands of one of the assignees, and when the order is made absolute, the debtor  becomes  insolvent. </para>
                    <para>Bankruptcy does not follow immediately on the making of the " receiving order " in England; but it does on the making of the sequestration order in New South Wales, and on the making of the order <inline font-style="italic">nisi</inline> for sequestration absolute in Victoria. In England, the creditors have to decide as a first step whether or not an approved composition or scheme of arrangement can be agreed upon. If so, there is no bankruptcy; if not, the debtor is adjudged bankrupt. In New South Wales, bankruptcy follows as a consequence of the sequestration order, and the first step is to ascertain, whether or not an approved composition or scheme of arrangement can be agreed upon. If so, the debtor may obtain his discharge; if not, the debtor's estate goes through the general course of administration and distribution. In Victoria, on the order <inline font-style="italic">nisi</inline> being made absolute, the debtor becomes bankrupt, and his estate goes through, the usual course without any preliminaries as to whether or not a composition or scheme of arrangement can be effected; but there is this provision, that if at any time, after sequestration, three-fourths in number and value of the creditors agree to a composition,  the Court may grant the insolvent his release. As to adjudication of bankruptcy, the Western Australian Act of 1892 is. with consequential amendments, a copy of the English Bankruptcy Acts of 1883 and 1890, while the Queensland, and Tasmanian A.cts, as to this subject, are a copy of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1869. </para>
                    <para>The Bill provides a uniform practice and follows the New South Wales bankruptcy law, which, in view of all the provisions relating to private deeds and compositions is deemed the most desirable. A true line is drawn between the two. Therefore, upon the Court making an order for sequestration the debtor be-  comes divested of his estate, which is then subject to distribution. After sequestration comes the debtor's statement' of affairs, showing particulars of his assets, debts, and liabilities, the names, residences, and occupations of his creditors, the securities held by them respectively, and such further or other information as may be prescribed. In the different States there are practically no differences in the essential features of the provisions relating to the debtor's statement of affairs. The Bill simply follows the 'established practices. </para>
                    <para>Most of the State Acts contain similar provisions based on the English Acts with regard to meetings of creditors, but with a slightly varied procedure in some cases, the more up-to-date and uniform provisions being found in the New South Wales and Western Australian Acts. It may be observed that where provision is made for the office, the official receiver is the officer who takes the chief part in the creditor's first- meeting. Similar duties in this respect appear to be divided between the Registrar and the Official Assignee in New South Wales, and between the Chief Clerk and Official Assignee in Victoria. Uniformity herein is best effected by following the latest English legislation and English bankruptcy rules, and provision to this effect is contained in the Bill. </para>
                    <para>Next in order comes the public examination of the debtor against whom a sequestration order has been made. Of the provisions in the State Acts those of New South Wales and Western Australia are based on the latest English model which the Bill follows. The rules and regulations as to proof of debts will be found in the second schedule of the Bill. </para>
                    <para>On the bankruptcy of the debtor special provisions relate to the appointment of the trustee either (1) by an ordinary resolution .of the creditors; or (2) by the Committee of Inspection, his appointment and eligibility being an essential part of the whole scheme of bankruptcy. But the general provisions relating to trustees - appointment of  joint and successive trustees, official name, remuneration, discretionary powers and control thereof, audit, &amp;c. - are numerous, and, generally, based on the provisions of the English Acts. The tendency has been strongly in favour of getting into line with and adopting the language of the latest English provisions on .the subject, and this has been practically accomplished by New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. The control exercised over trustees under all the later bankruptcy laws is stringent and effective. This remark applies with equal force to official assignees. The Bill has followed the latest legislation and contains very complete provisions as to trustees. </para>
                    <para>I wish to draw special attention to Part IX. A special procedure is, by the English Bankruptcy Act, provided for winding up, with or without bankruptcy, the estate of a debtor those property is not likely to exceed £300. As in the case of ordinary bankruptcies, a petition by or against the debtor must be presented, and thereupon the Official' Receiver holds a personal interview with the debtor in order to determine whether the estate should be subjected to summary administration, and the Court will make an order for this purpose if satisfied, on the Official Receiver's report, that the property is not likely to exceed the amount mentioned. The making of the order does not relax the provisions of the Act relating to the examination and discharge of the debtor, but the following chief modifications, subject to certain exceptions, take effect :  - The Official Receiver will be the trustee and take the place of the Committee of Inspection. Costs will be lower, there will be no advertising in the local paper, and no jury; no " composition " or " scheme of arrangement " will have to be submitted, six months will be allowed for distribution of dividends, the estate must be realized with all despatch, and, where practicable, distributed in one dividend. The debtor, it has to be observed, need not be made bankrupt unless he makes default or the Court so orders. In practice it appears that he is almost without exception adjudged bankrupt. The provisions of Part IX. of the Bill follow closely the English legislation, and this innovation, I have no doubt, will result in getting rid of a great deal of unnecessary formality and expense. It will result in a saving to creditors and will " temper the wind to the shorn lamb." </para>
                    <para>In England, and in all the States, exceptVictoria, the trustee's title to property which he may claim for distribution among creditors is not limited to the date of the receiving order, or of the adjudication, or of the sequestration order, but may relate back to the time of the first act of bankruptcy committed by the debtor within a definite time immediately preceding the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings. Uniformity is desirable, as the following variations in the present law will show: - England, three months of date of presentation of petition ; New South Wales, six months of date of presentation of petition; Victoria, no provision ; South Australia, twelve months of date of presentation of petition; Western Australia, twelve months of date of presentation of petition; Queensland, six months of date of presentation of petition;- Tasmania, twelve months of date of presentation of petition. Honorable senators will thus see the tremendous variations that exist. The Bill provides that relation back will not extend beyond six months. This is. a matter of interest to lawyers. </para>

As to property divisible amongst creditors, the provisions in all the Acts are practically the same, being based on those of the English Act of 1869. With regard to the avoidance of voluntary settlements, similar provisions are found in each Act with variations as te* periods: - Victoria 1915, section 143, two and five, years; South Australia 1886, sub-section 158- 160; Western Australia 1892:, section 45, two and ten years:. The periods provided for in the Bill are avoidance of settlement " within two years of bankruptcy, or within five years unless proof is made of bankrupt's ability at time of making settlement to pay all his debts without the aid of the property settled. </para>

The Bill fellows generally the provisions of the New South Wales law, which is of a legal and technical character. </para>
                    <para>Protected Transactions. - Certain transactions in connexion with the bankrupt or his property, which take place before the date of the receiving order or sequestration order, but after the bankrupt has committed an act of bankruptcy, are protected. This matter is dealt with in section 45 of the English Act of 1914. </para>
                    <para class="block">The principles are the same in all the State Acts, which, however, contain in some cases additions and modifications.

                    <para>Priority of Debts. - The order in which debts are payable in England is regulated by tha English Bankruptcy Act 1914, section 33. The Crown has no priority. The existing legislation in England gives priority to - (1) the wages or salary of any clerk or servant, not exceeding £50, in respect of services rendered during four months prior to the receiving, order, and (2) the wages of any labourer or workman, not exceeding £25,. for. services - whether time or piece-work - rendered during two months prior to the date of the receiving order. In support of these priorities it is urged' that, in addition to their being only small creditors, the employees have helped te make the assets. The Bill provides for £50 in regard to the wages or salary of clerk, servant, or workman in respect of services rendered within four months of date of sequestration order. </para>

                    <para>Rent. - A landlord's power to distrain is limited, under some Acts, to rent for a certain period ; under others, he has no power to distrain, but receives, in lieu thereof a priority to an amount equal to rent for a stated period. However, in  either case, the practice varies, as. the following comparison shows: - England, distress for six months' rent; New South Wales, no distress after bankruptcy, but priority for sum equal to three mouths' rent ; Victoria, three, months' distress repealed, now three months? rent out of estate in respect of which there were goods on the premises liable to distress for rent ; South Australia, distress for various periods according to nature of tenancy: Western Australia, six months' distress; Queensland, no distress, but priority for sum equal to three months'' rent; Tasmania, distress for twelve months' rent. Subject to other priorities, the Bill provides for a prior right for three months' rent similar to that granted under the Victorian Act, the balance being treated as an ordinary debt. The matters dealt with under the following heads are practically the same in each State: - Mutual debts, conduct of debtor and control exercised over him - duties of debtor, redirection of debtor's letters, and arrest of debtor. </para>
                    <para class="block">  The English Act 1914, section 10, gives power to the Official Receiver to appoint, on the application of a creditor, a special manager of the estate until a trustee is appointed. Security has to be given. Western Australia has followed the English section, with consequential alterations. There is a corresponding section in the New South Wales Act. Where a special manager is. not appointed, the Official Receiver is to act as manager pending appointment of the trustee. This, provision is' included in the Bill. Similar provisions are found in all the States in respect of the following, matters: - Realization of property: Possession of property by trustee,, seizure of property of bankrupt,, vesting and transfer of property, disclaimer of onerous property, powers of trustees to deal with bankrupt's property, powers exercisable by trustee with permission of the Committee of Inspection, declaration and distribution of dividends, joint and separate dividends, provision for creditors residing at a distance, right of creditor who has not proved debt before declaration of dividend, final dividend, no action for dividend, power to- allow bankrupt to manage property, right of bankrupt to surplus, and unclaimed funds. </para>
                    <para>Discharge of Bankrupt,. - This is a matter in respect of which there is comparatively a considerable variation. The English Act of 1914, section 26, is a very long section, but, epitomizing the essential points, they are found to be - (1) The Court may grant or refuse an absolute order of. discharge or suspend the operation of the order for a limited time,, or grant it subject to conditions with or without a suspension ; (2) the Court shall refuse the order, except for special reasons, when the bankrupt has committed certain offences under the bankruptcy law ; (3) on proof of certain facts the Court shall either refuse the order or suspend it for a period of not less than two years, or until a dividend of not less than 10s. in the £1 has been paid to the creditors, or require the bankrupt, as a condition of his discharge, to consent to judgment being entered against him for any balance or part of any balance of the debts provable under the bankruptcy, subject in this last case, under certain circumstances, to modification after two years; and (4) where the bankrupt has made a fraudulent or unjustifiable marriage settlement the Court may refuse or suspend the order or grant it subject to conditions. The provisions of the New South "Wales Act are practically the same as those of the English Act. The Court may (a) grant or refuse an absolute order of discharge; (6) suspend the operations of the order for a specified time; (c) grant an order of discharge, or suspend the operations of such order subject to conditions as to earnings or after-acquired property; but shall <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> refuse the discharge when misdemeanour as to bankruptcy is committed; (e) refuse or suspend discharge, or grant it conditionally on proof of certain facts. This is generally common to all later Bankruptcy Acts. In Victoria the details of the application for discharge and the principles on which the application is granted are nearly the same. The Court may (a) grant or refuse an immediate absolute certificate of discharge; or (fe) suspend the certificate from taking effect for such time not exceeding two years as the Court may think fit ; or (c) suspend the certificate until such dividend - not exceeding 7s. in the <inline font-style="italic">£</inline> 1 - as it may fix has been paid to the creditors, or until security for the payment of such dividend has been given to the satisfaction of the Court. In other respects the Victorian law is similar to that in England and New South "Wales. Western Australia adopted the English provisions. The South Australian provisions relating to certificate of discharge are not in conformity with those of the other State Acts. They provide for first, second, and third class certificates, and other provisions in connexion with discharge which have been adapted from earlier legislation. The provisions in the Queensland and Tasmania Acts aS to discharge are borrowed, with slight variation, from the English Acts. The Bill follows closely the English legislation. </para>
                    <para>Deeds of Arrangement, Liquidations by Arrangement, and Compositions. - These are matters of vital interest to the mercantile community. It has been said of the English bankruptcy system, as formulated  by the Acts of 1883 and 1890, that it represents a <inline font-style="italic">via media,</inline> consulting the wishes and interests of creditors with just enough official control to prevent those abuses which spring up so easily from the supineness or self-seeking of creditors, the dishonesty of debtors, and the rapacity of trustees; that it discriminates, as no previous system has done, between insolvency brought on by misconduct and insolvency due to misfortune. I think honorable senators will readily realize that there is a great difference between a man who is insolvent because of misfortune and one who is insolvent by reason of his roguery. In every way possible the Bill tries to make a distinction between those two classes. It is generally agreed by those most competent to judge that the man who has become insolvent by misfortune should have every consideration possible within the bounds of the law. It has been further said of the English system that by steadily discountenancing the one class, and dealing gently with the other, it insensibly purifies commercial morality, but that the vulnerable point of the system is the number of insolvent estates which are liquidated outside the Bankruptcy Court. Traders favour private arrangements to bankruptcy. That they do so is set down to their antipathy to officialism and publicity. The expense and  "red-tapism"  of bankruptcy proceedings have been urged as objectionable features. It appears clear that the recognition of deeds of arrangement must find a place in any general bankruptcy system. In view of the different practices prevailing, care is necessary to determine what form legislation on this subject of arrangements without bankruptcy should take. There are three methods in use. The English Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914, together with the important provisions of the Bankruptcy Act of 1914, which operate in regard to control of deeds of arrangement, applies and incorporates the main bankruptcy provisions relating to trustees and other provisions relating to proof of debts, the property available for their payment, the effect of bankruptcy on antecedent transactions, and the realization and distribution of the bankrupt's property. This system has been introduced as Part XII. of the Bill. Compositions and assignments without bankruptcy are provided for in Part XI. of the South Australian Act of 1S86, and the Western Australian Act of 1898. This is provided for. in Part XI. of the Bill. The later legislation in Victoria embodies the principle of deeds of arrangement. The New South Wales Act contains no provision for a , scheme of arrangement or composition without bankruptcy. There appears to be no danger that private deeds of arrangements or compositions will be resorted to to commit frauds on creditors so long as they are subjected to official control, to which there appears to be no great objection on the part of the commercial community. The evidence in England, where figures are obtainable, goes to show that, under private deeds of arrangement, as compared with ordinary bankruptcy proceedings, dividends are larger and costs of administration less. Of the total number of insolvencies in England, including administration orders relating to deceased insolvent debtors, approximately not much more than one-half are administered in bankruptcy. The rest are dealt with by private deeds of arrangement. </para>
                    <para>South Australia, in Part XI. of the 1886 Act, re-enacted a system of compositions and assignments without insolvency. It should be observed, however, that this system., based, to some extent, on the provisions of former English Acts relating to liquidations by arrangement and compositions with creditors, was adopted before the passing of the English Deeds of Arrangement Act of 1887, and the subsequent important provisions of the English Bankruptcy Act of 1890, relating thereto, now known as the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914. Nevertheless, in 1898 Western Australia adopted this part of the South Australian Act with a few amendments, the reasons given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston,</inline> as reported in the Western Australian <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard,</inline> page 658, for its adoption being that the system had found favour in South Australia, and that the eastern colonies were anticipating altering their bankruptcy laws to fall in with those of South Australia. Some tangible reasons for the adoption of the system  were  to simplify procedure, reduce expenses to enable creditors to get control without recourse to bankruptcy proceedings, to bring deeds of assignment under the purview of the Court, and to provide for the deed of assignment being binding when signed and assented to by a proportion of creditors in number and value. The most satisfactory scheme of arrangement to secure what creditors and debtors alike demand - efficiency at a minimum of cost, no unnecessary publicity, and just so much judicial and official control as is requisite to maintain even-handed justice and to prevent fraud - will probably be found, for present purposes, by adopting, as has already been done to some extent by the State of Victoria, the English Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914, and by incorporating also the main bankruptcy provisions relating to trustees, proof of debts, property available for their payment, the effect of bankruptcy on antecedent transactions, examination of debtors, and the realization and distribution of the bankrupt's property; and by adopting Part XI. of the South Australian Bankruptcy Act 1886. Provisions to this effect have been included in the Bill in parts XI. and XII. </para>
                    <para>Chambers of Commerce and other bodies have been afforded the opportunity of making suggestions as to the proposed bankruptcy law, and I have received from South Australia a number of recommendations which will receive my very careful consideration. From what I have said, honorable senators will see that the groundwork of the Bill is the most recent legislation on bankruptcy. I have shown the difference existing in the bankruptcy legislation between the States. There is no need for the variation, which, as may be inferred from the dates of the Acts I have quoted, is due to the fact that the legislation of the States has not been kept up to date. Had the States been amending their Bankruptcy Acts they would have proceeded on the lines of the Commonwealth Bill, which may be regarded as a consolidating and amending Bill in respect of the whole of the existing Australian legislation on bankruptcy. </para>

It does not always follow, however, that the rogues succeed. I remember a case in which I was interested where a man who sold out his business put all the money into bank drafts, and left Queensland for the Old Country. He escaped before we imagined what he would do; but we made him insolvent, and ascertained on which banks in London his drafts were to mature. The result was that when he reached the Old Country he had to cable out to the creditors to allow him a few pounds with which to carry on. In the end, we obtained the full amount of our claims, and all the legal expenses were paid.; so that I do not think that gentleman will again try to evade payment of his just debts. I congratulate the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> upon the way in which he has placed this very lengthy measure before the Senate.

                            <para>- Possibly so. But the introduction of the Bill is a beginning, and if it is not passed this session it should become law next session. As far back as 1911- I was appointed a member of a sub-committee of the Rockhampton Chamber of Commerce to look through the draft of a Federal Bankruptcy Bill, and I believe that a good many of the suggestions made by that sub-committee are embodied in the present measure. When the Bill is going through Committee, I hope to offer some further suggestions that will make it more useful. Uniformity in legislation of this nature will be a great boon to the mercantile community, and to debtors and creditors generally. As has been mentioned by the Minister, the main provisions are taken from the British Acts,  That is where the title of " Bankruptcy Act " came from, although, personally, T prefer the term " Insolvency Act," possibly because people in Queensland are more used to that title. There are a good many provisions in the Queensland measure which might with advantage be included in this Bill. The Queensland Act has stood the test of nearly fifty years, and it has proved to be a monumental measure in the cases heard, and experience gained under it. It has been described as a masterpiece of legislation. </para>

                            <para>- Because experience in Australia in mercantile matters is quite different from that in the Old Country. Let us take from the English measure what is suitable to us, but let us legislate for our own requirements. In Queensland we have liquidation by arrangement. This provision gives immediate control of the assets, and it also gives control of the discharge of the insolvent for all time. There is no such provision in the Bill before us; but it would be a very great improvement if there were. </para>

                            <para>- The assignment principle which operates in Queensland is different from what is proposed in the present Bill, and it is an excellent method, especially for small traders. Another matter, that of assignments, is considered a wise provision in Queensland, but it would be an offence under this measure, and I hope that an alteration will be effected in Committee to include assignments. In sections 108 and 109 of the Queensland Act fraudulent preference is dealt with in a way that I should like to. see followed in the present Bill. The examination on oath by the trustees of debtors is not provided for in this measure. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> that it is a wise provision, and although it is not contained in the English legislation it has been found in Queensland to be of the utmost use in obtaining at an early stage necessary facts as to the assets of a debtor. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. The trustee in Queensland has power to take a debtor into his private room and cross-examine him on oath in order to obtain all the information he possibly can concerning the man's assets. An insolvent charged with offences has to be tried by special jury in Queensland, and we contend that that wise provision should be embodied in the Commonwealth law This Bill prohibits canvassing by trustees. I ask honorable senators how a trustee can be appointed at all if he does not canvass for the appointment? We should have strictly honorable men as trustees, but we should not prohibit them from canvassing for appointment. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot agree with that contention. The practice in Queensland, has been found quite satisfactory. That, however, is a comparatively small matter. This Bill does not fix the minimum remuneration for a trustee, as does the Queensland measure. There is a good deal of power, given to the Public Trustee under this proposal, but I do not favour placing estates in the hands of public trustees at all. Our experience is that they are. expensive in their administration, and that the delay occasioned in winding up estates is extreme. I prefer the tried private trustee. One of the effects of this measure will be largely to increase expenses and delay the liquidation, owing to unnecessary formalities and restrictions. I shall be able to point out this defect in detail in Committee. The Minister has stated that there are no unnecessary formalities and restrictions, but I shall show that there are, and I shall also explain that the expenses will be greater than they are in QueenslandAbove all things, we should aim at keeping down legal expenses. Perhaps some honorable senators will not agree with me in that respect. </para>

                        <para>This section provides, amongst other matters, that the first dividend, if any, shall, be declared and distributed within four months after the . conclusion of the first meeting of creditors, unless the trustee satisfies the Court that there is sufficient reason for postponing the declaration to a -later date. 'It is difficult to understand why a time should be stipulated within which to declare a first dividend, neither can we see any justification in compelling the trustee to satisfy the 'Court if a dividend has not . been declared within the time limit. . Section 152 of the Queensland Act appears to be quite adequate to -protect the interests of creditors, and, at the same time, affords the trustee an opportunity of  explaining to creditors the reason for any  undue delay in declaring a dividend. The declaration o'f a dividend is surely -a matter of interest to -the creditors only, and in withdrawing the mandate to the trustee to report to the creditors any delay the Federal Act throws on the property -of the insolvent an unwarrantable expense, because an application to the Court will almost certainly involve legal fees and expenses. </para>

                        <para>Clause 1 of this section is particularly objectionable. It coanp.els "the insolvent to  apply to . the Court . for an order of discharge,  releasing Kim from his debts whenever ordered so to do by the Court on the application of the trustee. <inline font-style="italic">Ohe</inline> insolvent's discharge is surely a matter which mostly concerns himself. Why should the trustee be asked to interfere? Section 167 of the Queensland Act deals with -.this matter more effectively than section 117 of the Federal Act. The Queensland Act provides that the insolvent may, of his own volition, apply for the. discharge, and confers on creditors certain powers if they wish to be indulgent to an insolvent, yet granting discretion to the Court in the matter, he elimination by the Federal Act of the powers of the creditors removes them from a sphere in which they are specially interested. discrimination between creditors - section 120. - We quite fail to see why there should be discrimination between creditors other than those to whom preference is granted ; but assuming discrimination to be expedient, why is it confined to cases where the liabilities of the bankrupt do not exceed £200? </para>

Small estates are frequently much more troublesome than larger ones, particularly where legal actions are found necessary, and, in the absence of a minimum fee, trustees would scarcely be- expected' to be- over zealous in the execution of their duties.

                    <para>This section, prohibits solicitation for trusteeships by. would-be trustees. This is surely inexpedient.

                    <para>Trustee shall administer all estates where neither the assets nor liabilities exceed £200.. It must be apparent that at first it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether the value of the assets of an estate will be within the limit or not. Very frequently an insolvent's statement of affairs discloses little or no property, yet through the acumen and energy of the trustee, property  of considerable value may be recovered for' the creditors. The best interests of the commercial community demand that no eBtate, however small, should be withdrawn from the ambit of the Creditors' Trustee. </para>

                    <para class="block">This, to some extent, takes the place of liquidation by arrangement and composition with, creditors as provided by Parts 9 and 10 of the Queensland Insolvency Act. Part 9 of the latter section of the Queensland Act provides a convenient method of winding up a debtor's affairs without making him . insolvent. It confers on the creditors the absolute control of their meetings, the appointment of a receiver without any application to the Court, and the debtor's discharge is entirely at their discretion;, and Part 10 provides that creditors of a debtor unable to pay his debts may, without any proceedings in insolvency, resolve that a composition shall be accepted in satisfaction of the debts due to them from the debtor. </para>

It withdraws from the creditors that control over the discharge of the debtor Which they enjoy under the provisions of Part 9 of the Queensland Act, as already referred- to. It makes no provision for the appointment of a. receiver except, by application to the Court, it gives the Court power to reject a composition or scheme if it thinks that the terms of the composition or scheme are not reasonable- or not calculated to . benefit the general, body of creditors. We fail to see why discretionary powers in these circumstances should be conferred on the Court. The- creditors are surely the best judges as" to whether a composition or . scheme is reasonable, or if it is calculated to benefit the general body of creditors. We favour the retention of Parts 9 and 10 of the Queensland Act in their entirety. </para>
                    <para>Deeds of Arrangement- Part XII. </para>
                    <para>In Queensland a debtor in financial difficulties may, with the consent of his creditors, execute a Deed of Assignment. A Deed of Assignment may be broadly defined as a contract in writing between debtor, -creditors, and Trustee, whereby the debtor agrees to assign, the whole of his assets to a trustee for the benefit of his creditors. This is the most simple and convenient method of dealing with an estate and releasing a debtor from his liabilities. It is very economical, the legal costs rarely exceeding £1 ls. It obtains the same result without the publicity or the cost of insolvency proceedings. The Federal Bill proposes to make the procedure a criminal offence if entered into outside the Act. The Act provides for assignments, but terms them Deeds ' of Arrangement. It provides a cumbersome procedure entailing expense and, most extraordinary of all, by section 201 takes from the creditors the right to fix the trustee's remuneration. The fixing of a trustee's remuneration is essentially a matter for the- creditors', seeing that the money must ultimately come from their pockets. Deeds of Assignment under Queensland conditions, should certainly be retained. </para>
                    <para class="block">Trustee. </para>
                    <para>Much of the insolvency work in this State is transacted by creditors' trustees, who are generally qualified accountants with commercial and legal experience, and who are subject to the supervision, of the Court. These trustees enjoy the esteem of the commercial community, and by their affiliations in the mercantile world, have opportunities for pursuing the inquiries sometimes necessary in this class of work, that would not be available to the officials of the Court,, who must necessarily be remote from the- main currents of business life, and-, therefore, lack access to a source from which the creditors' trustee can draw copiously. In the majority of case's, payment is by results,, with a minimum commission. The proposed Federal Act will seriously hamper the private trustee, as you will have gathered from our remarks on sections 131, 133. and 152. The control conferred by the Act is so oppressive and the requirements so onerous that we doubt very much whether private trustees will care to continue to act, and their withdrawal would certainly be a -serious loss to the commercial community. </para>

                    <para class="block">Clause 18 of the schedule specifies certain persons to whom general proxies may be given. !o provision is made in this privileged category for the public accountant who may be the creditor's auditor or financial adviser. There are very few businesses of any size these days that do . not retain a professional accountant in the latter capacity, and it is submitted that the relationship so established renders such a person with the qualifications he possesses a far better representative at creditors' meetings than some of those whose callings are specified in the clause referred to. </para>
                    <para>General. </para>
                    <para>It is a pity the new Act does not include sections 108 and 109 of the Queensland Act. These sections, which relate to fraudulent preferences, are peculiar to Queensland. Through the instrumentality of these sections, trustees have been able to recover large sums of money and property of considerable value that otherwise would not have been available to creditors. Provision should also be made for the exami nation on oath of the insolvent by the trustee as provided in the Queensland Act. Much valuable information' may thus be elicited at a minimum cost, and in many cases litigation would be avoided. All insolvents charged with offences under the Act should' undoubtedly be tried before a special jury. The above are the views of the Rockhampton Chamber of Commerce and my Association based on a rather hurried perusal of the Federal Bankruptcy Bill and comparison with the- insolvency -laws of Queensland. The short notice of the ' intention of the Federal Parliament to deal with the Bill immediately prevented a more exhaustive study of its provisions, and their consequences if an Act is passed containing such provisions. </para>

                        <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, late Chief Justice of Australia, brought in the Queensland Insolvency Act of 1874, he extended the theory of fraudulent preference by two sections, which are almost . peculiar to Queensland, namely, sections 108 and 109. These the Federal Attorney-General proposes to omit from the new Bankruptcy Bill, thereby diminishing the protection afforded to creditors by fully two-thirds. The wisdom of the late Chief Justice in inserting these sections is amply proved by the decisions given under them during the past forty-nine years. The only section retained in the new Bill is the Queensland 107, which renders voidable any payment -made or security given . with a view to giving preference to any creditor. The section as now introduced in the new Bill has an important omission; the last clause is wanting, namely, that pressure by a creditor shall not protect any transaction. This considerably weakens the efficiency of the section. Queensland section 108, which is not in the new Bill, included every transaction which was not made for a reasonable and sufficient consideration given at the time. This has been availed of by trustees in very many cases. The principal provision of Queensland section 109, which we are also to lose, rendered voidable any transaction which diminished the -property to be divided, amongst the creditors. This also has been 'the areas of recovering valuable assets for estates. It will be observed that the new section 93 for the avoidance of preferences applied only to creditors, and any person -who is not a creditor, but is a party to a fraudulent transfer of a property cannot be attacked. The Springall-Lonsdnle case affords an. excellent illustration of . the inefficiency of the proposed section. In this case, the insolvent having obtained advances against bond warrants for fictitious butter bought on credit, delivered to the defendants a large quantity of butter immediately before insolvency. This the trustee won under Queensland section 109, because it lessened the dividend payable to the creditors. There was certainly no intent to prefer Lonsdale.' The insolvent's motive was obviously very different. In another, the " Tronson " case, the insolvent transferred property to his family to . defraud his creditors, coining within Queensland sections 108 and 109, but not 107. We strongly urge our Queensland representatives, both in the Senate and House of Representatives, to press for the retention of these sections, which have stood the test of forty-nine years' experience. It is no argument against them to say they are not in the English law. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel,</inline> Griffith was capable of introducing something entirely new and desirable, which time has justified. The good faith defence is deleted, and the effect of this omission will lead to further complications. The inclusion of a preferred guarantor is an excellent point. We confess that we do not understand section No. 93-2, and the marginal reference is obviously incorrect. </para>

I am sure that, towards the end of the session, honorable senators, will complain that they have not had opportunities for doing so. We are not pressed with work at the present time, and the motion - " That the Budget-papers be printed " - will give honorable senators ample opportunity to deal extensively with the financial proposals of the Government. That will be the first business to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>.- I invite, the attention of the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to the fact that in another place the question of the erection of the nucleus of a permanent House of Parliament at Canberra, or of a provisional building, has engaged attention. So far the matter has not been discussed by the Senate. Tn effect, beyond the information to be gleaned from the report of the Public Works Committee, the Senate has no official knowledge of what has been done. If I understand the position aright, the plan submitted to the Committee did not meet with its approval, and certain amendments were suggested. I trades-stand that it has been decided by the Committee to make such an alteration that at least one end of the proposed Senate chamber should be open to the - fresh air. In this country it is not desirable to construct a chamber with corridors ail around it, and so, in effect, to imprison members of Parliament. In the Commonwealth a type of building has been developed which is distinctly Australian, and is typical of what is required. In Queensland, almost invariably, the houses have verandahs on four sides. Further south, the verandah space is curtailed to some extent. The old style of home, without any verandah provision, is confined to the extreme sou theo- /i part of the continent and to Tasmania. It is quite out of date, and altogether unsuitable for any portion of New -South Wales. I feel certain that honorable senators will not entertain for one moment the proposal as it affects the Senate chamber and the House of Representatives. In order to give honorable senators an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon this question, the amended plans of the Committee should be made available for inspection. </para>
