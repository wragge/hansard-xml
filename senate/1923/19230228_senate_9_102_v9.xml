                        <para>- Is the Leader of the Senate aware that a considerable amount of dissatisfaction exists as a result of the appointment, to the Superannuation Board, of the Public Service nominee from outside the ranks of returned soldiers? May we take it that the Government intend to adhere to the policy of preference to returned soldiers? </para>

It seems tome that we are far from having the peaceful conditions that it was hoped would emerge from the late great war, and, as Australia, is now a more important part of the Empire than ever, having been admitted to the discussion of world affairs, the new Ministers should direct their endeavours to a scheme of defence in co-ordination with that of the Mother Country. I take it that the best asset we can have in this connexion is more people, and that involves immigration. I suppose that the lines of previous policy with regard to immigration will be followed, and I hope that we shall have a  stream of desirable settlers from 'Great Britain to Australia. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I welcome that interjection; it was made to me in Cairns when I was voicing my opinion concerning immigration, and the answer I then gave was that there are plenty of avenues of employment in the Commonwealth that if filled would increase production and decrease poverty. Take cotton .growing, for example. It is an industry with which I am acquainted, and I can . conceive of none better for the employment of immigrants. The cotton crop does not take long to grow, and very little agricultural .experience is needed by those who take up the industry. People could be .brought out from the Old Country to be placed on the land to grow cotton. There are ample areas available, and there is an enormous market for the product. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the raw article. We know that the imports of cotton to Liverpool amount to something like £240,000,000 annually ; therefore, cotton-growing would not interfere with any industry that has already been established in Australia. If there were any great increase in the production of maize, or almost any other product pf a like nature, down would go the price at'once, but it would be almost impossible to bring about an over production of cotton. Employment would be afforded to the men on the land and to the people in the cities. That is my answer to the objection that immigration would increase unemployment. </para>

                </continue><para>There 'are other avenues for the profitable employment of people on the land, and "I hope that proper attention will be given to them. There is the sugar industry, that looms so largely in the minds of 'Queenslanders. It will, no doubt, receive the earnest attention of the government. I 'shall merely touch lightly upon 'the question at this stage. The  financial  importance df this industry to Queensland and the Commonwealth is -well known. The labour employed involves a wages, bill of about £6,000,'Q.OK) a year. One advantage to be gained by  bettering  the -conditions of the sugar industry, the significance of which is 'not generally recognised. is a strategical one. If anything is done that will have the effect of driving people out of the sugar industry, it will result in the depopulation of the littoral of north-eastern Queensland, a part of the continent which is of high 'strategical importance. The mastery of the Pacific -will probably some day - I hope the time ls long distant - be disputed, and then it will be highly desirable to have 'the largest possible settlement along the coast. We should, therefore, recognise the advantage of doing everything possible to encourage population in North Queensland, rather than discourage it. I hope that, whatever measures aru decided upon, they will be of such a character as to permanently stabilize the sugar industry in Queensland. </para><para>Another matter of interest, not only » to the individual States, but also to the whole Commonwealth, is the finding of markets for our meat. I understand it was the policy of the last Government to devote a sum of money to propaganda in the Old Country with a view to opening up markets there for selling our meat at a better price, and incidentally bringing the price of cattle up to a reasonable standard. It was suggested to me the other day that there are markets to which we have .given little .attention. They are the countries termed in Great Britain the Far East, but we may refer to them .as the Near North. If we can encourage the consumption of meat in the Near North, and educate its people up to -the point of consuming even a small portion of meat per week, the aggregate gain will be very considerable. We have only to consider the teeming millions in Japan, China, India, and such other countries to realize the advantage of opening up markets in their territories. 'The Government should exploit those fields, as such action would be of great advantage to the meat industry. </para><para>I -am glad to 'learn that during the life of 'this Parliament considerable improvements are to be made in, and that a good deal of attention is to be given to the work of, the Post and Telegraph  Department.  I 'believe it would be 'very  desirable  to adopt the system of wireless broadcasting, which is so prevalent in the  United  States of America. Whatever we cam do 'to make -the conditions df 'the men on the. land more 'congenial should </para><para class="block">Joe done, and 1 can conceive of nothing which would be more useful to settlers in the hack-blocks than the benefit -which would follow the wireless broadcasting of information. Although I am not conversant with the technicalities of instalment, I understand that it is an inexpensive matter to equip a home with an inside or outside receiving set. This is a matter which should be carefully considered by the Government during the present session. </para><para>I am also in favour of the State and Federal Electoral and Taxation Departments being amalgamated, as the present duplication causes a good deal of unnecessary expenditure 'and inconvenience to electors and taxpayers. In the matter of income taxation, I trust that some alteration in the present system of assessment will be made, as only a skilled mathematician can understand what is known as the curve system. I would prefer to see gradations made in such a manner that every one who ran might read. Although I am a business man of many years' experience, I cannot understand the curve system, merely because I am not a mathematician. The present system should be dispensed with and a more reasonable method adopted. </para><para>As a commercial man, may I express the hope that the long-promised Bankruptcy Bill will be dealt with during the -coming session. Honorable senators from Queensland will then have the opportunity of submitting important amendments, because certain provisions embodied in the Queensland Act have been omitted from the Federal Bill. If they were included it would be the means of improving the measure. As honorable senators are probably aware, the Queensland Act, which is regarded as a masterpiece, was drafted by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith. The Queensland Act is one which it would be hard to improve upon, and as I understand some very vital provisions in that Act have been omitted from the Commonwealth Bill, I trust we shall have an opportunity of submitting necessary amendments. </para><para>The people of Queensland are all very deeply interested in the New-State movement. In central Queensland the tripartite division of the State has been advocated, and without going into the question closely, I may say that as the project has many supporters. I trust the Government will give full opportunity for discussing this matter during the coming session, so that eventually we may be able to subdivide Queensland and other great States into workable areas under one Federal control. </para></speech>

                    <para>.- I second the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> for. the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. I also take this opportunity of personally congratulating Ministers on having launched a Government which, I hope, will have an uninterrupted, brilliant, and successful career for many years. I congratulate the- Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> He seems to possess a talisman which . secures to him a. permanent Ministerial position. The right honorable senator has held office in nearly every Commonwealth Ministry, and is a big figure in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament.  His  reputation was very materially enhanced at the Washington Disarmament Conference, and I shall not be guilty of adulatory expression when I say that he has achieved a reputation as one of the world's statesmen as well as being one of the statesmen of the Commonwealth. I also extend my congratulations to my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> who has been appointed one of the Honorary Ministers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> as we know, is one of those rugged individuals who possess a considerable amount of innate ability and talent, and, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> said in South Australia, he can be regarded as " a gift from the gods." I am sure he will not disgrace the position which he now occupies as a member of the Federal Government. The other Honorary Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> is, like myself, a man of somewhat retiring disposition. He is the Sugar King of Queensland, and what he does not. know concerning sugar is not worth knowing. No doubt he will be able to put the Government right, at any rate when the question of sugar is under discussion. While wishing the Government every prosperity and a successful career, I consider it my duty to say a few words concerning the most picturesque and romantic figure in Australian history, the pilot who weathered the storm - that little, great man, the Eight Honorable William Morris Hughes. </para>

                        <para>- He resigned his position as Leader of the Federal Government in a way which was very creditable to himself. He resigned practically against the wishes of his own party, because of his sincere and noble desire to maintain harmony and cooperation between the great anti-Labour' forces in this Parliament. He retired from the highest motives of patriotism, and in the best interests of this country. We ought, therefore, to record our high appreciation of this great man. The right honorable gentleman had no adventitious aid; he possessed neither birth, rank, nor riches. He rose from the lowest ranks of the people, and we should honour him for what he has done. I have read his career, and I believe in his early days he followed such varied avocations as- umbrella-maker, key-fitter, shearer, " rouseabout," cook, actor, organizer, school teacher, and lawyer. He has played a most distinguished part, not only in controlling the destinies of this great Commonwealth, but in impressing his supreme ability upon the greatest statesmen of the civilized world. I may be voicing only my own opinion, but I have no hesitation in saying that the two greatest statesmen in the British Empire, if not in the world, today, are <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M, Hughes. It is to be hoped that the services of the right honorable gentleman will be available to this Parliament, to this Government, and to this party. It would be a great calamity if we were to be deprived of his assistance. Although he may be temporarily eclipsed politically I do not think the right honorable gentleman cau be regarded as a back number. I believe he will come again, and will yet figure very prominently in the history of Australia and of the Empire. </para>

I believe the Bruce-Page Government have commenced in accordance with the best principles of constitutional law and practice. Whilst the people did not commit themselves to either the Country; the National, or the Labour party, their vote was a distinctly anti-Labour one. The people wanted an anti-Labour Government; They did not mind whether it comprised certain members of the Country party and certain members of the National party, but they gave the representatives of those two parties a clear majority, and left it to the good sense and discretion of this Parliament to see that the two parties came together and formed an harmonious body. </para>

                <para>It seems that the voice of the people was expressed very emphatically in favour of economy, and I trust that this Government will see that economy is the fundamental principle underlying its policy. I am very glad to see that economy is already being practised, particularly in the use of motor cars. I know from personal experience that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> who is the arch apostle of economy, if it is within his power, will see that economy is practised in every direction. I might remind the Government of the Scotch proverb : " Many a mickle makes a muckle." If economy is practised in small matters such as the use of motor cars, there are so many directions in which there has been that waste, the Government will be able to save hundreds of thousands of pounds as the months and years go by. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. How can we compete against Lord Inverf orth and Lord Inchcape? It is impossible. When we have an opportunity of examining the accounts, we will find that our venture into the shipping business has been disastrous. I am quite as ignorant of the exact position of affairs as are other honorable senators, but I feel convinced that when we learn the facts we will be alarmed. The Commonwealth Shipping Line is surrounded with all sorts of difficulties. Our sailors and stewards are continually raising objections against their conditions, and putting obstacles in the way of the successful running of the fleet. </para>

                        <para>- Itwasnot a joke; the railway will prove of great advantage to the people of the Commonwealth. I remindSenator Foll that when Napoleon sold the Louisiana territory to the United States of America for  £3,000,000, the people of America railed and stormed, saying that they had been victimized. As a matter of fact, the price paid was a fleabite compared with the worth of that country today ; "£300,000,000 would not represent its present value. The transfer of that territory conferred upon the people of America one of the greatest possible boons. </para>

I do not know how many there were in the Louisiana territory; there could not have been smany. It was a huge expanse of little explored but rich territory. The Northern Territory of Australia possesses metals and minerals of every description. it is capable . of growing cotton, tobacco, sugar - in fact, everything which will grow in a tropical country - and of carrying large numbers of sheep, cattle, and horses! One of 'the terms of the contract between South Australia and the Commonwealth Government is that the Northern Territory railway shall be completed. We -ask the Commonwealth Government to carry out their part of the bargain, as we are being asked to carry out the contract to remove the Federal Capital to Canberra. </para>
