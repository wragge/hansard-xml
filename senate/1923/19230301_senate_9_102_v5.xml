            <para>SenatorMcDOUGALL.- I ask the Leader of the Senate whether he is in a position to explain what appears to me to he a departure from precedent in connexion with the proceedings yesterday on the opening of Parliament? I noticed that no member of the Governor-General&#39;s staff on that occasion appeared in the uniform of the Black Watch, and I should like to know whether that was merely accidental or was intended. as an insult to Scotland ? </para>

                            <para>. - I objected to this motion being treated as formal because I wish the Senate to have an opportunity of determining the practice which it ought to follow in regard to the appointment of thisCommittee as well as the Library and the House and Printing Committees. In the appointment of members to serve on the Joint Public WorksCommittee and Joint Committee of Public Accounts we had a precedent in the practice followed last session, and I hold that appointments to the Committees I have just mentioned should be in exactly the same position. An honorable senator who was unsuccessful in the recent election, but who retains his position until the end of June, should hold his place on these Committees until this successor takes his seat in this Chamber and has an opportunity of voting upon the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of these several Committees. If we proceed to-day with these appointments we shall exclude, for instance, the successors of Senators Buzacott, Henderson, and myself from any say in the matter. </para>

                            <para>-That is so. The term &#34; this session &#34; is very indefinite., and, so far as appointments to these Committees are concerned, we ought to establish the precedent that the successors of defeated senators should have some say in them, because the new senators will have to abide by the decisions of these Committees. Most of us do not attach a very great deal of importance to the positions, but, nevertheless, we should not prevent recently-elected honorable senators from having some say in their appointment. I admit that there is a difference of opinion as to what our proper attitude should be. This matter was first threshed out in another place, and I think we would be well advised if we adopted the procedure followed in the appointment of the Public Works and Public Accounts Committees, namely, allow defeated senators to continue to hold their places on them until the new senators take their seats in this Chamber. </para>

                            <para>. - Senator de Largie has brought forward a. matter that is well worthy of careful consideration. We have to recollect that the elections were held earlier than was expected, and that certain honorable senators who were defeated at the polls will, under the Constitution, retain their seats until the expiration of the present financial year. In order that no injustice may be done to those senators who, unfortunately, were defeated, and who perhaps may feel that they are not being treated courteously by being left off these Committees, I move as an amendment - </para>

                            <para>- It is not in order to proceed in this matter by way of amendment. If any honorable senator is dissatisfied with the names proposed, the proper course is to demand a ballot. If any member demands a ballot, his demand must be conceded, and the appointments made in that way. If honorable senators will read the Standing Orders dealing with the appointment of Select Committees, which govern also the appointment of these Sessional Committees, he will find that these bodies must consist of seven members. The honorable senators to serve on a Committee should be nominated by the mover of the motion for its appointment ; but, if any senator so demands, they must be selected by ballot. I suggest, therefore, that rather than move an amendment, the proper course for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> to take is to demand a ballot. </para>

                                <para>-  I point out that, the Minister having moved a motion, it has become the property of the Senate, and must be disposed of in one way or another. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> were to accept the suggestion of the Minister and withdraw his amendment, it would not lesser in any degree his right afterwards to demand the taking of a ballot. The proper course would be for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> to withdraw his amendment, reserving his right to ask for the taking of a ballot when the motion had been disposed of. </para>

                            <para>.  - I do not remember an occasion since I entered this Chamber on which a course has been adopted similar to that which is being adopted now. When new senators have been coming in after an election, the appointment of Sessional Committees has been deferred until they had taken their places in this Chamber. The new senators should be afforded the opportunity of. taking part in the appointment of the Committees under which the Senate will have to transact its business. If that procedure is not followed, we shall be depriving the new senators of any say in the matter. The senators who have been on these Committees should be allowed to hold their positions until their successors are appointed, otherwise the. Senate is practically passing a motion of no-confidence in them, and is not giving them any thanks for the services which they have rendered. In 1913, the Sessional Committees were appointed shortly after we entered the Senate. After the succeeding election I was appointed a member of the Printing Committee. Some senators who have been on these Committees are still members of the Senate, and, unless they had done any wrong, it would be an act of discourtesy not to allow them to continue as members. I know that it is not the  intention of  the Senate to act discourteously towards them. Let these men complete their terms. </para>

As has already been&#39; pointed out, certain senators who have been successful at the recent elections will take their seats after 30th June; but it must be remembered that those who were defeated then are members of the Senate until July. I believe the practice in the past has been to appoint fresh Committees after the new senators have taken their seats. I do not know whether the Government intend to allow these Committees to lapse when the present session ends. </para>

                            <para>. - I am somewhat reluctant to speak  on  this matter, although I feel very strongly concerning the position which has arisen.

Millen)</inline> sent for mo to discuss the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of Committees. I was then the only member .of the Opposition entitled to act on paid Committees. </para>

                                <para>- I did not do so; but although I disagree with and dislike the arrangement, I considered it better to remain silent. The unfortunate position is that the elections take place at the wrong time of the year. Just as difficulties have arisen in connexion with the appointment of Committees at this stage, grave constitutional difficulties are likely to present themselves again when elections are held and Parliament called together before some of the new senators can take their places. What is happening now is likely to occur in the future. If greater support had been given to the Labour party, and that party had obtained a majority in  another place, practically all the business of a Government; comprised of members of the Labour party could be held up by representatives in the Senate who have been defeated at the elections. I do not wish to say anything harsh, but constitutionally it is a very unwise position in which to place a Parliament. The general elections should be held as near as possible to the date on which newly-elected senators can take their seats. The Government are in a position to do as they wish. We all have our rights, and even defeated senators have as much right constitutionally to speak at this stage as I have. I shall exercise my right to speak until the last day I am a member of the Senate. In view of the peculiarities surrounding the appointment of Committees, I think we should allow the matter to pass. </para>

                            <para>. - The Government do not wish to act discourteously towards any members of the Senate. The position has arisen in this way : It is the desire of the Government to give the Opposition representation on these Committees, and every honorable senator will concede that the Opposition, although small in numbers at present, has a right to representation. To make that possible, it became necessary to exclude certain honorable senators who were members of Committees during the last session. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. If representation is to be given to the Opposition on these Committees, some names have to be omitted. Honorable senators appear to, be making a storm in a tea-cup, and, seeing that the present session will not last more than two or three weeks, the members of the Committees which we now propose to elect will hold office only for that time. Surely during that period the Opposition have a right to representation on the Committees. When we considered the names which had to be omitted we naturally excluded those whose term will end in June. Honorable senators are aware that no great honour or publicity is attached to membership of these bodies. I have been a member of the Senate for a very long time, and have noticed that senators who have been defeated have generally shown a disposition to be free from parliamentary work because they are reshaping and adjusting their private affairs. It naturally appeared to me that those senators who will not be with us after the middle of the year would prefer to be free fromCommittee service. Some honorable senators have referred with solicitude to those who are to take their places in July. We are not interfering with their rights in the slightest degree. When we meet again in June or July, we shall commence a fresh session, and understanding order No. 33 new Sessional Committees will be appointed.. The new senators will, in July, have a free hand in the selection of the members to form these Committees for the : new session. I ask honorable senators to accept this explanation. As I have said, I had no wish, in submitting these names, to be discourteous to any one. The Opposition has certainly a right to two members on . these Committees, which consist of seven members. But as these are merely sessional Committees, they will exist only during the session, that is, for not more than a week or two. In view of these facts, I ask honorable senators to allow these motions to pass as they stand. </para>

                            <para>. - In addressing myself to the question  before  the Senate, I may commence by noting: the business like manner in which! the mover- and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply dealt with the Opening Speech.- I have heard a very great number of opening speeches from Governors-General, but I cannot remember one in connexion, with which the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply were- so much at a loss, for material as. they were on this occasion. Senators Thompson, and Benny, therefore, have my congratulations upon having made, good in submitting an Address-in-Reply to an opening speech of which very little use could be made.  It is interesting to note, that after delaying the meeting of Parliament to the extreme limit of the constitutional period at which it should be called together,.  His  Excellency&#39;s advisers1 have no programme to1 put before us. That is astonishing. Perhaps my mind- suggests evils which may not arise,, but it appears  to  me that we may be entering upon a period when Parliament will be scrapped altogether. To-day. we had the Minister answering a question put with regard to the- disposal of one of the most valuable and useful enterprises which the Commonwealth has ever entered into: I refer to the Woollen Mills. The Govern- . ment were asked whether. Parliament would be given, an opportunity of discussing the matter before the proposed sale of the Woollen Mills was completed, and the Minister,, in answering the question, emphatically said &#34; No.&#34; For a Government that has met Parliament without any programme to proceed to sell such an industrial concern as the Commonwealth. Woollen. Mills before they have been sufficiently long. in. office to estimate the advantage the mills have been to the people&#39; of this country, and to say at the same time that Parliament is- not to be given an opportunity to discuss the matter, indicates to my mind that the powers of Parliament are departing from it. What is the history of these mills.? The Prime Minister of the day,- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew-</inline> Fisher, and, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> were in England -when -the Labour Government determined to enter upon the manufacture of woollen materials. Applications!1 were called for the position of manager of the proposed woollen mills, and  a,  gentleman of the- highest qualifications was selected for the- position. He was immediately put on the books, of the. Commonwealth. and was- given instructions to visit the mills of Great Britain to inspect for himself and decide upon the most suitable and&#39; up-to-date machinery for the work he was to be. called upon to carry out. He came to this country, . having&#39; ordered the machinery he required. He went from one end of the Common- c wealth to the other to1 select the most suitable site for the establishment of the mills. In course of. time they began operations, and, as one who knows-,. I say that those mills- saved this country hundreds of thousands .of pounds during the war. I can remember that on. one occasion there was a demand for higher prices for materials required for  soldiers1&#39; overcoats and uniforms. I received a deputation of mill-owners; and I can remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smale,</inline> the thea manager of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, met those gentlemen and  checked;  their statements as to costs of manufacture. He was able to effectively answer all that they had to say by quoting .the prices -at which he was turning out material. Demands for increased prices  &#34;were cut down because if- was known that we could produce the articles ourselves. One of the mill-owners who was a member of the deputation to which I refer, and which I received as an Assistant Minister, complimented me on the possession of a man of such efficiency and capacity as manager of the Woollen Mills. As a matter of fact, his qualifications were so attractive to these gentlemen that he was given a better position than that which he . occupied under the Commonwealth. I venture to say that had the Commonwealth Government been desirous of maintaining the efficiency of the mills they would not have lost the services of that gentleman. </para>

                    <para>We talk of scrapping the Harness Factory and scrapping the- Woollen Mills, in the name of economy. When they are scrapped we will still have to provide harness and clothing. Where, then, does the economy come in ? I know there is a feeling against the Government conduct- . ing these enterprises. Why does it &#39;exist ? <inline font-style="italic">K</inline> could understand the feeling if there was evident a similar objection to the Government using public funds to assist private people in carrying on industries. There is not sufficient feeling of that kind to prevent the Commonwealth Government from spending millions of money every year in assisting private manufacturers and producers. By the Tariff and Excise duties it has imposed, this Parliament levies upon the people  taxation to the extent of &#163;30,000,000 a year to give aid to manufacturers and  producers of this country to carry on the industries in which they are engaged. Millions of pounds have been, voted by the Senate and in another place to assist private manufacturers and producers; and there is no complaint made of extravagance on this account. But when it is proposed that we should spend a few thousand pounds in establishing industries ourselves to provide materials required by the people of this country, serious objection is raised, although the charges of waste and extravagance cannot be borne out by a reference to the results from these Commonwealth-controlled industries. </para>
                    <para>I may &#39;set an example in dealing with these matters which may not be as commendable  as  that set by the business-like speeches of the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply, but I know they will excuse me.  They  referred indirectly to the question &#39; of immigration. We want people in this country. Having seen a little of other parts of the world, I know- that this country can carry 100,000,000 people. But if those who talk about desiring immigration were in earnest, do honorable senators not think that they would adopt the  simple  method of arranging with the working classes of this country from one end of Australia to the other to offer no objection to people of suitable character coming to fill our vacant  spaces  &#39;? </para>

                        referred to the greatState which  he has the honour to represent and its suitability for the growth of cotton. I am not a Queenslander, but I rarely speak of Queensland in this chamber or anywhere else without expressing my astonishment at its unlimited possibilities. I regard it as a State possessing the richest sugar-growing land in the world; and I dare say that.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline>
                        who has a knowledge of the matter, will claim, that it has land equally valuable for the production of cotton. &#34; If the production of cotton in Queensland becomes as successful as we all hope it will, I . am wondering whether when the industry is being carried on profitably under conditions so favorable, the rest of us who 3o not inhabit such a big, rich, fertile tract of country will be called upon to do what we are asked to do for those engaged in the industry carried on on the rich sugar lands of Queensland. Will the people who grow wheat under most difficult conditions in New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia be called , 1 upon out of their hard earnings to subsidize the people who grow 0 cotton in Queensland ? I hope_ that the industry will be self-supporting, and that when &#39;it comes into existence the hat will not be . passed round amongst the&#39; people of the other States to keep it. going. We have had an agreement in connexion with the sugar industry for some years; and with regard to that I will say that any agreement with reference to sugar that will assure  .to the producer of sugar a full and ample return for his labour I will gladly support, but any agreement which &#34;will . increase the- price of sugar to those who use it merely to add to the profits of the sugar companies I will oppose.

Sugar is grown in New South Wales as well as in Queensland. What is happening? Is the grower getting the benefit of the high price, or is the chief benefit being derived by the speculator in sugar? In glancing through the share list I see that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s shares, which were originally valued at &#163;20, are quoted at from &#163;40 to &#163;43 on the Stock Exchange. Has the increase in value assisted the grower to any extent ? </para>

                            <para>- I shall leave that comparison to the Minister. War bonds have been issued upon the security of the Commonwealth credit, and I venture to say that the market value of &#163;100 bonds ranges from &#163;95 to &#163;97 12s. 6d., and, where it is higher than that, it is due to the fact that interest has already accrued and will soon be paid; but sugar shares that cost originally &#163;100 will fetch at least &#163;200 on the market. The mover of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply said he was a business man. Business men of ability will be of value to the Senate. But is it a business proposition to tax the people generally to keep the price of sugar at twice its value, for the benefit of the holders of sugar stock ? </para>

                            <para>- I quite understand that the value has been gradually increasing, but I think the price of &#163;43 reached about a fortnight ago represents approximately the high-water mark. The company creates the increase in value by the enormous profits it is making. That its shares have risen from &#163;20 to &#163;40 shows that its profits are too large, and the tax upon the people is too heavy. </para>

                        (New South Wales),  Deputy  Leader of the Labour party, some time ago warned SirE. Johnson of a move against him, and offered him Labour&#39;s support, but he declined to have the office trafficked in.
                    </para>
                    <para>I have never offered <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliot</inline> Johnson the support of Labour. I had heard the rumour of a bargain that had been made with regard to the Speakership, and incidentally I may say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> with respect to removing you from your position. I admit having had an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliot</inline> Johnson, whom I asked if it was true that he was leaving the Speaker&#39;s chair, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> was to take the position. This interview occurred last Friday. The late  Speaker  denied all knowledge of such an arrangement and assured me that it was not true. I told him with a good deal of warmth of the trafficking not only in Ministerial positions, but for the highest offices in Parliament. In my indignation I may have said that I had no vote in the other House, but that, if I had one, nobody engaged in the business of bargaining for those positions would receive support from me. I desired him to confirm the rumour that I had heard - for it was only a. rumour. I do not consider it fair for me to be held up as one who bargained to keep <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliot</inline> Johnson in the Chair. I had no authority from my party to do that. I merely approached the late  Speaker  to ask him if it was a fact that ho was being turned down. He was quite surprised at the suggestion. He could not believe that the party that had sustained him for so long was going to cast him aside, so he discredited the statement I made to him as to the disreputable bargaining said&#39; to be proceeding outside of&#39; Parliament. </para>
                    <para>I should like to recall the election results, and consider what has happened since we last met. Fortunately for. myself I was a spectator at the election from the safe dugout of a seat that lasts for three more years. Under those circumstances. I could take a calm view. In many respects the recent election was quite remarkable. At. the beginning, we had as Primer Minister the gentleman whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Benny</inline> referred to as the great little man who had piloted the ship of State through dangerous shoals. I have been associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> for many years&#39;, and perhaps frequently I have been sorry that the heat of my words has not been warranted by the events that have transpired, but I have not lived long enough to be sorry for words that have expressed the indignation that I feel. On the two occasions on which I was a defeated candidate in New South Wales, I nursed the belief that those were the two occasions when I particularly deserved to be elected. To my colleagues of the old times I am not going to be hypocrite enough to pretend that I would like to see them taking the places they previously occupied, tut there is no bitterness on my part towards them if they conscientiously believe that the stand they took was for their country&#39;s good. When they stood with the </para>
                    <para class="block">Nationalists they were applauded, but now that the turn of the Nationalists is finished, they have been thrown aside like a sucked orange. They served their party in its time of need, and yet they have been turned down from one end of. Australia to the other. To my mind that is. the meanest aspect of the whole of the recent Federal election. The crowning act of meanness of the party in power was committed when they drove from the highest office in the Commonwealth the great little man who had piloted their ship through troubled waters for so many years. </para>

I knew, and of course he knew, too, that that was the only hope he had in those Labour districts of getting a following strong enough to win the election. The paraphernalia of the late Prime Minister and of his following, consisting of motor cars piled high with travelling bags and other impedimenta, reminded me of some circus or menagerie But the campaign was. a strenuous and remarkable one. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> would address a-  meeting at 10 o&#39;clock in the morning, have a 30-mile run, address another meeting&#39; at noon, snatch a hurried lunch, speak again at 3 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, and travel a considerable distance to address his chief meeting at night somewhere else. I know of no other man who could have conducted such a parliamentary campaign and finished so strongly as the former Prime Minister. But what happened? Ho is now being applauded by the press and every one else for the crowning act of his life, and that was &#34; getting out.&#34; He bore the brunt of the fight. During the recent election he led his forces in places where it was not easy to lead them. I remind honorable senators that he was not &#34; doing &#34; Collins-street in immaculate dress, including spats, attracting the attention of all passers-by. On the contrary, he was out in the back country conducting one of the most strenuous campaigns in the history of the Commonwealth. As a good Australian, my blood boils at the treatment meted out to men who at one time were members of the party to which I still belong. They served the Nationalist party in their hour of need. Their treatment by that organization calls to mind the reward meted out by the Egyptians to one who saved them from famine - they used him wisely in their hour of need, and rewarded him by the enslavement of his kin. The Nationalists, I repeat, used their leader while it suited them, and rewarded him in a manner that must redound to their everlasting discredit. </para>

I regret very much that that course was not followed, and it is my intention to quote constitutional authorities in support of my view. I know that honorable senators will bear with me if I quote authorities at some length, because I desire to deal seriously with the constitutional aspect of the position. My idea of a constitutional Government is a Cabinet responsible to Parliament, and a Parliament responsible to the people. The only way in which a Government may be properly brought into existence is by the best set of men elected by the people coming together in agreement upon opinion, and selecting a Committee of the Parliament to govern in a constitutional manner. Heretofore, in Australia - if I am wrong I invite the Leader of the Senate to correct me - high-minded men have observed this ideal of constitutional government. They have not hawked, bargained, intrigued, or huxtered for positions. We have never previously had an experience like the present in the history of Australia, and I think honorable senators will search the annals of British parliamentary government in vain for records of Ministers offering positions of preferment and emolument, and negotiating with others in an underground and, secret manner in order to get together a body of men to govern this country. That, to my way of thinking, is the reverse of constitutional government. </para>

                            <para>-I am speaking in general terms. In my judgment, the plain duty of the late Prime Minister, when the election was over, and the returns were sufficiently advanced to show that his Government had been defeated, was to summon Parliament, in order that the future government of this country should be determined in a constitutional manner. I believe it is the duty of the advisers of the King&#39;s representative here not to put him in an invidious position. Any arrangements that were necessary to insure the future government of the Commonwealth could better have been carried out on the floor of the House, where everything could have been done openly, and no one allowed to spread rumours and create suspicion as to how this man was induced to come in and the other man suddenly left out. It is admitted that all the incidents associated with the constitution of the present Government were somewhat remarkable, and the more one looks at them the more one ia surprised at the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Cabinet. &#34;When the arrangements had been completed, the press asked for my opinion, and I stated  that  there were three surprises. There was surprise, for instance, at the inclusion of men who never thought they would get there; there was surprise that certain gentlemen who wore regarded as certainties were not included; but the greatest surprise of all was that caused to some members of the Government, who did not know how it happened. This, I think, can be said of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Wilson,  who now finds &#39;  himself  sitting alongside of, and supporting, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> During the whole of the time I have known the honorable senator, I have never regarded him as a man who was taking politics seriously. As Leader of the Opposition, very often I found him exceedingly useful in opposition, particularly to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I generally thought of him as belonging to that sporting class  of men who think that a little &#34; scrap &#34; does not matter very much. I believe that, hitherto, his attitude has been that he was not in this chamber to support any Government, and that it was not his business particularly to support the  gentleman  who is now his&#34; Leader, and from whom, I have no doubt, he will gain a little wisdom. </para>

I confess that for some time I was puzzled as to how I  should address the Senate in this debate, and say  something  about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> with whom, of course, I am on very friendly terms; but, fortunately, during his recent visit to Adelaide, the Prime Minister came to my assistance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Bruce  knew, of course, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> had no parliamentary qualifications for office, but his inclusion in the Cabinet, even at the sacrifice of another member with a long parliamentary record, was necessary to bring about the coalition. The Prime Minister, I repeat, recognised that, and when he endeavoured to explain to the people of South Australia why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foster</inline> had been left out and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> included, he said, &#34;Look at his flashing eye and his rugged exterior.

But there is one thing I am sure of, and that is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> is young enough to learn something about parliamentary government.  He is under&#34; an able tutor when he is under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce;</inline> I have sat in the same position. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> with experience .and years, will develop those qualities which other members of this Senate have developed, and notwithstanding which they have been overlooked in the allotting of portfolios. I hope that he will develop those qualities rapidly. T hope that, that light touch - so pleasant, sporting, and entertaining - will give way to the more serious, thoughtful, and dignified manner of a&#34; Minister weighted with the responsibilities of participating in the government of this country.

I am not unmindful of the fact that to aspire to the highest office in this -Commonwealth is an ambition with which every man may be imbued, even though he fails to achieve it. The only regret I have is that while my colleagues and I were in office there was only one question that mattered - the winning of the war. We were not concerned as to whether we could survive for a session, or as to the success or otherwise of negotiations for the formation of a Government. Our sole concern was whether Australia and the Empire were going to live. </para>

                    <para>Let us look seriously at the question of the formation of a Government. The constitutional aspect presupposes that those who accept office have the confidence and the support, not only of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives, but also of the people in the country. Do those conditions obtain today? Has any gentleman the right - I do not care if he wears spats four times as big as those which are worn by the Prime Minister - not possessing the first requisite for the position of Prime Minister, to form a Government in the circumstances in which the present Government was formed <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> He has not, I made some remarks, that some people might consider were rude, with regard to the position. I still may have something rude to say if I am allowed by the  President  to say it. </para>
                    <para>I have here a number of opinions regarding the formation of Governments. I will go back to the occasion when representatives of &#39; the press interviewed me as I was coming out hurriedly from a meeting. They informed me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> had been sent for. I said, very indignantly, that I refused to believe that such a thing had occurred. They assured me that, it was so. &#34; Well,&#34; .t said, &#34; if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> has been sent for it is an outrage on constitutional procedure.&#34; Let us look at what constitutional procedure is. Some people claim that similar occurrences to that to which I am referring have happened frequently in the past. T. claim that this is the first occasion - and I challenge any one to produce another - on which a defeated Minister, a member of a party which has been defeated in the country,  has been sent for and entrusted with the duty of forming a Government. </para>

                        <para>Some people imagine that the advice of the retiring . Prime Minister must be accepted by the Governor-General in Australia, or by the King in England. That is not the case. - A change of Government is one of the occasions on which the Governor-General or the King is absolutely at liberty to use his own judgment. I think there are some writers who claim that another occasion is when a dissolution has been advised. Some people think that the outgoing Ministry or the outgoing Premier has the right to advise the Governor-General or the King. I will give a quotation which expresses the position much more effectively and much more clearly than I can express it. These . extracts are taken from <inline font-style="italic">Fifty Tears in the Making of</inline><inline font-style="italic">Australain</inline><inline font-style="italic">History,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes.

                            <para>There seems to be an opinion abroad, apparently received without inquiry, that it is a constitutional practice for a Minister retiring from office to advise the Crown as to his successor. Whether the representative of the Crown in this Colony has at any time permitted such practice, I do not intend to say, but it is known that on some occasions no such advice has been given or sought, and it is undeniably the fact that nothing of the kind has over occurred in modern times between retiring Ministers in England and the Sovereign. It will occur to the mind of any person capable of reasoning on the subject that it would he a logical absurdity for a Minister who has forfeited his position as adviser of the Crown, by the tender of his &#39;resignation of office, still to be permitted to advise as to the person who is to be his successor. Having himself failed to obtain the support of Parliament in his Ministerial capacity, how can ho be the right person to advise who is likely to succeed in securing that indispensable support in the government of the country? Having, as Minister, passed outside the boundary within which he can be held responsible -to Parliament for his advice (for by his resignation he has paid the utmost penalty which Parliament can exact), is he then to advise, without responsibility, on the momentous question of the formation of another Government? </para>

When I was compelled to abandon that hope (my sense of the coming evil remaining the same), I took the earliest opportunity, consistent with a sense of duty and of public honour, of tendering my resignation to the Queen, and leaving  Her  Majesty the full opportunity of consulting other advisers. I offered no opinion as to the choice of a successor. That is almost the only act which is the personal act of the Sovereign; it is for the Sovereign to determine in whom her confidence shall be placed.&#34; (Hansard <inline font-style="italic">Debates,</inline> volume1xxxiii., page 1004.) </para>

                            <para>The English system of government does not, as is sometimes fancied, go of itself. It is not an automatic contrivance, nor an engine which a child may feed or tend. To discern the real meaning of popular or parliamentary contests, to act as the interpreter of the national mind, to select its truest representatives, and to give effect to its will are offices involving grave responsibility and calling for more than ordinary intelligence and judgment. To do these things is part of the business of an English monarch. Constitutional Kings and Queens cannot but have, like humbler people, their own political opinions and personal preferences. The high impartiality and the controlling sense of public duty which, amid the changes of partyGovernments,have for a generation kept the private feelings of the Sovereign in abeyance, deserve record and honour. <inline font-style="italic">(Daily News,</inline> 5th December, 1868.) </para>

                            <para>We know from an unimpeachable source the patriotic view which the reigning Sovereign has always taken of her duty on the occasion of a change of Ministry The wise and lamented Prince who was her dearest adviser in life has told us how scrupulously Queen Victoria guards herself from any personal feeling or any consideration in conflict with the feeling of her Parliament and her people in selecting her First Minister. Speaking in the House of Lords on the death of the Prince Consort EarlRussell said - &#34; I happen to know from the late Prince . himself the view he took of the duty of the Sovereign in such a case. He stated to me not many months ago that it was a common opinion that there was only one occasion on which the Sovereign of this country could exercise a decided power and that was in the choice of the First Minister of the Crown. The Prince went on to say that, in his opinion, that was not an occasion on which the Sovereign could exercise a control or pronounce a decision ; that when a Minister had retired, from being unable to carry on the Government, there was at all times some other party which was prepared to assume the responsibility of office, and was most likely to obtain the confidence of the country. But, he said, a transfer having been made, whether the Minister was of one party or the other, he thought that the Sovereign ought to communicate with him in the most confidential and unreserved manner with respect to the various measures to be brought forward, the fortunes of the country, and the events that might happen - that, whether he belonged to one party or another, the utmost confidence should prevail between the Sovereign and the Minister, who came forward in Parliament as the ostensible possessor of power.&#34; <inline font-style="italic">(HansardDebates,</inline> volume clxv., page 44.) </para>

He continued -  <inline font-style="italic">&#34;I</inline> do, mO. Lords, attribute in great measure to that opinion which the Sovereign held in common with the Prince, the fact that there has been no feeling of bitterness among any party in this country arising from exclusion, and that all parties during the past twenty years have united in rendering that homage to the Sovereign which the conduct of Her Majesty has so well1 deserved, and the country still reaps the benefit of the good counsel which the Prince Consent gave to the Crown.&#34; (Hansard <inline font-style="italic">Debates,</inline> volume clxv., page -14-.) </para>

I am not pretending to belittle the difficulties. An important situation had to be met; but I do not think that, grave as the obstacles were, there was any justification for setting out on a new course. The question should have been settled on the floor of  the House, and  His  Majesty&#39;s repre- . sentative relieved of the situation in which he was placed. The quotation continues - tt has become n recognised convention that in the event of an adverse verdict being given at the polls at a general election, the previous Ministry will resign immediately, and will not wait for a vote of confidence to be passed by the new House of Commons. This is expressed by saying that at a general election the continuance of the Ministry in office depends upon the goodwill of the electorate, and no longer upon the goodwill of the House of Commons. The Cabinet is responsible collectively to Parliament for advice given to the Crown in the conduct of the Executive, and this means that the Ministry must resign if the House of Commons passes a vote o&#163; want of confidence in the Government. </para>

The House of Commons cannot dismiss a Minister of whose acts it- disapproves; it cannot even&#39; formally censure him, unless it is prepared to get rid of all his colleagues as well. Now, as a rule, that is just what the House - &#60; that is to say, the majority of the House - is most reluctant to do. If it censures the Ministry, it practically censures itself. If it con- &#39; signs it to &#39;defeat at the polls, it is, of course, depriving a considerable number of its own members of their seats. It is absurd &#39;to suppose  that the House of Commons - even the party majority - approves every action of every member of a Committee of some twenty Ministers or .more over a space of four or five years. But very rarely indeed&#39;&#39; does it express its disapproval in the only fashion for which a Premier need care, that is, by a hostile division on a point of real importance, or an unfavorable vote in Supply.

A vote of &#34;censure by the country is more far-reaching than a similar vote recorded in the House of Representatives.

On the one hand, while each Minister is an adviser of the Crown, the Cabinet is an unity, and none of its members Can advise as an individual, without,&#34; or in opposition, actual or presumed, to his colleagues. As a rule, the resignation of the First Minister, as if removing the bond of cohesion in the Cabinet,, has the effect of dissolving it. </para>

                            <para>Each member of the Ministry, therefore, is responsible for all the proceedings of the Ministry; and in like manner the collective Ministry is bound by the acts of each of its members.  . . The distinctive characteristic of the Cabinet, and the feature which is essential to its successful and complete operation, is its political unity. The Cabinet is not an ordinary Board. It is literally a partnership of Privy Councillors for administering the Government. . If it fail or if it succeed, its failure or sucecss is that of the collective body. Whatever internal difficulties it may have, its voice and its action are single. If one of its members commit any error or become involved in any difficulty, the blame attaches not to him only, but to all those who either actually concurred in his views&#39; or at least authorized him to act on their behalf. It is needless to say that under our existing system a retiring Ministry gives way at once, and in a body, to its successor. </para>

Second to be vacant, they did not seek to justify the act by any theories of the rights of resistance of by any doctrines of the rights of man. It was enough that, 800 years before, the Estates of the Realm had declared the throne of Richard the Second to be vacant. By thus walking in the old paths, by thus hearkening to the wisdom of our forefathers, we have been able to change whenever change has been needed, and we have been kept back from changing out of the mere love of abstract theory. We have thus been able to advance, if somewhat slowly, yet the more surely, and when we have made a false step we have been able to retract it. On this last power - the power of undoing whatever has been done amiss - I wish specially to insist. In tracing the steps by which our Constitution has grown into its present shape, I shall try especially to show in how many cases the best acts of modern legislation have been, wittingly or unwittingly, a falling back on the principles of our earliest times. </para>

No precedents are to be found anywhere that bear upon what has happened here. I do not believe that if the records of Great Britain for a hundred years were searched a man could be found who accepted office under the conditions under which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> accepted office. I want to touch on the aspect of this business from the point of view, shall I say of &#34;playing the game&#34;. I have read quotations to show how an Englishman loves a precedent. I am an Australian, the son of Australians, but I think that the desire to keep to the safe path is as strong in me as it is in any Englishman. I love the beaten track; and I do not like the short cut which leads I do not know where. To follow such a course may lead to disastrous consequences; and that may be the result here. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable senators opposite are always warning me about the way in which I may be dealt with in my own party. I want to say that, speaking justly, my own party ought to have dealt with me on many occasions. When an Australian delegate was going to America. I expressed my pleasure, and I was then told that some of them would deal with me. I take these risks. If the Trades and Labour Council are likely to deal with me because I prefer to stick to precedent, and to proceed along the old beaten track on which the liberties which they and I enjoy have been gained, I say to them and to all others that Parliament is an institution which has been built up by upright men, guided by honorable principles. The changes advocated by men who contend that our parliamentary institutions are obsolete will find very few supporters amongst those who desire to keep up the standard of honour in this country. </para>

                        <para>Let me sec whether the election was fought as Senators Thompson and Benny have contended. I hope I am not misrepresenting them, but they seemed to think that the present Government is constitutionally in office, because the real issue before the electors was- Labour <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> antiLabour. No such issue was ever put to the country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page could not be induced to agree for one minute on what the issue was. On the eve of the elections <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was said to have held out the olive branch to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page. If there was to be a union of the two parties ordinary decency, not to say- honorable conduct, would suggest that that was the time for the two parties to be brought together. They were going, to their masters, the people, and if they intended to coalesce, they should have said, &#34; Let us do it in the light of day, and. face the people with a united programme, and ask them for their verdict.&#34; That was not done. But no- sooner were the- elections- over than <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, in returning thanks for his election, said that one thing- which the Country party had done was to intercept the pendulum of public opinion and prevent it -from swinging altogether to the Labour party. I was a. long way away at the time, but,. &#39; distant as I was, I was able to inform even the  Speaker,  of the House of Representatives that he was going to lose his job. I want to say this, because it ought to be said publicly; that the persons most hungry for office in this business were <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gibson.</inline> That ought to be said. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is so convinced of the necessity qf the members of the Cabinet speaking with one voice- that he would not say things like that, but I question whether he will deny my statement. When to the press and the: people outside the members of the Country party were saying that they would not have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> they were saying to the  managers and coalition framers, &#34; For Heaven&#39;s sake, bring about a change; we want to get on to the Treasury benches.&#34; I object to &#34;the members of the Country party saying; that they, did not seek office. I say that they sought office with the activity and. spirit. of a fox-terrier after a rabbit. They scraped out every burrow from which there might be a chance of securing it. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator does not think there is much . in anything. He is so complacent that I can imagine that he has already been nominated for the highest position in the Senate by the junta he support&#39;s. Can any one understand <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page making such a statement as I have quoted after the Cabinet had been formed and its members had sat round the Cabinet table ? He preferred to pose before the electors as a narrow party man&#39; rather than as a Minister who had taken  the oath to administer the laws, and who, by virtue of his acceptance of office, accepted the policy  of . the &#39;Prime Minister under whom he served. The .older we get, the more we are &#39; inclined to attach importance to things which we passed lightly by when we were boys. I can recall a little village and half-a-dozen boys who had one of their number bailed up about something, and he ..said, &#34;Honour bright ! &#39; &#39; We were only rude boys, but no one doubted or questioned him. He and we kept our honour bright. It is a British instinct to keep our honour bright, and I call upon the Government to keep their honour bright, and not to drag this Parliament down to the level of discreditable conduct which would not be tolerated by the people of the Commonwealth. This was the most discreditable piece of bargaining, intriguing, and huxtering  for office that has ever disgraced a State in any part of the world. </para>

                        <para>I hope I have not wearied honorable senators by my references to the new Cabinet. There are one or two more matters to which I could refer in showing how history is always repeating itself. In Parkes&#39; <inline font-style="italic">Fifty Years in the Making of Australian History,</inline> we read the following :- </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>The scheme of parliamentary government supposes that a small band of superior men in whose political character and administrative capacity, as a whole, the Legislature has confidence, shall govern us so long as they can retain that confidence. The grand  security  for good government by these men consists in their direct responsibility to a larger body of men, who, in their turn, are responsible to - the whole people. . . . We ought not to fool surprised, however much .we may regret, that the preliminaries to which we have adverted, are speedily followed by negotiations and combinations that shock our sense of political propriety. And herein lies the danger to the people. It is this that makes matters trifling in themselves, of the highest concern to the well-being of the community. Once off the rail, who can answer for the engine which so far has carried the train with speed and security? Those who resort to means that amaze the community to obtain power are not likely to stop at trifles in retaining it. But the mischief will not end with their retirement from office. The next set of Ministers may commence their deviations from the Constitution, not from the original landmarks, but from the marks left by their predecessors. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para>Men who will  obtain office by the means by which the present Ministers have come into power are not likely to stop short of anything in  their efforts to retain it. Quoting further from the same authority, at page 231, we read - </para>
                        <quote>
                            <para>I held the opinion that our system of government might be made a blessing or a curse, according to the degree of sensibility to the principle of responsibility entertained by those whose chief business was to govern, and the degree of subserviency to the views of the Executive entertained by those whose chief business was to represent the country. If Ministers were sufficiently lax in their notions of their obligations to the Constitution, and the representatives of the people were sufficiently lax in their notions of the trust reposed in them, there would be little check upon the abuses of power, and it would be difficult to fix a limit to the tricks, devices, evasions, manoeuvres and manipulations, and the invisible arts of corruption in the practice of these, by which a worthless Administration might be supported. In all limes good men had made efficient government, and  systems  had failed to convert unstable, unprincipled, and scheming men into good and efficient governors. </para>

                        <para class="block">To my mind the present Government came into power under conditions unexampled in the history of Australia, or any other British community. It has come into existence as a result of men setting aside the opinions of a lifetime, to enable them to sit in the same Cabinet. I congratulated <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> the other day on coming back to the Senate as a member of the Government. Judging by his experience of the last fourteen years, I should think he will be a permanent occupant of the Ministerial bench in this Chamber. </para>

There were no negotiations then to enable us to get a .. majority. I have shown how high is the standard maintained by the Labour party, and it has had the commendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> on the present occasion. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> handed in his resignation, why did he not ask the Governor-General to send for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton,</inline> who led a party of twenty-nine ? </para>

                                <para>- But we know the result of it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Hughes</inline> &#39;retired why did he not advise that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> be sent for ? It is of no use to say that the Labour party wanted office, because that was quite impossible. When, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> had returned from the elections with the biggest party in Australia, why was the Governor-General not advised to send for him ? If that question had been put to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> his one answer would have been, &#34; The Labour party will not negotiate for office. They are going their own way. They have not a majority of their own, and, therefore, they cannot hold office.&#34; The advice given to the Governor-General was that the sweets of office be hawked round in a basket. During all the time that the Labour party has taken a part in the public life of this country there has never been a political crisis in which it has clung to office. Our party can afford to wait. We will wait until the force behind Labour is so great that it will be impossible to keep it out of office. People writing in reply to my criticism of the Governor-General in sending for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> said that we ought not to be angry with the Governor-General so much as with the people of Australia for not having given us a majority. I was not angry with the Governor-General, but I was indignant that the Labour party had been passed over, and I hope I shall never live long enough not to feel indignant at a snub. </para>

                        <para>I want now to go a little further and say that had the Leader of the Labour party been sent for, we knew that, as soon as the House met - and necessarily it had to meet in February - we could not carry on. We knew that until the conditions were settled we could do nothing. Buff if Parliament had been called together earlier everything that had to be done could have been done on the floor of the House. It has been said, as I have already indicated, that our quarrel should be, not with the Governor-General for not having sent for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton,</inline> but with the people of Australia for not having given our party a majority in the House.If that was the reason, then the same argument should have been applied to the position occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce.</inline> Upon what ground was he sent for, in view of the fact, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> was leader of the largest party, and also the Leader of the Opposition? When the people of the Commonwealth give us an absolute majority, no one will be able to keep us from our rightful position. If then it was a sound rule for the Governor-General not to send for the Leader of the Labour party because he did not command an absolute majority of the House, why was that rule not applied to the Nationalist party? Instead of being sent for and passed out when the House met, we were passed over. </para>

                        <para>I thank honorable senators for listening to what; I have had to say in connexion with what I regard as a grave constitutional position. I should be sorry indeed to think that we had reached a time when the highest standards of honour were no longer necessary for men aspiring to high political positions: in this country, and that the chief requisite was willingness on the part of such men to sacrifice the principles upon which they had been  elected. That, to my mind, would strike a  blow  at the confidence of the people in our parliamentary institutions. The machinery of parliamentary government can only work smoothly when the highest standards of political morality are maintained. If, in this matter, we fail to &#34; play the game,&#34; and fail to set an example to our people, then all the old standards of business and trade will be swept away, During the recent elections wo had Mr. Hughes bitterly denouncing <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, and the latter reciprocating with equal vigour. We have been told since by the mover and seconder of the motion for the Address-in-Reply that the present combination of political forces represents the verdict of the people, and that that verdict was anti -Labour. Well, we are quite prepared to go to the country again upon that issue. </para>

                                <para>- If there was no difference in the platforms of the two parties, that was a very good reason for calling Parliament together and allowing the constitution of the new Government to be settled on the floor of the House. If there was no difference in their platforms, there was no occasion for a change in the leadership of the Ministry.I hold no brief for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> but I cannot resume my seat </para>

                        <para class="block">Without repeating that nothing discredited the Nationalist party more than their contemptible treatment of their old supporters from the Labour party, and their more contemptible action in dispensing with the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> One of my friends said to me that he was surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> should take office in the present Government, in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had been treated so badly ; but I told him that if he knew <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> as well as I did, he would quite understand why he would take office in any Government. I am wondering if we are under a Democracy seeing that a vote of censure by the people does not remove a Government from office. I see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> smiling complacently, notwithstanding the disaster that overtook his party at the last election. It seems to me that a Government cannot now be removed from office by a vote of censure, and so I would like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> when he is speaking on this question, to inform us what will bo necessary hereafter to remove a Government from office. </para>
                        <para>I am very much obliged to honorable senators for extending my time limit. I have said all I wanted to say, and I shall reserve for future occasions what remarks I may desire to make on the Government policy if ever they produce a policy. Parliament has met, hut its members have been refused any official information concerning the compact which resulted in the formation of the Government. The people of the country have a right to know what that compact is. It should not be kept secret for the benefit of the Government. For myself, I like to keep to the beaten track, and to know that what I am doing to-day is safe because it has been done before, and that what I may do to-morrow will be safe because I am treading the well-beaten track of constitutional government. </para>

                <para class="block">SenatorPEARCE (Western Australia Ministerfor Home and Territories) &#91;5.48&#93;. - I understand that a census motion has been moved in another place and from what I have been able to learn it seems probable that the debate will last the better part of next week. In the circumstances, it seems unwise to ask honorable senators to come together for, possibly, one day or two days next week. I move, therefore - </para>
