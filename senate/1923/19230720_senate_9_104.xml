            <para>. - It is not my intention to traverse the ground covered in my second-reading speech, but I feel it necessary to reply briefly to some of the statements made in the course of the debate. There is, of course, a difference of opinion as to the wisdom of continuing the Line, but by placing it on a sound business footing we hope to insure its usefulness as a public utility. Some honorable senators have urged that the writing down of the capital value of the ships has been too drastic. I submit that if we err at all it should  be on the side of undervaluation in order that the Line may be in a position to offer reasonable freights, pay working expenses and earn interest upon its capital value. I emphasize that the transfer of the Line by the management to a Board is not a sale in any sense of the term. The vessels will not be passed over to outside ownership. The Board will be the creation of Parliament, and as such will be subject to parliamentary control. It is absurd to suggest that the Line is to be handed over to a Board to &#34; boom or burst.&#34; Parliament will have control, and I am certain that the position will be amply safeguarded. The Bill provides that the Board shall issue 5 per cent. debentures in payment for the ships. In normal times, this is the ordinary rate of interest provided for in any business undertaking. The Board, being constituted as a business concern, will be required to face all the usual business risks. There will be no power to sell any of the assets without the consent of the Treasurer, and as the Minister is answerable to Parliament we shall retain effective control. There will be no authority for the Board to increase the capital without the consent of Parliament, and we shall have what is, I think, an innovation, namely, properly audited balance-sheets presented to Parliament at least once a year. </para>

              <para>- But as the honorable senator knows, they have been belated. In this respect, the Commonwealth Shipping Line has also been an offender, for we have not been supplied with balance-sheets for two or three years. We say that as the Board will be in active competition with private enterprise, it should also be subjected to taxation charges. It is better to put the position on a strictly business footing. If, as critics of this proposal claim, the Line will continue to lose money for the people, then there need be no complaint about the taxation of profits, because if it earns no profits there will be no taxation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> also said that if certain of the vessels were to be sold it would be better to keep them in commission, because then there would be a better chance of disposing of them. I agree that we would get a better price for vessels in such circumstances, and we are endeavouring to find business for our ships. However, we simply cannot run boats for the pleasure of joy-riding. The smaller vessels of the Line, being unsuitable for. the work they are called upon to perform, are unprofitable owing to the excessive overhead charges. My information is that the commissioning of the idle ships would involve the Line in very much greater losses than the policy of keeping them at their moorings. If we could run them at a cost not greater than is incurred by keeping them idle, we would be glad to have them employed. </para>

              <para>- Unfortunately, they are not suitable. Neither are they suitable for the Tasmanian trade. We want a certain type of ship for certain work. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth does not possess a ship which is suitable for that trade; otherwise it would say to the Tasmanian Government, &#34; This is such a good thing that the Commonwealth is prepared to give you a ship almost at your own price. You can cater for Tasmania in your own way, and we will finance you.&#34; </para>

              <para>- I quite appreciated that fact when the honorable senator was speaking last night. The Commonwealth Shipping Line eannot compete against foreigners in the tramp trade on account of the greater cost incurred in running its vessels, and the fact that, while other tramp ships would be able to finance their way to their home ports, ours would be compelled to return to Australia in ballast. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to the valuations which have been arrived at. I assure the honorable senator that the writing down was not a haphazard process, performed by an officer of the Public Service. C. W. Kellock and Co., London, who are regarded as the greatest shipbrokers in the world, and who had no connexion with the Commonwealth Shipping Line, valued the undertaking. I feel sure that honor- able senators will recognise that the work wassatisfactorily done. It is the opinion of the officers connected with this Line that a sale of the vessels would probably realize a little more than the valuation. Honorable senators should remember that these are abnormal times; we have never experienced their like in the history of shipping, and I hope that we shall not do so inthe future. That fact is an advantage in some respects, because it wall enable the Board to commenceoperations on what one might term &#34; the ground floor.&#34; Therefore, we look for the very best results. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> stressed the value of this Commonwealth Shipping Line to the Australian producers. Iconcur in that view. I unquestionably believe that it hasperformed excellent work for Australia. An honorable senator from Tasmania said that the Commonwealth had not done anything for that State. I draw his attention to the fact that the intervention of the Commonwealth Shipping Line was responsible for a reduction in freights to Tasmania by 30s. per ton. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to the figures quoted by the present Prime Minister in 1921. Without an explanation, it is difficult to understand those figures in the light of the present figures. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce&#39;s</inline> figures, account was not taken of the building of the two &#34;F&#34; class steamers. Taking into account the difference between the presentday value of those two vessels and the price which is being paid by the CommonwealthGovernment to Cockatoo Island for their construction, a loss is shown of approximately &#163;1,200,000. The Government realize that a loss of approximately &#163;500,000 will be made on the construction of the vessel which was started last week. Some people may say, &#34; Why do you proceed with </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Why not scrap it ? &#34; The Government delved into all the details, and, in view of the fact that all the parts had been manufactured and were ready for assembling, decided to proceed with the construction of the vessel. The Government considered further that the work which was being done at Cockatoo Island was of such value to Australia that it was necessary to adopt a bold policy. The Government are justified also in their decision tobuild the ship by reason of the fact that it will have the greater amount of refrigerating space that is required to-day. At present-day values shipbuilding is not a payable proposition. We can, however, turn Cockatoo Island into a huge repairing shop, build those ships that are required in the Commonwealth, and keep the dockyard at the very highest state of efficiency,sothat it will fee available if required in time ofwar. On the 13 &#34; E &#34; vessels there has been a loss of &#163;2,300,000; on the &#34; D&#39;s &#34; a lossof &#163;899,000. That makes a total difference of &#163;4,511,000. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> ambition to have the Cockatoo Island Dockyard placed on a proper footing and worked successfully is equal to my own. In the last two years I have watched carefully the operations of Cockatoo Island. Compared with what it was two years ago the state of efficiency there to-day is as different as chalk is from cheese. In the past the permission of the Minister had to be obtained in regard to every detail, and the management could not get on with its work. Three experts are now to be appointed. They will be told, &#34; This is your responsibility. Australia wants to preserve this industry, and we put you to the test of doing it.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> advocated strongly that there should be on the Board a representative of theworkers in the industry. This is not to be a Board in the ordinary sense of the term. If it were, it should have on it representatives of all parties. It is intended to have on the Board a shipping expert, a works expert, and a financial representative. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> has given an undertaking that directly the Board is appointed he will convene a conference between it and the representatives of the men, over which be will preside, to endeavour to formulate a working scheme that will insure industrial peace and the happiness of the men. </para>

              <para>- I realize that the workers possess their fair share of brains. I realize, also, that a man must possess the necessary qualifications to perform any given work. If he does, there is nothing to debar him from occupying any position. It ought not to be a question of whether a man belongs to this or to that party; qualifications should count when any appointment is made. Efficiency will never be obtained unless that practice is adopted. The Government desire to make this Line a success, and they want the men to be happy. No shipping line in the world offers the advantages that are given by the Commonwealth Shipping Line to-day. The captain of a ship is entitled to five days a month off in return for the Sundays worked, with an accumulation of sixty days a year. No other line in the world confers on its servants benefits of that character. Similar conditions apply to the crews. I am certain that the taxpayers and the Parliament of this country expect their men to be given good terms and conditions. The Government desire, therefore, that the men shall be made happy and contented. </para>

In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> I wish to say that only last year the management of the Commonwealth Shipping Line offered to place a vessel at the disposal of Geraldton if 500 tons of cargo were guaranteed. If the Board is assured of trade, they will be only too pleased to place shipping facilities at the disposal of ports, whether Albany, Geraldton, or Port Melbourne. </para>

It was discussed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> and I regret that the Minister, in reply, owing, perhaps, to the time being limited, did not give it full consideration. We have ample scope to discuss it in Committee. I approach this question free from any desire to have merely Union or Labour representation, as such, on the Board. I wish to discuss it from the point of view that men with the best brains for business should be included in the management, and to remind the Committee that from the ranks of the workers some of the ablest men in the community have been recruited. They are the men who do the real work. Let me take as an illustration the conduct of the business of this Senate. On the Government benches is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> a man who came from the union ranks; the <inline font-weight="bold">President, Senator Givens,</inline> was also taken from union ranks, as was the  Chairman  of Committees, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland.</inline> On the Public Works Committee are <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eeid</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who were once unionists. All have displayed their abilities in this Senate; but, if the same principle existed in respect of the Senate that it is proposed to apply to the Board of Control, the Commonwealth would be deprived of the valuable services of these honorable senators. In legislating we say that we require the best brains on a Board of Directors. The workers comprise 80 per cent. of the community; those who are said to be &#34; in position &#34; comprise the rest of the community, and when well-paid jobs are created or vacated this section usually obtains them. What &#34; in position &#34; stands for I really do not know. Certain people say that it is the capacity to obtain wealth. </para>

              <para>- Very likely, if it can be destroyed by referring to those who say they constitute an elevated class. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> was determined that the claims of unionists should not enter into the question of the appointment of the Board. The unions should be considered, because they include the brains and machinery which, successfully or otherwise, manage any large undertaking. In the management of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, would it not be a distinct advantage to have on the Board men of this calibre? There will always be industrial trouble while men who lack merit obtain more than they deserve and others with merit get less than they deserve. It would be well to have on the Board a competent man who is really in sympathy with the men with whom he has to deal. That sympathy unfortunately, is, at present, sadly lacking in the industrial arena generally. The party feeling which sometimes reaches a high pitch in this Chamber,but which I always endeavour to quell asmuch as possible - becomes accentuated outside. The Labour man has the &#34; boot put into him &#34; from start to finish. Ability is not recognised when a man has been guilty of the awful offence of belonging to the Labour party. If the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> has any doubt about what I say, I am in a position to give him a concrete case. Any improvement brought about in the conditions of the workers results in the uplift of the general community. Education among the working classes is world-wide nowadays, and it is a mistaken policy to refrain from putting to the best use the knowledge that the working people possess. </para>

            <para>. -  I heartily support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I have always, as a general principle, opposed the appointment of Boards, believing that the best results are to be obtained from one brainy man, who should be given absolute control, and held responsible for the success of the undertaking of which he is placed in charge. A multiplicity of Boards has come into existence, and a few lucky individuals seem to find their way upon the majority of them. Very often these people make a hopeless muddle of the work they undertake. They cannot even issue notes and postage stamps without blundering. When I had a rest from my parliamentary duties some time ago, the Government were good enough to appoint me to a position on the Board of Trade. I was naturally pleased; but as soon as I was given the position the Board ceased meeting. It could not obtain a quorum. As soon as I was returned to this august Chamber, the Board met, but I was not invited to attend. I take it that the  Chairman  of the Shipping Board will be the gentleman who has conducted the Commonwealth Shipping Line up to the present. He would certainly make an able  chairman.  He does not pretend to know much about the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. In the manager of that yard, however, we have one of the ablest men to be found in Australia. He has reconstructed the yard, which is now a model workshop, and he has converted the establishment into a paying proposition. If he is not to be appointed to the Board, he ought to be. I take it that the present financial expert will also be selected as a member. In addition to the three I have mentioned, representation should be given to the workmen. Wherever that experiment has been tried, it baa proved successful. The Bureau of Research at the Sydney Trades Hall is as efficient as any body of the kind in any part of the world. The officers of the Bureau are experts, and the press recognises their cleverness, which goes to prove that workmen are efficient in such matters. Their statistics are most valuable. .

We should then have a responsible officer to whom we could look for the proper administration of the. Line. With a Board, it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to place responsibility on the right shoulders. Apparently, the Government have decided to have a Board., but have not made up their minds whether it should comprise three or five members.&#34; I have no doubt that at least five, and probably more, will be appointed.

As there is no hope of circumventing the proposal for a Board, I maintain that tha men engaged in the construction and operation of the ship should be directly represented. The constructional unions should nominate one member and the operating unions another. It is idle to assume that all the necessary administrative, financial, and other qualifications are to he found in men who have had little or no practical experience of ship construction and working. The adoption of my suggestion would lead to economy and more satisfactory results generally in connexion with the construction and repairing of the vessels, and would, at the same time, result in the smoother working of the Line. I wish to give notice of a further amendment as follows : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That, at the end of Bub-clause (2), the following proviso bo inserted : - &#34; Provided that one of the members of the Board shall be recommended by the unions representing the constructional section, and one by the operating section of the employees.&#34; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">By the constructional section, I mean the engineers, boiler-makers, painters, &#38;fc; The  &#39;Operatives  would include the seamen, members of the Merchant Service Guild, and the Australian Institute of Marine Engineers, as well as radio telegraphists and cooks and stewards. The inclusion of a representative of those sections would not add largely to the expenses of the Board. </para>

            <para>. - I am not favorable to the appointment of a Board, as I believe the ships can be properly managed by one man possessing the necessary qualifications for the position. At the inception of this enterprise the Government had had no experience in the shipping business, but the Line was as efficiently controlled by one official as were some of the oldest and best shipping lines that were managed by Boards, and this notwithstanding that the manager was not clothed with the drastic powers to be given to the proposed Board. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> stated that if the Lino were placed under the control of a Board it would be free from political influence, but I do not think it can be said that political influence has ever interfered with the management of the Line. The Commonwealth Line is in a sense a business proposition, but it is not endeavouring to make big dividends for the benefit of its shareholders, as private shipping companies are. . In my immature days  I  was under the impression that some of those who enjoyed the largest incomes were necessarily the most competent, and overshadowed every one else in the community; but after coming in contact with! such gentlemen at the conference table  I  concluded . that they were not giants of: commerce, but everyday human beings. The number to be appointed to the Board is not mentioned, neither is the remuneration stipulated. Are the members of tha Board to be Australians? Some of tha powers of the Board are set out in the Bill, from which it would appear that it will have the authority to handle this tremendous asset, which is the property  of  the people, just as it pleases. </para>

              <para>- I am hoping that the whole clause will be deleted. The Australian people are shareholders in this enterprise, and as a shareholder I have the right to discuss a proposition in which I am directly interested. I am not opposed to the Line being under the control of an efficient manager, as it has been in the past, but I do not think a Board is likely to render better service to the shareholders. If, however, the Government insist on appointing a Board its <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> should include representatives of those sections which are most vitally concerned, because that would tend to a more harmonious relationship between those engaged on the vessels. It is not a new principle to allow workers to have a voice in the control of industries. The idea is being carried out in some big institutions^ different parts of the world, and, from information received,- I understand it is proving eminently satisfactory. I say, in all seriousness, that the Government, in their own interests and in the interests of the people, should give representation on the Board to the workers. This would lessen trouble, and probably eliminate altogether that friction which,  on  several occasions, has been responsible  for  considerable delay in the working of some of the Commonwealth ships. The Board will be able to do almost anything in connexion with the ships and their employees. Having that power, it is possible that at times the Board may adopt a course that would result in serious inconvenience to the people of tho Commonwealth, and lead to serious trouble amongst those engaged in the ships. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said that  the  workers represent at least 80 per cent,  of  the population. I go further, and  say  that they represent about 90 per cent. As shareholders in this big concern, they are entitled to  at  least one representative on the B?ard. Is there anything unfair in that request? I think it is too modest. Personally, I should like to see the Board wiped out; but, as that will not be possible, I shall be satisfied if the industrial section of the community has one representative on it. As a shareholder in the enterprise, he will be as anxious for success as - perhaps more anxious than - some of the other members who may be appointed. It is likely that if they come from the business world their one purpose will be to make the Line pay, no matter in what way that object is achieved. We have seen fortunes made by so-called business men who, so to speak, have extracted the last ounce of blood from their sweated employees; men have had to work inordinately long hours for totally inadequate wages, and when they have reached a certain age have been cast aside. </para>

            <para>. - Notwithstanding the Minister&#39;s op- position to the amendment, I urge that it is worthy of serious consideration. &#34;Representation of workers on the management- of industrial concerns is one of the principles which I have always advocated. I have always endeavoured to direct unionists along what I considered to be right lines. I believe that they should obey constituted authority. I have always been anxious to do what I could to eliminate those bitter industrial troubles that occur so frequently between employers and employees. The time has come when we should realize the human element in the workers to a greater extent than has been done in the past. The existence of harmonious relations between workers and their employers is one of the greatest safeguards of industrial peace. I do not stand for the absolute control by the workers of the industries in which they are engaged. That course, I think, is quite impracticable; but I earnestly urge that serious consideration be given to this proposal. &#34;Workers should be encouraged by the knowledge that they have something more than a mechanical interest in their occupation. I am certain that if the amendment be agreed to it will lead to harmony in the working of the Line. I shall be satisfied with one representative from the industrial organizations, so long as he does represent the workers. We all know of the difficulties that have arisen between the Seamen&#39;s Union and the steam-ship companies, and we hear it suggested that this proposal would lead to job control. That is not at all probable, because the representative of the workers would be in a minority on the Board, and would be outvoted every time. One of the most potent causes of industrial unrest is the monotony of toil. It is essential, therefore, that the worker should have a real interest in his job. The operation of this principle in various industrial undertakings in England has been most successful. It has conduced to harmony and better industrial relations, and in many trades has eliminated causes of industrial unrest. I appeal to honorable senators to give this pet idea of mine a trial, lt cannot possibly do any harm. On the contrary, if it is adopted, we shall have industrial peace in connexion with the operations of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. </para>

            <para>. -  There are two proposals before the Committee, one submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> and the other by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> This is an advantage, inasmuch as anything which I may say concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> amendment will apply also to that moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant.</inline> Stripped pf all its make-believe find embellishments, the amendment suggests that employees of the Line will be subjected to some form of injustice, either now or in the immediate future. But this is a Government venture. The Board will be a business concern, for which this Parliament and succeeding Governments will be responsible. Therefore, employees of the Line .will stand in an entirely different position from employees in a private company. No Government could attempt to run this Shipping Line and at the same time be guilty of injustice to its employees without that injustice finding an echo in Parliament. It is not so with employees of private business concerns. They may be ground down with injustices, and perhaps may never be in a position to give expression to their complaints in the same way that employees of the Commonwealth Government Shipping Line will be able to do. Parliament in the ultimate resort will be responsible, because the Board will be a creature of Parliament. If the Board is guilty of any injustice towards its employees, the Government of the day will be responsible, and the ballot-box will soon settle them if they do not remedy the injustice. We are living in times of change. I am reminded that a Labour Government created this enterprise, and also the Commonwealth Bank. But when the latter project was being discussed in this Chamber, the last word of political wisdom then expressed was that a Governor should be appointed. There was no suggestion then that, as an alternative, there should be an adviser or assistant to look after the interests of the employees of the Bank. Labour supporters of the proposal were then silent. If this innovation is necessary now, it was no less necessary then. Now, if one may judge by their attitude towards the appointment of the proposed Shipping Board, they have changed their minds. It is, df course, quite right and proper, that, if they  honestly believe that the&#39; course they now advocate is right, they should! be allowed to change their minds. But I notice that, if anybody else changes hia mind,, it is a case of get the basket, the sawdust,, and the guillotine ready for hist head. </para>

              <para>- This new idea nas been&#39; put forward&#39; lately. I candidly confess that to me this has a strong Moscow taint; we get from it a whiff of red snow. The Whitley report, which was&#39; presented to the Imperial Parliament,  recommended  that  the  workmen should be given representation upon boards; relating to the industries in which they were engaged). The idea was that those; representatives&#39; of. the workers- should&#39; be charged with the duty of looking after the. economic welfare of the industry which they represented - that and nothing&#39; more. I do- not object to that in the least. The Soviet Government acted under the instructions of Lenin, who said, &#34; Take the industries ; they belong to you.&#34; The leaders of the Labour movement in- Australia recognise that it. is not possible at present for the workers to- take to themselves the  indus-tries  of this country. They therefore desire to take the first step in that direction! -by having the employees represented on the management of the different industries. I should not object to the employees having representation if sucha course were practicable; I do not think the practice would be workable for the simple- reason that if employees&#39;, a&#187; such, in any grade of society are given power beyond that to which they are entitled&#39;,, they use it to their own advantage and to the disadvantage of other sections of the community. The Commonwealth. Shipping Line is owned by the people of </para>

          <para class="block">Australia. What proportion of the community is: constituted of the men aboard the ships ? They are a very small decimal fraction of the total population. Where do- the other workers come in; who constitute a very high percentage of the total&#39; number? Are. they not to be given representation? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> is- working along logical lines: when he says; that if the employees aboard the ships are en-titled  to representation, so also are the men who build the ships. But where* d&#187;&#62; those who dig the ore- and mak&#169; the? iron come in <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> When one f alse step- is: taken it leads to another, until eventually one finds oneself in an- irrecoverable position-. There are others who ought to have representation on this. Board if that, practice is adopted. What about the- gold,  miners,  the product of whose labour is sent to the other parts of the world? What- will the. miners in the base metal field say if they find that excessive freights are being, charged &#39;because. o&#163; the mismanagement of this Line? Will they not have a grievance? Then there are the farmers. They work on a very  small  margin. Clocks and watches were newer intended to be used by the f aimers,, Aslong  as  their bodily strength endures, they have, to continue working in order to. keepin. idleness, the- city loafers. If their efforts were appreciated, it would not be so bad;, but they one not. They are bending their backs: early and late, carrying on the industries, of the country. What about the farm labourers,? Should they have representation? If all these interests are given -representation, the Board will be a hydra-headed monster, and that willi make effective management impossible. I agree with what was done in Russia up to a certain point, hu* I totally disagree with the later  development.  when everything- was turned upside down. There&#39; is an- old saying, &#34; There is no tyranny so tyrannical as the tyranny of the slave when he gets on top.&#34;- That does not justify the wild career that has been embarked upon in&#62; Russia, and has been held up as an- example to- this young democracy. We ought to go down on our knees and thank God that the men who battled in the past obtained for US&#39; the charter of liberty which we. enjoy to-day. We have greater freedom than any country, not even excepting Russia. I ask honorable senators opposite, do the workers employed in Labour newspapers have representation on the boards of management? Not in one case. Yet honorable&#39; senators opposite propose that that practice shall be adopted in regard to the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. Were the workers who erected the Trades Hall, Perth, given representation on the board of management when that building was erected by contract? Not on your life! Not a suggestion of it. Our honorable friends opposite, however, think that  what  is not good enough for themselves ought to be good enough, for the Commonwealth Shipping Line. I advise them to practise  what  they preach. </para>

            <para>.- In reply to- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline><inline font-style="italic">I</inline> wish to say that no matter how we may differ on various questions, honorable senators will agree that he takes care to &#39; prevent us from being at all bored.  His  speech, although interesting, was so, contrary to his professions of a lifetime that I feel compelled to reply. He stated&#39; that the Labour party obtained from- Russia their idea of the control of industry by the workers. We are contending-, not that each branch of industry should&#39; be represented on the Board, but, rather, the great majority of the community. When I stated this morning that the most capable men for appointment to the Board would come from the workers, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> by interjection, asked whether I did not think I was destroying my argument. I then failed to catch his meaning; but, now, after listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> I think I do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> spoke of lifting men from the ranks of the workers, where they obtain intelligence and education, to higher positions, where they will be of use to the rest of the community. That seems, on the face of it, quite a satisfactory procedure. But it is not the practice that should be followed. Men should be appointed to the Board on their merits. It is the earnest desire of this party to appoint a Board representing all sections of the community, so as to insure the success of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. We put forward this proposal, not for the purpose of antagonizing Labour and Capital, but in the belief that the 95 per cent. of the people constituting that section which is usually overlooked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson&#39;s</inline> party have more ability than the 5 per cent. he represents. </para>

          <para>SenatorFINDLEY. - Clause 6 is clear and specific. It provides that there shall be a Board of Directors, consisting of not less than three nor more than five members. It further states that the GovernorGeneral may appoint one of the members  to be  chairman.  We may take it that the word &#34; may &#34; means &#34; shall,&#34; and that the  chairman  will be appointed by the Governor-General in Council. Further on the clause states that, at meetings of the Board, the  chairman  shall have a deliberative vote, and, in the event of an equality of voting, a second or casting vote. If, in a Board of three, one member were in favour of a certain course of action, and another member against it, the vote of the  chairman  would decide the issue. There is to be a quorum of two, and I understand that it is now proposed to give the acting  chairman  a deliberative as well as a casting vote. There would be great danger in that. I suggest that when there are only two members of the Board present, and when they are not in agreement on a particular matter, the question should stand over for further consideration. Millions of pounds have been invested in the Commonwealth Shipping Line, and the rights of the people must be protected. Public interests would not be adequately safeguarded under the proposed new subclause if it means that the acting  chairman,  at a meeting of two, would have both a deliberative and a casting vote. </para>

The matters arising might be of sufficient importance to demand immediate attention in order that the business of the Line should not be held up. Surely any two members out of three should be of sufficient to constitute a quorum. In all matters, as in the case of other Boards, a member of the Shipping Board will be answerable in due course to the full Board for any action he may take. The new sub-clause would meet extreme circumstances, such as the illness of one of the members of the Board. </para>

The amendment provides that when only two members of the Board are present one shall be appointed  deputy chairman,  and theclause itself provides that the  chairman  shall have a deliberative as well as a casting vote. If the Minister will assure me that the  deputy chairman  will not bo. clothed with the same authority as the  chairman  appointed by the Governor-General I shall not press my objection. This is a dangerous power  to  place in the hands of a  deputy chairman.  Matters of great importance may be dealt with by the Board in the absence of the  chairman,  and that strengthens my opposition to the proposed new sub-clause. </para>

              <para>- And it might  save  considerable unnecessary expenditure. The responsibility rests, not upon the. Board, but upon those who support the Bill in its present form. It is our duty, as custodians of the public purse, to see that the work of the Board is carried on in a business-like way. I do not think it a reasonable proposal to place such extensive powers in the hands of a deputy chairman,  on  whose vote the disposal of the whole fleet might depend. </para>

The running of these vessels involves the State in a loss of about  &#163;12,000  a year, largely owing to the excessive overhead charges. It has occurred to me that if they could be acquired by the Board a substantial saving in working costs might be made. Apart from that I should like to see thewhole of the State steam-ship services controlled by one authority, if arrangements could be made with the States interested, with the object of cheapening the cost of transport. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by this clause to ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> if he considers it gives power to the Board to act as advisers to the Commonwealth Government on shipping matters? I do so because there are certain matters which I regard as omissions, and which I think the Commonwealth Government might very well take into consideration. The purpose of the Bill is to seriously curtail, in the opinion of honorable senators opposite, but beneficially curtail, in my opinion, the operations of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. It is expected that the Board will keep what may be termed the capital ships of the Line and sell the smaller vessels. The Line, I take it, was brought into existence to meet the necessities of the war, and to encourage Australian trade. One of the principal functions now should be to encourage the development of our trade with Eastern Asia. If the smaller ships are sold, as suggested, it will be impossible for the larger vessels to trade with those ports. I should like to know whether it would be within the province of the Board to advise the Government in the matter of subsidizing freights. It is important, in the interests of our trade, that this should be done. I may be permitted to give one or two instances to explain what I mean. One of our principal exports to Eastern Asia is flour. I do not wish to see an ounce of wheat shifted overseas - it should all go as flour. We are up against serious competition from America. The freight from Vancouver or San Francisco to Shanghai is 21s. per ton, compared, with 42s. 6d. per ton from Sydney to Shanghai, which is practically the same steaming distance. This difference of &#163;1 ls. 6d. per ton on flour, which, of course, is sold on narrow margins, is enough to put the Australian  flour  absolutely  out  of the market. I think honorable senators will see that if the smaller ships of the Line are sold, the Board should have power to advise the Government as to some remedy. It is of the utmost importance to Australia that our exporters of primary products should hd on the same level as competitors in other countries. Undoubtedly our rivals for the Eastern trade are subsidizing their shipping, and if we are to fight them on even terms the same policy should be adopted in this country. </para>

In Tasmania that has not been the case so far as the Line is concerned. Outside companies have established services between the north-west coast and Great Britain and other overseas ports. This week another company has entered into that trade, and there are now three lines of overseas ships calling at ports along that coast. That trade was available to the Commonwealth Shipping Line had it been prepared to meet the wishes of the people. It will find the greatest difficulty now in obtaining a footing. The people of Tasmania are shareholders in this business, and they are most anxious that it shall be made a success. Had the people been cared for by the Commonwealth Shipping Line in the manner in which the private companies are caring for them, it would have been well established in that trade. It will be part of the duty of the Board to see that the people&#39;s wishes are met. The Commonwealth .Shipping Line asked one company for a guarantee of  1,000  tons of cargo; and although the company gave the guarantee, when any other company offered any cargo above the  1,000  tons, it was not allowed as a set-off. , </para>

          <para>The Line has done more for Tasmania than for any other State, and received less encouragement in return. The Line berthed direct tonnage from the United Kingdom when, no other company did so. Tasmanian importers, instead of supporting this service, agreed to confine their shipments to other companies, and undertook to pay them 10s. per ton upon cargo diverted to other steamers, including Commonwealth Line steamers. In spite of this the Commonwealth Line service was maintained. Every available vessel of the Line has loaded fruit in Tasmania during each season. The quantify lifted during the present year was 269,033 cases, and during the previous season 107,782 cases, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> 17 per cent, and 14 per cent, respectively of the total shipments. The freight rate on apples by the Line for the 1923 season was reduced from 5s. to 4s. per case. This resulted in other Lines reducing their rate to 4s. 6d. The&#39; Tasmanian growers had stated that unless the rate for 1923 was reduced to 4s. they were not prepared to export more than 200,000 cases. The total quantity shipped in 1923 as a result of the reductions was 1,561,633 cases, of which 269,033 were carried by the Line at 4s. per case, and 1,292,600 by other Lines at 4s. 6d. per case. In January last the Commonwealth Line abolished the surcharge of 20s. per ton on cargo from the United Kingdom to Tasmania, and in this was followed by the other Lines. It also reduced all freights from United Kingdom by a further 10s. per ton. and the other Lines followed with a similar&#39; reduction. At the  same  time freight rates to the United Kingdom were also considerably reduced, and in this again the other Lines followed. The Line&#39;s arrangement with the Conference especially stipulates definitely for the needs of Tasmanian portsbeing met if necessary by a joint arrangement for the provision of a regular service from United Kingdom to Tasmanian ports. </para>

          <para>.- Clause10 proposes to clothe the Board with very extensive powers. The Senate is now considering the question of the management of the Line. I take it that we expect that the Board will, in the very near future, set itself out to capture the whole of the Inter-State trade. The Board will meet with fierce competition if it sets out to capture the whole of the Inter-State trade, and it will require to take over, on equitable terms, vessels which are at present engaged in that trade. That is one of the reasons why I support the measure. I anticipate that the Board will waste no time in nationalizing shipping interests, as far as Australia is concerned. </para>

          <para>. - I supporttheviewofthe Minister. We should keep a sharp eye on the legal fraternity. They persistently endeavour to introduce legal phrases into documents, evidently to secure employment for themselves at the expense of the ordinary laymen. The wording of the clause is clear and distinct, and the average person will know exactly what is intended. The legal profession clothe a will with ambiguity to provide occupation for themselves at excessive fees. I have a recollection of the will of a sailor who was pressed for time, which stated - &#34;All to mother.&#34; It was held to be legal. The phraseology of the clause is concise and to the point, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> amendment is accepted, it will mean the alteration of almost every clause. Bills should be drafted in language easily understood by the ordinary layman. </para>

          <para>. - I strongly oppose this clause because it. provides for the transference of Commonwealth property to the Board, and the consequent loss of Commonwealth control. I know of no reason why we should deliberately hand over this property to the Board, in such unmistakable language that the Board will have greater power over it than the Government will have. I know that the property cannot be disposed of without the consent of the Treasurer; but I object to the clause because if conflict occurred the Board, legally, would have a stronger hold of this property than would the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>. - I intend to divide the Committee on this clause.Under its provisions, the Commonwealth Government will give away to other bodies the right to tax Commonwealth instrumentalities. There is a strong public feeling in certain quarters that if money is to be taken out of the Government purse, a good big dip should be made. I do not see the force of placing our property at the disposal of taxing bodies that have no interest in the Commonwealth. When a valuer inspects property, he reasons - &#34; This is private property,and should be valued low, but this is Commonwealth land, and can bear a high valuation.&#34; </para>

            <para>- What would the objection be worth when the decision rests with the Court which is a state instrumentality ? This will give to other bodies the right to tax Commonwealth property. The sovereignParliament has no authority to dispose of that right. I realize that a State Government or a municipality would regard it as a hardship to be prevented from taxing a Commonwealth utility ; but, as I object  to  the principle of the clause, I hope that it will be struck out. </para>

If New South Wales decided to tax land values in accordance with the principles of Henry George, it would mean a serious depletion of the revenue of the Commonwealth Shipping Line.

          <para>. - I cannot complain of this motion, because the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> gave notice of it last week; but I am surprised at the adoption of this course. Honorable senators from other States who desire to go to their homes, as they are entitled to do, will have very little time, seeing that the Senate is to meet again next Tuesday. The action of the Minister is not calculated to expedite the business of the Senate. If the Government drew up a programme in keeping with the time at our disposal, it could be dealt with without an extra day of sitting. It is a wrong policy to endeavour to rush through the Senate a volume of business that it is humanly impossible to deal with properly within the time fixed. I should advise the Cabinet during the week-end to come to some decision as to the measures they desire to pass this session, and to take both branches of the Legislature into their confidence, instead of having a scramble to deal with as many Bills as possible. If the Government attempt to put through a dozen measures in a week they will find that there are enough new members of the Senate to prevent them from achieving their purpose. If the Minister informs honorable senators what legislation he thinks can reasonably be passed, I feel sure that we shall endeavour to assist him. </para>

            <para>.- I desire to reply in a few words to a statement read by the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Shipping Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson).</inline> No doubt the statement was supplied to him from an official source; but I made it quite clear in my remarks that I was referring to the northwestern portion of Tasmania, whereas the statement of the Minister had reference to the whole State. </para>

            <para>-  Order! The honorable senator is not in order in referring in the Senate to a debate that took place in Committee. Apart from that, I would remind him that there is barely time for him to make an explanation, because, under the Sessional Orders, at 4 o&#39;clock I must put the question, which cannot be debated, &#34;That the Senate do now adjourn.&#34; </para>
