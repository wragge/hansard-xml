It is indeed a. great honour. The Senate is elected by the whole of the people of Australia; it is, therefore, a representative Chamber, and to be elected as its  President  is as great an honour as any man can hope to obtain in Australia. I believe that, as in the past, you will do all in your power to uphold the dignity of this Chamber and to maintain its position in the Constitution, and that, as hitherto, you will always be quite impartial. I congratulate you most heartily upon your reelection. </para>

          <para>- I am afraid that I could not, at this juncture, make any statement which would be of much value to honorable senators, because I do not know how long the debate on the Addresa-in-Reply will occupy the attention of the Senate. Before the debate terminates, however, I hope to have an opportunity of informing honorable senators of the programme that will be submitted to the Senate. The GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech indicates, in general terms, the legislation that will be introduced, but at present I am not able to suggest the order in which the Bills will be submitted. </para>

            <para>. Having regard to the unfortunate position in which the Government have deliberately placed this Senate, I do not- feel disposed to discuss the Address-in-Reply to the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech at any great length. The session opened three weeks ago,, when the House of Representatives met and proceeded to dispose of the AddressinReply. The Government intentionally slighted this Senate by so arranging their business that the opening of the session did not coincide with the swearing-in of honorable senators elected in December last. </para>

              <para>- Supply could have been arranged for before the last recess, or, if necessary, Parliament could have been called together a month ago to pass Supply only. What is the position to-day? In this branch of the Commonwealth Legislature, which takes precedence in all matters,honorablesenators fresh from their constituencies and representing the whole of the electors of Australia, are sworn in as though they were filling so many casual vacancies. It is part of the programme of the Labour party to abolish the Senate, and no one will work more gladly to achieve that object than I shall do when the opportunity is afforded to do so; but while I remain a member of this Senate, holding myself responsible to the electors of the State of New South Wales, I shall not, without questioning it, permit any. indignity to be placed upon this Chamber. It is true that every Government has overlooked the Senate, but the present Government is apparently laying itself out to slight this branch of the Legislature. </para>

          <para>I leave for a moment the Government&#39;s action in commencing this session within a fortnight of the time when the newlydelected senators could have been sworn in, and when they could have discussed the Government&#39;s programme, as set out in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, and the remarks made by the mover and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, while they were still fresh in their minds. The Government&#39;s failure to appreciate the position of the Senate, as laid down in the Constitution, is also evidenced by the fact that they are seeking to transfer functions possessed by the Senate to a body which is not only irresponsible, but is also not recognised by the Federal Constitution. In recent years a practice has grown up of making agreements between the Federal and State authori ties. In this Senate we represent the people of the States. Surely a proposal to change the financial arrangements between the States and the Commonwealth shouldbe a matter for our considerationFederal Ministers meet State Ministers in conference and discuss the proposals in every detail, while we, the elected representatives of the States, sent here with the deliberate object of looking after State interests, are not even told in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech what they are. </para>

              <para>- I have no doubt that the electors&#39; unfortunate lack of keen attention to their responsibilities, as displayed three years ago, has materially contributed to the present deplorable condition of affairs. I have nothing harsh to say about the electors; they made amends at the last election, but no doubttheir action of three years ago was responsible for much that has since taken place. I appeal to each honorable senator to ask himself, quite apart from party considerations, whether he is satisfied with the trend of affairs during the last few years. If any honorable senator is satisfied with what is being done, all I can say is that he is the judge of his own conduct, but I am not satisfied, and I shall continue to voice my disapproval of any Government that disregards this Senate, and calls upon an outside body, which is in no respect responsible to the people of Australia to exercise functions that properly belong to the Senate. I have no doubt that the representatives of New South Wales at the Conference between Commonwealth Ministers and State Ministers fairly represented the views of the governing body in their State at the present time, but honorable senators elected to this Senate voice the opinions of the people of Australia, and the sooner we realize this Chamber&#39;s true position as set rut in the Constitution the better it will be for the welfare of the people of Australia. I do not know what form the secret arrangement in regard to  the finances will take. </para>

              <para>- But there is no occasion for the holding of secret conferences, which undermine the status of the Senate. If all these arrangements can be made by Conferences of Federal and State Ministers, without calling upon the Senate to exercise its functions, it is a &#39;big step towards one objective of the Labour party, namely, the abolition of this Chamber. I would abolish the Senate because, as a matter of principle, I do not believe in the bicameral system of legislation. I hold that we do not need more than one House of legislature. But while the present system continues, and I remain a member of this Senate, I shall not overlook, without questioning it, any slight imposed by the Government upon the Senate. Our Constitution having been modelled, to a great extent, on that of the United States of America, we can fairly compare our Chamber with the &#34;Senate of the United States. If we follow in the footsteps of the American Senate, and assert our right to exercise a power and influence such as that House exercises in the government of the country, then, instead of being a Chamber which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> suggests, is merely required to put the rubber stamp of its indorsement on agreements into which the Government have secretly entered, we shall be looked upon with respect by all sections of the community, and shall be capable of properly defending the interests of the people ve are sent here to represent. I feel disposed to test the feeling of honorable  senators by submitting an amendment to ascertain whether they approved o) the Government&#39;s action in regard to these arrangements with the States. I have decided not to do so, but I put this question in the forefront of my remarks, and ask honorable senators whether we are really doing justice to the duties which the electors sent us here to carry out, if we permit the Government to treat us in this way. I do not think we are, and thus I enter my most emphatic protest against the action of the Government in making the swearing in of the newly elected senators merely a casual occurrence, thus robbing this branch of the- Legislature of its rightful position on such an occasion as this. I hope that this transgression on the part of the Government will be the last in this respect. </para>

          <para>I shall not go through the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech in detail. This is a favorable opportunity for me to express my regret at the loss of so many old friends with whom I have been associated in this Senate for many years, and to record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> my keen appreciation of the sportsmanlike manner in which I was treated by all honorable senators supporting the Government when I was the only senator sitting in opposition. The strength of the Opposition has been increased as the result of the last election, but as an Opposition we shall endeavour to bring to bear on the business of this Senate the same sportsmanlike spirit, and shall try to play the game. I hope that we shall be a real Opposition, criticising any legislation brought forward in such a way that it will not be considered in a  party  spirit, but in the interests of the people in the States we all represent. </para>
          <para>The speed at which we travel in Parliament is such that the last post passed a fortnight ago appears to be miles back. I can only speak of the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> from the slight recollection I have of what he said at that far-distant date when he moved the motion for the adoption of the- Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. I complained six months ago that the Government had treated Parliament to an opening Speech which had nothing in it; but they have certainly opened the Parliament on this occasion in a most autocratic manner, saying that we must put through an immense amount of legislation before the 25th August next, in order that the Prime Minister may go to Great Britain. The consideration of the measures placed before us in the Governor-General&#39;s </para>
          <para class="block">Speech would take up several mouths, but the Government insist upon our disposing of their programme, or most of it, in a few weeks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> very ably put the case for the Government when commenting on their programme, and he dealt very candidly with the sale of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. No one could take exception to the honorable senator&#39;s remarks, but are honorable senators generally satisfied with the whole transaction ? I can quite understand that those who object to the Government having anything to do with any business that in their opinion can better be undertaken by private enterprise, or object to any Government interference whatever in private production, concur in the sale of the Commonwealth Woollen. Mills. But although they may take up that attitude, they would not readily consent to the Government&#39;s action in deliberately making a bad bargain in the sale of a most valuable asset under conditions entirely unsatisfactory, and such as no private individual would tolerate in his own business. These mills were established as part and parcel of our defence system. If the Government had continued to work them as they had been worked from 1915 until the date of their sale, they would have been a most profitable portion of the machinery that represents the defence organization of Australia. It is certainly an essential in the training of soldiers that they should be properly clothed. In 1911 the Labour party, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was then the Leader, realized the importance for defence purposes of having woollen mills to provide clothing for cur soldiers. The mills stood the test, not only of peace but of war conditions. In 1920 we realized that we had builded  .better than we knew. The woollen mills were established, a most excellent manager was obtained to conduct the business, a most excellent site was presented to the Commonwealth Government - the best site, it was considered, that could be procured in the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Smail,  who waa appointed manager, was permitted to travel where he liked in Australia in order to obtain the best site for the location of the mills. He finally decided that they should be established at Geelong. The selling of those mills, and the handing over of the freehold to a private company, cannot be honestly defended. The site was a magnificent gift. No conditions were imposed in black and white,, but the Victorian Harbor Trust Commissioners, who transferred the site to us,, never dreamt that as soon as they had proved successful the woollen mills, together with the site, would be handed over to a private company. We have not dealt fairly with the authority which made the gift of theland to us. I do not know that I would* be using too strong a term if I said that it was dishonest dealing. The valuers for the Government said that the value of the mills was &#163;267,000. I believe that they were worth a great deal more than that. The mills were equipped with the most up-to-date machinery that could be obtained. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Smail  was appointed, he was immediately placed on the pay-roll of the Commonwealth. He was given letters of introduction throughout Great Britain to enable him to inspect the woollen mills which were established in that country, and was authorized to order the best possible plant for the production of the materials he would have to turn out. At considerable expense to the Commonwealth, that gentleman did his work excellently, and established those mills in a way which gave satisfaction to every one. It was well into 1915 before: the first lot of material was turned out. Apart altogether from the actual saving: on the materials supplied to the soldiers, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the mills had saved the Commonwealth from &#163;3,000,000 to &#163;4,000,000. In addition, they provided the soldiers with clothing which was appreciated by all. Any man who has made himself acquainted with the supplying of goods for the needs of an army knows that it is during a time of war that the &#34;crook&#34;&#39; contractor makes money, because orders have to be carried out quickly, and inspection must necessarily be very limited. I do not want any one to think I imagine that all the material for our soldiers was supplied by these mills; but having these mills we were able to tell the owners of others, when they wanted to increase their- prices, at exactly what price per yard the material could be produced. We did not fix a starvation price for the owners of other mills. </para>

              <para>- Having taken control of the other mills, permitting the owners only to manufacture under licence from the Government when they were not manufacturing for us, it would have been unfair had we been other than liberal to them. Liberal though we were, they did not make half that which they would have made had they been able to prove their claim regarding the cost at which they were producing the material. We had a powerful check over costs by reason of the fact that we- had a mill which was toning out material, and a clothing factory which was making up that material. Each year from 1915 to 1922 the factory became more successful, and was able to disclose a larger profit. Why should there have been such sudden haste on the part of the Government to get rid of it? I think that I have seen in the press the statement that &#163;100,000 was the profit on the last two years&#39; working - &#163;47,000 for one year and &#163;53,000 for the other. Those Huge profits were made despite the fact that the amount written off for depreciation of both machinery and buildings was very considerable. Will any one who knows anything about building say that these splendidly constructed brick buildings, built according to the specifications of the Government architect, with every provision for durability and stability, were not in 1923 worth double the sum which they cost to erect? I would defy any contractor to build for &#163;160,000 in 1923 a mill which in 1914 cost &#163;80,000 to erect. That is a moderate estimate. The .cost o&#62;f the buildings themselves would be 100 per cent, greater to-day than it was ten years ago. The newness is not worn off the machinery; rather have the few years, during which it has run perfected it. </para>

          <para>The Government hurriedly called for tenders for the purchase of the mill. The highest&#34; tender received was about &#163;130,000. One might argue that if &#163;130,000 were the highest price we could get for the mill, that was the value of it. Nothing of the kind. I venture to assert that one of the reasons why there were not more tenders was the enormous value of the plant. Judging it on its production over a series of years, it looked to be a proposition worth half a million pounds or more. A number of people in this country imagine that Government control of business is not as economical and successful as private control. Yet this con-  cern  made a profit of &#163;47,000 in one year ! Is it not conceivable, then, that the reason for the non-receipt of more tenders was that the people who would have been likely to tender considered that the mill would&#34; not be allowed to pass out of the hands of the &#39;Government under about &#163;500,000 ? It possessed .goodwill, as a going concern. It was blessed with everything that promised success to any one who took it in hand. </para>

              <para>- The magnificent machinery would have been allowed to rust, and the willing employees prevented from getting employment, because these people were out to make greater profits from the other mills that they owned.

          <para class="block">Senate and of the community outside this Senate, whichsays it will have nothing to do with Government enterprise. Measured by waste, measured by loss, measured by the standard of . honorable conduct, the present system of production for profit has failed miserably. One would think that no civilizedcommunity would permit a capitalistic concern to purchase such a magnificent plant and allow it to lie idle merely in order that its profits in another direction might continue. That was a real danger. However, a company was formed to purchase the mill, and they tendered &#163;130,000. That price was not accepted. Tenders were called again, and arrangements were ultimately made for the sale of the mill to this company for &#163;155,000.  The original conditions stipulated that a certain deposit should he made and certain annual instalments paid. When the final arrangement was arrived at between the Government and the company, those conditions, which had been submitted publicly to the other tenderers in Australia., were considerably altered in favour of this new company. Was this good business? Was it fair that after a company had made its best offer, the Government should enter into negotiations and give the company something better by modifying the terms extending the period, and reducing the annual &#39; payment ? To my mind, the transaction has quite a sinister aspect. It cannot be said that the Government have thrown defence to the winds altogether. I know they have made such an awful &#34; hash &#34; of Defence administration that we cannot expect anything like a reasonable return for the expenditure of . public money in that direction, but if they intended to continue this pretence of providing for Australian defence, they should have retained the Geelong Woollen Mill. There was no occasion for taste in the disposal of this property. Just prior to the rising of the Senate in March last, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> if he would advise the probable purchasers of the mill that -when the Labour Government came into power again, we would take it back. I have no doubt that it was my sixth sense that prompted me to put the question to the Minister. For some reason or other I felt that this valuable concern was about to be handed over to private enterprise, and that the interests of the people of this country were to be sacrificed. I say now, after having had time to consider my remarks upon that occasion, that when we do get back to office we shall take that <inline font-style="italic">mill</inline> back or put a better one in its place. We shall have no hesitation in resuming it at the price given for it by the syndicate, and I am not so sure that we shall be particular about making an allowance&#39; for depreciation if . we get back to power quickly. </para>

I think that, with 5,000,000. of people - and it will be a day or two before we number . 10,000,000 in Australia- if one of the functions of government is to defend this country, then for the present we must, where possible, maintain all these wealth-producing concerns that enable us to produce profitably those articles that are so essential to the defence of Australia. In my judgment, the clothing of our soldiers is essentially a Government function, quite as essential, in fact, as the manufacture of munitions. </para>

              <para>- Why ? I am not an extravagant man, but if the Government brought down a proposal for the payment of a bonus of &#163;2,000,000 to a private concern to take over Nauru Island, I would vote for it at once, and so save any further expenditure of public money on that venture Nauru is one of the earliest swindles that can be charged against the late Government. It is going to cost Australia thousands of pounds for many years. Nauru was purchased for &#163;3,500,000 by the Governments of Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, Great Britain and Australia being each responsible for 42 per cent., and New Zealand for 16 per cent, of the purchase money. It is now being worked in competition with other phosphate deposits, and, notwithstanding that Commonwealth vessels are lying idle, ships controlled by private enterprise are being employed to transport the raw material to Australia, to be delivered to private enterprise concerns, that charge the Australian farmer practically what they like for the product. The Government, it appears, cannot go the whole distance and decide to manufacture superphosphates as well as provide the raw material. They salve their conscience by saying, &#34; We will go half way in a public enterprise, and half way in a private enterprise.&#34; Owing to the extremely high overhead charges and interest on capital cost, Nauru Island must be a losing concern for a great many years. The Government should get rid of the island. The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline></para>

I say that the Government of a sovereign State can do what the people desire them to do; and the sooner they get rid of Nauru Island the better it will be for all concerned. We should cast off this make-believe and pretence that by continuing our share in the administration of Nauru Island the producers of Australia are going to get cheap phosphates. </para>

              <para>- Not a bit better. I have taken good care that honorable senators should know the history of Nauru. Before the war, the phosphate deposits were being worked, by a German company, and at the outbreak of hostilities our troops captured the island. The shareholders of the old German company sold their holdings to a wealthy British company, headed by Lord Balfour, and subsequently good Australian, British, and New Zealand money was paid to enable the Governments mentioned to asume control. They paid a princely price. So satisfied was the company with the deal that one of its managers received a bonus of &#163;50,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has just suggested that it was good business for the Government to take it over. I say no. </para>

              <para>- It is questionable if it can be produced profitably at the pre-war price, because from answers to questions which I have asked in this Chamber we know that freight is from 20s. to 25s. per ton, and overhead charges about 30s., plus interest on purchase price to get rid of the German shareholders. I have no doubt that the British shareholders who bought out the German company were good enough to hand over to their German &#34;pals&#34; some share of the loot which they got from the Governments  of Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. How can we expect Nauru Island to be worked profitably under the administration of three commissioners and with joint responsibility for medical attendance, education, and control, not only of the natives but of the Chinese coolies, who have been introduced ? I do not want to be the first to throw mud at Commonwealth administration, but I am amazed when I think of all that has happened in connexion with Nauru. During the first year of our administration an influenza epidemic wiped out about 25 per cent, of the Nauruan population. We complain sometimes of criticism that has been levelled at our administration of the Mandated Territories, and I want to say emphatically, so as to mislead no one, that I believe the loss of Nauruan population from influenza was inevitable. At that time influenza ran its course through Australia, and even here the mortality rate was unfortunately very high. If honorable senators peruse the report which was laid on the table of the Senate the other night, they will realize that the outlook is very black. That report states that of the Nauruan population men, women, and children, about one in eight or nine is afflicted with the dread disease of leprosy. It seems as if the ill-luck with which we commence d our  asminis-  t ration is going to follow us right through. I do not hold the Government responsible for that, but I do charge them with the responsibility of introducing &#39;Chinese labour. </para>

              <para>- I cannot say; but my point is that the introduction of Chinese coolies has not resulted in the production of cheap phosphates for Australian farmers. I should imagine that in our own Mandated Territories there i3 an simple supply of native labour for the production of phosphatic rock at Nauru. And, assuming that 500 or 1,000 men are required to work the deposits, is it not possible to get first class white Australian labour ? But, of course, we shall be met with the argument that they could not do the work so cheaply as Chinese coolies. If that is the test, I should let the whole concern go to the Chinese or Nauruans. Personally, I do not want cheap phosphatic rock if it means such a heavy toll in human lives. So long as we remain in control of the Mandated Territories we have a  definite  responsibility for the people whom, we employ there. It so happens that, in my earlier life, I worked for . a time in association with coloured labour, and I can say definitely that, because of the greater output and the satisfactory manner in which the work is done, the employment of able-bodied white labourers is a sound economic proposition. Since we have taken over Nauru the importation of Chinese coolies equals the total of the Nauruan male population. I object to this influx of coloured labour from other countries, with its attendant danger of the introduction of foreign diseases. I want to make myself quite clear. I am not blaming the imported coolies for the introduction of disease; but we must realize that everything we do in connexion with the Mandated Territories is subjected to the keenest criticism of those who have been dispossessed. We should be prepared to face the facts, and have all complaints ventilated in this Parliament. In this matter I intend to get ahead of the critics by saying that I regret the introduction of coolie labour to Nauru, and I believe that the Government should take drastic action to save the native population from the fate which appears to be rapidly overtaking it. One of the remedies I suggest is to cease the employment of the present class of labour, and to see that all the necessary work is done, by good white Australians. </para>

              <para>- Of course, and I suggest that the work be done by white labour, at a good wage. Probably the cost would be great, but it would be a more business-like proceeding than employing coloured labour. Why should we work the phosphate deposits with cheap Chinese labour when the Government refuse to continue the operation of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, which, with white labour, have been showing a profit every year? There is a member of the Nationalist party in South Australia who believes in black labour. I refer to the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Barwell, and perhaps . he has been able to persuade other members of the Nationalist party to share his view. </para>

              <para>- We have been told that the mills at Geelong were disposed of because the Ministry did not believe in Government trading enterprises. There is less justification for continuing the phosphate fields than there was for retaining the Woollen Mills. Those mills played a most important part in our scheme of defence, but that cannot be said of the phosphate deposits. I admit that phosphates are most valuable to the primary producers, but I am not prepared to be a party to obtaining cheap phosphates for the farmers if it means sacrificing principles which the Labour party holds dear. . </para>

          <para>If the Geelong mills, profitable and satisfactorily managed as they have been, can be sacrificed for a mere percentage of their value, why are the Government keeping Nauru going? I know it is only a small island. When the Nauru Island Agreement Bill was before us I tried to make the Senate realize the danger in the proposal, but the woollen mills meant more than Nauru Island to men like Senators Newland, Lynch, Findley, Grant, and myself, who helped to bring the establishment into existence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> played a chief part in their inauguration, and no one knows better than he how during the war they justified the expenditure incurred. To me it is no small matter that these mills have been sacrificed. They represent an experiment in defence legislation that was made by the Labour party, and the people of Australia obtained a good return from the outset. The balancesheets speak eloquently of the business acumen displayed by the Labour Government at that time. That quality was also clearly shown in connexion with the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, which, I understand., the present Government intend to sacrifice. </para>

              <para>- Not for sale, but for destruction. There is a stronger private enterprise &#34;pull&#34; against the Commonwealth Bank than there was against the woollen mills. Once honorable senators opposite put all their influence behind the party in power, whose principle it is to eliminate Government enterprises, whether they are profitable or not. I fear to think what will happen to the Commonwealth Bank. Judging by an announcement made at Christmas time last year, the system of management is to be altered, and a Board of five is to be appointed. Since that announcement was made we have unfortunately lost the splendid services of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, who did invaluable work in lifting the Bank to its present proud position in the financial world. He was a great man, who did a great work well. The Bank has now reached a position when it should have its operations extended, not for the purpose of crushing out of existence other banking institutions, but for expanding its business as other banks are doing. In a very brief period, owing to the advantageous position it occupies, it would naturally capture practically the whole of the banking business of Australia, to the great profit of the people. Supporters of the Government do not object to Government ships being employed for the purpose of bringing immigrants to Australia. By what better means could Australia . be made productive than by using the Commonwealth Bank to help in the development of this country by land settlement ? </para>

It threw its doors open to the press, and removed from the executive every man who had had anything whatever to do with improper practices. That is a thing which the Nationalists have not yet done. Somebody stated on one occasion that the Labour party had lost its soul. I maintain that the Nationalist party has not possessed a soul in the same sense as the Labour party has. </para>

It is true that somebody had ballot-boxes that it would be possible to fake, but there was no evidence that such ballot-boxes had been used. The fact that the Labour party was prepared to place the whole matter under the public gaze shows that the party has not slumped. The Labour party is trying to do the work it set out to perform.

              <para>- Tha t is the principle tolerated by honorable senators on the other side. There was a deposit insisted upon in connexion with the sale of the woollen mills, but it was so small that the syndicate who purchased it could have recouped themselves to the extent of the deposit as soon as they had set the mill going. They were practically presented with the mills. Of course, we shall be told that all the people comprising the syndicate are honorable men. That is possibly true; but I am not attacking them personally. I am attacking the principle of disposing of a profitable Government undertaking. It is commonly understood that private enterprise is out to make money, and the people in pursuit of wealth do not, as a rule, pause to see if there is anything wrong with the way in which they are making it. The Labour party has been fighting so long in the public interests that once our opponents find an opening for criticism . of anything we have done, they eagerly take advantage of it. When a person is in the habit of getting drunk, his neighbours become used to the spectacle, and do not take much notice of it; but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> or myself became intoxicated, we would probably lose our seats. In the same way, the press were only too pleased to make full use of the allegation about faked ballot-boxes, because it provided them with scare headlines for a public ever on the alert for sensational news items. The proceedings of the last Labour Conference show that our party is honest, and determined that its affairs shall be conducted on &#39;straightforward lines. </para>

              <para>- I have already admitted that such boxes were discovered ; but if at the church the honorable senator attends, a shilling or two were stolen from the plate, he would not contend that the principle for which the church was established was wrong; and so it is with any other institution. I am not belittling the seriousness of the incident  of the ballot-boxes, but the &#34; mouthful &#34; our opponents make of it creates the impression that that is the only means by which they hope to be able to bring discredit upon us. The press is constantly publishing reports that we have altered our constitution so as to admit the &#34; red &#34; element to our movement. There has been no alteration of one word or line of the Labour party&#39;s constitution for the purpose of admitting any section. If honorable senators opposite were sincere, they would welcome the fact that the &#34; reds &#34; had joined the Labour party, because any member of the extreme section who joins the Labour movement pledges himself to the platform of that organization, which functions on constitutional lines. </para>

              <para>- That is so; but it is worth noting the marvellous change of public opinion between December and May. One can quite understand it. In December the great leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> said to the people of Queensland, &#34;The sugar agreement is all right, and you can rest assured that it will be renewed.&#34; That promise greatly influenced the election. The election over, honorable senators opposite had no further use for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and they butchered him as they now propose to butcher the sugar agreement. The Queensland people awakened and rubbed their eyes, and in the rub, both the Country and the Nationalist parties, at the last Queensland State elections, received the most severe drubbing they had ever experienced. The Theodore Govern ment, which had held . office for eight years, was then&#39; returned with a majority of fourteen, when just previously it had carried on by a proxy vote. It. is a record unrivalled in the history of Australia. </para>

              <para>-We used not to take notice of such interjections two years ago, but if the honorable senator will examine the figures he will find that in December last the Labour party were in a minority by 38,000 votes, whereas in May of this year they had a majority of from 8,000 to 10,000 votes. All the faked rolls imaginable will not alter these figures. I merely refer to the Queensland elections to show the rapid change which took place in public opinion. In December, after the Federal elections, the Nationalist members said, &#34; Wait until Theodore goes out.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> took these men at their word, and went before the electors in May instead of in October, and we know theresult. </para>

The Labour party will meet the Government as far as possible on legitimate legislation, but as soon as they commence to unduly cram and rush measures through this Senate, opposition will be rife. For a. long time proper consideration has not been given to the legislation of this country. Towards the close of the session Bills have been flung at the Chamber, and the Standing Orders have been suspended, to enable them to be rushed through. That practice has to end. </para>

          <para>Why should the Prime Minister go to England? Are the conditions in Australia so serious that the Prime Minister cannot allow any of his colleagues to guide the destinies of this country during his absence ? If so, the Prime Minister should not go abroad. I know that an important Defence Conference is to be held in England, but are not the affairs of Australia more important? I heard the Prime Minister speak for the first time at the Sydney Show. He spoke with a good deal of optimism, and told the producers that no matter how bad the conditions might be, those in the future would be better. Increased production can result only from the earnest consideration of the affairs of this country, and not from a promise of good things to come. Important as the Defence Conference may be, the business of Australia has first claim. It is certainly very good of the Prime Minister to promise to let Parliament know the nature of his important duties in England before he leaves these shores. Honorable senators who have taken their seats in this Chamber to-day have no idea of the seriousness of the position of this country. Our indebtedness is growing each year. Although a surplus will be shown this year, there is an increasing public debt. Since the war ended, nearly five years ago, each year has shown an increasing public debt. Australia is certainly in a much better position than is any other nation to recover from the war burden, and to relieve the producers of this country from the load of taxation. It is impossible to right the affairs of Australia if the Government insist on a few hurried weeks of session, necessitating the rushing through of measures without consideration, so as to enable the Prime Minister to attend the Defence Conference. Of what immediate importance is the Conference to Australia ? Surely the Government are cognisant of our needs for defence? After the experience of the war the Government should have an accurate knowledge of what Great Britain requires from Australia in the event of war. If we have to rely on the Prime Minister gathering this information from Great Britain, it is a very sad state of affairs. There is no good reason wiry <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> should leave Australia at present, but there are hundreds of good reasons why he should remain here. </para>

              <para>- The Government have been in office for five months. They have a great deal to their discredit and nothing to their credit. They have not sold the woollen mills; they have given them away. They are hurrying this session to a close so that the Prime Minister may go to England to participate in a Defence Conference, with possibly disastrous consequences to Australia, while he leaves untouched matters in Australia requiring his immediate attention. I am old-fashioned enough to believe that it is a mistake to put untrained, untried, and comparatively unknown men into positions of great responsibility in this country, and now one of these inexperienced men, as soon as he gets into such a position, proposes to hurry away so that he may deal overseas with matters that  are-vague  and uncertain, while leaving the realities of Australian public life to &#34; take care of themselves until his return. The Prime Minister is determined to close this </para>

              <para>- There was nothing in it. That was the trouble. He told them to be hopeful when they could see the earnings of a lifetime departing from them. Words count for nothing. Actions count for everything. That is why I prefer the Prime Minister to remain in Australia and face Australia&#39;s difficulties fairly and honestly in the interests of all classes. I regret his decision to close this Parliament until it is his pleasure to return from England. I regret the fact that the seriousness of the present position is not being consideredby the Government. What promise is given in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech that we shall have an opportunity to deal with the huge financial  commitments of the Commonwealth? There is no common-sense proposal before us to deal with the heavy interest bill, which is steadily mounting up as each year goes by. Ministers who have shouldered the responsibilities of managing theaffairs of Australia propose to rest while their leader attends a Defence Conference on the other side of the world. They are a Ministry of Australians, and surely Australia should be their first consideration. I hope that this will be the last time that they will run away from the public duties which demand their attention in Australia. The  serious work of administering the affairs of this country requires that they shall be at their posts in Australia, and not on the other side of the world. </para>

          <para>In conclusion, I reiterate my complaint against the manner in which this session has commenced, and against the slight put upon the Senate through the opening of the session before the new senators could be sworn in. I trust that even at the eleventh hour the Government will see the error of their ways, and realize that the seriousness of the position in Australia requires that the Prime Minister shall remain here, and not go across the water to discuss defence and other problems in England. </para>

            <para>. - I welcome to the Senate the new senators elected at the last election, and trust that their service here will be interesting to themselves and of benefit to the country. With regard to the statement of the Leader of the Opposition as to the attitude the Opposition will take up towards the Government, I can only say that, if it adheres to the course of action he has outlined, the Government will have no cause for complaint. As honorable senators opposite were elected to oppose the Government, Ministers must naturally expect from them vigorous criticism of their administration and measures, but that sense of public duty which must animate all honorable senators should cause &#39; them in offering vigorous opposition, possibly for party purposes or party motives, not to lose sight of that which is above all party considerations, namely, the interests of the nation. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>commenced his speech with a complaint as to the manner in which Parliament had been called together, and he endeavoured to make it appear that the Government had deliberately slighted the new senators. A very cursory examination of the facts will show that such an accusation is quite wide of the mark. The facts are that the financial year ends on the 30th June, that new senators could not take their seats before that date, that Supply had been exhausted, and that it was necessary to pass a new Supply Bill granting two months&#39; Supply before the end of the financial year,so that the Departments might meet the obligations that are cast upon any Government occupying the Treasury bench. It was not sufficient for another place to grant Supply; The Senate had also to pass the Supply Bill before it could become law. The Government were therefore forced to call Parliament together before the newlyelected senators could take their seats. At the same time they recognised theirduty towards the newly-elected senators by adjourning the debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address- </para>
          <para>Most of the honorable senator&#39;s speech was devoted to a revival of the question of the sale of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong. The Government not only had the authority of Parliament to sell those mills; we can also claim that the proposal received the indorsement of the people of Australia. The projected sale of the mills was before the people when the elections were being held. Tenders had been called, but the sale had not been effected when the election was in progress. </para>

I do not propose to go into the whole history of this matter, which has already been dealt with in previous debates in this Chamber. Prior to and during the war the mills were a success ; they were well managed, and they played a very important part in providing the clothing required by our troops during the war. The tremendous demand that arose through the war conditions, and the subsequent conditions arising out of the war, enabled the mills to show a large profit; but any one who looks at the matter impartially must </para>

              <para>- I was Minister for Defence when the Commonwealth Woollen Mills were installed, and I know what was intended of them. It was certainly never intended that the plant should be utilized to supply cloth for private individuals, or that the mills should enter into competition with establishments that were supplying the public outside. Even in &#39; the days of the Labour Government, the &#39; operations of the mills at Geelong were limited to the meeting of departmental requirements only. During the war, when the demand increased enormously, our mills had to be extended, as had to be done with all other woollen mills in Australia; but when the war was over, that demand ceased, and in order to keep the whole of the plant employed, an arrangement was entered into with the Returned Soldiers&#39; Association, under which our mills were to provide cloth for sale to returned soldiers. That demand replaced what was lost owing to the cessation of the war, and enabled the mills to be carried on at a profit. For a few years following the termination of - the war we still had a demand from State Governments for cloth for railway, police, and other uniforms; hut from time to time those Governments, yielding to pressure which was exerted to have these orders placed with firms in their own States, withdrew them from the Geelong mills. The contract with the soldiers expired last year, and they did not propose renewing it, because, meanwhile, they had formed a co-operative company for the establishment of their own mill.We were faced with the absolute certainty that, in the coming year, if they had any orders, they would place them with the mill which they had established with their own money. Wo were faced, also, with a tremendous decrease in the number of cadets and trainees in the Military Forces, and a reduction in the demand from the Navy. To be kept fully employed, the mill would have had to go to the outside markets, compete with private enterprise, and sell the cloth that is required for public use. Honorable senators opposite may believe that that is the right thing to do. It is not the policy of the Government. The Government realized that, unless they adapted that course, the mill could not be retained, because only a very small part would have been required to operate to fulfil the orders for the Navy and the Army. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to the mill as a factor in defence, and compared it with the Small Arms Factory. The analogy is misleading. There are other woollen mills in every State of the Commonwealth, excepting Western Australia, and one is about to be established there; but there is no Small Arms Factory in any State other than that established by the Commonwealth, nor is therelikely to be one, because there is no private demand for the output of such a factory. If this country is to be self-sufficient in the provision of its small arms, it must have its own small arms factory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has spoken as though the mill ceased to operate when it was sold. He said that we retained Nauru, where the phosphatic deposits are being worked with coloured labour, but sold the woollen mills, which were being worked with white labour, inferring that the woollen mills were not being continued. They are being continued ; white labour is still being employed in them. </para>

It was the first Hughes Nationalist Government which took that action. I ask honorable senators to carry back their minds to the Versailles Conference, because that is where the fate of Nauru was decided. At that Conference all the islands in the Pacific that had been under the control of Germany were at the disposal of the Allies. Japan, as well as Britain, had some claim upon those islands. If Britain had not been given Nauru, J apan, having the next best claim, would have secured it. I ask honorable senators to remember that. Therefore, if honorable senators say that we should not have taken Nauru, they are saying inferentially that Japan should have had it; because that was the only other Power which had any claim to it. </para>

              <para>- Nauru waa handed over not to Australia, but to Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. Before the war, a company, which was mainly German in its composition, owned those phosphate fields, and was exploiting them. The Government of the day thought it would be unwise that that great deposit of phosphatic  rock,  which is so necessary for the production of superphosphates, should be allowed to pass back to the original owners, or to fall into private hands; they thought that, in view of the value of this phosphatic deposit, at should remain in the hands of the Government. So the rights of the British and allied shareholders, in the company were acquired, and the company ceased to operate. Britain, New Zealand, and Australia became partners in a joint exploitation of that phosphatic rock: Australia to-day is obtaining superphosphates more cheaply than any other country in the world, largely because that phosphatic rock is being provided at cost price to the manufacturers of superphosphates in Australia. No profit is being made out of the supply of that phosphatic rock. </para>

              <para>- There is a monopoly. Owing to the fact that the &#39;three countries were partners it was decided that the rock mined should be sent to those countries proportionately to their degree of ownership. As a matter of fact, neither Great Britain nor New Zealand has been in a position to take the full share of the phosphatic rock to which it is entitled, and as a consequence Australia has had not only her share, but that which New Zealand and Britain have been unable to take. The possession of Nauru has thus been of greater advantage to Australia than to either of the other two partners. I am astonished that any honorable senator should say it was not in the. interests of Australia that that arrangement should &#39;have been made. </para>

              <para>- The phosphates are sold to quite a number of private companies, but so far as I know it has not been contended that those companies are charging an undue price or making unduly large profits. These companies are in Australia, in competition one with the other, and as far as I know they are satisfactorily meeting the demand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said that white labour is not employed on this island. That is quite true. It was not worked with white labour at any time. I have yet to learn that &#34;the Labour party; as it was constituted prior to 1916, claimed that the White &#39; Australia policy had to be extended to the islands of the Pacific. It did not do so. I do not know whether the Official Labour party to-day makes that, claim; in fact, if you listen to some of the alleged spokesmen of the Official Labour party to-day you will learn that they have no sympathy with the White Australia policy ; they believe in international brotherhood, and are prepared to welcome to Australia as a brother any coloured person. The Seamen&#39;s Union has already announced that it has no sympathy with, and does not support, the policy of a White Australia. </para>

              <para>- Because there is not a sufficient supply of native labour in Nauru. The report to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has referred shows that the total population of the island - men, women, and children - is somewhere about 1,100 or 1,200. Obviously, there is not sufficient native labour, even if they were all willing to take on the work. For various reasons we .do not desire to exploit the native labour. When the terms of employment of the Chinese have expired they have been re-indentured, or a sufficient number of others have been&#34; brought in to carry on the work in their place. </para>

              <para>- The labourers from other than European countries at present employed on the island number 578. Indentured labourers who went to the island during the year numbered 356, of whom 288 were Chinese. The number that left the island during the year was 391, of whom 216 were Chinese. It will thus be seen that there has not been any considerable increase in the number of Chinese. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>referred to the treatment of the natives, but did not bring forward any specific charge. Though he mentioned the unfortunate outbreak of disease during the Australian occupation of the island, I do not think he suggests that it would not have occurred if we had not been in possession. The report which was laid on the table to-day shows that, under the splendid administration of General Griffiths, work on the island has been carried out with the utmost regard for the interests of the natives. It is well known that the native population is decreasing in some of the Pacific Islands, but this is not the case at Nauru. The birth-rate for last year was 53 per 1,000 of the mean population, the highest on record, and the death rate was 14.37 per 1,000. As there are about 1,200 natives on the island, there would be approximately 106 births last year, and there would be, at that rate- </para>

              <para>- The facts are in this report. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> nor anybody else can refute them. They are all to the credit of Australian administration of the Mandated Territories. It is admitted that leprosy has increased at Nauru, put the disease has always been prevalent in the Pacific Islands. It was known to exist amongst the natives when the Pacific Islands were discovered by the white race, and therefore the recent outbreaks cannot be laid at the door of the white race, or of the Chinese coolies who have been introduced. The disease is native to the islands, but for the first time in the history of Nauru the Government have engaged a capable bacteriologist, and men skilled in the treatment of the disease, to combat its ravages. This was not done during German administration. It is being done by Australia, and we are hopeful that, with the greater knowledge of scientific and medical men, we may be able to cope with the disease, and eventually stamp . it out of the island. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said it seemed as if the Nauruans were being wiped out. The facts, according to the report I have quoted, are that they are on the increase. They aTe one of the few Pacific islanders who, in contact with white and Asiatic races, are increasing in numbers. </para>

Is itproposed to reinstate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> in the Labour movement ? The charges which he made, and for which he was expelled, have been proved. Is any restitution now to be made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts? Senator Gardiner</inline> might very well have told us something about that phase of the business. He has assured us that, notwithstanding that recently they admitted to their ranks the Communist party of Australia, which is associated with the Third International of Moscow, the Labour party are still in favour of constitutional methods of reform. </para>

              <para>- That admission by the honorable senator is interesting. But we happen to remember that not so long ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden,</inline> who is the secretary of the Sydney Labour Council, returned fromRussia. We remember also his statement, that the policy of the Communists was to get into the Labour party and &#34; white ant &#34; it. We are justified in assuming, therefore, that in opening the door to these gentlemen the Labour Conference practically invited them to &#34; white ant &#34; the party. In this way they hope eventually to reach their objective and overturn society. </para>

              <para>- We remember also that this matter has been dealt with by an important historical figure, greater even than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden</inline> himself, namely, M. Lenin, the High Priest of Communism. M. Lenin, so we have been informed, has declared to the world that their best line of policy is to &#34; whiteant &#34; not only the constitutional Labour party but the trade union movement, in order to enlist the strength of organized Labour on the side of revolutionary action. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> merely touched the fringe of this subject. He could have gone very much further, as he has done on other occasions - not always when the press were present - and have given us his views on the introduction of these Communists into the Labour movement. I object to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> efforts to make the people of Australia believe that the Official Labour party of to-day is identical in spirit with the Labour party prior to 1916. It is as different as day is from night. </para>

I was associated with the Labour party from my youth up.I grew up in the movement. When I look at some of the men now associated with it, and who speak of themselves as its leaders, and when I read their speeches, I can say absolutely without fear of successful contradiction, that the Labour party of to-day is not the Labour party to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has been referring, and which for many years occupied the Treasury benches in the Federal and State Parliaments of this country, leaving to its credit a record of useful legislation. </para>

              <para>- The difference is in ideals, in motives and in the internal machinery of the party. In the days when I was associated with it, any man who talked revolution would not have been listened to for a moment. It is true that revolutionaries were then abroad in the land, but they were not in the Labour party. They came in after 1916 in their hundreds. Since that year these men, who, up till then, had never lifted a finger for Labour, have ever been ready to denounce the older members of the movement who parted company with it on a vital issue. They now speak of themselves as the leaders of and spokesmen for Labour. </para>

          <para class="block">I have no desire to weary honorable senators with a reiteration of what is current history, and, therefore, I shall turn to another phase of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> remarks. Apparently the honorable senator has been reading the newspapers in which, when it suits him, he believes implicitly, and so he charges the Government with an intention to adopt extreme measures in order to further their policy. I suggest that he should mete out to the Government the same treatment that he would like to receive himself - that he should not accept all press statements as necessarily true, but should criticise us on &#39; what we ourselves say we intend to do. I defy the honorable senator to find in any of the speeches made by Ministers, justification for his charges. We have said that there is a certain amount of work to do, and we believe that if Parliament will devote itself to the business there will be ample time to debate all measures presented. But if honorable senators, in the full exercise of their rights, refuse to discuss the business brought forward by the Government, and tak&#169; up the time of the Senate in inventing subjects for discussion or in using the forms of the Senate merely for the purpose of preventing the Government from dealing with the measures that the country  has been promised, we shall put up a fight, and ask our supporters to assist us in order that time shall not be wasted on frivolous and non-essential matters. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>remarked that if the Government wished the session to be brought to an early close, to enable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> to go to the United Kingdom, the Government ought to select one or two measures and ask Parliament to pass &#187;them. I point out that the Government have selected the measures we think should be passed, and, in doing so, we have paid due regard to the limited time at the disposal of Parliament. It may be that all the measures foreshadowed cannot be dealt with this session, and in that case we may have to take the more urgent ones. The honorable senator spoke as though Parliament would soon go out of existence. It is merely suggested by the Government that, when the time comes for the delegation to leave for Great Britain, Parliament shall go into recess, but early in the New Year meet again to proceed with the remainder of the business. That is not a very terrible proposal. I suggest that the Government, in their own interests, are not likely to bring down measures that are not necessary, or that require a greater amount of time than we shall be able to give to them this session. If honorable senators will glance through the list of Government proposals, they will see a number of important, though small, Bills which, in the ordinary course of events, axe usually left until the end of the session and rushed through in great haste. On the present occasion, however, these measures have been brought down early in the session, and there will be full opportunity for honorable senators to study them, and, if they will allow themselves time, to discuss them. </para>

              <para>asked why the Prime Minister wished to <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> to Great Britain. He said that defence was an important matter, but he asked whether we had no important Australian subjects to consider. I venture to think that defence is an important Australian matter, and it is probably more vital -to us than to any other part of the British Empire. Will any honorable senator say that we in Australia can adequately deal with the question of defence ourselves? If we are to have an &#39;efficient defence system that will be worth anything to us, we must have the assistance and co-operation of the rest of the Empire. I contend, therefore, that the proper place to discuss that matter is in the Mother Country at a Conference at which the other parts of the Empire will be represented. It is  essential, therefore, that Australia should have its Prime Minister at the Conference, which will be the first of the kind held since the war to deal with the defence of the Empire in all its parts. One has only to consider the subject of naval defence to realize how important it is. If Australia were attacked, the trouble would first come from .the sea, and, without the British Navy, we should be in a very parlous condition indeed. </para>

          <para>Defence is not the only subject to be dealt with at the Imperial Conference. There is, for instance, the trade problem to be solved. When we consider what is happening to primary production in Australia we must realize the growing importance of finding adequate markets for our goods. Every effort is being made to increase the number of people engaged in primary production. The growth in the production of fruit has been enormous, but of recent years we have not been able to dispose, profitably of the crop raised. Every year the problem is becoming more acute, and as time goes on production will increase not simply twofold or fourfold, but eight or tenfold, and, unless we take some action for the purpose&#39; of extending our markets, our producers will be in a very serious predicament. There is a tremendous market for our produce within the Empire, and, therefore, the Government contend that the subject of Empire trade is an important one for consideration at the Imperial Conference. If satisfactorily dealt with, it will settle one of the gravest problems that faces Australia. Let me mention merely one article that we produce. Dried fruits of unsurpassed quality are being produced in very great quantities in the Commonwealth. The State of Western Australia, for instance, is becoming a large producer of raisins, currants, and other dried fruits. In Canada there are over 10,000,000 white people who produce no dried fruits whatever, and they are to-day supplied from outside the Empire. Could there not be some arrangement or mutual concession by which we could supply Canada with this commodity? What a tremendous impetus it would give to Australian trade ! It would be a grand thing for the fruit-growers throughout the Commonwealth. Honorable senators are well aware of other products in which interEmpire trade on common-sense lines would be of mutual benefit. </para>

No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was disappointed because the Prime Minister&#39;s speeches in New South Wales caught the public imagination, and because he attracted large and appreciative audiences.

The honorable &#34; senator stated that we should face Australian questions. P maintain that the Government are doing that. We invite Parliament to face them. The Ministry are dealing with some matters that have been left too long in abeyance, and there has been a determined attempt to grapple with some of the important questions that are ripe for settlement.

              <para>- It was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> closing sentence that most disappointed me. He stated that the Ministry was Australian in name only. I have on many occasions heard the honorable senator declare in his eloquent fashion that at least the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth should be Australian born. The members of the present Administration are all Australian born. We have done our best to furnish a Government such as the honorable senator would approve, but still he is not happy. I can only hope that as the session goes on, and as the various measures are brought forward, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> even against his will, will be forced to recognise the sense of justice and equity with which the Government are facing the problems confronting Australia, endeavouring to legislate in the best interests not of any class, but of the whole of the people. I hopeit will be admitted that the Government are attempting to place the country on a sane financial footing. We desire to govern on constitutional lines by setting our face against revolution. We are anxious that the people shall lead contented and prosperous lives, and obtain a fair return for their labour. </para>

            <para>.- In the first place, I desire to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that honorable senators on this side are not members of the &#34; Official Labour party.&#34; There is no such party. It is the Australian Labour party - as it was, as it is, and as it always will be called - to which we belong. If honorable senators opposite look along the benches on this side today they will notice that there has been an increase in the Labour representation in this Chamber; but otherwise there is no difference. Turning for a moment to the other House, I am reminded of the remark of a visitor from Western Australia, who stated that his experience in this Parliament had been a very pleasant one. He stated that he had listened in the House of Representatives to the finest speeches he had ever heard, but, unfortunately, they had all come from the Opposition. Among the members of the Labour party in this Parliament there is not a single Communist or revolutionary. The ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was not a member of the Labour party at its inception. He came in from the ranks of the &#34; red-raggers &#34; and communists, in exactly the same way as these other men are doing to-day. He has since altered his views, and these men will do the same. The Labour party is just as good as, or better than, it was prior to 1916. A country newspaper published in New South Wales recently lamented the inability of the Country party to show any semblance of a fight in this Parliament, and referred to their position in these words: - </para>

          <para>There was  a  young lady of Riga </para>
          <para>Who went for  a  ride on  a  tiger; </para>
          <para>They returned from the ride with the lady inside. </para>
          <para>And a smile on the face of the tiger. </para>
          <para class="block">The Country party combined with the Nationalist party, and, in consequence, were, like the Lady of Riga, completely swallowed. They are like dumb dogs, and dare not express the views of the people who sent them to this Parliament. I have been associated with the Labour movement for nearly half a century, and I prefer to retain my old associations rather than follow the tactics of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and those who with him left this party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> when moving the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, stated that he would confine his remarks to two or three subjects, of which he had had some experience. I shall do the same. The honorable senator submitted figures in connexion with the industrial position of this country, and also with immigration. He &#34; put his foot &#34;on the Labour party of New South Wales because of their condemnation of immigration at a recent conference. The Labour party at that conference did not condemn immigration; in fact, they invited the right class of immigrant to Australia in unlimited numbers. They formulated a scheme to accomplish this object, and I shall put it on record so that  there can be no- doubt as to its authenticity. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>stated that the Government had a mandate from the people to do certain things; but that is not so. They were beaten from one end of Australia to the other, with the one exception of Queensland, and the Labour party were given a mandate by the people to incorporate their platform in the statute books of the Commonwealth. Had the Government been successful at the recent elections, figures would have been published by the press to show that they had been given a mandate by a majority of the electors; but the newspapers were strangely silent. After the Queensland election, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> compiled elaborate figures, showing the number of votes required to elect Nationalists and Labour men respectively, but he was quite mistaken. When the final results were published, it was found that the Labour party had a preponderance of votes ; but I have seen no notification to that effect in any newspaper, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> is just as silent. The people returned to this Chamber eleven Labour members and seven supporters of- the Government. Who had the mandate? Not the seven, but the eleven. These are figures as to the first No. 1 and essential, votes: - </para>

          <para class="block">Taking the Federal -returns for the Country and Nationalist parties together, we still have Labour with a majority in every State excepting Queensland. How can any one in the face of these figures pretend that this Government had a mandate to sell the woollen mills or any other Commonwealth venture? They had no mandate, and should at once have definitely appealed to the electors. Instead of doing so, they attempted to govern this country with a half mandate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> stated that he was ashamed of the action of the Labour party, at their Conference, in respect of immigration. I propose, in reply to him, to give the Senate the following accurate report of the committee appointed to deal with that question : - </para>

          <para>The Australian Labour party is against the people of this State being overburdened with interest on financial credit from oversea for immigration until- adequate provision is made  for the working class of this country. </para>
          <para>The working class, of this country have not been consulted in any way on the question of immigration, but the whole matter has been arranged by the representative of the capitalist class - the Nationalist Government. We therefore strongly protest against the working class being excluded in the consideration of any scheme. </para>
          <para>We also disapprove of the Nationalist Government being used to have land made available which in most cases is over-valued as well as unsuitable -for purpose used. </para>
          <para>The Australian workers warn the- workers of Britain and other countries that, the Australian labour market in every branch of industry and on the land is amply provided for, and in, most cases glutted with masses of unemployed, workers. </para>
          <para>They further warn all fellow-workers overseas to disregard any immigration policy which is not indorsed by the trade unions and the Australian Labour party of this country. </para>
          <para>Recognising; nevertheless, the fact that many thousands of deluded workers are being continually dumped on the Australian labour market with no guarantee whatever of stable employment, it is recommended, in accordance with &#34;the proposal of the Australian Labour party,, Western Australian branch, that a Labour immigration depot should be established in each State of the Commonwealth for&#39; the reception and information of immigrant workers. </para>
          <para>The principal duties of such Labour immigration depots should be - </para>

          <para>We further demand that a more drastic examination of immigrants should bo made both prior to embarkation and on arrival in Australia in order to prevent the introduction of diseased and mentally deficient persons. Such examination be made to cover all diseases that would tend to undermine the health of the nation. Tt is clear that many immigrants arriving are mentally deficient, and are becoming a charge upon the State. </para>
          <para>The sub-committee therefore suggests that each State Labour Council should be invited to confer with each State branch of the Australian Labour party for the purpose of establishing such Labour immigration depots by joint action. </para>
          <para>As an illustration of the cruel callousness of the present system of enticing people to migrate to these lands where there is no organization whatever to provide for their employment without displacing other workers, a case brought under the notice of the <inline font-style="italic">Labour News,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J. McKell,  M.L.A., is worth publication. </para>
          <para>The family concerned was induced to come to Australia by the glowing pictures which are painted by Nationalist agents and others - who, by the way, should be prosecuted for false pretences - and the father being unable to secure employment, the unfortunate people soon found themselves in a poor tenement in Redfern totally without furniture or warm covering, and practically starving. </para>
          <para>Although located in a district in which many of the people are more or less continually on the bread line, be it said to the credit of Redfern that when the condition of the family became known the neighbours immediately came to the rescue and speedily relieved immediate, needs. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKell</inline>has now appealed to the Minister of Labour and Industry in the following letter: - <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr.- ,</inline> of- street, Redfern. arrived from the Old Country on the 6th January of this year accompanied by his wife and eight children. </para>
          <para>As a returned soldier he was receiving a pension of &#163;2 5s. 5d. per week, but voluntarily had it reduced to Ids. per week so as to permit of his leaving for Australia. He came out under the free immigration scheme with the impression that there would be work awaiting him. Since his arrival he has done practically no work, and feels that there is very little prospect of his obtaining any. At present the whole family is in a state of destitution, and expect any moment to be turned OUt of their house on account of arrears in rent. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- interviewed</inline>me for the purpose of having me request you that he should be found employment or repatriated. </para>
          <para>Trusting that this matter will receive your earnest and careful consideration.&#34; </para>
          <para>In view of the above, is it any wonder that Labour opposes bringing more people here to swell the already large numbers of unfortunate out-of-works? &#39;Provide employment and then people are welcome in numbers unlimited. </para>
          <para class="block">The Labour party welcomes these people in unlimited numbers so long as employment is provided for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said that in a country like this no man should be obliged to look for work or walk the streets on the bread-line. I wonder if he ever walks from this Chamber into the street and sees the poor, slinking figure of some unfortunate hungry outcast, creeping under the eaves of a building to escape the cold. I have seen the sight too often. In Australia there is nothing for a man who is, workless but to pass on from the &#34; doss house &#34; to the old men&#39;s depot and thence to the grave. Is it to be wondered that we declare that our own men should first have employment before we ask other people to come here? <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Fuller has told the people of England that there are no workhouses in Australia. As a matter of fact, in Sydney there are three homes for old men, and in those institutions I have seen some of the finest Australians dying. I saw an ex-Minister of the Crown so reduced in circumstances that he had to seek a refuge in one of those institutions. That is the condition of affairs facing the working classes of this country. Some day they will rise in their might. No one will be able to withstand a&#34; forward movement the aim of which is to carry out the teachings conveyed to mankind in the Sermon on the Mount. If the moneyed classes who are now governing Australia will pass sympathetic legislation, there will be no need for any revolution; that revolution which is inevitable will, of course, be brought about by legislative action. Before very long the people will take charge of the administration of this country, and then we shall have again that progressive legislation about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has spoken. The platform of the Labour- party to-day is exactly what it was years ago. It has not changed. Some who were in the movement years ago have since turned to Mammon; others, although they may have differed with the majority of the party on the conscription issue, are still in it. I ask the Government to devote some attention to the matterof unemployment, so that no man may, through inability to secure employment, find it necessary to walk the streets on the bread-line. It is only when attention is given to this problem that we shall have a realization of the hope expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that there will be a contented race of people in Australia, working together for the great good of the country. </para>
          <para>During his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said that he would not confiscate any person&#39;s land, but when one sees that big financial institutions hold enormous tracts of country well served by railways, and refuse to give them up so that they may be put to their legitimate use, one realizes that some law must be passed to compel them to do so. I have with me the report prepared by the Committee of the New South Wales Labour Conference for the purpose of giving <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wignall</inline> an idea of how land has been alienated in New South Wales. A Sydney newspaper &#34; makes no bones &#34; about saying that this report was prepared by &#34; clever men.&#34; It is based on reliable data secured in the Lands Office and in the Statistician&#39;s Office in New South Wales. No one can doubt the figures given. The appendices tothis Committee&#39;s report are as follows: - </para>

      <para>Number 3, 15,989,675 acres, held in occupation under short term, may be available for closer settlement, providing that the improvements when the land falls due are not overcapitalised. </para>

      <para>During the war, as an inducement to the workers to enlist, all sortsof elaborate and extravagant promises were made by the Nationalist Government. They were told that after the war, or upon their return from the war, land would be made available on such terms that it would be almost impossible for them not to succeed. </para>
      <para>Returned men were invited to make application to the Lands Department, undergo an examination for qualification certificates. The result was that 20,000 returned soldiers received qualification certificates, and up to date about 8,000 have been allotted soldier settlement blocks.

        <para>The railway policy of the present Government is also opposed to land settlement by men of limited means, as the freights and fares are exorbitant. For instance, in the, central and eastern divisions there ore about 40,000,000 acres of arable land, only 10 per cent. of which is under cultivation. </para>
        <para>This land is served by railways, but is locked up by land monopolists, and until it is subdivided under reasonable conditions, and put to its proper use, thereby creating loading for the railways, it is impossible to expect the railways to pay from a revenueproducing point of view. The result is that the small area under cultivation has got to bear the burden of heavy freights. </para>

      <para>Sheep Losses Through the Drought. </para>
      <para>During the last few years there has been a loss of over 2,000,000 sheep in this State. This is caused through the lack of a progressive policy of fodder and water conservation, notwithstanding our continued periodical droughts. </para>
      <para>The following is a list, showing the losses through drought during the last twenty years. :  - </para>

      <para>The above districts in the early years employed a large number of men, as the wool industry lends itself more to creating employment than anything else in the grazing industry. In comparison with cattle, the sheep industry employs ten men to one of cattle. </para>
      <para class="block">This, condition has been brought about by the indolence of the moneyed men who are holding the lands of this country. They will not conserve fodder, they will not make provision for an adequate water supply. Their only concern is to load the country with the unfortunates from overseas, and they are continually crying out that labour is too dear. Labour has never been too dear for the pastoral or any other industry. When Vestey Brothers were compelled to close down their meatworks in the Northern Territory, they were absolutely satisfied to pay the rates of wages that were ruling, because they realized that when the pay was good the work was correspondingly well done. They complained of the treatment of the Government. which represents the moneyed class in this great meat industry. If the pastoralists conserved fodder, and made provision for an adequate water supply, to tide them over bad years, there would not be such great losses of sheep during periods of drought.

Coming to Mel-&#39; bourne to-day, I saw a man felling trees on his land. He will not be able to fell the whole of them even ifhe works at it as long as he lives. His is an unbearable life. If the Government adopt my suggestion, they will be doing good work. There are as many as 877 applicants for a block that is worth having. Even when a man succeeds in obtaining a good block, its value has been so increased that his life becomes unbearable in trying to meet the interest payment on the money which he has had to borrow.

        <para>Bathurst&#39;s Unemployed</para>
        <para>Bathurst, Saturday</para>
        <para>Unemployment is becoming acute in the Bathurst district - so acute that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzpatrick</inline> (Minister for Mines) arrives in Bathurst on Wednesday he will be approached by the Bathurst Progress Association with a view to seeing whether any relief work or Government grant can be secured to alleviate the position. The manager of the Government Labour Bureau at Bathurst states that there are over 100 local men, mostly married, on his list. He states that the increased number of unemployed is due to the number of rabbits in the district having been diminished owing to the drought in the first place, but more particularly to the activities of the Bathurst P.P. Board in insisting upon the extermination of the pest. </para>
        <para>Until this year many of the men now unemployed have earned excellent wages rabbit trapping during the midwinter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lorimer</inline> states that the Chinese gardeners have absorbed a surprisingly large amount of labour during the past few months picking peas, beans, and tomatoes, and digging onions and potatoes. The Chinese, he says, engage men, women, and children on the piece-work principle, and pay thorn at the end of theday&#39;s work. The Chinese have reaped prolific harvests this year, and have proved fair and considerate employcers. He has found employment for hundreds of Europeans at the Chinese gardens. </para>
        <para class="block">What a nice prospect if men who come to this country have to walk about our streets until they can get employment from a Chinaman who is making tons of money. I have nothing to say against Chinese personally, but I think it is decidedly unfortunate, to say the least, that white men should be forced to accept work in Chinese gardens. This is one reason why we object to immigration on its present lines. </para>
        <para>I desire now to direct attention to the existing social system which, I think, is largely responsible for much of our present trouble. No one can say that w&#169; are in an ideal position when* a considerable section of our industrial population is on the bread line while huge profits, in some instances amounting to millions every year, are being made by the great financial institutions of the Commonwealth. I am going to give one illustration - again from New South Walesa - in support of my contention. I direct the attention of honorable senators to this significant press statement concerning the profits of the Bank of New South Wales - </para>
        <para>Scarcely a day passes but the capitalistic press and the high priests of big business assure us that &#34; economic ruin faces the country &#34; unless the workers are forced to work increased hours per week and accept reduced wages. </para>
        <para class="block">What a nice prospect ! Because the Court decided that men must work fortyeight hours per week on the Sydney trams, 400 unfortunate men, many of them returned soldiers, have been obliged to join their comrades on the bread line. The Sydney press, in big head-lines, gave us this information recently, and declared that the unemployed included 500 &#34; diggers.&#34; I went to the Sydney . Domain to inquire into the position, and was appalled at the prospect before these men. It is frightful that returned soldiers should be obliged to accept relief from institutions that were not created for that purpose. Their services to this country have been forgotten. It is cruel to think that many of them are now allowed to starve in the streets of our cities. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur,</inline> who declared that these men were unemployable, confessed, when he saw them, that he was wrong. After what happened during the war, any Government that permits this state of affairs -to exist, is not worthy of a people of humanitarian instincts. In my spare time, and at my own expense, I went to do what I could to succour our men in the Great War, and over there 1 saw what I hope I shall never see again. Is it any wonder, after what our men went through, that we rail against war, and against any capitalistic class that lives by war ? Is it any wonder that we protest against any system that permits huge financial institutions to make enormous profits, and build up immense reserves, whilst so many of the working classes are on the bread line? The statement concerning the Bank of New South Wales continues - </para>
        <para>And yet it is a fact that bigger profits ure being made to-day than ever before. Our capitalists cun write off tremendous sums as depreciation, smother up huge parcels of loot in reserve accounts of various kinds, hand out bonus shares to shareholders, send up capital accounts sky-high with watered stock, and yet, despite these tricks of concealment, be compelled to disclose hig profits. </para>
        <para>Last week, the capitalist press stated quite frankly that the Bank of New South Wales, one of the leading financial institutions in the Commonwealth, had made &#34; record profits &#34; during the last six months. And so it had. For the six months ending 31st Mardi last, the profit was &#163;4.32,188 - the largest in the whole of its seventy years&#39; existence. </para>
        <para>The following figures will show the toll it has levied upon the people since the outbreak of war in 1914: - </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="103332192307046_29_8.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>Thus, since the firing of the first shot in the world war - just under nine years ago - this huge corporation has made profits totalling no less than &#163;5,434,974. It has been able to pay a dividend of 10 per cent, every year, has increased its capital from &#163;3,500,000 in 1914 to &#163;0,000,000 at the present time, and, in addition, has notched up its reserve account in the&#34; same period from &#163;2,570,728 to &#163;3,901,645. </para>
        <para>The above figures disclose that, though the bank has paid a dividend of 10 per cent, only, its not profits have been greater than this. The rake-off for the last six months (&#163;432,188) works out at an actual net profit of more than 14 per cent. After paying the customary 10 per cent, dividend, it has managed to stow away into reserves nearly half as much again as that paid to the shareholders. </para>
        <para>So great is the amount in reserve that a straight-out dividend of over 24 per cent, could be paid to the shareholders, and still leave the amount in reserve at the figure it was when the world war started. </para>
        <para>It is evident, moreover, from the foregoing statistics,  that  wages and working conditions are not ruining Australia. </para>
        <para>On the contrary, they prove conclusively that big business could pay higher wages, reduce tlie hours of toil, grant still belter working conditions, and nevertheless secure fat profits for itself, without calling upon the people to shoulder a single penny of the extra cost involved. </para>
        <para class="block">Banks are necessary, but they should be nationalized, and the profits paid into the Consolidated Revenue, or to help a colonization scheme for tho benefit of the people on the land. We do not want to bring people out here with no prospect of remunerative employment. We should follow the example of Western Australia, and provide for group settlement on safe lines. The immensely strong financial position of such institutions as the Bank of New South Wales, which is only one of many throughout the Commonwealth, is one of the contributing causes of our present industrial troubles. &#39;These institutions, many of them, do not know what to do with their surplus money, and frequently invest it abroad, to the detriment of Australia. Many of them also hold large ureas of land for speculative purposes. In this way values are inflated by unsound financial conditions, because those who control the land are able to hold it as long as they like, with the object of extracting the highest profit from its sale. </para>

            <para>- They will only be forced to sell by legislation. Land values taxation of itself will not do much good. Wherever it has been tried, iu effect has been to increase land values. But other legislative means may be employed to force these institutions to make the land available for the people who want it. We do not want to confiscate these lands. Wo should give the owners what they paid for them before the railways passed through them, plus a fair thing by way of interest, and make them available for the settlement of our own people and those who may come here. Our railways are not paying because so much, of tha land through which they run is held by these people. No land tax will shift (hem. Governments are obliged to pay huge sums of money to resume land which, in the first instance, cost very little. This state of affairs, I repeat, ss the cause of much of our present trouble. Labour conditions are good, but they could- be better, and the more they are improved the better it will be for Australia. The Government should courageously tackle this big problem, and not waste. time by referring to what has been done by the Labour party or to some silly business about ballot-boxes, or to the alleged introduction of Communists into the Labour party. In every community there is a certain proportion of extremists, but they have never done any harm. Has the great British Labour party, or any other Labour party, been influenced by them ? I say emphatically they have not. I was one of those who objected to the. admission of the press to the last LabourConference in Sydney. 1 am very glad,, in the circumstances, that press representatives were admitted, and although I was the only delegate who voted against their admission, I do not think I should do so again. I believe that the present Government are attempting to do something for Australia, but their ideas are not big enough. They have no national ideals; they are little Australians; and they have not attempted to grapple with the great national problems. They have offered to hand over to the States powers that properly belong to the Commonwealth Parliament. The Government, have had the audacity to agree to the States taking over the rights of the Commonwealth for . a period of five years. All agree that there should be one taxing master and ons tax gatherer, but the Government aro afraid to say that the Commonwealth should be the tax gatherer. Until the present Ministry awake to a keener sense of their duty, very little can be expected from them. </para>

The Labour party is prepared to grant pairs to those of the Ministerial party who are to comprise the delegation, and surely there is no need to bring Parliament to an early close.
