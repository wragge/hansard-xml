                        <para>- I wish to ask for some information which may be supplied during the recess, with reference to the case of a man named Dalton, a shipwright on one of the Commonwealth vessels, who was to be deported. He left his tools behind him in Melbourne, and was placed on a ship, but by pressure of threats from the Seamen&#39;s Union was put on shore. I should like to know why it was proposed to deport him, and who was responsible for the action taken? </para>

                            Whitton, the Comptroller-General of Customs, and an old and respected public servant, died during last night, and was found dead in his bed this morning. He was at work at his office yesterday, apparently in his usual health, and notice of his death came as a very great shock to us, as I am sure it will to all honorable senators who have been in contact with the deceased gentleman. I feel sure that I am voicing the opinions of all when I express our deep regret and our sympathy with the bereaved widow and family upon this sad occurrence.

                        <para>- I am very glad of that explanation, because it gives me more room for. discussion. The point I want to make is that, just as there are some people who hold a shallow view regarding the revolt of the workers against machinery, so there are some people who take the shallow view that the workers are against newcomers into this country. It is a wrong view. The workers in this country want continuous employment. It is a very fine thing for the man to whom next week&#39;s wages count nothing to speak of the greediness of the man who, perhaps, is out of employment, or who, through the importation of foreigners, may be put out of employment. It is not greediness; it is a fear of want &#39;by himself and family; and, in the condition of this country at the present time, that fear is justified. </para>

                        <para>- If we had in this country a Government that had a desire tq govern Australia as it should be governed, instead of closing Parliament for two or three months at a stretch, it would face the problem of finding employment for the people we have here and for those who come here. If you provide work for the men who are willing to work you will find that the Australian working classes can be just as generous as any other section in this community. </para>

                        <para>- Unemployment has been the problem of the centuries; but never &#39;before has there &#39;been a Democracy in which the workers have governed themselves, a Democracy such as that which we have. I can understand Britain, notwithstanding its magnificent record, being unable to solve the  problem ;because the people who have had the governing of that country have not been the people who have suffered from unemployment. Now that the Government of this country has been placed in the hands of the people who suffer from unemployment the problem can be settled, and it will be settled without very much loss of time when the public find that this Government have not any interest in the matter, and are not going to try and settle it. </para>

                <para>I want to draw attention to a statement that has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook - that no immigrant leaves Great Britain unless employment is waiting for him carrying good wages. I ask the Leader of the Government in this Chamber whether that statement is correct or incorrect? If the Government are making that statement to the people on the other side of the world, well and good; but, before they make it to other people they ought to make it good to the people who are here. If it is a good thing for our Australian representative in London to be able to say that no man leaves Britain for Australia unless employment and good wages are assured, it is a better and a sounder thing to be able to say to the people here who have borne the brunt of the development of this country, and must bear the brunt of the taxation of this country - because nearly all the taxation, through the operation of the Tariff, is placed on the shoulders of the workers - &#34;You shall be assured of continuous work and good wages.&#34; I urge the Government to face this problem in a way in which it has never been faced before, and to settle it by the simple method of providing work for the man who wants to work. </para>

Bruce and Pearce, and the members of their party, have been attacking the objective of Labour, the socialization of industry. If Labour, like little children, has been stumbling in the dark, and has not yet been able to evolve a system that will lead the workers to the position they are entitled to occupy as the producers of the whole of the wealth of this country, that is no &#39;reason why people should imagine that Labour cannot do it. Has not the time arrived to talk of the socialization of industry? Consider the conditions obtaining, at the beginning of last century! Remember the  records  of the Royal Commissions asked for by Lord Ashley! We read that, after ten hours&#39; work in the factories and in the mines, the children became sleepy, and had to be chastised to keep them awake. After a further four hours&#39; continuous work, it was found impossible to keep them awake. </para>

                        <para>- It was just as bard to fight in liberty-loving England, at the beginning of last century, for &#39;the children who were being sweated, as it is to-day to get a free Australian people to mete out justice to children whose fathers and mothers have no means of providing for them. Unless we direct attention to what has happened in the past, nothing will be done. If the present Government, during the coming recess, will introduce a system by which able men and women who require employment will be enabled to earn a fair wage for a fair day&#39;s work, they will deserve- well of the people. The Ministry should not hesitate to take action. Australia&#39;s greatest wealth lies in its possibilities. Every pound spent to-day in the. interests of Labour would return a hundredfold in the near future. If the Government would face the problem of unemployment, there would be no need to jeer at Labour because we do not want strangers coming in, not to share what is on the rich man&#39;s table, but to take from the poorly-spread table of the workers. </para>

                        <para>- There is the cure, and &#34; Those who have ears to hear, let them hear.&#34; Here is a rich and undeveloped country, in which any quantity of labour is available. Any sum spent in the interests of the working classes is sure to give a good return after a few years. It was estimated that, at the &#39;end of last year, there were 36,000 unemployed in Australia, yet thousands of people continue to come to this country, and members of Parliament complain because those who are out of work express the view that the influx of men from Italy, England, Ireland, Scotland, and elsewhere-  is  encroaching upon the little they have. </para>

                        <para>- I do not &#39;think that any one section of the community can provide a cure. Queensland, despite its great resources, cannot hope to do so when thousands of the workers of New South Wales flock across the border to reap the benefits of Labour rule in the northern State. I do not suggest that a cure can be found in five minutes; but it is time that the Federal Government set the stamp of its approval on a system that would end the trouble. We are living here under conditions which make it possible for the few to assure themselves against poverty, while the many are in constant dread of actual want. It is said by some people that men can be induced to work only by the application of the spur of poverty. Their attitude is very much like that of the overlookers in England in days gone by, who flogged little children to make them work. Under the system for which honorable senators opposite stand, we do not flog little children to-day; we practically starve them; and my complaint is that when Labour tries to improve upon that system, my honorable friends opposite misrepresent and vilify us. They use the press to put only one side of our case, and to carefully suppress the other and more favorable side. At the same time, they contend that they are working in the direction of making this a better country in which to live. </para>

                <para>I do not propose to detain the Senate as long as my opening remarks might have suggested. I have availed myself of this opportunity to deal with these matters because I do not think we shall meet again for months. The Government has had the audacity to meet Parliament without a programme, and its Leader has said that he does not desire to live in a country where Labour rules. I take that to be an intimation that he is going to England; that he will stay away as long as possible, and that when he does return it will not be for long. London to-day seems to be the Mecca of Premiers and Prime Ministers. They would have us go to England for everything. They seem to disregard the fact that they have to look to Australia for the men to do the work that keeps the country going. The sooner we all turn our attention to the fact that Australia itself wants looking after, the better for Australia, its Parliaments, and its people. </para>

                    <para>. - I purpose, in supplementing the remarks of my chief <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner),</inline> to draw upon my practical experience. Last Tuesday week I attended a meeting of . the Iron Shipbuilders Union of New South Wales, of which I am proud to be a member. On that occasion twelve new members were elected. Eight of them had arrived recently from Britain. They had their clearances and their union cards, and were what honorable senators opposite would call true Bolsheviks, every one of them. The remaining four were apprentices. Out of our total membership of 1,600 we have at the very most a thousand, or probably only 800, in constant employment. The others are always looking for work, and manage to make a living as the result of mishaps to shipping along the coast. In passing, I would draw attention to the remarkable fact that, with the exception of the Commonwealth Government liners, all shipping on the Australian coast makes for Sydney for repairs. The vessels of the Commonwealth Government line are sent to other countries for repairs. </para>

                        <para>- I shall tell the &#39;honorable senator. A vast number of men in our union are constantly looking for work. I dare say that fully 200 of them earn barely enough to provide a livelihood. They have to scratch along, and, in many cases, do not earn more than an average of &#163;1 a week for the whole year. The eight Britishers who joined our union, at its last meeting, were welcomed, and had extended to them the hand of friendship. At the same time four apprentices - young Australians - joined our ranks.Whatchance will these young Australians have? The new arrivals informed me that they were advised in the Old Country that plenty of work was offering in the Commonwealth Dockyards, Sydney. I know, as a fact, that such information is supplied. </para>

                <para>It seems to me that the National Government should take charge of the whole of the arrangements for the colonization of Australia, and should see to it that the right class of people are brought here. To be successful, we must take away this duty from the States. While the Commonwealth is paying the passages of immigrants to Australia some persons in the States, on the arrival of these people, are consigning them to a life of drudgery in the back country. A number of Dreadnought &#34; boys &#34; were brought out here recently, not by the New South Wales Government, but by a private organization. I saw them as they landed at Sydney, carrying gloves and little canes, and wearing &#34; Teddy &#34; hats and ties. We cannot hope to make settlers of such men. After all, they are men, not boys, and their first anxiety on landing was to ascertain how they could spend on the pleasures of society the few pounds they had. One might as well paint the legs of a &#34;poddy&#34; calf and enter it for the Melbourne Cup in the &#39;hope of carrying off that event, as think of successfully settling such young men in the back country. Their lives have been spent in the cities of the Old World. They have been working behind desks, and on their arrival here they are sent into the backblocks to sleep on bags and to be tormented night after night by mosquitoes and other pests of the bush. With such conditions they are sure to become discontented and to return to the Old Country. Out of 80,000 immigrants, who arrived here in one year, 70,000 have returned. The whole system is wrong, and can be placed on a proper footing only by the Commonwealth taking charge of the work of settling Australia, and building up a class of manhood that will take its proper place in the country. We can best achieve that object by assisting Australians to a greater extent than is now done. </para>
                <para>It is stated in the press that the Government contemplate closing down dockyards in Sydney, where a steam-ship of 12,500 tons burden is almost ready for launching. The material for another vessel is on. hand, ready to be assembled as soon as this steamer is off the stocks. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott-Fell,</inline> the financier, and others of his class, are crying out that the cost of building this steamer has- been excessive; that such work must be carried on elsewhere, and that the dockyard must be closed down. These people, apparently, are unaware of the fact that large sums of money have been expended&#39; in buying the material for the second steamer, which is all ready to be put together, and, that if that work be abandoned, the capital costs will be loaded. I rose in order to draw attention to the fact that this nation is not placing in power men who are able and determined to take the bull by the horns, and do what they should for the benefit of the country at large. The Commonwealth should take full charge of immigration, and see that before people leave the Old Country there is work for them here, so that they may not be left to fight for a living against their fellow men We do not object to immigrants if they are introduced in the right way, but it is certainly not the right way to tell them that there is plenty of work for them in Australia. It is proposed to close down Cockatoo Dock Yard. </para>

                        <para>- Our only source of information, like that of the honorable senator and those with him, is the press. We are told that the British Government are re-organizing their naval workshops and docks at Singapore, and I should think that that fact is significant enough to induce the Government of Australia to follow the example. When I was honorary secretary of the shipbuilding union, and when the Admiralty had charge of the dockyards in Sydney I had a list of all the available men throughout Australia who could be sent to Singapore in case of war and of any mishap to the Pacific Fleet ; but I do not know that the Government have in their possession similar information. I hope and believe that nothing will happen in the Pacific, but seeing that the British Government are preparing for the worst we should also take precautions and organize our staff in case of emergency and keep the dock in our own possession. I am in this Chamber as one of the six representatives of New South Wales to look after the interests of . that State, and that I am doing to the best of my ability. I am sorry to say that for years, honorable senators have allowed their powers as a legislative Chamber to be impaired and taken from them. Matters are now dealt with by- secret conferences in Melbourne, and conferences - even the Methodist Conference - always seems to be arranged for a time when there is something interesting going on in this city. These political conferences have usurped the rights of this Senate and this Parliament, and I should be glad to join with any one in taking steps to have these rights restored and maintained. </para>

                <para>The Labour platform has been thoroughly explained and justified by my Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I am not ashamed, but proud of that platform, and I went before the electors with it showing on my back and on my front. I also went out armed with the moral teachings of our Saviour; and I should like honorable senators who have time during the recess to look into those teachings, with which they will find the Labour platform to-day runs parallel. The Saviour&#39;s command was to love one&#39;s neighbour as oneself, and not to lay up treasure, and on that command the Labour platform is based. I also advise honorable senators to get a copy of <inline font-style="italic">The New Religion,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Proctor,</inline> an evangelist. That gentleman wrote a pamphlet in 1912, prophesying the great war, which he said must come at the command of vested interests. He also contended that the teachings of modern dogma are entirely opposed to the moral teachings of the Sermon on the Mount. The Labour platform knows no caste or creed, and has no object but the bettering of the conditions of the people. </para>
                <para>I offer my sympathy to those honorable senators who were cast on one side at the last election.

Millen, though a political opponent, is one whom I regard as a man in every way.

However, immediately the contest was over, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, like a true sport, sent me a telegram congratulating me on my victory. A few weeks later he was laid on one side with illness, a fact which I deeply regret. </para>

                        <para> - As this is probably the last occasion on which I shall have an opportunity of addressing the Senate, I should like to join in the expressions of sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen in his serious illness. If any member of this Chamber has above another offered his life in the service of his country, it is that gentleman. I am very sorry indeed that his condition is such that I shall not be able to visit him before leaving Melbourne. I remember that when he undertook the task of creating and administering the Repatriation Department, he made a rather prophetic statement about the possibility of digging his own political grave and ruining his political reputation. To some extent that premonition has been realized. If ever a Minister worked hard in the endeavour to do the right thing, and succeeded in a difficult task, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen has done so. Honorable senators, no matter on which side of the chamber they sit, will indorse that statement. </para>

                <para>I appreciate the kindly remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in reference to those of us who were defeated at the last election. There is none of us who does not like a little sympathy now and then. </para>
                <para>I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> have not by their remarks on immigration added to their own political reputation or conferred any benefit on the country. Every thinking man must admit that the Commonwealth must have an increase of population. A man who condemns immigration without qualification is doing the worst possible thing for Australia. It may be said that too many people are being introduced for whom no work is provided. But I do not hesitate to say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> were Prime Minister he would be confronted with the very difficulties which face the present Government, and I doubt if he could solve them any better than they are attempting to do. Immigration is too big a question to be discussed in a light and airy fashion, and it is idle to say that work must be found for people before they are brought into the country. It cannot be done. I care not what policy is in force, whether it be Free Trade or Protection, or whether we have a Liberal Government or a Labour Government, there are bound to be some unemployed in Australia, as there are in every other country. If Australia could solve the problem of unemployment, if it could offer work for everybody, the population of every other country would be flocking to these shores to participate in such unexampled prosperity. But I know of no policy that would create such a state of affairs. I believe just as firmly in the policy of the Labour party, apart from the conscription issue on which we divided, as do either of the two honorable members of the Opposition. I have been quite as long a trade unionist as they, and perhaps have done quite as much for the Labour movement. </para>

                        <para>- Probably, because I have been not quite forty years in Australia. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was referring to the conditions of mining labour in the Old Country, one who had actually experienced those conditions was listening to him. It is over fifty years since I first went into the mines of Scotland, and I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that, comparing the conditions then with those that obtain to-day, no greater transformation has taken place in the labour world than that affecting the coalminers. I speak with a knowledge of the mining industry extending over half a century. The coal mining conditions in Australia, especially in Kew South Wales, are better than obtain in any other part of the world. I do not say that they are better than they should be; coal mining is an industry in -which men are entitled to the best wage they can get. But I defy Senators Gardiner and McDougall to say how either the stoppage of immigration or different labour laws could improve the conditions of the coal miners of New South Wales. There is no good in ranting and raving to the gallery on this question. I challenge the honorable senator to mention one thing this Parliament could do to improve the labour conditions in the coal trade of Australia. </para>

                    <para>Reverting to the general question of immigration, if we are to do anything to increase the opportunities for employment in Australia, we should be prepared to offer practical suggestions. It is useless to merely find fault. The one great Australian industry that  i3  capable of expansion, and of giving increased opportunities for labour, is the utilization of the land. I take second place to no one in my love of the Old Country ; and <inline font-style="italic">X</inline> know the conditions that prevail there fairly well, because I visited Europe only a few years ago. The first big step towards the betterment of labour conditions in this country must be a radical alteration of trade policies. That can be effected partly by the Commonwealth and partly by the Old Country. The time has come when our fiscal relations should be brought under the notice of the powers that be in England, and of the public, if need be, and some plain speaking indulged in. A few years ago I had the privilege and pleasure of speaking in one of the largest halls in Glasgow. I broached the- subject of fiscal reciprocity, and my remarks were very well received-. I feel confident that if sufficient attention were given to the matter, and the public of the Old Country were educated fiscally, we&#39; could get considerable help for our rural industries. People in the Mother Country are ignorant on this subject ; they are busy in &#39;their own little way, -and fail to grasp the meaning of preferential trade. At the present time, the whole of the benefit of that policy goes to them. That is not as it should be. If preferential trade is to &#39;be of any advantage to us, it must be reciprocal. The present bargain is too one-sided - Australia giving preference to the products of the Old Country, and receiving nothing in return.  </para>

All I asked as a first step was that Australian products should be placed on an equality with those of Argentina and other countries. Britain could do that without any radical alteration of the Customs Tariff. As a preliminary, dock, port, shipping, and light dues could&#39; be waived in respect of Australian- ships and commodities. All of those concessions it is within their power to grant. That would be the first step. Australian meat, wheat, wool, and other produce are entitled to a preference in the British markets to the extent that we give a preference to British goods sent to Australia. When I pointed out in- Glasgow that if Australia forwarded goods to British ports they were subjected to the same treatment which was- meted out to good&#39;s arriving from Germany, Austria, or any enemy nation, there were cries of &#34; Shame 1&#34; Unless the Government try to do something in the direction of bringing about greater reciprocity with the Mother Country they will fail to solve one of the great problems facing them, as it is certainly one of the big questions to which the new Parliament should devote its attention. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> would like to know the figures in regard to unemployment and immigration. I had them taken out a few days ago, and they are exceedingly informative. In 1921 the assisted immigrants entering Australia numbered 14,682. In that same year the rate of unemployment for the Commonwealth per 100 workers employed was 11.2. The figures for the State of Victoria for 1922 are not available, but excluding Victoria the number of assisted immigrants last year for the Commonwealth was 15,113, an excess of 431 over the previous year. Notwithstanding this increased number of  arrivals, the rate of unemployment fell during the year to 9.3 per cent, for the Commonwealth. Evidently it is a case of &#34; more immigrants, less unemployment.&#34; But when we come to analyze the figures for the individual States the position is even more striking. The number of assisted immigrants entering Queensland in 1921 was 1,147, representing 1.49 per 1,000 of the total population of the State. In the same year Western Australia had 3,381 assisted immigrants, representing 10.15 per thousand of the total population of the State. Now let us look at the unemployment figures. In the year in which the Queensland assisted immigrants represented only 1.49 per thousand of the total population of the State, the percentage of unemployment was 15.4, whereas Western Australia, whose assisted immigrants numbered 10.15 per thousand of the total population of the State, had an unemployment percentage of only 8.6. In 1922 Queensland had 1,711 assisted immigrants, representing 2.18 per thousand of the population, and the percentage of unemployment was 10.2, practically the same percentage as in Western Australia, where the assisted immigrants for the same year numbered 4,373, representing 12.88 per thousand of the total population of theState. With six times the percentage of immigration in 1922, the State of Western Australia had the same ratio, of unemployment as Queensland. The figures for Victoria show even better results. Where the immigration percentage is highest the percentage of unemployment proves to be the lowest. I thought it only right that I should place these figures on record alongside those submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> They certainly do not bear out his contention that assisted immigration leads to unemployment. </para>
