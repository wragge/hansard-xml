                            <para>- The answer is as follows :  -  1 and 2. The conditions under which aboriginals and  haft-castes  may be employed in the Northern Territory are prescribed by the Aboriginal&#39;s Ordinance No. 9 of 1918 and regulations thereunder, which were published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> of 29th May, 1919. Amongst other things, it is provided that no  person shall  employ or continue to employ any aboriginal native or female half-caste unless he is the holder of a licence under the Ordinance. Applicants for licences in country districts undertake to pay the prescribed rate of wages, and to provide food, clothing, Ac, as prescribed. Applicants for licences in town districts, of which there are four for the purposes  of  the Ordinance, &#39;undertake to enter  into  an agreement  with each  of their employees,  such  agreement covering wages,  food,  clothing, &#38;c., and being executed in the presence of the  local  Protector of Aboriginals. </para>

                            <para>. - I desire to take this opportunity to refer briefly to the position which has arisen at Canberra. I have always taken a very keen interest in the establishment of a Federal Capital, and particularly in the proposed new Houses of Parliament. I have perused the report of the Public Works Committee, and nave generally kept in close touch with the whole situation. This branch of the Legislature should take definite action in regard, to the proposed provisional Houses of Parliament at Canberra. When the plans of the proposed structure were first placed before the Committee it was so dissatisfied with the design and arrangement of the accommodation that it recommended thirty-two distinct alterations. This conveys the impression that the Committee was entirely dissatisfied with the plans of the proposed building as submitted to it by the officials of the Department of Works and Railways. In the preparation of the plan originally submitted to the Committee, the location of the Senate chamber and of the House of Representatives was not sufficiently considered. The Committee was dissatisfied with the arrangement, and it recommended an alteration in each case. It is a striking coincidence that the gentlemen who draw these plans treat members of Parliament in a manner different from that in which they treat the permanent officers of Parliament. I quite realize that in many countries Parliament has grown up very slowly and in great fear, and its meetings have been held in what might almost be termed dungeons. Any one who visits the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and many other Houses of Parliament cannot but be struck by the great precautions which in the past have been taken to protect members of Parliament, apparently, from the people outside. Surely, if the need for such precautions ever existed, it has passed in Australia. Yet we find that the proposed House at Canberra contains a replica of the chamber in which  we are now deliberating. Every honorable senator knows that a very small quantity of fresh air is permitted to enter this chamber. The condition of the air in the chamber has frequently engaged the attention of expert officers. At the present time a considerable number of honorable senators are indisposed. I do not say that their indisposition is due to the quality of the air in the chamber, but there can be no doubt that it has an injurious effect upon their health. The same thing applies to members of another place. The proposed Senate chamber at Canberra which was suggested by the officers of the Department of Works and Railways did not, except at a great height, come into direct contact with the open air. In the first place, it was surrounded by a high&#39; wall. On two sides of the Senate chamber was a foot corridor, abutting at one end on what might be termed the Queen&#39;s Hall, and at the other end on a long passage. Mark the difference in the accommodation suggested for the officers attached to Parliament. In absolutely every case, so far as I have been able to ascertain, there is direct natural lighting from at least one side of their rooms. That is as it should be. If honorable senators study public buildings in which are housed the permanent officers of the Departments, they will see that proper precautions have been taken to insure to those officers a plentiful supply of fresh air and natural light. At one time in this chamber a horrible contraption in the shape of a huge chandelier was suspended from the roof which seriously injured the eyesight of a number of honorable senators. Finally it was removed - to the advantage, I am sure, of every honorable senator. In Parliament House honorable senators will find that telephones are attached to the walls; whereas the permanent officers have table telephones. This is only a detail, but it indicates the different treatment meted out by permanent officers to members of Parliament. So long as members tolerate that kind of thing, it will probably be good enough for them. I enter my protest against the proposal, which I understand has been approved by another place, for the erection of a provisional Parliament House at Canberra. Originally it was intended to have no fresh air admitted to the chamber except at a very great height. Following upon representations made to officers of the Department of Works and Railways by the Public Works Committee, a revised plan was submitted. From information gained at second hand, I believe that it was intended to bodily remove the Senate chamber so that at least one end of it would abut on the open. When I brought the matter under the notice of the Senate last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> drew my attention to the plan embodied in the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, with which I was already quite familiar. I was under the impression that that plan had been further amended. Inquiry to-day convinced me that the revised plan shows the building which it is proposed to erect. I invite the attention of honorable senators to the plan numbered 3. A slight alteration had to be made in regard to the Senate chamber; a door has been placed on each side, abutting on a small verandah, but no fresh air or natural light will be admitted to the chamber. </para>

                            <para>- Easily. Apart from the gaols of the country, I do not know of any public building in which the windows have been placed, as in this case, at a height of 14 or 15- feet. Windows at that height are entirely out of place. What is proposed by these astute gentlemen ? With the exception of the chamber, very nearly all of the rooms will be open to the fresh air on at least one side. I feel deeply in the matter, because in the occupation which I followed many years ago it was most difficult to induce the employers to provide what I regard as suitable accommodation. Many of the men employed, even when they had suitable accommodation, seemed to be inclined to do things which, to my mind, were injurious to their health. As a result, many scores of them have joined the great majority. They died for the want of sufficient fresh air suitably supplied. In the revised plan it is proposed to provide access from each side of the Senate by means of covered lobbies to small verandahs. On one side is a reception hall, and between the open air and the Senate are found an officers&#39; lavatory, a small area, the &#39;senators&#39; lavatory, a covered-in corridor, the Committee room, and the verandah. All these rooms, lavatories, and areas should be transferred to another position. The Senate chamber should be moved so that one side of it would communicate direct with the fresh air. The work of the Senate could then be done more satisfactorily than we can hope to do it in the absence of a supply of fresh air. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The abolition of the Senate would take some time, and probably, in the opinion of the best-informed men of this country, it would be much more advantageous to abolish the other branch of the Legislature, and increase the usefulness of the Senate. That is my view, but it does not correspond with the views of my party. Sometimes my party makes a mistake, and it may be right or wrong on that question. Having shut out the fresh air from the Senate chamber, it is proposed to install a complicated piece of machinery, worth &#163;12,000, to pump in fresh air and extract foul air. It seems to me to be an operation that ought not to be countenanced for one moment. I am not quite sure what the Senate&#39;s powers are in this matter; but I think it should make representations in the right quarter so as to have the proposed new temporary chamber erected to an up-to-date and healthy design. The days have vanished when we need fear that great crowds of people will menace the lives of members assembled in a Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think they will. There does not appear to be any justification for the perpetuation of this antediluvian, old-world foolish idea of excluding fresh air, and asking honorable senators to deliberate in any but the&#39; best possible conditions. It is &#34;up to &#34; this country to develop some ideas of its own. I know that some people will supply original ideas only with reluctance, and they are liable to copy, wherever they can, the actions of other countries. The conditions that prevail in one country are not always suitable for another. The housing accommodation in many parts of the Commonwealth is not suitable for the prevailing climate. Any one who goes into the tropical or semi-tropical parts of Australia will notice that the styles of homes in Great Britain and Northern Europe have entirely disappeared. The homes in those parts of Australia are surrounded to a large extent with wide, comfortable verandahs, and are in every way more suitable, more healthy, and better than those provided in the northern hemisphere. As we come further south into New South Wales and Victoria, and to the still colder region of Southern Tasmania, the wide verandahs and other conveniences disappear. It must be remembered that Canberra is only about 2,000 feet above sea level, and that the climate is almost the same as that of Sydney. It is warmer than Melbourne, and much warmer than Tasmania. The style of home adopted in Tasmania and many parts of Victoria is out-of-date for Canberra. This Chamber ought to take deliberate and decided action so as to insure that this branch of the Federal Parliament shall meet at Canberra under the best possible conditions. It cannot do that if we are confronted with a &#163;12,000 machine for pumping in fresh air and extracting foul air. All that expenditure is quite unnecessary, and will only lead to trouble. I make these remarks because I feel sure that honorable senators have not looked closely into the matter. Otherwise, they would not have remained quiet while another place approved of such a proposal. As to whether we should have a temporary Parliament House at Canberra, or the nucleus of a permanent one, I may say at once that I am in favour of a temporary one. I realize that some difficulties will confront us if we have a temporary Parliament House; but I am of opinion that a temporary building would suffice for a considerable period - probably fifty or sixty years. I am entirely opposed to the idea of having the building on the side of a hill. That would be an outrage of the first order. It has been suggested that instead of erecting it on a fiat, the side of a hill should be excavated, and the building constructed there. If that were done the top of the building would be almost on a level with the surrounding country. </para>

                    <para class="block">That would be a huge blunder, and ought not to be countenanced for a moment. Surely it should be possible to erect the Parliament House at Canberra on a <inline font-style="italic">vite</inline> that would permit of all the rooms being on the one level. I hope that whatever else is done there will be no occasion to excavate into the side of a hill and place practically one-fourth of the building below the ground level. It has always struck me as peculiar that our builders or architects should burrow 10 or 12 feet below a street level for the purpose of making a cellar or basement. It would almost pay them to build up from the street level a distance of about 10 feet and provide cellars, if they must have them, with good natural lighting and fresh air. Apparently proper attention has not been given to this matter in connexion with the proposed Parliamentary buildings at Canberra. I hope that another site will be found for the temporary building. I would prefer a start being made upon the nucleus of the permanent structure, but plans and specifications have not yet been drawn, and if competitive designs are invited, it will not be possible to proceed with that work for two and a half or three years. In the circumstances&#39;, I think it better to proceed with the erection of the temporary building. I believe, notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary, that the temporary Houses of Parliament may be completed within two or two and a half years. </para>

                    <para>There are a number of other matters to which I should like to refer. When Federation was accomplished, the States retained their sovereign rights and delegated certain powers, about thirty-nine in all, to the Federal Parliament. Quite a different procedure was adopted in both Canada and South Africa. The Union of South Africa assumed control of all the utilities of Government, and relegated certain powers to Provincial Councils. Canada did likewise. In Australia, the State Parliaments were reluctant to relinquish their sovereign powers, and, as a result, there has been a sharp conflict of authority in regard to certain matters. Among the subjects that have not been dealt with, so far, by the Commonwealth Parliament, are those relating to marriage, divorce, and matrimonial causes. As a result, a great number of people are suffering acutely. I realize, of course, that there  are very great difficulties in  the way, and that powerful influences are at work to prevent this Parliament from legislating in that direction for a number of years; but the sooner we do so and challenge the opposition the better it will be. During the war, other matters of more urgent importance had to be dealt with, but this question should engage the attention of the Parliament upon the return of the Prime Minister from London. </para>
                    <para>National insurance is a subject that might well be considered by the Commonwealth Parliament, and I should like to see a Commonwealth insurance office established. A number of private institutions appear to be preparing to conduct very extensive business, and, knowing the excellent work that has been done by the Labour Government in Queensland in the matter of insurance and workmen&#39;s compensation, I believe that this Parliament should, at the earliest possible moment, be asked to consider a scheme of national insurance. </para>

                        <para>In response to very urgent appeals, the Government has decided to amend the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. The system of invalid and old-age pensions has been brought into operation very slowly. I&#39; believe that the Reid Government, in New South Wales-, many years ago, suffered defeat because of its attitude on this subject, but finally a measure dealing with it found its way upon the statute books of that State. At a later date - I think in 1909-10 - the matter was taken up by the Commonwealth. The old-age pension, first granted, amounted to 20s. a fortnight. In 1916-17, the payment was increased to 25s. a fortnight, and in 1919-20, to 30s. a fortnight. The Government now proposes again to increase the amount, and while its action ought to be supported, I think it should have gone further than it has decided to go. After 30th September it is intended to fix the payment at 35s. a fortnight, and a great number of deserving people warmly approve of that decision. I have no doubt that the Government and its supporters had a caucus meeting, and that a greater payment than 35s. cannot be expected at present. A pensioner is permitted to earn 20s. a fortnight, and it is proposed to allow him to earn up to 25s. a fortnight. Assuming that he can find a job, it will mean that the maximum amount a person in receipt of the full pension can receive will be 60s. a fortnight. It will thus be possible for a married couple to receive an income up to &#163;6 a fortnight. This is a step in- the right direction. Whenever the Act has been amended it has been liberalized. The Government is confronted to-day with a very substantial expenditure in connexion with the maternity allowance, war pensions, and other payments, but I have no fear for the future of Australia, and I think that the Government are proceeding on safe lines in this respect. </para>

                            <para>. - Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> I am, as a representative of New South Wales, and, I hope, also, as a good Australian, interested in Canberra, but considering that we are now discussing the financial situation of Australia, I am not particularly concerned at this stage about the comfort of honorable senators and of honorable members of another place when they reach the new Federal Capital. Although, no doubt, it is very desirable that members of the Federal Parliament should be as comfortable and healthy as possible at Canberra, there is a time and place for the discussion of every matter, and I look upon this occasion as a peculiar opportunity for honorable, senators to review the financial position of the country, and to offer whatever comments they may feel disposed to make regarding the Government&#39;s administration. I intend to devote myself to the consideration of financial matters, certain aspects of administration, and certain proposals made by the Government for the future. It must be recognised that honorable senators are at a disadvantage, compared with the members of another place, in discussing the Budget, because the subject has already been more or less worn threadbare in the other branch of the legislature. The best brains of that House have been directed to its consideration. Most of the points in respect of which criticism could be levelled against the Budget have already been mentioned, and those who wished to praise it have done so fulsomely. There is therefore very little of an original nature left for honorable senators to say, and as I do not. like repeating what has been said by others, I feel that this Chamber is, as it always has been, at a decided disadvantage in this respect. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has had a comparatively easy task this year, because of the sound financial position of Australia. He has had a year of mounting revenues ana abounding prosperity. It may be said that for some years conditions in the Commonwealth have been exceedingly prosperous. A Treasurer, no matter how incompetent he might be - I am not suggesting that the present Treasurer is incompetent - should find it a comparatively easy matter to direct the financial affairs of the country when he has a bigger revenue than he could possibly spend, and little before him in the way of extra expenditure for the future. The task of the Treasurer has been easy because every section of the community has&#39; enjoyed comparative prosperity. I was amazed not long ago to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                                <para>- It is. I did not have the figures available at the moment to refute the statement, but  I felt that if such were the case, the facts should be known, and, if not, such a misleading assertion should be denied. I have been to some trouble to ascertain .the actual facts; and in going into the figures in a dispassionate and impartial manner I find that the position instead of being as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> stated, is quite the reverse. I shall submit certain facts and figures which I feel sure will more than disprove the statement which the honorable sena- &#34; tor made. From 1913-14 to 1922, which is the last year for which the figures are available, the population of Australia increased by 13 per cent. The number of depositors in the Savings Bank increased during that period by 62 per cent., and the number of depositors per thousand of the population increased from 428 to 613. It will be seen, therefore, that out of every thousand .persons in Australia, 613 were not only able to maintain themselves in reasonable comfort, but were also able to have a banking account. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. The figures show that during the period when a Nationalist Government has been in office the prosperity of the Commonwealth has not in any way decreased, but, as a fact, has considerably increased. The amount of money on deposit in the Savings Banks during the period I have mentioned increased by 48 per cent., and the average amount on deposit per head of population increased from &#163;16 17s. lOd. to &#163;29 2s. 10d., while the average amount on deposit per depositor increased from &#163;39 12s. 4d.. to &#163;47 10s. lOd. In view of these figures I should like to know upon what basis <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> could make the statement I have mentioned. I have been into this matter quite impartially, and if my investigations had shown that his statement was correct, I should have been quite prepared to admit it. </para>

                                <para>- That is what I am doing. Since the Commonwealth has been under the control of a Nationalist Government the condition of the people has improved to such an extent that not only have more people been able to maintain themselves in a reasonable standard of comfort, and to a greater degree than in any other period of our history when other Governments have been in office, but they have been able to save more than has before been practicable. According* to the official figures, which cannot , be challenged, not only has a greater number of people been able to save money, but the average amount per depositor in the Savings Bank has increased to a greater extent than during any previous period. The actual position of the workers has not only improved, as disclosed by the deposits in the Savings Banks, but the condition of the workers, as revealed in the official figures, has improved out of all proportion when compared with any previous era in our history. I have not been able to obtain the figures relating to industry as a whole; but in connexion with secondary indus1tries the number of factories increased between 1914 and 1922 from 15,428 to 18,023. The number of employees during the same period increased from 331,728 to 395,425, and the amount paid in salaries and wages increased from &#163;34,103,703 to &#163;68,050,861. </para>

That is the objective we should all have in view, and with a continuation of an administration such as we have at present - not what we would expect from a Government composed of gentlemen supporting the policy of honorable senators opposite - possibly before many years have elapsed every one will be satisfied. The value added in the process of manufacture during the years mentioned increased from &#163;66,661,441 to &#163;129,921,500, equal to 95 per cent, gross. </para>

                                <para>- The value of plant and machinery increased from &#163;41,154,389 to &#163;78,058,680, an increase of 77 per cent., and the value of land and buildings in connexion&#34; with factories increased from &#163;39,352,432 to &#163;67,322,458, an increase of 72 per cent. The total increased value of plant and machinery, plus the increased value of land and buildings, was equal to &#163;64,901,317, which represents a gross increase, taking into consideration the value added in manufacture, of about 95 per cent. It might be said that that was the increase in the returns to the manufacturers throughout the Commonwealth as compared with 100 per cent, increase to the workers, but the 95 per cent, is the gross increase, from which has to be deducted the interest on capital invested, which at 5 per cent, amounts to over &#163;3,245,065. In addition, allowance has to be made for the taxation which manufacturers have to pay, and advertising and other charges not included in these figures. After making allowance for these deductions the total increase to those engaged in manufacturing industries during this period would not be more than, if as much as, 70 per cent., whereas the increase to the workers has been equal to 100 per cent. These are very illuminating figures, and, taken in conjunction with inquiries I have made, prove to me, at any rate, that the workers have been able not only to maintain their position, but to enormously improve it. This has been done during a period when a Nationalist Government has been in office. Whether it is due to the strength of their organization or outside influence I cannot say, but we cannot dispute the fact that under good government the workers of the Commonwealth have had a fair deal, and have been able to improve their position to an enormous extent. That being so, it would be idle for honorable senators opposite to say that the workers were becoming poorer, the rich richer, and that children were starving. </para>

                                <para>- It is a disgrace if such is the case, but the blame cannot be placed at the doors of this Government or the Government which immediately preceded it. Labour Governments have been in power, but will honorable senators opposite dare to say that when Labour Governments were in office there was no poverty in Australia, that children were not going bare-footed, and that there were not large numbers of men and women who were unable to maintain themselves ? </para>

                                <para>- I believe the proportion would be about the same. The less wealthy section of the community deposits its savings in the Savings Banks. The figures relating to the Savings Banks show that the people of Australia are better off to-day than they have ever been in the history of this country. That being so, I have no compunction in urging upon my friends opposite the advisability of remodelling their views to a very large extent. There is sufficient to engage our serious attention without continually crying &#34; stinking fish.&#34; Instead of talking about the poverty of our people and the conditions under which the workers live we ought to stand up fearlessly and say to other countries, that in sunny Australia the people are better off, have greater opportunities,&#39; and work under more agreeable conditions, than the people in any other part of the world. The figures I have quoted prove that the position of the workers has improved in a greater ratio than has the position of those whom we might call capitalists. There are other figures in the Budget which show that wealth- is being more evenly distributed. The figures which have been compiled from the income tax returns made by firms and individuals cannot be disputed, and. they bear .out my contention, relative to the distribution of wealth. </para>

                                <para>- They are at least equally as reliable as were the returns made in past years. There will always be a percentage of faked returns sent in by those who are not prepared to tell the truth. In 1920-21 there were 822 individuals and companies &#39;with incomes between &#163;10,001 and &#163;100,000. In 1921- 22, the number had been reduced to 718 - a good thing, because we do not want to see enormous incomes made in this country! In 1920-21 ..there were 49 individuals with incomes over &#163;100,000, but in 1921-22, that number had been reduced to 23. If these figures prove anything they prove that the poor are not growing poorer but richer, and that the rich are not growing richer, but poorer. </para>

                                <para>- I do believe it. With taxation at its present level, it is impossible for the position to be different. If statistics are of any value in enabling us to arrive at the true position, these statistics show that wealth is being more evenly distributed, and that the great masses of the people are improving their position. It would be a hopeless situation if, after all these years of concentrated human effort, not by one party, but by many parties, we had not succeeded in bettering the general position of the masses. Even my honorable friends opposite will not suggest that the most Tory Government Australia has known did not - under pressure, maybe - do something for the workers. The position of the masses has been improved to a greater degree in this than in any other country. </para>

                        <para>There is in the Budget sufficient to provide honorable senators with food for thought and discussion. The Commonwealth is a huge business concern. It ought to be run as such - not in the hard hearted way in which an ordinary business is run, but with a proper regard for all sections of the community, consistent with the necessity to keep the . country financially on an even keel. The Budget is the balance-sheet issued each year to the shareholders, the people of Australia. Members of Parliament, I suppose, occupy the position of&#39; a Board of Directors. From the balance-sheet we ought to be able to discover which branches of the Government&#39;s activities are paying and which are not. We ought to be able to take any department, more particularly the trading departments, and discover from the Budget what those departments have cost during the year, what they have made, and whether they disclose a credit balance. In New Zealand, as the result of an alteration made quite recently, the Budget is presented in that way. Every department submits a separate balance-sheet, which is audited by the Auditor-General. The various trading departments of the Dominion issue a balance-sheet embodying a profit-and-loss account and a statement of income and  expendi&#39;ture,  signed by the head of the department and audited by the Auditor-General. Any one who takes up the New Zealand balance-sheet can see at a glance the position of any department. </para>

                                <para>- That is an entirely wrong idea. For years there has been in Australia a growing recognition of the necessity for adopting such a course as I have suggested. It is felt that there is an increasing tendency for Governments to interfere more and more with industry, and to trade to a greater extent than has been the case in the past. </para>

                        <para>The Country party was more vociferous than any other party in urging the desirability of presenting a clear statement of accounts. It threatened Governments which did not do so, and stated that it would not be satisfied until its ideas were given effect to. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> is the Leader of the Country party. He was foremost in his criticism of past Budgets, because they were not presented in this way. He has had his opportunity, and it is regrettable that in the preparation of this Budget he did not observe the principles which he formerly enunciated. This Budget has been presented in the same old style ; if anything, it is worse than previous Budgets. It is not possible for the average man or woman to determine the actual position of the Government. I take exception, not only to the form in which the Budget has been presented, but also to the figures which purport to show the receipts and expenditure and the balance at the end of the year. I admit that the finances have been administered in a properly conservative way, but there have not been those remarkable reductions which we were inclined to believe would follow the replacement of the late Government by this Administration. The actual decrease in expenditure for the year was only &#163;386,000, which is not worth mentioning. The surplus disclosed amounted to  a  little over &#163;1,020,000. It has been pointed out that that was not the actual surplus. As  a  matter of fact, it should have been very much greater, since large sums which were voted for specific purposes were not expended. It was impossible to expend some of those votes, because the necessary legislation had not been passed by Parliament. Those items are included as expenditure, although they have not been expended, and as  a  consequence the actual surplus is very much less than that set out in the Budget </para>
                        <para>A decrease in Customs receipts is expected this year. Before I come to that may I say that  a  large surplus is not necessarily a good thing. If due to careful and wise administration, it is all right, but if it results from over-taxation of the community, then it is all wrong. The Government should not take more out of the community in the way of taxation than is required. It is no use building up surpluses to play with in the future. I do not know why the Government expects a decrease in Customs receipts this year, and I do not believe there will be a decrease. In other countries, particularly in those that, felt the war severely, there is a growing realization of the necessity for expanding their export trade. If they can readjust themselves so as to resume their normal, or even fifty per cent, of their normal, activities, they must export .large quantities of goods. Per head of its population, Australia is one of the best buying countries in the world. The people of Australia can afford to buy more per head than the people of any other country, not excepting the United States of America. The countries that need an export trade will look to Australia as a field for their exportable products. It is more than likely that they will be prepared to export cheaply for the next two or three years, and that being so,  I  cannot agree that there is likely to be any very great decrease , in Customs revenue. There is therefore no necessity to consider an increase in taxation. One of the complaints I have to make against the Budget is that it does not propose to decrease taxation to the extent that it should. Indeed, judging by .the utterances of  a  Minister, there is a fear that taxation may be increased in the near future. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Austin Chapman)</inline> went to Sydney a little while ago and spoke at a dinner of the Commercial Travellers&#39; Association. He said he &#34; hoped &#34; there would be no necessity to increase taxation. While the people of this country are looking for  a  decrease in taxation, and expecting it in view of the Budget proposals, the Minister for Customs merely &#34;hopes&#34; that there will be no necessity to add to it. </para>
                        <para>After that criticism I wish to congratulate the Government, upon the fact that the national debt has been reduced during the year by &#163;5,074,193. It is to me always a matter for regret when  I  find that our huge national debt has been increased to any degree, and the fact that it has been possible to reduce it in one year to . the extent stated, is a matter for sincere congratulation. The actual reduction of our public debt is greater than the figure quoted indicates. The note issue has undergone a gradual but steady deflation. The value of the notes in circulation in June, 1921, was &#163;58,228,070 10s., while in June,  1923, two years later, the issue had decreased to &#163;52,102,241 10s., representing an actual reduction of &#163;6,125,829. In addition the proportion of actual reserve to notes has steadily risen from 32.29 per cent, in June, 1917, to 47.40 per cent, in June, 1923. The notes in actual circulation last June amounted to &#163;23,200,490, while the banks held &#163;28,901,751. Those figures show that the proportion of notes held by the banks is greater than is necessary to provide for the normal requirements of the country. We ought to congratulate ourselves upon the fact that we are approaching a normal gold basis of currency; that will be a good thing for this country, and, if a gold basis were adopted throughout the world, it would be good for the world. Of the many countries in the world, it seems that Australia will be the first in which the normal gold basis of currency will be reached. It would be interesting, if I had the time, to reflect upon the position that will be reached by the world in a comparatively short period by reason of the fact that the demand for gold for currency purposes is increasing each year, while the supply of gold from the mines is decreasing. Gold is becoming more and more valuable because the demand for it for currency purposes is growing faster than the supply. </para>

Owing to the closing of mines which supplied gold in the past, and to the decreased output of the mines which have remained open, it is within the bounds of possibility that before many years have passed we shall find that there is no gold currency. </para>

                                <para>- I took particular notice of the remark, and decided to refer to it when discussing the Budget. He advocates an almost unlimited use of the printing press for the note issue, and an almost unlimited note issue. That would spell financial and industrial suicide to this country, and I congratulate the Government upon the fact that the note issue has been reduced, and is being reduced each year. I hope it will continue to be reduced until a par condition has again been reached. </para>

                                <para>- I did not give a lie to anybody. There is another aspect of the note issue that needs some explaining. The Budget tells us that the net increased profit on the note issue for the year was &#163;7,107. I cannot understand how this increased profit was obtained, in view of the fact that the issue has been materially reduced. Looking at the matter superficially, it would seem that a reduced issue should be accompanied by a reduced profit. I should like to know how it has been done. </para>

                        <para>I wish to refer to one or two economies which have been effected in Government Departments. The expenditure of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department decreased by &#163;147,621; of the Home and Territories Department by &#163;94,818; of the Defence Department by &#163;473,135; of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department by &#163;114,000; and of the Health Department by &#163;22,000. I should like to be quite sure that the economies in the Defence Department have not been effected at the cost of efficiency. I am more than afraid that a great deal of the efficiency of the Defence Department has gone overboard in this mad scurry for economy in a Department which ought, at all costs, to be maintained at the highest possible efficiency. This country has to provide for its effective defence against possible aggression. The money we spend on defence each year is an insurance premium that we ought not to hesitate to pay. There has been an insistent demand for a long time that the Defence Department should be cut down, until I fear that it is carrying more than its share of the burden of economy. Economies are all right provided we do not pay too high a price for them. I hope that the Government, and honorable members generally, will look very closely into this matter. I, personally, intend to do so. We have gone much too far with our Defence Department economies, in view of the world&#39;s position generally, and I hope there will be no more retrenchment in that direction. The Postmaster-General&#39;s Department shows a very substantial surplus. That is not exactly as it ought to be. We should not look to that Department for huge profits, and a profit of over &#163;100,000 in a year is too much. The Government is evidently of the same opinion, for it has announced a reduction in the rates of postage. That will probably mean that such a big profit will not be earned next year. There has also been an economy to the extent of &#163;22,000 in the Health Department, which, I have reason to know, is doing a very fine work. I believe that future generations will concede that the money we have spent and are spending upon our Health Department will give a better return than expenditure in any other direction. I hope, therefore, that the economy in this magnificent Department has not been effected at the expense of efficiency. </para>
                        <para>Expenditure on war pensions shows an increase of over &#163;100,000. I welcome that increase. It is undoubtedly true that many war pensions paid have proved quite inadequate for the needs of individuals concerned, especially in the case of widows and other dependants. </para>

                                <para>- In season and out of season I have urged that the position of our war pensioners should be improved. Perhaps the honorable senator is not aware that in this Parliament there is a non-party committee of soldier members, including members representing Labour, engaged in watching the interests of returned soldiers. We have made repeated requests to the Government in respect of various matters which affect our returned soldiers, including this question of war pensions. As I have shown, there was an increase last year of &#163;100,000, and I hope that in future, if the necessity arises, the Government will not hesitate to give further assistance. </para>

                        <para>There are a number of other matters to which I might direct attention, but I have no desire to detain honorable senators too long. The attitude of the Government towards the primary producers is one in which I am deeply interested. In view of the composition of the Ministry, I examined their proposals very carefully to see in what direction they intended to afford relief to our primary producers. I regret that, so far as I am&#39; able to see, the Budget contains only three proposals that directly concern our primary producers. It is proposed to introduce a Bill to abolish the land tax on Crown leaseholds, to abolish the duty on sulphur, thus insuring the manufacture of cheaper superphosphate, and to provide for an advance of &#163;250,000 to small holders for the purchase of wire netting. So far as they go, those proposals are all right, but I regret that further relief is not to be given. No section of the community offers a better return for money expended. It has been said that our primary producers carry the cities upon their backs. To some extent they do. If they are prosperous, our cities, likewise, are prosperous, and business people throughout the Commonwealth are doing well. On the other hand, if our primary producers, through unfavorable seasons, or other causes, are having a hard time, so also are other sections of our community. The Government should do everything possible to grant them relief in the matter of taxation, and in respect of other burdens that have been placed upon them. I hope that, as time goes on, the Government will realize more fully the pressing used for further relief being given to our primary producers. </para>
                        <para>The Budget, speaking generally, evidences a desire on the part of the Government to encourage individual effort. The Ministry realize, as also do most people, that the prosperity of any community depends upon the degree of freedom allowed to individual effort in commercial and industrial enterprises. The Government propose, therefore, to encourage private enterprise in such a way as to insure the development of this country on sound and satisfactory lines. Our friends opposite, members of the Labour party, do not agree with this doctrine. They do not approve of individual effort. This divergence of opinion marks the clear line of demarcation between us. We do ; they do not. They look forward to the great day, according to their point of view, when they shall reach their objective - the socialization of industry and the means of production, distribution, and exchange. We believe &#39;that when that day dawns, it will see the end of individual effort and of everything that is worth while. We stand fast in our desire to maintain the liberty of- the individual, to encourage private enterprise, and to better the conditions of our&#62; people in order to make this country what it should be - a place fit for white men to live in. </para>

                                <para>- The employers would have received a little less profit, and the workers would have had a little more comfort. If that recommendation had been adopted and the highest basic wage - in the case of Sydney it was fixed at &#163;5 13s. Id. per week-had been paid generally in industry, even then the workers would not have been in that comfortable position which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> would have us believe they are in today. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> is a drone in the hive of industry. I repeat that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> was very wide of the mark when he stated that the workers of Australia were well off. He went further, and contended that there was no poverty; but at this time last year I noticed poverty  iD  Western Australia as a result of unemployment, and I have seen poverty in Melbourne from the same cause. I have observed children &#39; going to school bare-, footed. </para>

                        <para>The Budget indicates that the Government intends to increase the invalid and old-age pensions by 2s. 6d. per week. This news will be particularly welcome to old-age pensioners. No honorable senator will dispute the fact that the cost of living is very high. It is 50 per cent, greater than it was during the pre-war years, despite the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has assured us that the worker is well off. The average wages of the worker, as a matter of fact, have not increased in proportion. The old-age pensioner has had no Wages Board or Arbitration Court to which he could appeal. He has been endeavouring to manage on the miserable pittance of 15s. per week. In 1919 the Labour party suggested that if it were returned to power it would increase the pension to &#163;1 per week. After a lapse of nearly four years the present Government has decided to increase the dole by the small amount of 2s. 6d. per week. It could well have made the payment <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> and it might have gone even further and made the increased pension retrospective. With a surplus at its disposal the Government could have provided even a pension  for widows and orphans. Mothers struggling with two or three children of tender years, with the bread-winners in the grave, are deserving of every consideration at the hands of Parliament. When it was previously suggested that widows and orphans should receive the  pension, the constitutionality of the proposal was questioned, and I understand that the legal opinion given was that it would be quite within the bounds of the Constitution for the Commonwealth Government to grant such pensions. I suggest to the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> that generosity should be shown to people who are entitled to the pension and are inmates of philanthropic institutions. If a person has once been an inmate of the Consumptive Sanatorium, at Wooroloo, in Western Australia, and after his discharge finds his way to the Old Men&#39;s Home, the pension is denied him. Why should a man who is stricken with the disease of consumption, and has been an inmate of a consumptive sanatorium, be deprived of his right to the pension? The Government should consider the advisability of amending the Act to remove that disability. </para>

About 50 per cent, of the inmates are pensioners. The Commonwealth allows an amount per week for the maintenance of each person, and another 2s. is granted to the inmate, making a total of 12s. 6d. Why should these people have to submit to a reduction of 2s. 6d. in their pensions on admission to the Home? At present the State is subsidizing the Commonwealth to the extent of the balance of the cost of the pensioners&#39; maintenance. </para>

In spite of the opposition of a section in Parliament, with which the honorable senator is associated, war pensions and invalid and old-age pensions arc now regarded as being quite distinct.

I do not wish to initiate a fiscal discussion at this juncture, but nearly all of the articles I have mentioned - and which the Treasurer also quoted - could be produced in Australia. Instead of importing them, we should be exporting them. I am a Protectionist, but our alleged Protectionist Tariff appears to be more of a revenue Tariff. I would rather support Free Trade than a revenue Tariff. </para>

                        <para>I understand that it is proposed that the Taxation Department of the Commonwealth shall be transferred to the States. What action is it proposed to take in regard to the Commonwealth taxation officers, male and female, who will be retrenched ? Will due regard be paid to their term of service with the Commonwealth ? Will they receive any compensation for the accrued rights that they may lose ? Will compensation be paid to the families of the officers who will be affected ? I have received representations from returned soldiers, many of whom will be placed in a rather awkward position. These men have been for some time in the Commonwealth Taxation Department, and they will not be fitted to go on the labour market and compete with the average man. </para>
                        <para>I desire to bring under the notice of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> a superannuation matter affecting the widows of five officers in Western Australia. I have received from the secretary of the Western Australian branch of the Telegraphists&#39; Union a letter of which the following is a paragraph: - </para>
                        <para>In a general sense the Superannuation Act provides (section 38) that where an employee, having ten years service, dies between 31st December, 1920, and 5th January, 1923, a pension is payable to his widow and children. This applies in all States. However, later on (sections 51 to 58) the Act makes special provision for employees with pension rights, apart from, and existing prior to, the Superannuation Act, to transfer or convert their rights, or to come under the Act for the limited purpose of a pension for their widows and children. </para>
                        <para>This part of the Act was evidently designed to prevent employees being entitled to two pensions upon retirement, and it was thought wise that persons with pension rights already in existence must convert same, or only come under the Superannuation Act under certain conditions. </para>
                        <para class="block">Further on the letter states - </para>
                        <para>However, section 51, which was designed to prevent payment of two pensions to one person, has had the effect of nullifying section 38 as far as officers with previously existing rights are concerned, and has affected widows and families of some of our late members (who had long and meritorious service) in an adverse manner, simply because the employees died before they had an opportunity of coming under the provision of the Superannuation Act. </para>
                        <para class="block">The officers referred to were Messrs. P. McKnight, A. J. Besley, telegraphist; D. W. Thomas, clerical assistant; W. F. Cole, telegraphist: and G. P. Marks, clerical assistant. The letter points out - Had these officers not been entitled to a pension under a Western Australian State Act, their widows and children would have received the benefits, but, as it is, their dependants get nothing. </para>
                        <para>Representations have been made, and we are informed it is proposed to amend the Act in the direction desired. As there are only five such cases - and there can never be any more, seeing that the time limit has expired - we trust that you will use every endeavour . - . to see that justice is done. </para>
                        <para>J The  president  of the Superannuation Fund Management Board <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. F. Eoss),</inline> replying to the secretary of this organization, stated - </para>

                            <para> I agree with you in the view that  the  widow of an employee with pension rights who receives no consideration in respect of the death of her husband, should receive the same treatment as .the widow of an employee without pension rights who dies in the Service. </para>

                            <para>Referring to previous correspondence in connexion with request for compensation for the widows of five officers who recently died in Western Australia, namely, P. McKnight, A. J. Besley, W. F Cole, D. W. Thomas, and G. F.

                        <para class="block">Before the session ends the Superannuation Act should b.e amended to enable compensation to be paid to the dependants of these five officers. We are rushing legislation through at a break-neck pace, . and I think that we might pause for a moment, before Parliament rises and the delegates leave for the Imperial Conference, to amend the Superannuation Act in the direction suggested by the  president  of the Superannuation Fund Management Board. I would not suggest the amendment of the Act if it meant the perpetuation of such cases ; but under the Act as it stands there cannot be a similar case. </para>

                                <para>- Western Australia is the only State affected. These five widows and their dependants are unprovided for because of two conflicting sections in the Superannuation Act. The Senate will rise in a few weeks and reassemble some time next year. Meantime, what are these five women and their dependants to do? In all sincerity, I commend this matter to the Leader of the Senate, and ask him to see if it is not possible for the Government to bring down a short amending Bill before the session closes. </para>

                                <para>. - I desire to address myself to the Budget and to some extraordinary assertions which were made by certain honorable senators opposite during the debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. It is regrettable that such a doleful picture should have been painted of this great country, which is more prosperous, gives a greater equality of opportunity, and affords a brighter outlook generally, than any other country. Honorable senators opposite have advertised this country throughout the world as a poor, miserable place, in which everybody is downtrodden. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> Was particularly pessimistic; he had nothing good to say of this wonderful Democracy and of the opportunities which it affords to every one. I thought also that the criticism of the immigrants coming to Australia - people of our own kith and kin coming from the British Empire - was most unfair. It was stated by some honorable senators that those immigrants were weak mentally and physically. </para>

As a mat&#39;ter of fact, as a member of the executive of the New Settlers&#39; League, and one who wishes to hold out the hand of friendship to our kith and kin from across the seas, I have had the privilege of meeting on -their arrival many of the immigrants who have come to this great, empty country. Both physically and mentally they are splendid specimens of our race. It is lamentable that the statement should go forth to the world that, not only is this country not fit for them, but also they are not fit to be citizens of this country. . The greatest necessity of the British Empire to-day is undoubtedly a redistribution of its white people.  It is urgently necessary for the Commonwealth to have more people. Unless we increase our population we shall have great difficulty in developing and defending Australia.  </para>

                                    did not show that pride in his speech. He painted a picture which would condemn this country as a sorry land in which to live. Facts and figures, on the contrary, show that the Commonwealth of Australia is extraordinarily prosperous. There are hundreds of thousands of ex-service men in England, Ireland, and Scotland who are available to-day to help us to develop and defend this country. In 1.908, according to the Commonwealth
                                    <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book,</inline>
                                    the total production of this country amounted to &#163;164,934,000, and in 1920- 21, it had increased to &#163;402,208,000. The imports in 1913, prior to the war, were valued at &#163;79,750,000, and in 1921- 22, at &#163;101,064,000. On the other hand, we exported in 1913, goods to the value of &#163;78,572,000, which consisted mostly of primary products. In 1921-22, that figure jumped to &#163;127,923,000. The value of the goods manufactured in Australia increased from &#163;28,905,000 in 1910, to &#163;68,655,000 in 1920-21. The best and fairest indication of the prosperity of a country is the Savings Bank deposits of its people. In this connexion we find, as
                                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline>
                                    has shown, that a very large percentage of the population of Australia has Savings Bank accounts. In the year 1901, which is little more than twenty years ago, the deposits in the Savings Banks of Australia amounted to &#163;30,883,000, whereas in 1922 which is the last year for which figures are available, they had increased to &#163;162.273,000. It must be remembered that those who use the Savings Banks are mostly of the working class. Savings Banks deposits in 1901, amounted to &#163;8 3s. per head of the population, and last year to &#163;28 2s.10d. per head. That figure does not represent the average deposits of the depositors in the Savings Banks, but the Savings Bank deposits averaged over the total population of the Commonwealth. I find that in the year 1912, the deposits in the banks of issue were over &#163;84,000,000, the Savings Banks deposits were &#163;66,000,000, and the total deposits and investments in war savings certificates were &#163;216,763,000. For the past year they were &#163;413,903,000, which was nearly double the amount ten years previously. The savings of the people of Australia in the last ten years, despite the war, and owing largely to the fact that a National Government has been in power, increased by 100 per cent.

                            referred to an alleged land monopoly in this country, and other honorable senators opposite have made similar allegations. Those statements are, of course, nonsense, because the facts are that less than 10 per cent, of the total area of Australia is alienated, and of the 718,000 existing estates only 12,182 pay the whole of the land tax.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline>
                            is in favour of abolishing the exemption. Farmers are exempt from land tax upon valuations up to &#163;5,000. We, on this side, believe that it is better to collect the tax from the largest owners. I shall read a letter to the press of Melbourne in which I am taken to task for saying, in my speech on the Address-in-Reply, that only 10 per cent, of the land was alienated. In this letter the writer states that, according to the official
                            <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline>
                            for 1922, the land alienated and in process of alienation is not as much as 10 per cent, of our spacious national real estate, and that a stock-taking would show that, of a total area of 1,903,000,000 acres, the land alienated and in process of alienation was 173,000,000 acres, or less than 10 per cent. Considering the enormous size of Australia, and the fertility of its soil, that statement proves that there is any quantity of land available for immigrants, as well as for our own people.

The work would take men from all the Australian capitals at a time when they were most required. This was to build a place 40 miles from nowhere. Had the work been postponed for five years the demand for labour would probably have been easier, and the work would probably have been carried out for half what it would cost to-day. </para>

                                <para>- That is not so. The money was granted for the unemployed. The official <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Books</inline> show that the percentage of unemployment is lower in Australia than in any other country. In 1914, the year prior to the war, unemployment in the trades unions in Australia amounted to 11 per cent.; in &#34;1921 it was 9.56 per cent.; and at the present time it is 7.2 per cent. Honorable senators opposite seem to think that unemployment is the fault of the National Government, and they have boasted about the condition of affairs in Queensland, which is the only State in Australia where a Labour Government is in power. Statistics show that the percentage of unemployment is greater in Queensland than in any other State of the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- Because of the misgovernment and mismanagement of the Labour Government which is in power there. Honorable senators opposite have suggested that the workers of Australia are not well off. They are, in fact, better off, in proportion to the cost of living, than the people of any other country. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> who said people worked forty-eight hours a week for what he called a &#34;paltry average wage of &#163;4 14s. 6d.&#34; The facts are, that in 1914 the average hours worked in Australia were 48.87 per man per week, and the average wage paid was &#163;2 15s. 7d. Statistics for the year 1921 show that the average number of hours worked by the people of Australia had dropped in that year to 46.22 per week - I do not say that I deplore that reduction - and that the average wages had increased to &#163;4 14s. 6d., which compares very favorably with the wages paid in any other country. If that average were maintained, and we could insure that everybody would be employed, the workers should be satisfied. </para>

                        <para>Nothing has contributed to the increase in the cost of living so much as the policy of strikes, ca&#39; canny, and &#34;go slow.&#34; Naturally, if, in the building of a house, bricklayers decide to lay only a certain number of bricks per day, the cost of the building must be appreciably increased to the owner, whether he be a man of means or a worker who has saved sufficient to build a home for himself or a house from which he hopes, in his old age, to derive revenue from rent by way of interest on his savings. To meet this increased cost the owner must demand <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> very much higher rent if he is to get even the moderate return of 5 per cent. Nothing is damaging this country so much as is the pernicious policy of encouraging industrial strife. Unfortunately, the workers are being misled by paid agitators, who realize that their comfortable billets at &#163;5 or &#163;6 per week will be endangered if conditions approximating to industrial peace are allowed to prevail in Australia. Thus, they persist in fomenting trouble, and incidentally they are largely responsible for keeping up the high cost of living to the workers. In the consideration of this problem I want to be quite fair. I admit that, owing to the unfavorable seasonal conditions, the cost of meat, particularly in the southern States, is deplorably high. We have experienced a very bad season. The rain did not come until May or June, and as we cannot hope to fatten bullocks, or even sheep, for many months after rain falls, we have had to import from New Zealand - a course which every one must deplore, especially in view of the fact that in the northern half of Australia cattle are saleable only at a price that does not cover the cost of production. Owing to the tick pest in Queensland, there is an embargo upon the importation of live-stock from the northern State, and so we have to look elsewhere for our immediate needs. </para>

                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline>
                            in the course of his remarks upon land settlement, declared that the land purchased for the settlement of immigrants or returned soldiers cost &#163;8 per acre. I have taken the trouble to examine the
                            <inline font-style="italic">Y ear-Book</inline>
                            on this point, and I find that the 3,895,849 acres of freehold land purchased by the various Governments of Australia cost, on the average, &#163;3 16s. per acre. That is much below the figure quoted by the honorable senator. Even in Victoria - the smallest and most closely populated State, where land is much higher than elsewhere in the Commonwealth - the average cost of all land, including city lands, bought for repatriation of our soldiers- and for closer settlement purposes generally, is &#163;7 per acre. That is high enough, but, in the circumstances, it cannot be des.scribed as exorbitant. I do not want to see the price of land increased through Government re-purchases for the settlement of either immigrants, or Australian citizens, f agree that before we encourage immigration for land development we should make land available for our own people; hut I maintain that an abundance of good Crown lands is available for the settlement of not only our own people, but also thousands from overseas. What is possible has been well demonstrated in the mallee country of Victoria. The farmers there are as prosperous, on the average, as are producers in any other part of the Commonwealth. Thirty years ago that portion of Victoria, speaking generally, was regarded as absolutely useless ; but, as a result of a policy of water conservation and distribution, the use of fertilizers, and modern methods of cultivation, it is now one of our most important wheat belts. The Wimmera United Water Trust has no less than 6,000 miles of water channels for the distribution of water throughout the northwestern corner of this State. What has been done there is an example of what is possible in almost any other part of Australia.
                        </para>
                        <para>I agree with honorable senators opposite, that it is useless to encourage immigrants to take up land unless we have a comprehensive and sound land settlement policy to insure their success. We can afford to spend a vast sum of money on such reproductive works as the construction of railways and roads, the  conserva-  ti on and distribution of water, and the establishment of postal, &#39; telegraphic, and telephonic facilities to make &#39; life in the country worth living. I hope that a great deal of attention will be given to this matter in the future. The statistical returns concerning production, earnings per head of population, deposits per head and gross totals of deposits in our Savings Banks, reveal a condition of prosperity that is absolutely astounding. </para>
                        <para>Australia is essentially a country for primary production. We are capable of producing immense quantities of raw products required by the rest of the world. Chief amongst these is wool. Honorable senators opposite, who so often declare for the policy of &#34; bursting up &#34; our sheep walks, and who so often decry the wool industry of  the Commonwealth, will no doubt be surprised to know that at the present time over 80,000 families are engaged in the industry, and that in value our exports of wool contribute very materially to the total of exports. The actual figures, which are truly illuminating, are as follows: - </para>

                        </para>
                        <para class="block">These figures show that, for the financial year that has just closed, the exports of Australian wool represented in value nearly half of our total exports. They illustrate the enormous importance of the wool industry. </para>

                                <para>-I can. The average price of wool produced in Australia for the five years prior to the war, was 9.7d. per lb., and the average price during the period of the appraisement scheme, when the Australian clip was sold to the Imperial Government, was 15Jd. per lb. For the financial year ended 30th June, 1923, the average price for all wool grown in Australia was 16d. per lb., an increase of a little over 60 per *nt.. compared with the pre-war average prices. This advance is considerably less than the percentage increase for all other raw commodities in the world. Figures relating to middling American cotton, which is wool&#39;s greatest competitor, show that the average pre-war price was  4&#189;d.  per lb. and the latest quotation is about 15d. per lb., an increase of over 300 per cent., compared with an increase in the price of wool of about 60 per cent. It would be a good thing for Australia if wool were twice its present price because, as I have pointed but on many other occasions, the increased cost of raw wool in an all-wool suit of clothes is infinitesimal. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. The actual weight of raw wool in an all-wool suit of clothes is 71bs. Therefore, if the price of wool increased - by 6d. per lb. the actual increase in the cost of the raw material for an all-wool suit of clothes would be only 3s. 6d., and as the honorable <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator knows,&#39;</inline> a decent all-wool suit costs from &#163;12 to &#163;13. I have repeatedly deplored the fact that although we produce the best wool in the world, and immense quantities of it, and by a high protective Tariff endeavour to encourage the allied secondary industries, we are still importing 75 per cent, of our requirements in woollen goods. . I am glad to be able to say, however, that as the result of the Protectionist policy of the Nationalist Government, woollen mills are springing up all over the Commonwealth. The number in Victoria has doubled during the last five years, and many factories are also being established elsewhere in Australia. The last company which I had the privilege of helping to float is a new woollen company in&#39; the south-east of South Australia. I am pleased to be able to say that I have just received a telegram stating that the company has been successfully floated and that a woollen mill is to be built at Mount Gambier. I should like to see woollen mills established all over Australia. We are using only 3 to 4 per cent of the wool actually produced in the Commonwealth, and we are manufacturing only 25 per cent, of our requirements. This anomaly is being rectified from day to day by the establishment of new factories. Geelong alone will soon have six mills in operation. I hope to see the day when Australia will not only manufacture the whole of its requirements in woollen goods, but will also export them on a considerable scale. As a matter of fact, Australian-made blankets are already being exported to the United States of America, . where they are admitted to be the best in the world, and where it is recognised to be to the advantage of the people to purchase them in preference to the American-made article. </para>

                                <para>- That is perfectly true. I am sorry that there will be a serious decrease in the value of exports from the Commonwealth during the coming year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> remarked that he thought the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> was pessimistic in his estimate of the Customs receipts for the next twelve months. I do not share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan&#39;s</inline> opinion, because, I regret to say, I believe that there will be a serious falling off in our exports. Taking Australia&#39; generally, the season has been so unfavorable that there will probably be a decrease in the export of wool from 250,000 to 225,000 bales. </para>

                                <para>- But the balance of trade this year has turned against us. Owing to climatic conditions, the intrinsic value per pound of the wool-clip will not be equal to what it was last year. We had a dry season up to a certain period, and, owing to the excess of rain that fell subsequently, the area under wheat will be less than the acreage sown in 1922. In Victoria it is estimated that the area under crop is from 33 to 40 per cent less than it was last year, and the crops prospects, unfortunately, are not very good. Although a lot is said about the season being a good one, it should be realized that the rain came too late. There will be a splendid growth of herbage and grass, and an abundant supply of water, but the fact remains that there will be a decrease in the production of wool, meat, and wheat, and consequently a shrinkage in our exports. The wheat market, moreover, is not as good to-day as it has been, therefore I foresee a very serious falling off in the value of Australian exports generally during the coming year. There will be less wool, less wheat, and less meat sent abroad. </para>

Others have asked me to use my influence to get them a job, so that they could earn something to keep their homes together. That is the position of many men in the cattle industry, not only in Queensland, but also in other parts of Australia. . . . Travelling amongst them, one realizes that to-day many of them are practically bankrupt. Even those in a large way of business are not making working expenses.

As the speech I have just quoted indicates, they are so hard up in Queensland that they are prepared to catch opossums for a living. We all know of Swift&#39;s great combine in the United States of America. I am as strenuously opposed to combines as any body in Australia, because I know perfectly well what America has suffered at the hands of meat combines. I fear that, on account  of the low price of the Queensland cattle stations and meat works, and of cattle all over Australia, there is something significant in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swift&#39;s</inline> visit to Australia. He inspected very many of the large cattle stations, and all the meat works. I only hope that he is not going to take advantage of the depressed condition of the industry in Australia by buying up those properties at the deplorable prices ruling to-day. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable senator had done me the honour of listening to the earlier part of my speech he would have heard me explain why the price of cattle in the southern parts of Australia is deplorably high. It is due to the fact that owing to adverse seasonal conditions nobody has any fat cattle. There is an abundant supply in the Northern Territory and Queensland; but unfortunately those cattle cannot be sent to the southern markets, and it is necessary to import bullocks from New Zealand. I deplore the high retail price of meat, but it is due entirely to the law of supply and demand. Owing to the bad season I sold quite well-bred cattle, within 30 miles of Melbourne, at &#163;2 per head less than a month ago. Until quite recently they were in poor condition. Honorable senators should remember that it takes from six to nine months to fatten cattle. </para>

                                <para>- I was referring to the visit to Australia of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swift,</inline> the American meat magnate, and expressing my fears that it was not a coincidence that he should have visited the Commonwealth, and have inspected cattle properties and meat works when the cattle and meat industry was languishing. It behoves the Government of Australia to see that the American Meat Trust does not obtain control of the Australian cattle and meat industry, because it could do so at present at a minimum expenditure, and at a price, which to that enormous Trust, would be insignificant. Unfortunately, the beef industry of Australia is at present in a deplorable position, but we trust that it will very soon recover. </para>

                        <para>I am prepared to admit that probably the American cattle, or, at any rate, the South American cattle, are better than ours; but I was rather amused with the cheap advice <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swift,</inline> while here, gave to the cattle-raisers of Australia when he advocated the de-horning of cattle. That is a cruel and unnecessary process. We have very good hornless breeds in Australia. We have, for instance, the polled Angus, which is, from a purely beef -producing point of view, one of the best possible breeds. There is also the red poll, which is the best for general utility purposes. We can . also breed hornless Herefords and other types. I am in favour of breeding natural polled cattle rather than adopting the cruel process of dehorning. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swift</inline> also said that our sheep were not of the best quality, and that we should devote more of our time to improving our mutton breeds. I have made a study of this question, and having seen most American breeds of sheep, I consider that they are inferior to the Australian sheep. The American sheep may not be inferior from a mutton or early lambing viewpoint, but they are certainly not superior to ours. From a wool-producing viewpoint the American breeders are a hundred years behind the times as regards the quantity of wool produced per head, its value per lb., and the methods by which it is prepared for market. It is almost ludicrous that in such an enlightened country as America the wool producers do not skirt or class their product, and tie it up with hay bands in ill - shaped, unpressed packages weighing up to 700 lbs. As a fact, most of the wool in the western States is contracted for by &#39; dealers at so much per lb. on the sheep&#39;s back, and not sold by auction as it is in Australia. The contractor buys at so many cents per lb., and the wool is not classed at all. An Australian gentleman named <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richards,</inline> of Sydney, while visiting the western States of America, has been instructing wool-growers in the construction of wool sheds, machines hearing, and also in the art of classing and properly preparing the wool for market. At last some of the Americans have started, disposing of their wool at auction in Boston. While the Americans are a hundred years behind Australia in this respect, it is very out of place for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swift</inline> to comment as he did on our methods. </para>
                        <para>T notice that the Government received from Customs and Excise during the last financial year the huge sum of &#163;32,872,000. That, in my opinion, is too large a sum to obtain from that source. We have been over-importing, and, unfortunately, a high Tariff has not been the means of protecting some of our industries. When the Tariff was under consideration I voted in some cases for lower duties than were adopted, but the manufacturers in England during the last twelve months have been dumping large quantities of woollen goods into the Commonwealth. This exorbitant amount of revenue has been extracted from the people in the form of Customs and Excise duties in the one year; but the Government must realize that they cannot rely upon receiving in the future a similarly large amount. The revenue has been unduly inflated, and woollen goods have been dumped into this country - I honestly believe that they have been dumped - during the last twelve months. The value of apparel and textiles imported into Australia has actually amounted to &#163;44,944,000, which is easily a record. The importation of woollen goods into Australia so freely during the last twelve months was due to two factors - I wish honorable senators to pay particular attention to this, because it is very important - one of them being that British manufacturers became acquainted with the propaganda with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stirling</inline> Taylor and others are associated in connexion with the great secondary industry of wool manufacturing in Australia. The British manufacturers learned that we were contemplating the erection of many more woollen mills, and that policy did not suit the Yorkshire manufacturers or the Australian importing houses. A great many of the country mills established are, perhaps, under capitalized, and are at present experiencing an anxious time. </para>
                        <para>I find, on making inquiries, that the wool manufacturers in England have, during the last year, been selling in England serges, which cost 21s. a yard to manufacture, at 4s. 6d. per yard. It is the British Government, and not the manufacturers, who are the losers, because the British Government are recouping the manufacturers from the war profits tax to the extent of 80 per cent. Therefore the British Government, which, is losing the money, is indirectly encouraging the dumping of goods in Australia. Serges . have been selling in Flinders-lane, and are still on the market, at lower prices than the cost in England of the yarn in the goods. I regret that that some of the British manufacturers are in league with certain large importing houses in Australia, and that they appear to be endeavouring to throttle the Australian wool manufacturing industry. </para>

                                <para>- Australia can manufacture woollen goods equal to any  in the world. There is another reason why these goods have been exported to the Commonwealth. There has been a big balance of Australian credits in England, and as it would cost a lot to send the actual money out here, much of it has been sent in the form of goods. That, to some extent, is responsible for the abnormal importation of textile goods. For some years, our exports have been greater than our imports, and the balance of trade in London has been in our favour. But now the balance of trade &#34; has swung against, Australia. On the 30th of June last, our imports were valued at &#163;131,808,000, and &#39; our exports at &#163;117,913.000. Our imports during the last year have exceeded our exports by  &#163;14,000,000, and during the coming year the balance of trade against us is likely to be even greater owing to the decrease in the wool clip and in the output of mutton, lamb, wheat, &#38;c. The price of wheat also is likely to be lower than it has been of late years. </para>

                        <para>In view of these facts, the value of our exports for the next twelve months will show a serious shrinkage. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> is optimistic if he believes that the amount of money to be collected from Customs and Excise during the coming twelve months will be as much as he anticipates. With the balance of trade against Australia, we cannot afford to import such large quantities of goods from other countries as we have been doing in the past. </para>

                                <para>- No. I think the present Tariff is high enough; but the Tariff Board should have immediately considered this question of dumping, and have taken steps to protect Australian industries. Under normal conditions the Tariff is high enough, because we have at our doors the best wool in the world, whereas those with whom we are competing have to buy our product, transport it 12,000 miles, pay interest and insurance, and when it is returned to Australia - another journey of 12,000 miles - in the form of manufactured goods, pay a duty of 35 per cent. </para>

He has debited to the preceding year half-a-million of money, none of which was spent in that year, nor even voted during that year. I hope there are not any other items which he has debited to the revenue of the previous year. He shows that&#39; &#163;500,000 as if it had been spent, whereas the Government has not yet started to spend it. </para>

The Commonwealth Government has declared that it will not finance any more pools, but it cannot allow the unfortunate men who have been encouraged to engage in the industry to starve on their blocks. There is not a man growing soft fruits in any part of Australia to-day who is making anything like the basic wage. </para>

                                <para>- The fruit growing industry has been overdone. There are many other occupations in Australia to-day in which immigrants could profitably engage. It is our duty, however, to assist, in a practical way, the fruit-growers, who were encouraged to embark on that industry. The Government should act in the direction of securing preferential trade with Great Britain. We give an enormous preference to Great Britain in our Tariff; and while I admit that she has given us magnificent protection with her Navy, she has given us very little preference in trade. Therefore, I urge the Prime Minister to fight at the forthcoming Imperial Conference for preference for Empire goods. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted.&#93;</inline></para>

                        <para>We have a very valuable dried-fruits industry in Australia which provides an ideal form of closer settlement. It gives employment to a large number of returned soldiers and others, and unless we can get an outlet for dried fruits we shall be in &#34; Queer-street.&#34; Canada imports dried fruits, and therefore I urge the Government to make an arrangement with that Dominion by which a market will be opened there. I hope also that an effort will be made to win back the splendid market that we once had for tinned goods in India. That market was &#34; murdered.&#34; In my speech on the Address-in-Reply, I read a letter from a buyer of tinned goods for the Indian Government. He used to buy from Australia 2,000 tons of tinned goods per annum for that Government. Unfortunately, through some lack of supervision, or want of proper cooperation between the fruit-growers, the canners, and Government officials, the goods, when they arrived in India, were not up to sample. Australian fruit is unequalled in quality, and the flavour is good. We can produce tinned fruits equal to those of any country, but we should take steps to see that uniformity is obtained in grading and packing, and that the goods are attractively tinned and labelled, and, above all, true to sample. Unfortunately, these conditions were not observed when goods were sent to the Indian market. It was clearly shown that when they arrived in that country they were not properly graded ; they were often wrongly labelled, and were sometimes not up to sample. Consequently, this Australian gentleman received instructions from the Government of India not to buy any more Australian tinned goods. The failure to exercise proper supervision over such exports is one of the greatest blunders that this country  has  ever perpetrated. The Government talk of subsidizing steam-ship services to the East, and spending large sums of money in opening up fresh markets. In India we had a splendid market, and we throttled it. It may take years of careful and honest grading and packing to get that market back again, but we must bend our energies toward that end. </para>

                                <para>- I have not heard of that; but I do know of our failure in India. We should sheet home the responsibility. Was the loss of that market due to dishonest dealers here, and were the Government inspectors in any way to blame ? An inquiry should be held to determine that point. Nothing has been done, the scandal has been glossed over, and the Government has apparently lost &#163;500,000 of the taxpayers&#39; money in ill-conceived and mismanaged Fruit Pools. The fruit industry is now in a chaotic condition. The men who are growing fruit in Australia are going to have a lean time, and I cannot see how they cao make even a living. It is our duty not to desert them; but they, on their side, should organize with a view to increasing the consumption of fruit within Australia. It has been said that if the people of Australia ate an apple a day the whole of the production would be absorbed locally, and the local market, as we know, is generally the best of all markets. Australia can produce fruit second to none in the world. The growers are not receiving enough money to pay them for picking it, but the price to the public in the cities is exorbitant. There is an absence of coordination and organization in the marketing of our fruit. A propaganda should be launched to encourage the people to eat more fruit, and an organization should be created through which householders could buy our magnificent fruit at a reasonable price. </para>

                        <para>I now desire to say a few words about the estimated expenditure on defence. For the coming year the Government propose&#62; to spend &#163;3,425,829 under this head. We must defend ourselves, but I .have frequently said that the cheapest and best way to defend this vast, rich, empty country is to people it. The means for the defence of Australia should be increased population, plus aeroplanes and submarines. The aviation branch of defence is starved and neglected. We are behind every other country, as far as I know, in the encouragement we give to the development of aviation, both civil and military. </para>
                        <para>The amount voted last year for expenditure upon aviation was &#163;151,915, but only &#163;120,861 was spent. For civil aviation &#163;99,127 was voted, and only &#163;48,342 was spent. That is false economy. I do not favour the encouragement of military aviation so much as civil aviation. For the current year the estimated expenditure upon aviation is practically the same as last year. There is no advancement. For civil aviation the Estimates provide only &#163;87,000, actually less than last year. Very much more should be spent. We have splendid aviators. Australian flying men at the war proved themselves equal, if not superior, to the airmen of any country in the world; but they are  not being encouraged. Many of them are trying to get a living out of civil aviation, and they are not succeeding. The Government should spend far more money than it is spending on the encouragement of civil aviation as a means, particularly, of developing the back country and carrying mails. Incidentally, it would form a nucleus for defence. To spend less than is voted by Parliament for the development and encouragement of an arm of defence like civil aviation is not economy. Every one says that we should defend Australia primarily by submarines and aeroplanes. Practically .we have neither; &#34;We are only &#34;fiddling&#34; with the job, and are discouraging many splendid young men who are willing to embark in the business. All the mail contracts in the back country should be carried by aeroplanes as a means of encouraging aviation, and to provide a nucleus of airmen and flying machines for the defence of Australia. The amount estimated to be spent this year on general stores and the maintenance of aircraft is ridiculously small. </para>
                        <para>I notice that the Government intends to reduce postal charges. That is a popular cry, but the reduction will make very little difference to the average individual. The people who will derive the benefit from it are the big commercial houses, like the one with which I am connected. That business will probably save more than any other in Australia, for it spends in postage on letters and for telegrams, perhaps, more than any firm in this country. Large distributing houses will benefit by the reduction; the average farmer or other citizen will not.  I agree that the Post Office should not be used as a taxing machine. The revenue derived from it should be spent on providing a more efficient service, and the development of telephonic, telegraphic, and postal communications for people on the land. In many isolated places - I am connected with one - they have a mail service only once a month. In some parts of Australia the people have to travel a couple of hundred miles to send a telephone message or telegram. It has become the custom in the press and elsewhere, when discussing our postal charges, to compare them with New Zealand, where the conditions are altogether different. Australia is a land of vast distances. A letter posted from Perth or Darwin has to be carried thousands of miles. The charges for city deliveries may be considered high, but they are not excessive when the average distances are taken into consideration. </para>

                                <para>- A system might be evolved to reduce charges for city deliveries, but I would not advocate preference, because I want to be quite sure that people in our out-back country are provided with reasonable facilities. I repeat that a reduction in our postal charges will benefit large commercial houses more than the average citizen in the Commonwealth. I notice that the future construction policy of the Department is to draw, to a large extent, upon loan moneys. This is only right. In the past, too much has been spent out of revenue for such purposes. Post-office buildings will last for fifty or 100 years, and therefore it is not fair that money for their erection should be drawn from the current year&#39;s revenue. I applaud the Government for their intention to give better attention to country districts, and hope that, in future, those who are the backbone of Australia are provided with better postal, telegraphic, and telephonic services. </para>

We must get rid of the idea that Australia must have all the kernels and the British people all the husks. We must realize that every section of the community can produce something that is required by people in other parts of the world, and that trade should flow along its natural channels. What does he say with regard to our fruit producers? I do not wish to misrepresent the honorable senator, but if I understand him rightly, one of his remedies for our present troubles is that Britain should pay more for her dried fruits in order to&#39; give us a preference - that she should shut out the dried fruits from other countries. The honorable senator affects to believe that we give Great Britain a preference. I do not know how he, as an intelligent man, can entertain such a belief. In what way do we give Great Britain a preference? On the very woollen goods which the honorable senator says are being dumped by British manufacturers on the Australian market, we impose a duty of 40 per cent. We give Britain a preference by imposing a penalty of &#163;40 on every &#163;100 worth of woollen goods she sends to Australia. </para>

I am under no misapprehension in that regard; but does not such an impost interfere with Britain&#39;s trade with us? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and, indeed, all honorable senators opposite, are, so far as mere words go, enthusiastic supporters of Empire. They will, if necessary, die for the Empire, but they will not trade on an equal footing with the rest of the Empire. Without the existence of a high Tariff, trade with the Empire would interfere with their banking accounts and their businesses. They are prepared to do anything for the Empire, but they will not trade with it on an equal footing. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly, but we make the other people pay. Our idea of British competition is that it shall be burdened to the extent of, at least, a 40 per cent. Tariff. If we are to work in harmony with the rest of the Empire, we&#39; should not impose a trade barrier. The two things are not compatible. We want either one thing or the other. I speak as a Labour man. On this question of preference, I do not want the British workingman to come here and share our unemployment. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> take the view that the whole of our competitive system is wrong. It gives the best results to the most unscrupulous. The high-water mark of our love of Empire would be reached if we demonstrated practically our desire to trade with Britain even in the things that we  produce  ourselves. I have no desire to place any additional burden on her starving millions in order that our primary producers may market their products to greater advantage. We speak of all our magnificent opportunities, and we invite immigrants to come and share them with us ; nevertheless, we want the British people to give us preference in regard to the marketing of &#39; our butter and other products. Notwithstanding that in climate, soil, and in other respects, we have opportunities undreamed of by the people of Great Britain or in European countries, we say that we cannot compete with them unless we put up a barrier to give our people the necessary trade protection. Britain has given us a very real preference. She has permitted our wheat producers to market their products without any fine in the shape of Tariff duties, and we, in return, show&#39; our love of Empire by imposing on articles that she produces a duty of 40 per cent. Then, forgetting all this, honorable senators opposite rise in their places from, time to time and talk about Empire preference I This system of production for profit has failed utterly. All this talk about Empire preference merely covers our own shortcomings, and prevents a consideration of the real cause and the application of the real remedy. </para>

                        <para>I think I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> say, this evening, that he had sold some bullocks recently for 50s. per head, although, according to a press report, fat bullocks in the Bendigo market were sold a day or two ago for over &#163;70 each. This is the fault of the competitive system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has lately been giving some of his time to public affairs, and therefore, in the business world, he has been at a disadvantage. He sold bullocks at 50s. per head, and now that the grass is growing somebody will, no doubt, re-sell them at &#163;50 per head, and will congratulate themselves on having beaten him in a deal. The workers now pay more for their meat and get less than ever for their money. Consumption has fallen off, and it will continue to do so, because the competitive system permits a small section of the community to make huge profits while thousands are struggling for an existence. I am always interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> because I believe that, owing to the tangle caused by preferential trade and high duties, there is room for an Empire statesman. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> would like to see a dumping board appointed to keep out of Australia all the fabrics that are manufactured in Great Britain, and that come into competition with the mills in which he is interested, including the mill that was given away by the present Ministry. </para>

                                <para>- I intend to repeat it frequently because I am satisfied that the Commonwealth mill was positively presented to the company that acquired it. The position is analogous to the so-called purchase of wheat from the &#34;Wheat Pool in New South Wales. That grain was practically given to a company, which immediately sold it to Japan at a higher price. The Commonwealth woollen mill was given to a company which first paid a small deposit, and even arranged for that to be reduced, and it subsequently set the mill at work to earn sufficient money to pay the remainder of the instalments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has a slight interest - some 2,000 shares - in the company. I shall go on repeating that story until, the whole community believes it, because it is perfectly true. Why should Australian wool be carried to Great Britain, manufactured there, and then sent back to Australia, when we can buy quite as good machinery as is used in Great Britain ? </para>

The Treasurer&#39;s statement of last year referred to this matter, and pointed out that constitutional amendment was the only way to attain real relief from taxation and undue expenditure; yet there is no mention of this reform in the Budget of this year.

The Treasurer now comes along with a Budget which should include constitutional amendments to enable two new State Parliaments to be created. The district that the Treasurer represents was to have one of the new State Parliaments. Perhaps he has now reached the height of his ambition, and there is not the same necessity for new States. I have heard that as there are only three representatives of the Country party in the present Ministry - I refer to the Treasurer, and Messrs. Stewart and Gibson - and as they are satisfied with their Ministerial positions, nothing else matters. All that I can say is that never was there a more favorable opportunity than the present for a Convention to deal with the subject of the formation of new States. After the present session terminates there will be a considerable recess during which the whole matter could be discussed by any Convention called into existence. If advantage were taken of that opportunity it would be possible, when Parliament meets again next year, to give effect to what the Treasurer and his colleagues once claimed to be of the utmost importance to Australia.

Some think we are living in prosperous times ; but we have never been in a more serious position than we are in at present. The greatest injury that could possibly happen to Australia is the loss of confidence which should exist between constituents and their representatives. </para>

                                <para>- The Treasure is not a free lance. He is responsible to a majority in the Cabinet, at a party meeting, or in Caucus ; but that will not relieve him and his supporters from the demand of their constituents that they shall adhere to their principles and do as the people; wish. The work of this Parliament has been hurried. A number of measures have been thrownbef oreus.not for consideration, but merely to enable the Government to go into recess this month, and to allow their supporters to return to their constituents and say, &#34; We have passed a number of Bills. The Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson),</inline> also moved the second reading of the Bankruptcy Bill- an effort that required a good deal of exertion on  his part,, and we passed&#39; a Customs Bill which was simply a machinery measure:&#34; They will not tell the people: that, in the Customs Bill an attempt was made to violate a longstanding principle of British justice; and that they endeavoured to pass in that measure <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> provision: which meant that a man would be held to be guilty until he could prove his innocence. The Government supporters&#39; will&#39; point with pride to a long list of legislation passed in. ten  or  twelve weeks, and say that there was no occasion for Parliament to sit during the hot summer months. They will also say that the Empire was calling the Prime Minister to confer with British Ministers on Imperial and trade questions. This is the Empire for which they say they will fight and die. They will die for it rather than trade with, it! Under their policy, if we trade with the British Empire the British manufacturers must pay a penalty before any business can be done. Of course, I know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> and others will say that it is not the British manufacturer, but it is the Australian user of British goods who pays the difference. I candidly admit that. But there is a Tariff barrier preventing trade between Australia and Great Britain. In this wonderful composite Government, one half of the members are pulling in one Way and the other half is not game to pull at all. The Bruce section is dragging the Page section wherever it likes. The Page section we were told by. . the Treasurer would , pass out of the alliance with its forces intact. I have not the exact quotation, but it was to that effect. The Treasurer said that it was an alliance between the Nationalists and the Country party, but that a composite Government had been formed from which the Country party should any disagreement arise could withdraw its division intact. During this year we have had the extraordinary exhibition of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> governing the Commonwealth, although not once has a majority of the representatives in another place met in the room of his parity. The members necessary to form that majority have met in a separate room; they have not yet attended the meetings of the Nationalist party.I trust that the Prime Minister will inform the British people of this innovation so successfully carried out and in a way that was never dreamt of on that side of the world. </para>

I do not think that any honorable senator, irrespective of the side of the Chamber on which he sits, will say that that is a fair report of what occurred in this Chamber last week. What occurred was this: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> submitted a motion dealing with the position in which Tasmania was placed owing to Certain provisions of the Navigation Act. As Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber, I rose to speak to the motion, but, unfortunately, did not catch the eye of the  President,  and the debate was adjourned on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman.</inline> Had I been given an opportunity to speak to the motion, I should have stated that the members of my party would strongly oppose it. The statement that Labour senators supported the proposition is false and misleading. I am prepared to give and take with others, but I strongly object to statements such as are being published in the press, particularly when they put the position so unfairly. The position should have been stated in a perfectly clear and intelligent manner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> &#39; knows as well as I do, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> is not in favour of black labour being employed on British ships.

If all the big business concerns have to come to the consumers, and the hat has to be taken round on their behalf, something must be wrong with the whole system. Surely we can get nearer a remedy than we should do if we were guided only by the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan.</inline> The honorable senator quoted statistics showing the amounts per head on deposit  in the Savings Bank, and said that, in his opinion, every one was in a good financial position. There must be an increase in the amount deposited with the Savings Banks, because the number of people in actual employment is larger. In such circumstances the thrift of our Australian people would naturally lead&#39; to an increase in that amount. But what are we doing to keep in constant employment that large &#39;body of men who, year after year, are looking for work? I measure the prosperity of a people by the number of able-bodied men and women who are able to maintain themselves in a reasonable standard of comfort. </para>

                                <para>- That may be so; but income tax imposts have been fairly heavy, with the result that although in days gone by, the father of a family placed all- his savings in the bank, he to-day distributes them over the accounts in the names of his sons, and thus avoids the payment of the tax. There are many who are sufficiently skilled to dodge the tax gatherer. I could quote a number of methods employed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Falkiner,</inline> who was once a member of another place and who is a director of one of our big banking institutions, said that many were adept at dodging income taxation, and he said quite recently that more were engaged in fleecing the public than in fleecing the sheep. He is an expert - I was going to say in both - but I shall not do him that injustice. At least, he is an expert in wool. With all his years of experience as a director of the Bank of New South Wales, when addressing some of the most responsible people of Australia, he pointed out that it was easier to fleece the public than to make money by fleecing sheep. The question arises, what will happen to the sheep industry when all the shrewd men adopt that idea? We have had the schoolmaster abroad for some time, and many people are becoming shrewd. It will be no use for us then to hold up our hands in horror and say, &#34; They will not work&#39;; they are going slow.&#34; If the big men are adepts at dodging the income tax, and if it is easier to fleece the public than to get a decent living from the fleeces of sheep, then we are rapidly approaching the time when an educated Democracy will say to these men, &#34; What are you going to do about it. If you cannot manage things better than this, wo will.&#34; All my life I have been working and fighting to induce Democracy to turn its attention to capturing this and the State Parliaments. I have advocated that they should do that in a constitutional way, which I believe to be the best way. If they would do this they could remedy all the evils under which they suffer. </para>

                                <para>- I am stating my opinion, but we must &#34; wait and see.&#34; I venture the prediction that speeches regarding unemployment such as those to which we have listened are dangerous. The unemployed have been told that they have no reason to complain. Supporters of the Nationalist Government have proved, by bank statistics, that the Government has made things so good that&#39; the unemployed are better off than ever they were. Let them tell that story to the man who has tramped this and other cities looking for work. Let them tell him that the average investments are so much higher ; that the deposits are now millions, whereas they were formerly only hundreds of thousands ; and that he ought to be satisfied with such a magnificent advancement, made possible by the Nationalist party. All I have to say on this point is that most of the benefit derived from the reign of the Nationalist party is due to the fact that it has not yet repealed much of the legislation passed by Labour Governments. The greater part of that legislation is still operating, particularly that which enables the workers to get a little better wage than they would otherwise receive. Who are the opponents of giving the workers what they earn? The opposition comes not from this, but the other side. </para>

                                <para>- The Labour party pushed old-age pensions into the arena of practical politics, and forced other Governments to grant them. I suggestto <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the two parties in this Parliament should declare an armistice on the question&#39; of old-age pensions ; that the 2s. 6d. increase should be made l5s, so that the old-age pensioners would receive 30s. a week each, and that both parties should agree for twenty years not to advance beyond that amount. That would remove the old-age pension question from public discussion, and &#39;it would prevent the parties bidding one against the other in 2s. rises for the people&#39;s support. I am quite sure that our party would be lucky enough to bid &#163;1. If we were sensible men in this Parliament we would surely say that the aged people of Australia were entitled to 30s. a week each. We could hold a conference, agree to a fixed amount, and declare an armistice for a certain number of years. If the Government will make it 30s. a week I promise not to open my mouth again on the subject while I am in public life. Labour commenced in this country, as Labour &#39;has always done, in fear and trembling. Those men who are prepared to go the whole distance in one stride have -always been looked upon as extremists, and have never &#39;been listened to. I am one of the timid men, cautious in what I do, careful in what I propose, intent upon &#39;keeping to the old cleared track. 1 do not very often look for support or try to win elections by what I offer to the people. The one thing I have in my mind is to keep intact the machinery which, if taken possession of in real earnest by the workers, would make their conditions better. I do not want them to follow any of the wild-cat schemes, which I have no doubt are financed by the big-monied interests of this country, and have for their object the introduction to our movement of men who, by passing exaggerated resolutions and making wild statements, will make the movement look as ridiculous as possible. The war panic being over, the workers are now determined to organize and take possession of the State and Federal Parliaments. When they have done that they will go much further than they have ever gone before and will make it impossible for men who are willing to work to wait an the rain as they do at the foot of Bourke-street, Melbourne, and round &#39;the employment agencies in Sydney, in the hope of finding it. These men form deputations and demonstrate when the State Parliament is opened in New South Wales. What do they demonstrate for? The right to earn the wherewithal for themselves and their families. This is a matter that Parliament should settle. I do not think there are two opinions about the need for settling it, but there are, perhaps, 100 opinions regarding the way in which it should be settled. I believe that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and I were sitting at a table and trying to devise a scheme for continually employing those who are willing to work, and providing for those who are not, there would not be much difference between us after an hour&#39;s discussion. As soon as he realized that all I wanted was a sound scheme to prevent the economic waste caused by unemployment, I have not the slightest doubt that he would meet me more than half way. He would say, &#34; I go farther than you. I have had a business training. I am connected with one of the great business houses in this country, and knowhow . to develop and do these things.&#34; He would put me on the right road to solve the problem. </para>

                                <para>- My scheme is simple. It postulates that no man willing to work shall have to look for it, but that those who have work to do shall look for him and fetch him. We have plenty of work crying out to be done, but we are doing everything possible to find the other fellow to do it. Let us suppose that there are 1,000 men in Bourke-street, Melbourne, willing to work. Let us suppose that we have an intelligent Government, which wants to develop this &#39;undeveloped country, and to do work which will furnish a return, perhaps not tomorrow, but in the course of a few years. Surely we could evolve a scheme to employ these people for that work. Surely it would be a saving to the community to employ them. There is something wrong, not only in this country, but in Great Britain, the United States of America,  and elsewhere, when these are 11 percent, of the population unemployed. Unemployment is an awful economic waste. There are many ways in which those men could be usefully employed in this young country; and if they were usefully employed, no objection would be raised by the Labour party to our brothers from Great Britain being brought here. We have no ill-feeling against the (Britisher. What we complain of is that glowing pictures of Australia are drawn in Britain, but when the immigrant comes here, the promises made to him are not fulfilled. Some of the new arrivals become stowaways in order to get back to their native  land.  If we could only devise a method by  which  men who are willing to work would have work togo to, I venture to say that we would deserve well of our day and generation, and  this </para>

                        <para class="block">Parliament  would go  down  to history as She greatest Parliament that ever sat. It is difficult to imagine, with the prosperity of the people increased by the earnings of the 151 per cent, now unemployed, where development &#34;would begin and end. The Nationalist party is not bent on doing  that,  but on keeping in existence the present system by  which  a few men become wealthy. Subsequent speakers from the other side will probably point to a few men who have drawn prizes in -this gamble, and have risen from the lowest rung of the ladder to the highest. These men are to be found in the Public Service and in the business life of the community. In Sydney  there  are thousands of men who,  with very little advantage  in their early childhood, are now big business men. </para>

                                <para>- Perhaps when the honorable senator has heard what I have to say in refutation of the charge he may change his mind. To attempt to get at (the root cause of unemployment in Australia, we might very well sit here all night and all day to-morrow. I intend, in the time at my disposal, to advance some of the reasons why this bright and sunny land of Australia is not free from a trouble that is common to the older countries of the world. It appears to <inline font-style="italic">one</inline> that one of the main reasons is that industries, which ought to have been established on a sound basis, have not been able, as the result of a mistaken policy on the part of those engaged in them, to continue profitably owing to the continued diminution of output. We had such , an instance but a short time  ago at Newcastle. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company&#39;s steel works there were closed down for many months mainly because of this diminution of output from week to week. The management being unable to meet the competition of the imported article, were forced to close the works, and hundreds of men were thrown out of employment. I have no doubt that the same contributing causes are at work in connexion with  many  large industrial concerns in our metropolitan areas. The future development of Australia depends on the continued expansion of her primary and secondary industries; but, unfortunately, the army of. unskilled labourers is year by year growing in size, while, on the other hand, the skilled artisans who play so important a part in our secondary industries are becoming fewer. This state of affairs in .the industrial arena is, in my opinion, one of the chief factors in our unemployment problem. Those primarily responsible for it sure trade unionists who, many years ago, combined to make the skilled trades a close corporation and to demand what wages they pleased. </para>

The object originally was, as I have said, to create a close corporation for the especial benefit of a limited number of skilled artisans. Those men forgot, however, that the time would come when they would have growing lads of their own, who had&#39; just as much right as their fathers had to adopt a skilled trade as a calling. These lads were debarred through the operation of the policy limiting the number of apprentices to be employed in skilled trades. </para>

In view of the present position, is it any wonder that unskilled men among  immigrants now arriving in Australia are finding it difficult to secure employment in our cities? I am confident, however, that if we approach this problem in the right spirit, we shall eventually find .a way out of our present difficulty. </para>

                        <para>We have been &#39; hearing .a good deal about the preference which we should show to Great Britain and which Britain should show to Australia. Notwithstanding that in our Customs Tariff Act the duties against articles of British manufacture are fairly high, yet the schedule, as a whole, gives substantial preference to Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> would have us believe that, because there is a duty on British goods, we are not giving any preference to Great Britain. That, of course, is an erroneous conclusion. Let me refer honorable senators to one item in the schedule, namely, that relating to cotton textiles. I forget, how many mil- lion pounds&#39; worth of manufactured cotton goods were, imported last year. It is important ,to note that they came in duty free from Great Britain, whereas there- is a duty of 15 per cent, on such goods imported from the United States of America. I remind honorable senators that this is one of the biggest items in the Tariff list, and, if it does not give substantial preference to Great Britain, I do not know what preference is. It must not be forgotten that, from a manufacturing point of view, Australia is a comparatively young nation. British industries are firmly established, whereas Australia is just at the beginning of her career as a manufacturing country. How could we possibly evolve a Tariff to fit in with our necessities as a manufacturing country if we admitted duty free the bulk of the goods that would compete with our industries? We could not, of course, hope to compete with the manufacturers of the Mother Country. We must first build up our industries. I am not, by any means, a prohibitionist. I do not believe in the erection of a Tariff wall over  which competitors from other countries could not possibly climb. That policy would be directly responsible for the establishment in Australia of jelly-fish, spineless manufacturing industries, devoid of initiative and resource. When our industries, are firmly established, we may then consider the revision of our Tariff schedule in respect of competitive manufactured goods from other countries, and perhaps without fear that the competition will be disastrous to our own industries. </para>
                        <para>I desire to remove a misconception that has arisen in the course of the debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> referred to the proposed increase of the allowance to old-age and invalid pensioners. Speaking of the allowance made to the inmates of benevolent institutions, he made what appeared to be a reasonable suggestion, namely, that those people should receive the difference between the cost of their upkeep and the amount of the pension. If the actual cost of their maintenance was, for instance, 12s. 6d., and the pension 17s. Cd. per week, the honorable senator suggested that the inmate should receive 5s. I happen to know a good deal , about the administration of benevolent institutions in Tasmania. I find that in 1914 the average cost of maintenance per head at the Newtown charitable institution at Hobart, and at an allied institution at Launceston, was &#163;37&#34; per annum, or approximately 14s. 6d. per week. In 1921-22 - the last year for which: statistics have been published - the average cost had, however, increased to &#163;66 per annum, or about 25s. a week. That disposes of the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that there should be a balance available for the men and women in such institutions who happen to be in the same category as old-age pensioners. The proposal in the Budget is that, irrespective of what it costs to keep a person in a benevolent institution, he shall receive an allowance of 3s. a week for pocket money. That puts a totally different complexion on the whole matter, and I am glad that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> finds himself in such a happy financial position that he is able, not only to increase the pension from 15s. to 17s. 6d. per week, but also to increase the weekly allowance of these inmates from 2s. to 3s. a week. I am sure that With the attention the inmates receive in such institutions, they will be quite as well off as, if not better off, than the average pensioner outside with a larger income. The increased cost of maintenance in. these institutions has been mainly brought about by the fact that the barrack like buildings have been transformed, and wardsmen have been replaced by nurses. This has made a great deal of difference to the comfort of the inmates, and the diet provided is on a much more liberal scale than it was a few years ago. </para>
                        <para>On page 6 of the Budget-papers there is a reference to the very heavy additional expenditure that has occurred in late years. The increase in expenditure omitting war expenditure, for the year 1922-23, as compared with 1918-19, amounts to &#163;9,735,000. If we did not analyze the true position of affairs to-day we might think that we were considerably increasing our expenditure without receiving anything in the way of compensation ; but on looking through the Treasurer&#39;s  statement I find that the revenue increased during the same period to the extent of &#163;20,300,716. Those figures are very gratifying. But what is even more pleasing is the fact that the statement shows clearly that instead of last year&#39;s operations resulting in a deficit, they ended with a considerable surplus . That was brought about by the unusually large sum. collected in Customs and Excise duties. I find that the- Customs receipts for 1922-23 amounted to &#163;32,872,129. In 1918-19&#39; th&#187; amount received- was- &#163;11,465,410, so that&#39; the increase amounted&#39; to&#163;2I,406,7il&#39;9 in the short, space of. four years. It is a wonderful record, and it makes one wonder whether the- apex of Customs revenue has been reached&#39;. The details&#39; arc, I think, appalling; inasmuch as we find&#39; that 43 per* cent, of the total7 amount received by way of Customs- and Excise revenue represented duties on stimulants and narcotics. </para>

I do not agree with, the methods, proposed for the disposal of portion of the surplus. - 1 am in favour of using some of it,, as the- Government propose, to* increase- the invalid, and old-age pensions;, and I also agree to-&#39; provision being made for a. sinking fund, and the paying off o&#163; the gratuity bonds. </para>

                        <para>Reference has been made to the loss incurred  by  the Commonwealth in connexion with the fruit  industry  and I indorse all that has been said in regard to the possibility of overcoming the existing difficulty  by  effectively organizing distribution and thus minimizing expenditure. Those engaged in the fruit-growing industry, unfortunately, are not adept at organization. A  few  years ago when there was  an  enormous crop of apples, the Victorian growers arranged to supply householders throughout Melbourne and the metropolitan areas with graded fruit  at certain  prices. Delivery was made to householders on specified days. The distribution was so well organized that a large quantity of  apples  which would otherwise have rotted were readily sold at good prices, and this helped the growers to tide over the period of temporary difficulty. Organization of that character is commendable, and I have frequently told the growers in Tasmania that they should adopt a similar policy. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. The average householder has very little opportunity of securing good quality fruit at a reasonable price. There should  be  no difficulty in arranging for supplies of case and half -case lots on receipt of cash with the order. Reference has also been made to the quality of certain exports which it is said were of  an  inferior quality, badly packed, and unfavorably commented upon  by  purchasers  in  other countries, with the. result that  the  trade has received  a  setback from Which it  will  take some time to recover. Certain business people  in  New South Wales  and  in other States have thus lost the opportunity of establishing  a  permanent business connexion with Java. The goods exported were not  up  to standard. </para>

                                <para>- No. An effort is being made, as far as possible, to protect the interests of farmers and pastoralists whose crops and grass are threatened with rabbits and other vermin. The average man on the land has not the opportunity of purchasing his requirements in wire netting, and no doubt the action of the Government in this direction will toe appreciated . When the Appropriation Bill is in Committee, due attention will, I trust, be given to the various items of departmental expenditure, and I shall reserve any further comments I have to make until that stage is reached. I sincerely trust that the Treasurer&#39;s estimates will be realized.. If the measures proposed to be submitted, are approved by Parliament, I have not the slightest doubt that Australia will continue to prosper, and that industries throughout Australia will recover from the setback they have received during recent years. </para>
