                            <para>- Some of it is not. It has been somewhat elaborated. The statement to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> has referred conveys the impression that it is intended to open a new office in Adelaide, but we have a branch of the Customs Department in Brookman's Buildings at the present time. It is my intention to make some arrangements by which I shall be able to interview business people in Adelaide concerning Customs and other matters. </para>

                            <para>. - I wish, in the first place, to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny</inline> on the speeches they delivered in moving and seconding the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. The mover, as a new senator, certainly showed in his maiden speech in the National Parliament that he possessed the valuable qualification of being able to condense his matter. In regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny,</inline> I am sure he will not expect me to eulogize or condemn him, as he has before gone through the ordeal, and in seconding the motion he spoke as we expected him to speak. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>I do not propose to reply to all the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner),</inline> and I am sure he will excuse me if I refrain from so doing. It would be better, I think, if we both reserved our powder and shot until we meet again, when we shall have definite measures to deal with, and when we shall be able to indulge in a more practical form of discussion, as anything I might have to say now would be more in the form of a prophecy. One remark, however, of the honorable senator's cannot be allowed to pass without comment, and that is his reference to the Honorary Minister in this Chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson),</inline> who, he said, could be likened unto a butterfly flitting from flower to flower. I object to such a term being applied to my colleague, and. any one who looks at the honorable senator will admit that whatever defects bo may possess he cannot reasonably be compared with a butterfly. </para>
                    <para>I have given some attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> comments on the constitutional situation and the events leading up to the formation of the new Ministry, and as that matter will have passed into the limbo of forgotten things by the time we meet again, I propose to say a few words in reply to his statement. I have had the opportunity of reading the honorable senator's speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I take it that the gravamen of his attack is in the quotation which I shall make. He said the issue before the country was, " Bid the Hughes Government possess the confidence of the people? It waa <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> himself who made that appeal to the- people, and when the verdict had been given the correct and constitutional course for him to take was to retire immediately or to call Parliament together at the earliest possible moment to see who should govern the country." The honorable senator, having surveyed that position, then formulated his views. I do not think he adequately consulted the constitutional authorities before he formed his: opinion; but, having surveyed the position, he then proceeded to find, as he submitted, constitutional statements and authorities in support of his contention. It would have been far better for the honorable senator to first consult the authorities and then give us the benefit of his views thereon. If he had done so, I am sure that he would not have .expressed the opinion he did, because all constitutional authorities, including many of those he quoted, as I shall show, are against the views he put forward. The late Ministry took one of two courses. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> as I shall show, appears to have decided that the Government should have taken the two courses pointed out by him. The ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> retired, not perhaps as soon as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> would have liked, but no one can say that his retirement was protracted. The cx- </para>
                    <para class="block">Prime Minister retired in a constitutional way immediately the result of the elections could be said to have been accurately determined. The Leader of the Opposition knows quite well that the result of a general election, in Australia cannot be ascertained within a day, or a week. We have to compare the size of the Commonwealth with the size of some of the countries to which he referred. </para>

                            <para>- No. One has only to take into, consideration the size of the country to realize that the term " immediately," as applied to an election' in the United Kingdom, has a very different meaning when applied to Australia. The Leader of the Opposition, finding that what had been done was not to his liking, made up his mind to search constitutional authorities for light and wisdom. In <inline font-weight="bold">'Sir Henry</inline> Parkes' <inline font-style="italic">Fifty Years in the Making of Australian History,</inline> he found, in two letters, a number of precedents, but it would have been more informative to the Senate, and to those who, in the future, may read his remarks, if he had given the  reasons  for those letters. They owed their origin to the fact that a Government, after an adverse vote at the polls, continued in  office  for three months without calling Parliament together, and had made an arrangement with a private banking institution for funds, in lieu of obtaining Supply through Parliament. That was not the position in the recent crisis. The Government had Supply from Parliament, and, therefore, there was no analogy whatever between the constitutional position in New South Wales, as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and the recent political situation in the Commonwealth. In other words, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> put up a bogy, and then he proceeded to knock it down. He assumed, for the purpose, of his constitutional discourse, that the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had perhaps advised the Governor-General whom to send for.  His  remarks were directed, in great part, to the abstract question - " Whether or not it is a constitutional practice for a Minister retiring from office to advise the </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Crown as to his successor." <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes had digressed at length on this subject, not as an impartial, but as an interested, observer - a candidate for office - as to whom the Governor in New South Wales should send for. No one doubts for- a moment that the authorities quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, and the views expressed by him on this matter, are in accordance with constitutional practice observed in the formation of the present Government, and, indeed, of all Federal Governments in this country. ' T suggest, also, that it was somewhat pedantic on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to quote at length all the statements he did. He gave as a reason for doing so - and it appears to be the only reason he could put forward - his desire to place them on record in order that they may be readily accessible to honorable senators.  His  speech on this subject will, however, prove a reservoir of disjointed extracts on constitutional government. The honorable senator quoted Edward W. Ridges' <inline font-style="italic">Constitutional Law of England,</inline> as follows : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The present practice upon the formation of a new Ministry is for the Crown to call on the recognised leader of the party which has been returned- with a majority in the House of Commons to nominate  his  colleagues. </para>

                                <para>- I am coming to that point also. Every one knows the quotation, " Much learning doth make thee mad." I am not suggesting, of course, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is mad. I think there was more purpose than madness in his recent utterance on the constitutional issue. He seems to have been laboriously studying all the eminent authorities on constitutional law in order to support his assumption ; but there are two or three quotations that may be recalled. In Todd's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Government of England,</inline> one of the authorities quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> there appears this opinion - </para>

Every student of politics knows that, whilst certain things ought to be done, some amount of preliminary action is necessary. For instance, there are questions in which the Commonwealth and States are alike interested. These are not matters of State right, <inline font-style="italic">per se,</inline> but they deal with the concurrent powers of the Commonwealth and State Parliaments, and affect both. The question of finance, as one illustration, involves something more than the mere raising of loans, although it includes that function. It affects any attempt to reduce the cost of government, and to obviate the overlapping of Federal and State jurisdictions. There is a field in which, with the exercise of common sense by Federal and State Governments, considerable savings can be made to the taxpayers of Australia. We have no power arbitrarily to decide these questions; we must obtain the good-will and the co-operation of the States. Equally the States have no power arbitrarily to affect the Commonwealth; they in their turn must secure our co-operation. </para><interjection>

It is essential that the Commonwealth and the States should meet, and that there should be some agreement. Here, again, it is impossible for the Commonwealth of itself to supply the remedy; it can come only by agreement between the two authorities. That will take time. Steps already have been taken! to get the States to meet us. I "want to emphasize the point that this is not merely a question of State rights; it is more a question of industrial peace and order. </para>

That requires, first of all, conference, and subsequently, almost certainly, legislation by this Parliament and possibly by the State Parliaments. </para><para>Another matter which seems almost a. challenge to our common sense is the fact that in the Commonwealth, not only have we seven tax-collecting authorities, but, actually, we have seven statistical collecting authorities. We have the Federal authority collecting statistics over the whole of Australia, while every State duplicates that statistical bureau, and collects, very often, the same statistics. In many cases two returns have to be made out by employers or owners of factories and others - one to the Commonwealth, and one to the State. In some cases, these returns provide certain information for the Commonwealth which is not called for in the State return. It is a perfect farce to allow this to go on. I was present at a conference in 1916 when it was unanimously agreed by the Commonwealth and State Governments that there should be one collecting authority. The Commonwealth offered that, if there were any statistics which it would not otherwise collect, but which the States required, it would undertake to collect those statistics. </para><interjection>

One is immigration, and the other is the general question of finance - State and Commonwealth. </para><para>I am sure that every honorable senator is pleased to see that an increasing stream of immigrants is coming here. But. the worst advertisement that Australia could: have and the thing that would kill immigration quicker than anything else, is to have immigrants come here and not be satisfactorily placed after their arrival. Whilst it is the Commonwealth's responsibility to obtain these immigrants and bring them out, it is the States responsibility to place them after their arrival in Australia. That necessitates close and complete co-ordination between the Commonwealth and State authorities. The Commonwealth, in order to. protect itself, must see that, the arrangements for providing these immigrants with work are satisfactory. Equally, the States have the right to be consulted as to the class of immigrants selected, and the. manner in which they are brought out. </para><para>When it comes to the question of finance, we find that many things are happening which are not good for the credit, either of the Commonwealth or of the States. Take, for instance, the issuing of tax-free loans. The Commonwealth, some time ago, decided not to issue any more tax free loans, but the States are proceeding to issue them, and that must have a bad effect on Commonwealthfinance as well as' a bad effect, ultimately, on State finance. It is continually lessening the area of income that is taxable within Australia. </para><para>Then there is the question of the conversion of the huge loans that are falling due in the near future. That: alone is such a big question that it needs the united efforts of the Commonwealth and the States to see, that, the taxpayers - who are the same people whether they are taxed by the Commonwealth or by the States - are provided with a scheme of finance that will prove economical. All these are questions which the Government must face and deal with before it can bring forward the necessary measures for the consideration of the Parliament. </para><para class="block">We come next to the wider issue of Imperial relations. Every one will agree that the one great difficulty with which our producers are meeting to-day is that of finding markets for their produce. Our oversea markets, with the exception, possibly, of those for mutton and wool, are not as satisfactory as we should like them to be, yet there rests, in the Empire itself a buying capacity which, properly organized, would make our markets safe. And there is another side to the picture. We, as Australians, would like to see the unemployed in the heart of the Empire absorbed; we should like to see Britain maintain her supremacy among the nations of the earth, and if, whilst giving full protection to our own industries, we could at the same time, by mutual preference, assist British markets and the British producer, we should not only confer a benefit on ourselves, but help and benefit the whole of the Empire. The Economic Conference which is to be called will do important work in endeavouring to find a solution of that problem. </para><para>There is also the question of Defence. The time surely has arrived when representatives of the various parts of the Empire should meet to formulate some common plan for the future defence of their common interests. The Washington Conference has altered very largely the basis upon which our pre-war plans for common defence were drawn. No Conference has since grappled with this question, and it is essential, therefore, that representatives of the various parts of the Empire should meet to discuss it. It is improbable that the proposed Imperial Conference will be held before the Parliament again meets, but, in the meantime, the Government needs to formulate its own views as to what ought to be put before that Conference in order that it may give the Parliament some indication of what is in its mind. That must be done so that our representatives may go to the Conference with the knowledge that the proposals they put before the British 'Government and the Governments of the remaining parts of the Empire have the approval and goodwill of the Commonwealth Legislature. </para><interjection>

Honorable senators are aware that, from time to time, considerable exploratory work has been carried on in the Northern Territory with the object of discovering rock oil,  and that some very promising indications of the probable existence of such oil in the Territory have been found. But no one can say that  these explorations up to the present have proceeded along scientific or ordered lines. On the contrary, there has been what may be described as a free and easy scramble. I have no doubt that if a vote of the Senate or, indeed, of the people of Australia were taken, as to the best geological advice we could obtain on this subject, the verdict would go very strongly for that of Professor <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edgeworth</inline> David.

He recently saved the Government of Western Australia some expenditure 'by pointing out to them that a party of people who had been sent to the North- West to grow cotton "had been settled in the wrong district. He has had those people moved to another place which holds out more hope of success. A desire to grow cotton will undoubtedly lead people to expend money, and it would be well if we could have portions of the Territory indicated as suitable and prospective growers fortified with expert knowledge. </para>

                                <para>- Transport is the next subject upon which I propose to touch, though on the present occasion I shall deal only with local transport. Up to the present, for some years past, the Commonwealth Government have been endeavouring to give the Northern Territory a shipping service for what might be called the coastal trade. Various steamers have been purchased and sent there, and a large amount of money has been lost by the Commonwealth in running these services. During the last year we have been running a vessel known as the auxiliary steamer <inline font-style="italic">John Alee,</inline> a vessel of 31 tons, to the outports, with the result that we have lost £6,000 on the year's operations. It seems to me that the time has arrived when we should cry a halt, and try a new method. The Government, holding this view, called for tenders for a coastal shipping service, offering a subsidy of £5,000. The service is to be supplied for three years, and the successful tenderer has to provide a vessel of not less than 80 tons, to carry out voyages as required from Darwin to Roper River, Borroloola, Victoria River, and such ports as the Administrator may direct, the total voyages not to exceed in any year a distance of 17,000 miles. Fares and freights are on a fixed scale, and the successful tenderer has to pay all ' the usual port and Customs dues. A tender has been accepted on those terms. </para>

                                <para>- Let me deal with one thing at a time. The successful tenderer is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dennis</inline> Morley Rooke, and the name of his vessel is the <inline font-style="italic">Rachel Cohen,</inline> of 95 tons net and 171 gross. She carries all the necessary boats, and her cargo capacity is 250 tons. She is fitted with twin screws, and is equipped with a hoisting engine. The Commonwealth will have a much better service than that supplied by the vessel at present in use, and at a cost of £1,000 a year less. As to the other service, we are paying a subsidy at present to Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, who run steamers from Brisbane and Sydney to Darwin. This contract with Burris, Philp, and Company has another year to run, and although the freight and fares are higher than we like them, still, when we take into consideration the time at which the service was commenced, they are not unreasonably high. Undoubtedly, when that contract terminates, we shall endeavour to get a more satisfactory service, with cheaper freights and fares; and I may say that Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, at our request - for we could not compel them - have reduced these charges somewhat below what they are entitled to charge under present conditions. As to the overseas service, I venture to say that we have first to create the demand. "We have done something in that regard by the provision of a cattle race at Port Darwin, where we have encouraged and developed the shipment of live cattle, of which a number of loadings have been satisfactorily carried to Manila. The race is working so beneficially that, whereas under the old system many days were occupied in loading a ship, the last vessel sent away took on 500 head of cattle in four and a half hours. Furthermore, the old system was responsible for knocking the cattle about, and bruising them, whereas under the new conditions there is no bruising, and casualties <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> are lessened. Inquiries are now being made with a view to developing trade to other ports in the East. </para>

                                <para>- That question is at present under consideration of the Meat Council,  which  was called together under the auspices of the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> and is continuing its work. We have also to remember the fact that Vestey's works may be re-opened. That firm has made certain proposals to the Government, in view of the further development of the pastoral industry in the Territory as a whole. All these matters are under the consideration of the Government, but as no decision has been arrived at in regard, to any of them, I am not in a position to say more at present than that we: believe the best way to develop 'the Territory is by means of the' pastoral industry. It may foe that in the meantime oil, or some mineral discoveries may give us a lead in' another direction; in any case, the* Territory has1 demonstrated its capacity for growing  'Cattle,  and' we- propose to render1 all the assistance we' can in this direction. "We hope that the Barclay Tablelands will eventually be stocked with sheep;, certain propositions are being: made in that direction ;, and here, again,  the Government will offer all the encouragement and assistance- in its' power.  A.  statement was made the other day by, I believe; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Goldfinch^ that there is a possibility of a meat famine; and I think that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> holds the opinion that that part of the Territory can 'be used for the raising, of sheep. This appears to me a promising line of development, which would be even more beneficial than the raising of cattle, for sheep country requires larger expenditure, and affords more employment. </para>

                            <para>.- The Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has dealt very quietly and easily with a number of subjects, and I am truly glad that he has at last told us what should really have been embodied in the Governor-General's Speech. Had all that information been disclosed to Parliament on the opening day there would possibly not have 'been so much criticism of the Government. I shall not go into the question of the constitutionality of the method of forming, this Government, because that matter has been pretty well threshed out already, but I do congratulate the present Ministers on their Government made, to order for us. All we on "this, side can do now is to criticise the acts and policy of the Government, so far as. they have been disclosed,, until another election puts another, set. of Ministers in power. Why was there all this secrecy about the formation of the Government? We heard much about "managing" and "leading," and about honorable gentlemen- opposite going in the dead of night to Mayfair Plats and other places in Melbourne and. its neighbourhood. We were told by the newspapers that all that the present Government were then doing was "for Australia" - to save Australia from the rule of the Labour party. But if it had not been for the Labour party, which was ridiculed when the Australian Fleet was first formed under the. Fisher Government, where would Melbourne and Sydney have been to-day? It was truly the Labour party who saved Australia for Australians. It is said by our politcal opponents that the trade unionists are the Bolshevists of the country, but I remind honorable senators that it was the trade unionists who fought and bled for this country, and saved it. Why are our friends opposite not honest enough to say that they " saved Aust tralia" 'by securing to themselves office and pay for the few months that they will occupy those 'benches? The Labour party did not desire to take office in this Parliament, and never would unless given permission to do so by the people. The present Govern-* ment have not the people's sanction . to rule, and have no right to be in office. They have, however, an artificially* created majority, and for a time they may do as they please.. They are now going into recess for four months in  order to formulate a policy, which one man could prepare in five minutes, because the policy for the good government of Australia is laid down by the Constitution, although it has never been put into force by any Commonwealth Government. If the men who opposed the creation of this great Federal machine twenty-five years ago could rise from their graves they would find a verification of their prediction that the Federation would prove unwieldy, costly, and unworkable. It stands to-day a monument of huge expenditure without commensurate national results. There is only one way in which adequate results can be achieved, and that is by unifying Australia, having one Government, one taxing master, and one tax collector. Until Australia is governed by one central authority no party will be able under the present Constitution to do a fair thing by the people. We are told that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> proposes to call a Conference of State Premiers in order to discuss various public matters. Where is the need for such a Conference? This Chamber was constituted with a right to speak for the States, and no other authority has that right. The Senate, however, does not do its duty in that regard, and is, to that extent, losing the rights which the Constitution gave it. The Premiers meet together and agree that this and that should bo done; there is no reference to the Federal Parliament. Under the existing circumstances, no Government or party can do justice to the ideal of Australian nationhood. Any party that is game enough to go before the people and advocate the abolition of all State Parliaments, the division of Australia into provinces, and the establishment of one central Government, will win from Cape York to Cape Leeuwin. In every State the people are eager for a man to rise who will teach them what is to be gained from Unification. The present Federal system is useless; it can achieve nothing. The present Government is the last and the worst that the system has produced, and their administration will but hasten the time when the people will change their minds in regard to Unification. And yet still we hear the hypocritical cry of the Government and its supporters, "All for Australia and none for self " ; " Save Australia from the </para>

If the soldiers had been wise in their day and generation they would have taken charge of Australia when they returned from the war. Amongst the men who served in the Australian Imperial Force were some who were as smart as any serving in this Parliament, and with the large voting strength at their command they could have taken charge of this Parliament and the Commonwealth. Why was there so much secrecy; why this combination of silk sox and woop-woops? The two parties at present allied can never work together. In the negotiations that preceded the formation of this Government all were for self and none for Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">Bt  the hist election, and it would win in every part of Australia if men were game enough to advocate it. The trouble is that candidates are not game to cut their own political throats; I am. They prefer to continue the present huge expenditure and this ineffective governing machine which is inflicting so much damage upon the industrial life of the country and causing so much unrest and distress. That does not afford any section of the community' a fair chance of making good, either for themselves or for the nation. In a few years the taxation of the Commonwealth will rise to such an extent that it must smother us. Our borrowing  ha3  increased year by year, and neither the States nor the Commonwealth can show r.ny works completed which will serve to recoup the country for this expenditure of loan money. In my opinion, it could be curtailed by cutting out all unnecessary Governments. Surely, our Ministry must feel ashamed of themselves, by proposing to go into recess for several months, -while Australia is thirsting for legislation. The following figures indicate how the indebtedness of Australia has grown during the last two decades : - </para>

                </para>
                <para>And we have nothing to show for this huge indebtedness that will help to produce a return. Its sole achievement has been to create land values. I would not permit such a huge expenditure to continue for such a purpose. I would go further, and compel the holders of the vast freehold areas in our midst to submit: as every one else has had to submit, to a drastic cutting down of their incomes. While, on the one hand, there is misery among a great n maher of the population, on the other hand, there are people in our midst who spend on their own pleasure and enjoyment in one week what would feed and clothe them for a year. If the National Government do not do something for the welfare of the country by boldly tackling the problem of the national debt, the Commonwealth will be practically bankrupt within a few years. </para>
                <para>I want to say a word, now, about what I may call race suicide - a matter of greater interest to future generations of Australia than is anything else I know of. No Government has been game enough to tackle the question of a disease, the record of whose ravages is hardly fit for publication, but it is time some Administration introduced legislation which would have the purpose of freeing Australia from this dreadful scourge in, say, a hundred years' time. The reports of medical men point out how necessary it is that those who have the welfare of the Australian nation at heart should do something in this direction. The press could do much, but still we see in their columns advertisements which should never be permitted to appear. A few cases come to light, but there are thousands which are hushed up.' Any one who likes to study the question can get all the information in the Library, and a walk in the streets would demonstrate the ravages of the disease. There are plenty of cases of suicide due to it. Unfortunately , in many cases, the sins of the fathers are visited upon the third and "fourth generation. I want this great National Parliament to do something in this direction. It is really a question of race culture, or race suicide. One does not care to be outspoken upon such  a  matter, but the Government who have a medical gentleman in their ranks should endeavour to do something in the interests of the health of the community, for the purpose of preventing, as far as possible, the spread of this scourge. </para>
                <para>T do not propose to say very much more. As has already been said, it is like flogging a dead horse to talk to-day, but I shall take every opportunity of watching what the Government are doing, and to see how the fifteen men who have swallowed- the whole National party succeed in this Parliament. I am sorry that the National party did not see fit to fight on the floor of Parliament, where we could put the " acid " on them a little. Now, however, they are powerless, and, to my mind, the sooner the Ministry commit political suicide, the better it will be for the country generally. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to offer my congratulations to the mover and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline> who was the mover, gave a very fine exposition of his views concerning many important subjects, and," indeed, he is to be complimented upon the manner in which he carried out his task. In the speech of  His Excellency  the Governor-General, honorable senators did not find any 'outline of the policy of the Government. We could not reasonably have expected to do so. Its nature, however, was such as to afford us opportunities to express opinions upon several matters affecting the welfare of the Commonwealth, and these opinions, I trust, will prove helpful to the Government in formulating their business programme. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I desire, first, to refer to the extraordinary position in which  the Commonwealth Parliament has found itself as an outcome of the recent election. The present Parliament was not elected by a majority of the people, but actually by a small minority. Proportionately fewer eligible persons exercised the franchise last December than at any other Commonwealth election. Apart from Queensland, there was not one State in which a 50 per cent, vote was recorded. Even including the magnificent Queensland vote, I believe that the final official returns will reveal that rather less than 54 per cent, of the eligible population of Australia went to the polling booths. In certain of the States only 42 per cent, of the voters exercised the franchise. Australia has been put to considerable expense in providing compulsory enrolment. The natural corollary of compulsory enrolment is compulsory voting, and I trust that that fact will have the serious attention of the Government. Compulsory voting would be no new thing in Australia. The Commonwealth Parliament, in  1915,  passed a measure to provide for compulsory voting in connexion with the referenda proposed to be taken upon the subject of constitutional alterations. The Act was not enforced, however, for the reason that the referenda were not held. During the same year the Queensland Government passed a Bill to provide for compulsory voting in connexion with State elections. Queensland representatives in this Parliament may justly claim that the splendid vote, cast in the north last December was due to the existence of that Act. It provides that every person within a specified distance of a polling booth must vote. Every eligible adult who fails to vote is required to furnish a reason, and, unless that reason is deemed to be adequate, the person concerned must pay the penalty provided under the Act. </para>

                        expressed the hope that the existing immigration policy of the Commonwealth would be enthusiastically carried on by the new Government. He spoke optimistically concerning the outcome of the continuation of that policy. An interjector commented that the effect would be merely to add to the ranks of the unemployed in Australia. I heartily indorse the expressed views of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson.</inline>
                        Instead of adding to the ranks of the unemployed, I feel confident that a vigorous immigration policy would absorb our workless population. Those who recognise Australia's vast  possibilities are confident that this country can carry .very much greater numbers than are resident here to-day. We look for a reasonable immigration policy to considerably develop our untouched and only partially exploited resources. I may mention Australia's prospects of cotton-growing as one very important example. I understand that the industry has now been placed upon a sound footing. In Queensland last year the total area under cotton cultivation amounted to only 6,000 or 7,000 acres. It is authoritatively estimated  that the area placed under cotton crop this year will be fully 60,000 acres. Any one who reads the commercial intelligence published in British newspapers must realize that the world is being more and more seriously faced with a shortage of 'this universal -requirement. The shortage in America is becoming actually alarming. Australians should take every advantage of the great opportunity which is opening to them. Latest statistics show that the American production last year was 6,000,000 bales less than that for 1914, while the con-, sumption during the same period had increased by 4,000,000 bales. Unless America's considerable difficulties with regard to cotton production are overcome, that country before long will have no cotton to export, and England will be called upon to look to Australia, together with certain other countries, for the production of her raw material. I read only yesterday in the Melbourne press that the Australian Cotton-growing Association, through its managing director, had issued a statement to the effect that Australian growers had now increased in number from 2,000 to 15,000- all in the short space of twelve months. The fact augurs well for our future. "We should take every advantage of the experiences of. America in .connexion with the devastations caused to cotton . crops by disease and insect visitations. We are not only interested in the possibility of cotton-growing in Australia. . I can clearly see that if the growing of cotton becomes one of our staple industries, there is no reason why the manufacture of cotton textile goods should not be one of the greatest of our secondary industries. Already the English manufacturers of cotton textiles are having their attention directed to the openings that exist for their goods in Australia. The value of plain cotton textile fabrics, such as unbleached calico, and goods of the plainest description, imported from the United Kingdom into Australia .in the year 1920-21, was £764,000. Of white plain goods, such as calicoes and similar materials, the value imported was £3,871,699; while of dyed and printed cotton goods the value was £8,500,000. Those items make a total of over £13,000,000 worth of plain, dyed, and printed cotton textile fabrics imported into Australia from the United Kingdom only. In view of our wonderful resources of power and climate in Australia, there is no reason why, with the assistance of experts from the Old Country, we should not. see a beginning of the cotton-manufacturing industry in Australia within the next two or three years, in conjunction with cotton-growing in those parts of the north suitable for the purpose. We even imported cotton and linen goods to the value of £892,000 from Japan last year, and similar goods to the value of £945,000 from America. The people of Australia are spending on imported cotton and linen goods, at Customs values, something over £15,000,000 annually. If we could manufacture only a proportion of these articles iri Australia we might be able, eventually, not merely to supply the needs of Australians in these plain fabrics, but to export a surplus to the Dutch East Indies and the near East, where there is a great demand for this class of goods.
                    </para>
                    <para>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a matter of very considerable importance, not only in the development, but in the maintenance, of Australian industries even at their present standard. I must first refer briefly to the overlapping of the Federal Arbitration Court with the State Wages Boards. In this connexion there is, first, the question of the employment of juveniles. At the outset I make bold to say that every man who has a heart will agree with me when I say that every boy born in Australia should be given an opportunity, in the land of his birth, of developing his gifts and becoming a useful member of the State- in which he resides. He should be allowed to follow the occupation for which Providence has fitted him. In endeavouring to put that idea into practice, the States of the 'Commonwealth have incurred, especially during the last eight or nine years, very heavy expenditure in the development of the technical branches of their school curricula. What is the abject of incurring .this heavy expense in providing the necessary staff for technical instruction? The object is, first of all, to give a boy °an opportunity to find himself - to find the occupation for which he is most fitted - so that in the future there may not be so many round pegs in square holes, or square pegs in round ones. After the expense has been incurred, and care and attention have been lavished upon the  boy  in technical classes, the time arrives, when he has to leave his school and take up an occupation. What is the experience of 50 per cent., and perhaps even more, of parents, when they take their boys out to find them an occupation for which they have been proved to* 'be fitted, and in which they have had primary tuition? The ordinary experience, is that after visiting every manufacturer or tradesman employing labour in that particular trade, the parents return home broken-hearted and disappointed, because they find the doer closed: to their son. This occurs, not because the employer has no room for the boy, and not. because he feels, that the boy is not of the right class for the job, but because the law has said that he, shall not employ more than one apprentice to every three or four adults. How can we, while wo perpetuate such an absurd system, hope to maintain the proportion of skilled workmen necessary to the development of the Commonwealth ? It is not fair to our youth,, and it is certainly not fair to the Commonwealth. If that policy is persisted in we shall find, in a. few years' time, that the. bulk of our skilled workmen will have to . 'be imported from oversea countries, while our own boys will become the unskilled labourers of Australia. This question has received the attention of many thinking men. In America a congress was recently held to deal with the matter, and in Victoria last year a conference was called at which the subject was fully discussed. It has been suggested that the difficulty might be overcome by the State assuming the entire control of the boys during the whole of what would ordinarily be their apprenticeship period, and then turning them out as skilled workmen. Whatever' is done, I hope it will be in the direction of insuring that every Australian boy horn to his parents shall have an opportunity to develop to the full the ability with which he 'has been endowed. I wish to. cite an instance of what has. actually occurred quite recently in. Australia. I have. been pegging- away at this; question for, the last five, years, and: I intend' to stick to it, and to do what I can, by my influence, my voice, and my vote, to insure that the Australian 'boys shall receive treatment which is fair and reasonable ; that no boy shall continue to be handicapped in life, as he is to-day, and that we shall net always have to meet the problem of the increasing cost of living, which confronts us today.  The  cause of the increased cost of the houses that we live in is that if an employer needs twelve skilled workmen on a job, he generally has to be content with only four or five. Let. any honorable senator ask a master builder if he can fill up the ranks of his employees with the necessary number of skilled workmen - I say " skilled workmen" advisedly - in order to complete a building at a reasonable cost. He will state that he cannot do so 'because boys are not allowed to follow the occupation for which they are fitted. The employer has to be content with men who, although they receive the standard wage, have not had the training necessary to make them skilled workmen. </para>

                            <para>- The lack of skilled operatives in every trade is evident throughout the Commonwealth, from Carpentaria, to. the' southern portion of Tasmania, and it- is one of the main, factors in maintaining the high cost of living. Some five or six year* ago, I spoke on similar, lines in the Tasmanian Parliament, and whilst: I remained, a member oil the Tasmanian. Legislature I entered my protest each session against the continuance of this great restriction upon the employment of juvenile labour in skilled trades. Two or three years ago, and since I have been a member of the Senate, the Wages Board determining the conditions of a certain industry in Tasmania met and reconsidered the whole position, with the result that in the building trade they altered the proportion of juveniles to adults, which had been fixed at one to three, to one to one, realizing that with the former proportion it was impossible te maintain the requisite number of skilled tradesmen. That determination has remained in operation. But only a month or two ago, a Federal Court, whose awards apply to Tasmania, fixed the proportion of apprentices in this particular trade at one to four, making the position in Tasmania infinitely worse than it was a few years ago. Here we have the spectacle of the determination arrived at by a Wages Board, constituted by a State Parliament, overridden as regards the State by an award of the Federal Arbitration Court, and the position with regard to the restriction of juvenile labour in a particular trade made much worse than it was some years ago. </para>

                            <para>- What it means is that if our boys cannot get into the trades for which they are fitted, they have no option but to become street sweepers, or earn their livelihood at any  unskilled  occupation they can find. Their special gifts and talents are ignored by our legislation. Under one class of legislation throughout Australia, there is an enormous amount of money being spent to qualify boys to follow trades for which they are specially fitted, and by another class of legislation we close the doors of those very trades to them. This verges on a travesty. I hope that when we are discussing the question of the duplication of industrial legislation this matter will be kept in view, and that each State will, be permitted to work out its own salvation in regard to such matters. I am able to say that many prominent trade unionists take the same view of this matter as I do. One man said to me that, when the restriction of juvenile labour was first spoken of, trade unionists felt that it would be a great tiling for them, because the number of skilled men would become so few that they would be in a  position  to demand any wages they pleased. But he found that to-day he could not get his own boys into the occupations for which they were fitted. He had not thought that he would have boys later on who would desire to follow certain trades. He is now satisfied that the restriction of the number of apprentices in trades was a selfish idea. I admit that in the past there were abuses connected with the system of apprenticeship, but surely we have advanced sufficiently today to be able to avoid a recurrence of those abuses. </para>

                    <para>It is opportune for me at this stage to refer to the duplication of Federal and State activities mentioned by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I indorse what the honorable senator has said on the subject. I hope that at the Premiers' Conference, which is to take place very shortly, common sense will prevail, and that without any injustice being done to the States it will be found possible to prevent taxpayers being harassed unduly, as they are at present by the duplication of taxation schedules. I hope it will bo found possible to evolve a scheme by which one return only will be necessary for both State and Federal taxation, and that that return will be a very simple one as compared with the income tax schedules which have now to be filled. Under the present system honest men, prepared regularly to pay the taxation due from them, have, in many cases, no idea of how the schedules should be filled up, and they are obliged to employ a lawyer, or some one else to fill "up their- returns for them, and so are doubly taxed. In connexion with the subject of taxation I should like to remind the Leader of the Government in the Senate of a statement which I made last year or the year before. in this  Chamber,  and which I repeat today. I believe that the time has arrived when the Federal Government should cease to collect taxation which is not absolutely essential to the financial welfare of the Commonwealth. During the war period it was quite legitimate for the Government to collect taxation from every avenue from which revenue might be obtained. Taxation was then derived from sources which I claim we are no longer justified in levying upon. I refer especially to the entertainments tax. Surely it is a paltry thing that the National Government of Australia should  levy such a tax. It was never intended that the National Parliament should impose an entertainments tax unless it was really essential. </para>

                            <para>- But our revenue is higher, and everything points to the probability, notwithstanding the remission of £3,000,000 in taxation, that we shall have a handsome surplus at .the end of the financial year. If such should be the case, surely the time is opportune for the Government to discontinue collecting taxation in this form, which is beneath the dignity of a national Parliament. I wish to refer to one instance in particular of the administration of the Federal Entertainments Tax Act. In Hobart an organization known as the Hobart Regatta Association was formed eighty-five years ago by a number of worthy men and women who banded themselves  together  and decided that an annual regatta be held on the Derwent. Since the formation of that association an aquatic carnival admittedly superior to anything of its kind held south of the line has been conducted every year, and the day on  which  the carnival is held is regarded by the people of Tasmania as a national holiday. No charge whatever is made for admission to the grounds, and the people, no matter whence they come, are in every sense provided with a day's pleasure free of cost. Fully 20,000 attend this annual gathering, and the people throughout Tasmania contribute funds to meet expenditure. "With the surplus contributions received from time to time the association has constructed a stand in memory of a gentleman named Colvin, who was for many years the secretary of the association, in which seats are allotted to members. The Federal Taxation Department, however, has this year called upon the association to pay an. entertainments tax. </para>

A tax is being imposed on members of the association who occupy seats in their own stand, and the Department might just as legitimately levy a tax on the people who provide their own tents or who take chairs from which to witness the sports. The Department would also have as much justification in levying a tax on persons who pay a small amount to the lessee of the kiosk in the Fitzroy Gardens for the use of chairs on a Sunday afternoon when there is a band performance.

The money is voluntarily subscribed to provide free amusement for the people, and surely we have not reached such a stage in national affairs, and when the Department is in such sore straits, that it has to demand from such an association a tax on tickets issued? I do not know on what grounds the Crown Law authorities arrived at such a decision. </para>

                    <para>Tasmania is one of the most important States in the Commonwealth, not because of its area, but. in consequence of its importance industrially and otherwise, and the people of Tasmania justly claim that they are entitled in every respect to the treatment meted out to taxpayers in the other States. Our geographical position should not handicap us in the matter of national legislation; but we are penalized. Honorable senators have already heard of the inconvenience experienced in consequence of a. provision of the Navigation Act which gives certain discretionary powers to the Minister, and under which the Peninsular and Oriental Company's vessels were allowed to carry passengers from Sydney to Melbourne to witness' the Melbourne Cup. During the tourist season, however, the same vessels are not allowed to carry passengers from the mainland to Tasmania. Surely that is an anomaly that needs adjustment. </para>

                            <para>- Is the desire of the people to witness the Melbourne Cup of greater importance than carrying thou- sands from the heat of the mainland during the summer to recuperate in the delightful . climate of Tasmania? Which is the greater emergency from a national point, of view? I claim that the tourist trade would be the greater, yet permits have been granted to the Peninsular and Oriental Company to carry passengers between. Australian mainland ports, and. without any knowledge that the traffic could, not be. handled by rail. No person can show, on the information available, that any number of people desired to travel to Melbourne by sea because they could not travel 'by rail, whereas in the case of Tasmania, a very large number of tourists is excluded because the facilities for travel are not available. </para>

                        - That may be so. For the same reason the tourist traffic to Tasmania has been seriously interfered with because the necessary facilities have not been provided. The former Minister for Trade and Customs
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline>
                        to whom representations were made a few months ago, sent the Director of Navigation to Tasmania to inquire into the position, and I understand his representations are now in the Department. I think he indicated that in order to meet the; situation it. would be necessary to amend the Navigation Act, but whether he advised the Minister that this was desirable or not, I cannot say. If an amendment is necessary, I hope that it will be introduced by the Government at an early date.

                    <para>In other directions Tasmania has been at _ a disadvantage. I was rather surprised to learn, from, a report in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> a few days ago, that an alleged injustice to Tasmania had been ventilated on the floor of the Tasmanian Parliament. Honorable senators will, no doubt, recall that in the Customs Tariff schedule there are a number of items to which deferred duties are attached. Woollen yarn is one. It was to be admitted free from the United Kingdom until 1st January, 1923, and thereafter upon payment of a duty of 10 per cent. Last year Tasmanian importers and manufacturers ordered a quantity of this woollen yarn from England. It was sent by a vessel calling at mainland ports before reaching Tasmania. The vessel, through probably stress of weather or some untoward cause, arrived in Australia rather late in the year, namely, 25th December,, hut sufficiently early for the Melbourne cargo of woollen yarn to be. discharged before the. 1st January. </para>
                    <para class="block">Consequently, importers and manufacturers of the mainland obtained this yarn duty free. When the Tasmanian importers and manufacturers were made aware of the late arrival of the vessel they telegraphed to the Melbourne shipping agents, asking them to tranship the Tasmanian consignment of woollen yarn by the first steamer leaving for the NorthWest Coast or Launceston, but were advised that the cargo was stowed in such a way as to make it impossible to get at the Tasmanian consignment. As a result the vessel discharged at Hobart on the 5th January, and Tasmanian importers and manufacturers were  called  upon to pay the duty of 10 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- It is £188. But this is the position. By means of Tariff protection we are trying to build up certain industries in Australia. We are encouraging the establishment of industries engaged in the spinning of woollen yarn, but there are other established concerns - that are dependent upon supplies of this product. We have such industries in Tasmania, and, unfortunately,- by the late arrival of this consignment, they are penalized to the extent of 10 per cent. Our legislation should not differentiate as between the different States. Cases similar to the one I have just mentioned might be met by providing that the duty should 'be levied upon the arrival of the vessel in territorial waters. I intend to approach the Minister to see if the matter can be re-opened, and a rebate made to the Tasmanian importers. </para>

                    <para>Statements have been made quite recently regarding the necessity for the extension of our telephonic, telegraphic, and postal facilities for the man out-back in Australia. I have been astounded when I have read in the press of public men having made statements inferring that nothing has been done, that everything remains to be done. Honorable senators may have had the privilege and the pleasure of reading a little book issued under the auspices of the ex-Postmaster-General a few months ago, showing in concise form what was the policy which was brought before Parliament last year, and indorsed by honorable members, with regard to telephonic, telegraphic, and postal communication for the people outback. Yet the ex-Postmaster-General has not received one word of credit on that account. It was the finest policy which was ever introduced by a Postmaster-General anywhere. Before the ex-Postmaster-General vacated his Ministerial room, after he was defeated, I brought under his notice the fact that forty settlers were isolated in a portion of Tasmania without telephonic communication, and they were very keen on having the telephone provided. I asked, him to have inquiry made, and to attend to the matter as speedily as possible. Within twelve days I received from his Department a communication stating that the line had been approved. You could not have- anything done more rapidly than that. </para>

                            <para>- I hear gentlemen stating that it is time better facilities were granted. . Our present policy provides that a telephone shall be granted free of- cost to out-back settlers, where circumstances warrant it, provided the construction of the line does not cost more than £1,500. In the great majority of cases, where telephonic communication is required, the cost is infinitely less than that; the expenditure of £300, £200, £150, £100, even as low as £50 in some places, will grant the concession. .1 think that the ex-Postmaster-General deserves credit for the policy he introduced. It was a bol'd policy, and it will confer an inestimable benefit on those people upon whom we will have to depend so much in the future - the men who are prepared to go out and pioneer in the back country. </para>

                    <para>The honorable senator who has just resumed his seat <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Payne)</inline> referred to matters of peculiarly Tasmanian interest. That, connected with the administration  of the Customs, is one in which my interest has been aroused, like his, very recently. The matter has been debated in another place, and, to some extent, that is, on the floor of the Legislative Assembly of the State Parliament. However much one might take exception to the fact that a matter of that kind is debated there, perhaps sometimes we set an example which causes State Legislatures to adopt courses that we, perhaps, think are reprehensible. My honorable friend himself, during the course of his remarks' just now, was pulled up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> with the query whether a matter he was discussing was not one which came more properly within the province of the State. I think, however, that the honorable senator connected his remarks afterwards with Federal responsibilities. </para>
                    <para>This particular matter was ventilated at some length in the Tasmanian Legislative Assembly the other evening. During the course of the debate the question was asked, "What were the Tasmanian Federal members doing?" </para>

                            <para>- Having failed to secure redress themselves, they thought that the Federal members were handy to be blamed. As far as I know, practically the whole of the Tasmanian Federal members heard nothing whatever of this grievance. It has to ' be remembered that uniformity cannot always be obtained in connexion with the imposition of duties everywhere which come into operation upon a certain day. There is no doubt whatever that for eighteen months it has been known to all who were interested that those duties were to become operative on a' certain day. The day could not be shifted backwards and forwards because a vessel happened te come into Australia and arrive at one port before the day and at another port after the day, discharging cargo of the same nature at both ports. The converse, has happened in the past, and no notice has been taken of it. I remember in connexion with previous Tariffs that have been passed when in another place a duty has been lowered, or even removed, during the course of the discussion it has been pointed out that a vessel that very day had been discharging cargo, subject to that duty, in one part of Australia, and the next week would be in another part of Australia where those importing goods would get the article duty free or on payment of a lower rate of duty. </para>

It might be possible to arrange that all dutiable goods arriving on that date should be treated as having been entered in Australia, no matter when or where in an Australian port the vessel might subsequently discharge. </para>

                    <para>The omission from the Governor-General's Speech to which I propose to refer is very important to Australia, and is one in which I have taken the greatest interest. I allude to postal rates. If the press accounts are to be relied upon, the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> seems to be disposed to adopt something in the nature of penny postage, or, at all events, to bring about a reduction in the present high postage rate on letters. I view that possibility with a great deal of pleasure since, as honorable senators are aware, whenever the question has been dealt with in the Senate I have insistently and continuously stood for the adoption of reasonable rates. In September, 1920, when the rate on letters up to \ ounce in weight was raised to 2d., I was in very strong opposition to the increase, and spoke at some length, both in the Senate and in Committee, upon the subject. I pointed out that to adopt a twopenny postal rate for letters was a retrograde movement, and I dealt with the advantages and disadvantages of such a rate to city and country. I said then, as I have before and since frequently said from platforms throughout the country, that the country and not the city people would most benefit by a reduction of the letter postal rates <inline font-style="italic">io</inline> Id. per ^ ounce. Taking the weight of the mail matter that goes out of a big city business house, and goes into it, it is more than probable that the average payment in respect of it is considerably less than Id. per £ ounce. Circulars and the hundred and one forms of correspondence in which large city business houses indulge to-day go through, the post at a considerably reduced rate. On the other hand, there is scarcely a communication sent through the post by country residents, including people in business in country districts,- which has not to bear the ordinary letter rate of 2d. per § ounce. Business people in rural districts do not issue circulars or large quantities of printed matter, and so do not reap the advantage of the reduced rates in respect of such mail matter. In September, 1920, I emphasized the point that the Post Office should not be a tax collecting machine, and although the responsible Minister at that time  questioned  some of the data that I supplied to the Senate, I think I was able 1 to verify it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> speaking out of his experience as a Postmaster-General, took the same stand that I did. On that occasion I stressed the point that, in respect of letters going through the post, Australia compared with the United Kingdom and. New Zealand, gave the minimum weight for the- maximum, rate. We find that in New Zealand the maximum weight that can be carried through the post for the lowest rate ranges up to 1 ounce, if not 2 ounces;, instead of only half-an-ounce as in the case of the Commonwealth. la the United Kingdom the maximum weight carried, through the post for the lowest rate, runs up to 4 ounces. Although I emphasized that point at the time, the Minister disagreed with me, but I succeeded  eventually in convincing the Senate that we in. Australia were paying the maximum rate for die minimum weight. That was the position with the ordinary postage rate of l£d. per half ounce without increasing the rate to 2d. per half ounce. I am glad that the representations then made have borne fruit. The. very contrasts, which I introduced here between our rates and those prevailing in New Zealand and the United Kingdom have recently been used with great advantage in causing the Department to review the whole position. </para>
                    <para>Incidentally, while dealing with, this matter, I, too, wish to' join with the preceding <inline font-weight="bold">speaker (Senator Payne)</inline> in paying a tribute of gratitude and appreciation to the ex-Postmaster-'General (Mr: Poynton) for the work that he did, particularly during the last twelve or eighteen months, in the direction of extending postal telegraphic, and telephonic facilities to the outback.

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline>
                        has said, "some other bloke" will now come along and reap the honour and glory of the exPostmasterGeneral's  work; but I hope that when the people of the Commonwealth cast up their accounts in connexion with this, matter the . name and actions of the honorable gentleman will not be forgotten, and that due credit will be given him.
                    </para>
                    <para>Telephonic communication is another important consideration to which I invite the attention of the Government. I do not think I need elaborate. I believe I shall be voicing the experience of every honorable senator when I say that the telephone system, especially in the larger cities of Sydney and Melbourne, is very far from being satisfactory. The telephone system in Melbourne and Sydney requires examination from top to bottom. The services of inspectors might be of some advantage in securing an improvement. If inspectors were empowered to enter business houses and residences where telephones are installed and suddenly to call up the exchange with the object of connecting up with it or some other exchange, they might in the course of their experience realize what subscribers have to put up with. It may not be that the annoyances with which subscribers have to contend are in any way due ito the officials in the exchanges. They may be due to other circumstances, but unless we have inspectors with power to call at private and business houses and suddenly to ring up the local exchange, it appears to me that the Department will never fully realize what the experiences of subscribers are. </para>

I have often thought that, so far as Melbourne is concerned, and Sydney; also, to some &lt; extent, if a person is in a hurry to get a message to some one who is not more than half or three-quarters of a mile away, it is much better to walk than to try to communicate by telephone; if a person has a little time to spare, let him take a tram, but. only if he has- a holiday let him try the telephone. The experience of telephone subscribers is enough to drive them mad; indeed,, I know some who will not go near a telephone unless they are rung up and they know there is somebody at the other end, or they have the connexion made for them. The whole system requires investigation. I am not in a position to point out where the system is at fault, but, certainly a subscriber does not get the " goods " for which he pays. </para>

                    <para>The administration of the Navigation Act, to which <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Payne</inline> has referred, i3 of great. interest to Tasmania. Last September., when I referred to it at some length in this Chamber, I was inclined to think that I had the sympathy of senators who were present on that occasion. Certainly, I introduced the subject on a Supply measure, but a number of honorable senators, by interjection, and others, by remarks afterwards, gave me to understand that in their opinion the case for Tasmania waa one that called for the most favorable consideration, as requested by me and other Tasmanian senators; they seemed to show that their sympathies were with the island 'State. During the recent election campaign I submitted the suggestion that the Navigation Act be a mended, so far as Tasmania is affected. We are the only island State of the Commonwealth - we are the only State that is not . only unconnected, but unconnectable,  'by rail. All the five mainland States are  connectable;  any portion of the mainland is  connectable  with the great centres: of population in it. Tasmania, geographically and physically, is not in that position, and our case calls for some exceptional treatment. Of course, we are faced with constitutional difficulties involved in the matter of discrimination, but it seems to me that provision could be made to amend the Act by providing that, at least, British mail boats - mail boats which have a contract either with the Commonwealth Government or the British Government for the transport of mails between the Commonwealth and Great Britain - should not be deemed to be engaged in the coasting trade in relation to the ports of Tasmania and other ports of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Government will give full consideration to the position of Tasmania, and will submit to Parliament a remedy for the undoubted handicap under which that State is suffering, and, moreover, that the Senate, however it may be constituted, will support any action with that end in view. Honorable senators will remember that when I spoke on this subject at some length in September last, I intimated what had been the terms of the reply given in the previous year to a deputation which waited on the responsible Minister of that time. Honorable senators then seemed, or, at any rate, some did, astonished at the nature of that reply. I can only now say that last year the representations were reiterated on behalf of Tasmania to the then </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister. In my. remarks hero in September I indicated that we Tasmanian representatives were going in a body as a deputation, and that I hoped that if the Government brought down any proposal to meet the position it would be given a favorable reception here. We did go as a deputation to the Minister; and when our representations were under the consideration of the Government, the Minister, though he was not prepared to offer any relaxation of the conditions in order to provide for the tourist traffic and general trading of Tasmania, had, as we learned through the Tasmanian pres3, actually relaxed them in the case of a vessel the owners of which desired to bring visitors from Sydney to the Melbourne Cup! What can we think of the judgment, to say nothing of ordinary common sense, that on the eve of an election, permitted a responsible Minister, when the whole of the people of Tasmania had been and were clamouring to be put on an equality with the sister States, to refuse to relax the provisions of the Navigation Act on their behalf, but to relax them in order to enable " Cuppers " and " trippers " - possibly some of whom, though I do not say all or the greater proportion, were wanted by the police - to travel from Sydney to Melbourne in order to see the Melbourne Cup race? That, coming from the mainland side of Bass Strait, was an insulting answer to the reasonable request of the people of Tasmania for communication with its sister States at a time of the year when it was essential that every bottom available should be trading between Tasmania and the mainland. Tasmania, rightly or wrongly, considered that bound up with this matter was the question of the export of its products to the other end of the world. While they were seething with excitement and indignation, they "learned that the great Commonwealth Government was making provision to enable Cup "trippers" to come from Sydney to Melbourne, though refusing that provision in the case of Tasmania, for coping with its tourist traffic and the export of its fruit to the Old Country. Thus the Government was carrying out the traditional "wowser" policy of the Australian Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Commonwealth says to Tasmania, "You run Tattersalls; we cannot allow letters to go addressed to John Jones, in Water-street, Hobart, because we believe, or the Postmaster-General thinks, that he is an agent for Tattersalls." What a wicked, awful man John Jones must be! Neither will the Government allow a letter to go addressed to A. 13. and Co., of Hobart - a well-known firm established for seventy or eighty year3, and as reputable as any in the Commonwealth - because it is thought that some of the employees of the firm may be agents for Tattersalls. But the moment the bookmaker or the " punter " from Sydney asks for a relaxation of the Navigation Act provisions in order to enable him to visit the Melbourne Cup, the Government say " Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Ikey  Mo, you can have it." To Tasmania, the Government say, "No; stand back, the provisions of the Navigation Act are sacred, even though the apples rot in the orchards because they cannot bo taken to London.'' The people who swelter in New South Wales and Queensland, and desire to go to Tasmania for a month in the summer are unable to do so because the sections of the Navigation Act are sacred against all but  "Ikey  Mo." I trust that the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will give proper consideration to the peculiar position of Tasmania, and to her legitimate claims, and that when this matter comes up again honorable senators and members of another place will sec that evenhanded justice is dealt out to Tasmania. When the Navigation Act was passed it had for its object the building up of the Australian mercantile marine, and it was confidently predicted, and generally hoped, that the conditions to be provided for employers and employees would build up one of the most contented marine services in the world. But hardly had it come into operation than we had for three years in succession strikes or lock-outs - call thom what you please - the effect of which was to cut off from its sister States the  only island State in the Commonwealth. We were not concerned with the Montagues of owners or the  Capulets  of employees - " A plague o' both your houses," said </para>
                    <para class="block">Ave. Our ports were waiting for ship ping, our people were waiting to travel to the mainland, people on the mainland were waiting to travel to Tasmania, and we had produce ready for export to the sister States and overseas. Tasmania was isolated; and its people considered that if, after giving all the benefits of the Navigation Act to the employees, and protection to the employers and owners, they were to be treated in that way, the operation of the Act should be relaxed in order that Tasmania might be able to " function " properly as one of the sister States of this Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the general question of immigration, I have been told - I am not' in a position to vouch for the accuracy of the information - that although a great many people are flocking into the Commonwealth as immigrants under the arrangements that have been made by the States and the Commonwealth, there is almost as large, if not as large, an outflow. It is said that numbers of the new arrivals do not stay long, but return to their homeland dissatisfied and alleging that misrepresentations had been made to them. I am not in 'a position to say whether that information is correct, but it has been conveyed to me on more than one occasion and in more than one place, and I hope, for the sake of Australia, for the success of the immigration policy and for the development of the States, that these statements are without foundation. But if there be any justification for them, I trust that the Commonwealth Government will see that there is no further misrepresentation which will lead to disillusioned immigrants returning to their native land and there becoming a bad advertisement of the Commonwealth, its immigration policy, and its possibilities. </para>
                    <para>Another matter not mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech, although I suppose it will be mentioned in .the speech with which he will open the next session, is the unification of railway gauges. Honorable senators are aware that an agreement has been made between the Premiers of the five mainland States and the Commonwealth for the unification of gauges, and if I remember rightly, the estimated cost of unifying the gauge from Brisbane to Fremantle is approximately £21,600,000, of which the Commonwealth proposes to accept responsibility for one-fifth, or £4,320,000. The five mainland States will bear the burden of the other four-fifths - not- in proportion to the amount of work to be done within the borders of each, but upon a population -basis. </para>

Motor transport has not nearly come into its own; we have not even visualized or  visioned  its ultimate development. There is also air transport. The authorities might well consider to what extent the unification of railway gauges may be justified in view of the probable conditions of transport fifteen or twenty years, or even eight years, hence. </para>

                            <para>- Whether the railway gauges be unified or not, roads will still be necessary. Air transport is bound to grow to enormous dimensions in the near future. We are too accustomed to look at our problems as if conditions were stationary. That is far from being the case. I remember seeing within a few months before the election of the first Commonwealth Parliament the first motor car to arrive in Melbourne, and I can still recall the astonishment with which people regarded it. The people of to-day would be even more astonished if they could see that pioneer vehicle; they would think it was a 'bus centuries old. Think of the universality and luxury which the motor car has developed in twenty years. The mastery of the air is a much more recent achievement ; but consider, to what an extent flying is indulged in to-day. It is no longer a mere experiment or a means of  communication  to be adopted in the last resort. </para>

Its dimensions and the quantity of its contents astounded me, )vet it was moved about in that narrow lane with the greatest skill and ease. Having regard to modern methods of road construction, the development in the construction of motor vehicles of every description, and the impetus given to transport by aviation, the authorities will require to consider carefully the amount of expenditure to which they should commit the people for the purpose  of unifying railway gauges. They will need to compare carefully the advantages of unification with the disadvantages of the present system, and. then have a good regard to the possibilities of the development of other systems of traction and transport. </para>

What would a motor car do on a continuously good road? I recollect asking in the early days of the Federal Parliament whether the Government of the day would take steps to invite Signor Marconi to come to Australia, as it was stated in the press that he was leaving Europe to visit the Orient. I remember there were those in the Senate and elsewhere who ridiculed that proposal. They regarded wireless telegraphy as a "dud," and some members expressed astonishment that this fanciful scheme had not originated in America. To-day wireless telegraphy is in universal use. So, too, with motor traction and transport, and air transport, the rapidity of their development should be considered in connexion with the costly project of unifying the railway gauges. </para>

                    <para>An important matter to which I invite the attention of honorable senators is one which is consequent on a Bill passed last year, the Public Service Superannuation Bill, and I ask the favorable attention and consideration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to it. He was a member of the Senate, as I was, when 'the Judiciary Bill was introduced it was introduced first- into the House of Representatives, and came to the Senate from that Chamber - and he will remem'ber, as I do, that the measure when introduced contained a provision for the payment of pensions to members of the Federal Judiciary upon their retirement. A debate ensued in the House of Representatives upon this clause; and, on a division, which was never regarded properly as a test vote, the provision was amended. There were members in the House of Representatives who favoured the payment, of pensions, but not at the rate intended to be paid, as set out in another clause of the measure, and they voted for amending the provision in question, not believing that the vote they were giving was to be taken as a test vote on the general principle. The Commonwealth Government of that day experienced the greatest difficulty in launching the High Court. Nothing that I can remember in the history of Commonwealth legislation imposed a more difficult or more irksome task on the Administration of the day than did the successful legislative establishment of the High Court. During lengthy debates in another place honorable members said that the Court would not have any work to do for years. There was at the time .1  very strong  Kyabramatic  atmosphere throughout Victoria. It was suggested by some that the Court could be from time to time, as required, constituted of the Chief Justices of the several States or of other Justices. Lengthy arguments had to be urged to show that, constitutionally, such a course was not possible, because the Constitution required that Justices of the High Court should only be removable by a joint address from both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament, and otherwise should hold office for life or good behaviour. Every move possible was made to defer and delay the setting up of the Court. The most optimistic prediction concerning it was that it might be called upon to deal with twenty cases in a year after having been established for some years. Eventually .the High Court was constituted, first with three Justices, and later with five, and. now it has seven. The Supreme Court of the United States of America consists of nine Judges - some years ago there was a proposal to increase that number to twenty-one - and besides the Supreme Court there are Federal Circuit Courts and Federal District Courts. The Federal Judiciary of the United States of America runs to something over 130 or 140 Judges, dealing with. Federal matters only. No one can say that our High Court of seven Judges is not kept busy from one year's end to the other in the different centres and on circuit. The expedition with which it deals with its volume of work is a marvel to those of the legal profession, not only in Australia, but also abroad. What I wish to emphasize is that it was only by a singular accident that no provision was made in the J  Judiciary  Bill for the payment of pensions to Justices of the High Court. It was not a party question. There were men of all parties in. the House of Representatives who strongly supported the payment pf pensions; others were against pensions on principle; and others simply were opposed to the scale of pensions proposed in the Bill. However, one of the strongest arguments, and, in fact, the only real argument used against the principle of the payment of pensions, was that other officers of the Commonwealth Service had no corresponding provision made for them. Last year we remedied that defect by providing a scheme of superannuation for our public servants to which the Commonwealth generously contributes, and that having been done, I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will now see the necessity for endeavouring to convince his colleagues of the wisdom and justice of reviewing the position of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament towards the High Court Justices in this regard. </para>

When the first Chief J  Justice  of the Commonwealth came to that age at which he found he- had to retire from active judicial duties, we had the unwelcome, and distasteful, spectacle of finding him, or those interested in him, approaching Parliament for a special Bill to deal with his case, and make provision, by way of a pension, for his remaining days. Parliament passed the Bill, upon which there was a lot of criticism at the time, but he did not live long to enjoy his pension. </para>

                            <para>- That was the salary paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J</inline> ohn Madden when he was Chief Justice. But I fancy it was reduced to £3,000 before his death, and that his successor got £3,000. The other Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria are paid £2,500 each. The Chief J Justice  of the High Court is paid £3,500, and has no right to a pension, whereas the Chief Justice of Victoria, with not nearly the extent of responsibility that the Chief Justice of the High Court has, gets a salary of £3,000, and is entitled to a pension. I think, that the Chief Justice of New South Wales, is paid £3,500. At any rate, the other Judges of that State are paid £2,700 each. The Chief Justice of Queensland was getting £3,000. I am not sure that he is getting that amount now, I do not wish to  enter  into details, but the comparison of the salaries paid to the High Court Justices with those paid to the Judges of the Supreme Courts of the States shows that the Commonwealth Justices do not get anything extraordinary. If a man were offered the position of Chief Justice of Victoria or the position of Chief Justice of the High Court, he would be well advised to take the emoluments and the work of the Chief Justice of the State. That is not right. Now that the Public Service Superannuation Act has taken away one, if not the only one, of the reasons which caused some people to oppose pensions for. Judges on principle, we should make some provision for the payment of such pensions. There is another aspect of the question. In some of the States, men at the Bar earn considerably more than is offered to the Chief Justice of the High Court, and it is desirable, when filling vacancies upon the High Court Bench, that the Commonwealth should not be limited in its choice. It should be able to offer to those whom it seeks to take up such high responsible positions something beyond the honour itself that will attract them. The honour of sitting upon the Bench of the first High Court was very great; but those Judges who took office did so at considerable pecuniary sacrifice, actual or prospective. Now that the Superannuation Act is in force, the time has arrived for the. Commonwealth to place our High Court Judges in a position to correspond at least with that occupied by State Judges and those in the United Kingdom. The Federal Judges in the United States of America - whether of the Supreme, the Circuit, or the District Courts - all retire on pensions. They may retire at the age of seventy; but whenever they do so their pensions are made equivalent to the salaries enjoyed at the time of retirement. I think there is no legal provision in Great Britain that Judges, upon retirement, shall receive pensions. It is the practice, however, to provide pensions. If that principle, or method, were adopted in the Commonwealth, there would be no necessity to leave the matter each time to Parliament. Circumstances to-day differ from those which have existed at any time since the High Court came into existence. I hope, at any rate, that there will be no recurrence of happenings like those connected with the retirement of the first Chief Justice of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>have referred many times previously to the subject of a Constitution Convention. A Convention is foreshadowed once more in the speech of the Prime Minister. If it is convened, I trust that it will not be given the right of considering and revising the whole of the provisions of the Constitution. As long ago as November, 1914, I moved, in the Senate, for the calling of a Constitution Convention. It was to have been one which would be elected by the people on the same franchise as that for the Senate - that is to say, there was to be an equal number of representatives from each of the States. The Convention would have sat at such places and times as might be prescribed by the enabling Bill, and would have reported - first, as to the need; secondly, as to the substance; and, thirdly, as to the form of proposed amendments of section 51. That section sets out the Thirty-nine Articles of our powers. It is the section round which all the legal controversy has raged concerning the respective limits of the powers of States and Commonwealth. And I may add that a Convention which, in the light of more than twenty years' experience of State and Commonwealth administration, can recommend a more clearly defined demarcation will be productive of great good for Australia. I realize, and have always realized, that anything a Convention might do would not be final. My motion - introduced nearly nine years ago! - provided that, when the Convention had reported to the Governor-General and the six State Governors, it should be  incumbent  on the Federal Government of the day to put into operation section 12"S of the Constitution, and submit the Convention proposals to Parliament. If those proposals passed through each House with the requisite majorities, they should then go on to the people. My object in moving as I did was to strip from the preparation of the proposed amendments any suggestion of party colour. My desire was that they should not be drawn by the Cabinet of the day; that they should not be formulated by the Caucus of the party in power ; that they should not be voted upon by members of the Federal Legislature on party lines. My purpose was not to have the amendments submitted to the people as' the propositions of the Government of the day, and opposed, therefore, by the Opposition of the clay. My aim was simply that the Convention, being free from party bias and prejudice, should consider the need for amendments, and frame such amendments as might be required. The procedure would be the same as that in connexion with the drafting and submission of the Constitution itself; and, from the moment when they first proceeded to elect their representatives to the Convention until they were asked to say " Yea " or " Nay " upon the referenda proposals, the people would bc so familiar with the  subject-matter  as to be able to vote intelligently - with an apprehension of the significance and importance of what  they  were doing. It has been recently suggested that the work of Constitution revision could bc done by some outside body. Introducing my proposal in 1914, I dealt with the alternative which had crossed my mind, namely, of calling for the assistance of certain persons, such as Judges of the High Court Bench, men versed in administrative experience since the establishment of the Commonwealth, and those who knew the shortcomings of the Constitution. I gave reasons, however, why such a tribunal would not bc as appropriate to the purpose as a Convention. I hope that if the Government introduce a Bill to bring about a Constitution Convention, they will see that its functions are confined to section 51, and that such matters as Unification, for example, shall be left outside the purview of that body. </para>

                    <para>A matter which has aroused recent interest is the attitude of the United States of America towards the International Court of Justice. The press has announced that  President  Harding is viewing with interest and enthusiasm the possibility of his country associating itself in the functions of that Court. Further newspaper cables have intimated that the opposite political party has expressed its determination to prevent tha United States of America from joining with the other nations. At first blush, many Australians may feel inclined to resent the attitude of the United States of America. The creation of the International Court of Justice was foreshadowed several years ago, namely, at the time of the Versailles Conference, but it was not until some time afterwards that the Protocol in connexion with the International Court of Justice was prepared. It is not for us to say to the United States of America, "You have been a long time realizing the advantages of the International Court of Justice. You want to come in and reap the benefits attaching to membership of the League of Nations; you want to take advantage of the institutions under the League which have been provided for you; but you will not accept and share any of the responsibility." I am not sure that, in this respect, we are not living in a glass house. The Protocol in connexion with the International Court had been signed and ratified by South Africa, Canada, and New Zealand long before Australia added her signature. I constantly brought this fact before the Government of the day. I asked several questions, hut failed to receive any quite satisfactory reply. I drew attention to the fact that, early in 1921, in the British House of Commons, the Minister then responsible, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austen</inline> Chamberlain, had pointed out that Canada and South Africa and New Zealand had signed and ratified the Protocol, but that Australia had not done so. It was not until well after June, 1921, and after asking many questions on the subject, that I was informed, and the Senate learned, that Australia had signed the Protocol. We came in rather late, and our action might be regarded with some suspicion. I, for one, welcome 'this step forward by the United States of America. I feel that, even if that country is endeavouring to take advantage of what it considers to be the beneficial institutions existing under the League of Nations, it will not be very long before she realizes that she cannot take all the advantages and accept none of the responsibilities. </para>
                    <para class="block">There is one more question I would like to refer to, and that is the general position of the Senate. We, in this Chamber, are very awkwardly placed. We are handicapped, indeed, when circumstances such as have occurred since </para>
                    <para class="block">Parliament assembled this year arise in connexion with the two Houses.- On the first day of sitting a notice of motion of want of confidence may be tabled elsewhere, and this Chamber, immediately it is acquainted with the fact officially, rises until the motion has been disposed of. There are many matters about which, on the assembling of a new Parliament, one desires to obtain information - matters, for instance, in connexion with one's own State, the Commonwealth, and international affairs; for Australia has been assuming an international status for some years past. Much of this information one desires to get publicly, on the floor of the Chamber, but when our sittings are interrupted as they have been there is frequently no possibility of securing information in that way. The infrequent and irregular sittings are not the fault of the Government. During a crisis, or a supposed crisis, in another place, it becomes very difficult for honorable senators to apply themselves continuously to certain lines of work, especially in relation to matters upon which public information is desired here from the lips of Ministers themselves. It is frequently in the interests of administration, of Parliament, of the Commonwealth, and of the public that such information should be furnished. I do not know with certainty upon what rests the practice, which- has been followed in all the colonial Legislatures, of a second Chamber, when a Government is threatened in another House, ceasing to do anything at all ; but it may be that on a proper and full consideration of the circumstances some way can be found to allow this Chamber to " function," as the French say, in regard to certain matters, even when a censure motion is being debated elsewhere.I should not expect the Government to introduce Bills, except those of a very formal character, with no party significance, but there is other work which could be proceeded with quite consistently with the fact that a motion of censure was being discussed elsewhere. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, they could. I asked some questions in this Senate, and they were several weeks in .being answered because of the infrequent sittings of this Chamber. I asked what was the position of the Commonwealth of Australia in regard to the International Court of Justice, and I inquired whether the Protocol in connexion with that Court had yet been subscribed by Australia. I was asked to give notice of the question. I gave notice that day, but the Senate rose for ten days, and in the meantime the question could not again be brought up. I am not laying down any hard and fast rule. The whole position ought to be reviewed. Experience has shown that the Senate has lost, and in present circumstances will continue to lose, the opportunity of dealing with important matters. The Senate could deal with resolutions on the notice-paper. I think honorable senators should realize that the infrequent opportunities provided for the discussion of public affairs in this Chamber should be availed of to the fullest possible extent. The history of the Senate shows that in the past, especially in the early days of Federation, the influence of this Chamber upon legislation, and upon the course of administration, has been very marked and noticeable. I certainly hope that whatever the developments may be in connexion with the amendment of the Constitution, and whether a Convention takes a part in framing proposed amendments, this Senate, as representing the union of the States, in which each has an equal voice, will not be impaired in any degree, and that its efficiency and status will be maintained by the people of the Commonwealth and by the honorable senators who compose it. </para>

                        <para>. - Although during the election campaign a few of my friends, with .that affectionate levity which characterizes the most intimate of them, told me that if I devoted myself very seriously to politics for some time ito come they would constitute themselves the inheritors of my share of next year's gold yield from Norfolk Island, or some such illusory asset, I intend to take my duties seriously. I wish, accordingly, to contribute something to the debate on the Address-in-Reply. It has been pointed out by the speakers who have preceded me that the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply have been commendably brief, although they have compressed into their speeches much of very important matter. I certainly do not intend to occupy the Senate for any very great length, of time. Let me begin by saying that I  congratulate the mover and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply upon their speeches. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benny,</inline> of course, has served years of political apprenticeship, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> is an accession to our ranks.

                    <para>The Ministry, as is usual in the circumstances, has undergone some criticism already, but I congratulate the members of it upon their accession to office. As most of the members of the Ministry are new men, I consider that there are all sorts of possibilities of a character profitable to the nation in respect to their labours. To the untried, as to the young, all things are possible. I believe the very best has been done in the circumstances that could have been done, for if the people of Australia desire to adhere to a system of parliamentary government which can only be effective 'by dividing the members of " the popular Chamber," as it is called, into two parties for the purpose of government, they must recognise that many difficulties exist when they take it upon themselves to send representatives of three or four parties into that House. Our system of Ministerial responsibility, which throws upon a Ministry the necessity for resigning if a vote of censure is carried against it, necessitates that there shall really be only two parties in Parliament, or, if there are more than two parties, that at least a majority of members shall  vote as if only two parties existed. Otherwise  parliamentary  government, as we understand it in connexion with the Cabinet system, which is a part of Parliament, but is not the institution itself, cannot continue. It is well known, I think, that I am an ' opponent of the present method of selecting Ministers. I do not believe that Ministers should be selected as they are at present. I believe the electors should send as many representatives of as many parties as they care to choose to this Parliament, and that (then the members should elect the Ministers, who should have a specified term of office, just as the  President  and the  Chairman  of Committees and the members of the various parliamentary Committees have. I see nothing at all impracticable in that. On the contrary, I consider it highly sensible and very necessary. The present system is ' outworn. I wish it to be clearly understood that whilst believing that the best has been done in the circumstances according to present practice, as a parliamentarian that practice earns no indorsement from me. </para>

That duty has fallen to Tasmanian senators who have preceded me in this debate. They have performed the duty very ably, and as repetition is wearisome, all I need say in regard to all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has said, and most of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> remarks, is that the arguments they have put forward meet with my hearty indorsement. So far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> remarks in connexion with the Constitution Convention are concerned, I am sorry to have to say that I differ entirely from the honorable senator. As a representative of a small State, I will not lightly concede to any other body, even though it be an elected body, the duty of amending the Australian Constitution. </para>

They have been referred to by Senators Payne and Keating. Even during the last few weeks very strong representations have been made to the present Ministry in regard to matters of great importance to that State, and favorable, or at least impartial, consideration of those representations was promised. I believe that the representations of Tasmanian members will bear fruit. But for such fruition we must await the lapse of a reasonable period of time. </para>

                                made a very proper reference to Australia's assumption of national status, and it follows that she should take an intelligent interest in what I might term the happenings of the outer world. There is a matter to which I wish to draw attention, and which seems to me to be one of a very grave character, and yet it has passed practically without comment, even at the hands of public men or prominent journalists. About a fortnight ago, I think not more, it was stated in the cables that three important speeches on vital subjects had been delivered in various parts of the world. Two of them, I think, were made on the American continent; but one to which some little prominence was given at the time in the cables was a pronouncement by the Canadian Prime Minister,
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie</inline>
                                King. This gentleman said - I take it he was making a speech at some public function in an important centre of the Canadian Dominion - that in all future wars in which the Empire might be engaged, how Canada would be affected by the conflict would have to be directly considered, and that no participation of Canada in an Empire

                    <para>Avar  could be promised until that had been considered and decided in the affirmative by the Legislature of the Canadian Dominion. I wonder if many people have reflected on what such an utterance really means, if it truly represents the policy to be adopted by the Canadian people? We must first of all remember that Canada contains about one-sixth of the white population of the British Empire, and that if the statement of the Canadian Prime Minister is true, one-sixth of the white population of the Empire would possibly not be participants in an Empire war. </para>

It should be remembered that, as a result of the war, the British Empire attained the very pinnacle of Imperial prestige and glory. But it may be that at this very moment disintegrating influences have commenced to work, and that our existence as an Empire in a material and moral sense may almost have ceased. It is irrefutable that, as a result of the war, the British Empire is no longer an Empire in the old sense. It is not the Empire in the sense that the French Republic is. France still holds her Colonial Empire in the old fashion more than Great Britain does. As I have said, one-sixth of the white population of the Empire is in Canada. </para>

                            <para>- Yea. The highest estimate I have noticed of the white population of the Empire is 73,000,000. I believe the correct figure between 66,000,000 and 70,000,000. Canada has a white population of over 11,000,000. It may bc said that Canada is sure to participate in any war in which the life of the Empire is at stake, and I believe that for a generation or two such a statement might have an element of accuracy in it; but a3 the present Prime Minister of Canada has made the public utterance I have mentioned, it is well for us to understand where we are, and in what direction the Empire is developing or disintegrating - as honorable senators may care to have it. It is of great importance, and very necessary, for Australia that the British Empire should retain its potency for many decades, or even centuries to come. I do not wish to refer in detail to speeches made during the election campaign, but I was careful to point out to the Tasmanian people prior to the election that Canada was in quite a different position from Australia in regard to Empire questions. I believe the statement of the Canadian Prime Minister to be correct, because when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, the ex-British Prime Minister, was communicating with the Dominions in regard to the possibility of hostilities with Turkey, and was ascertaining the attitude the Dominions would adopt, the Canadian Government indicated that the matter would probably be relegated to the Canadian Parliament for .. decision. The ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the National Government of the day received some criticism because the Australian Executive took upon itself the responsibility of promptly replying to the effect that in the event of hostilities assistance would be given. I had to point out to the electors the different position in which the Australian Commonwealth found itself as compared with the Dominion of Canada. Within the last few days I had a conversation with a representative American citizen on this matter, who agreed with me that the statement I had made to the 'Tasmanian people in regard to the Canadian position was, no doubt, accurately based. Canada knows that in connexion with any international conflict in which she might be embroiled, the invasion of Canadian territory would, no doubt, be regarded by the United States as a cause for war. lu other words, Canada can have it both ways. She can have her territory protected as a member of the British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations, and can also rely upon the fact that the stars and stripes of the American Republic will protect her. Canada can say with impunity, " We will at all times allow our Legislature to determine whether or not we will go to the assistance of Great Britain or any of the other Dominions of the Empire." Let us understand where we are. We cannot afford to take up such an attitude. Canada, proportionately, is of no more assistance, and cannot reliably be counted upon to assist the British Empire in a greater degree than 10,000,000 or 11,000,000 Americans, because the American  President  can decide, and those countries which during the Great War did become co-belligerents of the Empire, can relegate to their governing authorities the question of whether they will engage in a war or not. Canada takes up the same attitude, and is, therefore, on the same footing as a foreign Power in such a matter. I venture to say that the friendship and possible assistance of 110,000,000 of people in the United States is of greater importance to us than the qualified allegiance of 11,000,000 Canadians. If what I have mentioned is to be the attitude of Canada, that Dominion will not get any more support from rae, as an Australian legislator, than any foreign nation, and certainly not more consideration than the United States of America. If Canada is going to reserve to herself the privilege of saying whether she will come to the assistance of Australia or not, I am going to mould my conduct on lines that will enable me to say that the friendship of Canada for Australia is worth proportionately not nearly so much as is the friendship of the United States of America, and there can be no discrimination on behalf of Canada in any Act by the Commonwealth Parliament in which I am a legislative participant. Consideration of the Canadian attitude involves very far-reaching and serious thought. I want the Australian people to understand that we are by no means in the same position as Canada. We have no neighbouring people speaking the same language, and solicitous about the inviolability of our territory. And since we have not that good fortune, we want seriously to consider our position. If we claim exclusive possession of this continent, we must at all hazards, and despite the fact that it may be inconvenient, as well as costly in blood and treasure, be ready to help the other Dominions of the Empire whose safety may be endangered, in order that we may demand reciprocal treatment in our hour of need. There are very many other considerations of grave import in this connexion. They all tend to show the importance acquired by America in the eyes of the world during and since the war. So important has the Panama Canal become that serious thought is now being given to the question of its duplication. </para>

                    <para>I am, of course, leading up to a subject to which I have given a great deal of thought, and which I regard as one possessing elemental factors of safety for the Australian people, namely, the question of Australia's representation in a serious and important manner at Washington. The abstention of America from participation in the International Court of Justice, which has been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> or from any great world movement, paralyzes other nations concerned to such an extent that they cannot function properly or achieve anything worthy of note. In fact, the United States of America is the pivotal nation of the world. If that great Republic abstains from any world movement, it must almost surely fail. If, on the other hand, she participates, it will achieve, at all events, qualified, and perhaps a full measure of success. This being so, I consider that any one who is opposed to the representation of Australia in a serious and proper manner at Washington has not the interests of the Commonwealth at heart. The friendship of America, which alone enables the Canadian Prime Minister to talk as he has been doing lately, must be a valuable factor in the future safety of the people of Australia. Whether we, with a population of 6,000,000, will be able to hold this continent in peace, depends to a very large extent upon the attitude towards us during the next twenty or thirty years of America, with its 110,000,000 of people. Therefore, I invite the present Government, as one of the first measures of national policy worthy of consideration, to give solid thought to the matter of the early representation of Australia at Washington; not, however, by a Trades Commissioner, or any person who has not what I would call a satisfactory status, but by some Australian of note, to whom the  President  of the Republic would give audience, and who would be able to give publicity to Australian objectives and ideals in such a way as to insure to us the friendship of the people of the United States of America, conducive as such friendship would be to our national safety. Therefore, I say that every representative Australian public man worthy of his salt should give hi3 adhesion to the appointment, at an early date, of some one worthy to represent Australia at Washington. People talk about assuring this continent to the white race. I shall have a little more to say about this matter presently. How can ir be assured by expenditure of money which we can afford at present? Warfare of the future, if unhappily there is going to be war, will assume a character very little dreamt of at this moment. We cannot expect to hold exclusive possession of this continent unless we have the friendship of the great nations of the world, and, preferably, the friendship of nations speaking our own language. I am very sorry to say that in the recent deliverance of the Canadian Prime Minister I find indications that there is, almost unnoticed, perhaps, a disintegrating principle at work. We must not look upon this Empire of ours, much as .we believe in it, as something that is as permanent as the pyramids. It may wither in a night, as Kipling said, and nothing is more likely to .cause it to wither than pronouncements such as that recently made by the Prime Minister of Canada. I have made a few extracts upon this subject. I am only going to deal with this matter and one or two others, and then I shall resume my seat. I know it is the desire of the Government to end the proceedings to-night, and I am not in the humour to delay them; but I feel that I have certain duties to perform in furtherance of views which I sincerely hold. It is acknowledged, I think, that the development of American trade in the East, through the Panama Canal, must have its influence on the waiters that wash our shores. I am going to say nothing that is original, but I am about to quote certain extracts from an article, written by a very eminent American, whose subject is "America." The thesis which he seeks to expound is that the future of America will lie in development towards the south. He says that the cry, " Go south, young man," is being substituted in the consciousness of the American for the old-time slogan, " Go west." He speaks of the opening of the canal - </para>

                        <para>Whilst the American flag certainly waves less on European waters, it waves more on the Pacific Ocean. Pan-Americanism, the dream of Stephen Douglas and many others, is carried nearer to realization, the dream that America should rule all the way from the Canadian line tn the Isthmus without question and without regret. Empire was never foreseen by the fathers of the Republic. But what is to be done? America is committed to an Imperial destiny 'and cannot help herself.  Her  vast surplus of capital, her gold accumulations must in the human way of necessity fmd an outlet for use. The West has been exploited. The old world is distrusted. There remains, inevitably and obviously, the South. " Go south, young man," is being substituted in the consciousness of the American for the old cry, "Go West." </para>
                        <para class="block">I have said that these republics are retaining an expanding Empire in a sense which our Empire has lost or forgone. We have gone in for self-determination; to any people within our society of nations that have a reasonable chance of governing themselves successfully we give that chance.

This writer says further - </para>
                        <para>One' thing which the great war seems to have revealed is that we are physically subject to forces over which we have little or no control. These forces are generally called economic, and are said to be academic, and theoretic. That is a mistake; they are elemental and primitive. They sweep' statesmen away when the time comes, and sweep other statesmen into power. Such a force drives the American flag southward, and the cry is, " Go South." </para>

If our 6,000,000 Australians cannot see the value of being represented there, when 7,000,000 or 8,000,000 Portuguese, 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 Dutchmen, and 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 Danes see that necessity, then the Australian people are suffering from a kind of mental blindness, for which no eye-wash can be purchased at the apothecary's. I want to see the Australian Parliament, through the. Australian Administration, at the earliest possible date secure the ablest and best representation of Australian interests at Washington. So I will conclude in respect of that matter. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I want to deal - because it is incidental to this question of our keeping this continent - with a curious exclusiveness that is growing up in Australia amongst the Australian-born. We all know that this continent has adopted the policy of a White Australia - about which I am not going to make any remarks. I believe, as I have said before, that so long as the incidence of the operation of the policy is not too cruel, the idea of preserving Australia as a continent in which, preferably, the members of the British race, and, secondly, the members of the white races, can develop the civilization which is characteristic of Europe - develop their economic and other ideals - is a very commendable objective. I do not know that there is anything particularly wrong in it. It is contradicted, of course, by such men as Havelock Ellis. They say that it is 'wrong; they say that this idea of establishing pure breeds of people is nonsensical; that the pure breeds of people hardly exist at all; and, moreover, that such specimens as have been found to exist in isolated cases have never effected anything. According to Havelock Ellis, all that is great in the world has been accomplished by hybrids - quite contrary to popular ideas, popular imagination, popular beliefs on the matter. We will let that pas3. Undoubtedly out of this White Australia policy has grown, not only a policy in restriction of Asiatics 'but a policy that is certainly possessed of an undercurrent of hostility towards even Europeans. We know that the term "Dago" is used, and that it is applied to Spaniards, Greeks, Levantines, Italians, even southern Frenchmen, and certainly not in an honorific sense. We talk of the League of Nations. Are we going to make the League of Nations the arbiter in the world's quarrels? What will the League think of the frame of mind exhibited in connexion with the recent visit to our shores of a ship manned with Italians, and having on board a large number of Italian would be immigrants? It may be that these men were induced to come to Australia in an improper sort of way, by a kind of false representation. I have close to me a representative of the State of New South Wales in the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner).</inline> I understand that there is in New South Wales a gentleman called <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wearne</inline> - who, if he does not hold at present, recently held, Ministerial office and rank. </para>

                            <para>- I thought so, but I was not quite sure; and I never like to make a statement unless I am sure of my facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wearne,</inline> it appears, is some sort of station-owner, or has a property up-country. He gave some ot these Italians who did land a job at rabbit-trapping. I have not been out of Melbourne for some weeks, but here in Melbourne the feeling of indignation at the fact that he was inclined to give employment to these men reached me. I became aware of the fact that there had been created in New South Wales a feeling inimical to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wearne</inline> because he had given employment - to whom? To some Italians. Are we going to take, up the attitude that, although they may be admitted, we really do not want them, and are not going to encourage them here; that they are not Europeans; that they are not white men in the proper sense of the term? How are we going to stand when we are being arraigned before the nations? Will we appeal in such a case to the League of Nations? Will we make the League of Nations the arbiter in such a case as that? What hope of success, what hope of a favorable verdict, would we have? The fact remains that, in preserving Australia for our descendants - quite a laudable objective - in inducing immigration from the overcrowded portions of the United Kingdom, we will have ito be sensible beings; we must not offend the susceptibilities of other nations which are responsible for a good deal that is admirable in European civilization - even though we may happen to call them "Dagoes." We must allow them to come in, otherwise we shall get into trouble. I would say to my fellow Australians, "Do not confuse your White Australia policy with feelings of hostility to men of acknowledged European races and nations, otherwise you will speedily get into trouble." </para>

It is all very well to speak of these people as " Dagoes." They are Europeans, and if in this continent of ours, of which some 6,000,000 of us claim exclusive possession, we fail practically to treat them as Europeans, we shall be looking for trouble, and will readily find it. </para>

                    <para>These matters on which I have touched should be dealt with by the Australian Senate. Although the Senate is not spoken of by the press of the Commonwealth with any very great degree of consideration, I notice that the electors on any question which has to be decided as between the two Houses nearly always take the Senate view. That, after all, is natural, since the Senate has the States and' the people of Australia for its constituencies and constituents, whereas the members of another place represent only segmentary or fragmentary portions of the populations which go to make up the States as a whole. I am not aware of any instance in which the Senate, by resolution, has indicated to the people of the nation a course which it would he dangerous or in any degree perilous to pursue; on the contrary, the Senate has at all times indicated the ways of safety, sanity, and prosperity. I hope that honorable senators, when they have leisure, will study these questions, and give the Senate and the Australian people the benefit of their thoughts upon them. Beyond all doubt, these are matters of the utmost importance, and should be considered by the Upper Chamber of the Australian Legislature. </para>
                    <para>I shall say nothing more about matters of domestic concern. I feel sure that the present Administration will give the people of my State every consideration, inasmuch as, although few in number, they inhabit one of the most important parts of the Australian Commonwealth; and, since the greater always includes the less, anything that makes for their prosperity will make also for an increase of markets, an increase in consumption, and an increase in the general prosperity of the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>-  His  speech on the occasion of the banquet given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sastri</inline> in this building was, like the speeches made by the leaders of other parties in the Federal Parliament, as well as by the State Premiers, very favorable to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Sastri's  requests. This is a subject in which I am greatly interested, and I am sure I am not exaggerating the facts when I say that the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sastri</inline> have been published in the Indian press, and have made a profound impression throughout India. I do not say that the honorable gentleman committed himself to a statement that die would do all that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sastri</inline> asked, but that was the inference to be drawn. Then, it must be remembered that the last Imperial Conference, which was attended by delegates from all the the Dominions, including our own, decided that this privilege should be granted to Indians wherever they were situated. Our delegate was, as I say, present, and the recommendation  was his as well as that of the others. </para>

                            <para>- None of the delegates, except General Smuts, objected or  protested.  Personally, I do not see why  honorable  senators should object to the granting of" these citizen rights. There are very few Indians in Australia to whom the rights could be extended, and if they all voted together they could not change an election one way or another. They were in this country before Federation  was  consummated, and it is not proposed to open our doors to all Indians and give them the same rights. I agree </para>

                    <para>Avith <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> that whomsoever we admit into the Commonwealth should be given citizen rights, for otherwise they are not fitted to be here. The Australianborn sons and daughters of these Indians are in business or on the land, mostly the latter, and they are entitled to vote. In view of the fact that there are very few persons who will be affected by any change in this connexion, it would be a generous, and I might say a noble, act on the part of this young Democracy to recognise its responsibility and duty. It certainly is not in the spirit of Democracy to treat others as we should not like to be treated ourselves. These people are good and respectable citizens, who obey the laws and pay their taxes; and I trust that, during the recess, the Government will make up its mind to set an example to the other Dominions. I do not wish to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> in his .remarks about the Empire, though I wish to. see the Empire developed; and I may say that I do not think it has yet reached its apex of glory, in spite of what may be said in Canada by a mere passing Premier, who  is here to-day and gone  tomorrow.  The British Empire has to look to the East, and to its millions of subjects in India,  who  are part and parcel of the Empire; and it is only right that these few Indian residents in Australia should know that, at all events, Australia is  willing  to fulfil the promise more or less agreed upon at the Imperial Conference, thus tending to cement the Empire still more closely. I shall say no more on this subject at the present time, but on a future occasion I shall take an opportunity to set forth many reasons why this modicum of justice should be granted. The ex-Prime Minister gave a promise in the presence of the leaders of all parties; and I am sure that if a vote had been taken at that banquet, the reforms which I am now advocating would have been agreed to by an overwhelming majority. Why should there be a change in sentiment now? If it was right then to extend these rights it is right now; and it is far better to do it deliberately and calmly than be carried away by the words of some eloquent advocate. I trust the Government will consider this matter, not  only  from an Indian, but from an Imperial, point" of  view. </para>
                    <para>Another promise made by the late Government had reference to the Boy Scout movement, and to an official recognition of its usefulness and standing in the. community. These lads are encouraged, to do a kind action every day, and to make themselves handy and useful; indeed, in my opinion, the movement is doing more to properly train young Australians as good citizens than any in operation- today. All that is asked by those interested in the Boy Scouts is that the body shall be legalized, and their badges and so forth recognised. This will tend to prevent persons collecting on behalf of the Boy Scouts, and make it possible to prosecute any who fraudulently do so. I understand, from officers of the Boy Scouts that, during last session, the ex-Minister for Defence - I do not know whether it  was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massy</inline> Greene - informed them that the Government were considering a Bill to carry out this desired reform. I trust that the present Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden),</inline> for the sake of this useful movement, will take this matter in hand. To some this may appear a small matter, but I regard it as one of the most- important in the training of our young people as good citizens. </para>

I  wish to tender my congratulations to those honorable senators who have risen to the high rank of Minister in  His  Majesty's Government. To-day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> who has been thus honoured, showed me his commission, in which he is referred to as "trusty and well beloved," and no doubt he is so regarded by honorable senators generally. I also desire to congratulateSenator Pearce, the Leader of the Senate, on the high post to which he has been appointed. If that honorable gentleman's strength is to be measured by the ability he shows to retain office in any Government, whether of one party or the other, or of a composite party, he is certainly well fitted to lead this or any other deliberative Assembly. He has shown an ability to forecast coming events that many of us might well envy. He seems to be a Minister of the everlasting type, blooming in all sorts of weather and in all seasons. Whatever the circumstances are, whatever. Government is in office, he remains a Minister. </para>

                            <para>- I am not implying that the honorable gentleman's continuance in office is due to self-seeking. Perhaps because of his many and varied qualities he is sought after by successive Prime Ministers to accept office; and the honorable gentleman who to-day is Prime Minister has paid <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> the very high compliment of asking him to become Leader of the Government in the Senate. I feel sure that he will acquit himself with satisfaction to the Senate and honour to the Government and himself. Without desiring to reflect in any way upon the ability of the honorable gentleman, I do regret the circumstances that have led to the retirement of that magnificent little fighter and loyal friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. Millen, who for so long was the leader of this Senate.  His  retirement from office is most unfortunate for Australia.  His  treatment by a section of the press and the criticism of those who should have been his friends, as well as of those who were his enemies, have been distinctly unfair; and I feel sure that that, more than anything else, is responsible for his present unfortunate illness. I hope that the honorable senator will soon be restored to health and may be among us again, if not as a Minister, at any rate as a comrade, to assist us with the foresight, readiness in debate, and ability to meet any circumstances which are peculiar to him. </para>

                    <para>I pass on now to a consideration of what has to serve for the time being as the declaration of the policy of the Government. In that respect we have not been told much so far." A little information has been given by one person and a little by? another, but other members of the Ministry have had the good sense to keep quiet. To-day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> gave us an amplification of certain aspects of the Government's policy, representing, no doubt, decisions that have been' arrived at by the Cabinet since the Governor-General's Speech was read to Parliament. Of course, I understand the very great difficulty which the Government have in formulating a policy. Two sets of gentlemen who fought each other bitterly during the election campaign, have been forced by political circumstances to arrive at some common basis, of agreement upon matters whereon it did not seem possible at one time for them to agree at all. If they have taken a long time to find a basis of agreement, we must not forget the circumstances preceding the formation of the Ministry. What is apparent to everybody is that the members of the Government were not so anxious to arrive at a common policy upon which all sections of the Ministerial party could follow them as they were anxious to secure and retain the Ministerial bench. What the Government were to effect in the form of legislation, and what would be their administrative acts in respect of many urgent questions, was of minor importance. The chief thing was to secure Ministerial rank and keep some one else out. All minor matters such as policy and effective administration could be deferred. I know that Ministers are working very hard at the present moment in an attempt to find some common basis of policy to present to Parliament, and when it is presented I hope that it will be one which we. can all support. </para>
                    <para>I want to make my position .clear. I was elected to the Senate as a Nationalist, and on a definite policy upon which I had pledged myself to the electors, and I will only support the present Government so long as its policy conforms with my pledges. Where it differs in any way whatsoever from the policy enunciated by the Nationalist party, and upon which I was returned to this Chamber, it will be necessary for me to use my own discretion. It was practically agreed upon by the party that we were to have a free hand to vote with or against the Government as we pleased. </para>

                    <para>I do not care what the policy of the Government is to be, nor does any other honorable senator; but a gentleman who claims to be co-equal with the Prime Minister in certain respects  has  'been going about the country making speeches as to what that policy is. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page has spoken on two or three occasions in New South Wales, and he has told us quite deliberately that the first task of the new Cabinet is to " clean up the mess." If there be a mess to be cleaned up- and I deny it- who has made it? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> and other members of the late Administration who are in the present Government, are the men who have made that mesa, which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">Earle Page, as Treasurer of the Government, declares it must be one of the first tasks of the Government to clean up. If that is a fain attitude for any member of the Ministry to take up, surely it is not ill-becoming of a private supporter of the Government to venture upon a little criticism .of the Administration at any particular time. But the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page - that there is a mess to be cleaned up - is a gross reflection - upon every member of the Nationalist party who is supporting the composite Government. I deny that there is any mess requiring to be cleaned up. I have not been able to see it. I supported the late Government. In spite of a gibe thrown across the chamber to-night, I consider I gave them very loyal support. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, it was taken off; but one member of the Government said a little while ago at an important New South Wales country centre, " I am going to have certain duties removed as one of the first acts of the Government." He did not know that they had already been removed. To-day we are asked to give support to that sort of thing, and it is not to 'be wondered at that honorable senators now and in the future, however much they may desire to give most whole-hearted and enthusiastic support to the Government, will watch its policy very carefully and analyze its proposals in every possible way. I trust that wo shall be enabled to support everything the Government propose; but should the occasion arise I shall not hesitate to register my vote against the Ministry, no matter what the consequences of my action may be. In any case, it is not a National Government; it is not the kind of Government I was elected to support, nor is it the kind of Government members of the Country party were elected to support. It is a Ministry without a party of its own, but with their following entirely dependent upon an agreement as to a policy. </para>

                            <para>- Of course not. This Government, we all know, has come into office largely to bring about that economy in administration which it was declared was lacking in the last Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was such a leading light. Certain sections now represented in the Cabinet claimed that the grossest kind of extravagance had been perpetrated. " Too many Boards were appointed," they said; yet I was amazed when I read in the newspapers yesterday to find that  the new Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson),</inline> right at the beginning of his career as Minister, has found it necessary to appoint a Board to show .the Government how the Post Office should be run. Here is a new Board already appointed by a Government, individual members of which have said they are determined to wipe out Boards already in existence. It may be necessary for the Postmaster-General to have a Board to tell him what to do and how to do it; but it is better for Ministers to think and act for themselves, and to take sole and full responsibility. Anyhow, I trust the new Board will do good work. </para>

                    <para>Something has already been said concerning duplication of State and Federal Departments. With the remarks of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> I am in almost entire agreement. There is too much duplication in certain directions; but there is something sinister behind the movement to eliminate all point? of duplication. I know the gentlemen who are at the back of it. Most prominent among them is the New South Wales Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bavin).</inline> He it is who has been holding consultations with Ministers in other States, and I suspect that the intention behind these meetings is not to benefit the Commonwealth, nor to extend its powers and influence, but that it is designed to hamstring the Commonwealth authority - to take away the too few powers which are at present enjoyed by it. </para>

[ do not believe in Unification. It would be absurd for the Commonwealth to attempt to legislate for the whole of Australia. The honorable senator, although such a pronounced believer in Unification, himself recognised the absurdity of the principle when - after pointing out that we needed only one Parliament - he urged .that provincial Legislatures should be established. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> was speaking for his party when he advocated the. cutting up of the present States and the creation of new ones, with the establishment of provincial Legislatures. These latter would each be a kind 'of glorified County Council.

                            <para>- I would not do that for anything. I have a tender regard for the honorable senator's feelings. I do not wish to see anything happen to him which might be distasteful to himself. I realize that it is not possible for him to make much of an onslaught upon the Government while some one else is vigorously attacking him from the rear.  His  lines of communication are not protected as they ought to be. He finds himself in a pretty serious position in that, while making an advance, his commissariat is being harried from behind. I hope that he, like the Government, will find a happy solution of all his problems. For my part, I would be pleased to see it in both instances. Anything that I can do to help the Government - I will not say, to help <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> because that might not do him any good - I am prepared to do, and my prayers are with the honorable senator who leads the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>. - Some years ago I read a book by Lewis Carrol, <inline font-style="italic">Through the Looking Glass.</inline> There is one scene where, as Alice comes along, she sees before her an avenue which looks like a chess board. The red chess queen takes her hand, and rushes her down it, crying, " Faster, faster," until at last she stops for want of breath,' and finds that she is at exactly the place that she started from, and on inquiring from the queen the reason for this, is informed she would have to run twice as fast to get anywhere else. That is a parable of the political situation of to-day. The public of Australia have ha'd considerable difficulty in following the political' vicissitudes that have taken place recently. Extraordinary political phenomena have resulted from the elections. The electors have shown- much uneasiness in relation to certain things  that have happened, and, rightly or wrongly, have determined that there shall be a <inline font-style="italic">rapprochement</inline> between the two sections of the anti-Socialist party, namely, the Country party and the Nationalist party. Surely this coming together may be accepted as reasonable. It is well known that apparently opposing forces bring about direction and control of action in many realms of nature. In the human body there are balances brought about by opposing nervous fibres. In the heart we have on the one side a nervous fibre that causes acceleration, and on the other one that causes retardation, and these working together give direction and balance. An experiment that is repeated frequently in physiological laboratories on the body of a dog is the cutting of the vagus nerve, affecting one side of the heart, and of the sympathetic on the other. When the operation is complete, and the body has been sewn up, the dog still lives. It, however, cannot move quickly - cannot run - because there is no possible means of causing acceleraton of the heart's action. Similarly, there is no possible means of causing retardation. Consequently the dog must proceed in the most placid way. Then we have in the human arm two sets of muscles, the flexors and extensors, that are opposed, and their interaction is necessary to properly directed movement, and the same statement is true of the whole of the muscles of the human frame. If we pass from anatomy to psychology, we find the balances of pleasure and pain giving direction. If we go to the inorganic -world, and, viewing the infinitely great, look at the stars, we find that they are kept in their orbits, and at the other extreme, regarding the infinitely small, the molecules, that they are kept in motion by the forces of attraction and repulsion. Another illustration that might be used is the employment of the two reins that drive a horse. Opposing forces everywhere go to the making of balance and direction: As the public of Australia has determined that there shall be an arrangement between the two" anti-Socialist parties, surely we can get a similar practical ..balance between them in the two Houses of Parliament. Ministers have determined, rightly or wrongly, that that shall be so, and that out of this hurly-burly there shall be created a Government that will direct the fortunes of Australia as a whole. I am referring, of course, to the fortunes of Australia from the anti-Labour standpoint. It has been stated that in the formation of this Government the Constitution has been violated. When a Prime Minister is defeated he hands in his resignation, and, generally, the man who leads the victorious side is offered the commission to form a new Government. But has not the King the right to send for any man? As Dicey, in his <inline font-style="italic">Law of the Constitution,</inline> says, It is a well established rule in the Constitution that the King shall send for those who can control the House. The House shall have the last say." What has been the result in this case? The House has absolutely confirmed the decision of the Governor-General. We now have a composite Government, which has before it certain things to do. We have been told that it has not come down with a policy. Surely there is reason in this. Might I divide the functions of Government into three? They are, first, national stability; second, national strength; and third, national progress. We are living in a democratic age, and I ask honorable senators to take their minds back a little distance and recall some of the early democratic writings in relation to America, and they will remember that when Fisher Ames came back from studying American conditions he was asked what he thought of Democracy as accepted in the United 'States. He said that, coming as he did from a Monarchy, it appeared to him as if an Autocracy or a Monarchy was like a merchantman. " You go on board and ride wind and tide in elation, but by-and-by you strike a reef, and go down. But Democracy is like a raft. You never sink, though your feet are# always in the water." If that was so in those days, I maintain that it still holds good to-day. The surface of the democratic sea on which the barque of the State is now being guided is disturbed by many storms, by many industrial problems. We had an earlier foretaste of Democracy in the Greek City states ; but all appreciate the fact that we have a Democracy to-day such as the </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Greeks never anticipated. Let us allow our imagination to flow back to Pericles and Athens. Could we join in the throng in the Agora, and meet the men of creative genius, those of the vision immortal, who were dealing with democratic principles, we should realize that the Democracy we have to-day would throw a challenge to their mental activities. Our Democracy is la thing very delicately adjusted and marvellously regulated. It was thus well for the Government to consider where their ship was heading before they came out to say, " This is the policy we propose to deal with and enforce upon the people of Australia." That policy wants a considerable amount of thought and care. They understand that progress does not come with a rejection of our cultural heritage, like that of Russia. We must  descriminate  between the real and the futile. In Russia we have a few persons taking hold of the reins of government and  showing  the people a rule analogous to the Asiatic despotism of the early Czars. The Government have to deal with the present-day Democracy, and it will require great thought and care on their part to bring down a policy that will be acceptable to the whole of the people. Stability, as I understand it, depends upon the elimination of misplaced static forces, and to master the grave problems that confront them will require much consideration by Ministers. Time will not permit me to continue upon that phase of government, and so I turn to the second part, which, in my view, is the conservation of national strength. </para>
                    <para>National strength does not mean only defence. It involves the proper utilization of our raw materials, the preservation of our timbers, the care of agriculture, the proper dealing with finance, and a right appreciation of our intellectual people, who will be prepared to aid the progress of Australia.  May I, first of all, say a word or two on the subject of foreign policy. Australia, as a result df the war, has cast aside her swaddling clothes, and has come forth in the habiliments of nationhood. She has won, as the result of her prowess at the Front, the right of entry to the councils of the nations of the world. She has "been admitted to the Peace Conference, and enjoyed the right there to a voice and a vote in the framing of policies that were ito be of world-wide effect. We have been members of many Conferences and parties to many Treaties. We are a member of the League of Nations. During the time we have enjoyed membership of the councils of the nations, we have been represented by able men, possessed of excellent qualifications, fitting them to deal with matters of world-wide importance and urgency. We occupy a different position to-day from that which we occupied in 1914. In that year England declared war. When England declared war the sons of the Empire prepared to follow the old flag, and following the flag meant that they must tax themselves to find the money to fight, as Australians love to fight, in defence of what they believe to be right. The result of the action we took was that we were given a say in the councils that dealt with the conduct of the war. At the same time we assumed a responsibility that we as a people are now called upon to carry out to the utmost. As we have been permitted to be  members  of the Imperial Councils, we are given the right to a voice in determining the fate of the Empire. We have been given the right to a say in the framing of foreign policies which may have the effect of bringing about war. It is now possible that any of the units that go to form the Imperial family of nations may bring war upon the Empire. That is not likely, perhaps, but it is possible. Unfortunately, at the present time we have no machinery whereby the policy that is determined by the Empire can be expressed by a single voice. This suggests a matter referred to by my honorable colleague from Tasmania in connexion with Canada. That matter has, in my opinion, been far overshadowed by the  fact  that the Canadian people have 'been the first of the members of the British Empire to break away and make a treaty with another nation. They have recently made a treaty with the United States of America in respect to fisheries in which both nations are interested. If the people of all the units that form the British Empire begin to make treaties just as they feel in*  clined,then  we shall have a disruptive force at work that will send the </para>
                    <para class="block">Empire tottering as surely as the sun will rise to-morrow. It is not of the slightest use for Canada or Australia to imagine that as units they can expect to cut any figure in world politics. They each have tremendous influence as members of an Empire such as the world has never seen before, but the moment they propose to act independently of that Empire their power will become less. I therefore say that it behoves the Prime Minister to bring about as soon as possible an Imperial Conference that will speak for the Empire. To have a satisfactory policy laid down, as the result of consultation in an Imperial Conference between the representatives of the various parts of the Empire would be a natural evolution of self-government. A further evolution surely will be that we must take our share in the defence of the Empire. The Imperial Conference that dealswith these matters will have to consider how the Empire can best be defended, and must allot to the different nations forming the Empire the duties which it is essential they shall perform to insure that any defence of the Empire that is undertaken shall be effective. I therefore say that it is the duty of the Prime Minister to do what he can to forward the holding of an Imperial Conference as soon as possible, a purpose which I believe he has at heart. </para>
                    <para>I want to pass from this matter for a moment to refer to our raw materials, and in this connexion I ask the Government to give every encouragement to our Bureau of Science. In it we have an institution from which science will improve our products, abolish waste, establish new industries, and reach out helpfully into all the activities of our nation. I remember reading at one time a lecture by Berthelot, and I was struck by two or threepregnant phrases, one of which was <inline font-style="italic">Savoirc'est pouvoir</inline> - to know, in order to do - which is the pragmatic test of useful knowledge. Our Bureau of Science can tell us what to do, because they know. If the Government are prepared to aid, the Bureau with money and encouragement, they will assist materially to lift the people of Australia above the plane which they occupy to-day. Man's one hope of salvation in this world is to overcome nature. When he left Paradise he was given a sentence of hard labour. As he began to evolve, he put the work upon horses and cattle, and, in some cases, upon other men. By the aid of science he has been able to discard some of his ideas of earlier days, and has invented machines which enable him without a great amount of physical exertion to accomplish great things. Unfortunately, history tells us, that the people who have benefited most by the introduction of machinery have had most to say against those inventions. In the earlier days of the Industrial Revolutions the people demanded that machines should be smashed. The poets of those times wrote songs about their waste and their danger, and even theologians thundering from their pulpits condemned them as ungodly and unholy. Magistrates on the bench denounced those things that were for the benefit of mankind. To-day that attitude towards the discoveries of science continues in a lesser degree. Although of such moment they are not appreciated here as they should be. At a great meeting in Atlanta City, in  1919,  a conference of working men, in force assembled, decided that the only way whereby the working man could benefit, and greater progress be accomplished, was by evoking the aid of science, in geology, agriculture, and mechanical appliances. If we allow our minds to revert to the early days of the last century, we will recall that, after the Napoleonic wars, when Germany had been crushed, her spirit ruined, her finances crippled, and she was generally in despair, Fichte suggested that, as her position was critical, her only hope of recouping her lost powers and rehabilitating herself amongst the nations of Europe was by means of scientific research. At the outbreak of the Great War she had accomplished this, and had placed herself in the forefront of the nations. Who will say that the Democracy of Germany will not be prepared to subscribe again to the doctrine preached over a century ago? If Germany survived her earlier misfortunes, let us not be crushed by any unfortunate mediocrity. We must be prepared to expend very freely on research for the benefit and betterment of the whole of the Empire of which we form a part. </para>
                    <para>Let me pass to the question of national progress, which we have to look forward, to. To-day is the day of the machine. The machine is the great leveller. It is one of the powerful forces of Democracy. An aristocracy cannot be maintained without distinction in dress, and that only by sumptuary laws or costliness. Under our Constitution the first is impossible, and the second is becoming rapidly impossible. For instance, rubies were used to decorate the ladies of the earlier days at great cost, but now specimens physically perfect are being manufactured in Paris which conform to any test to which a physicist may submit them. These cost4d. a carat, instead of many pounds, as in earlier days. Lace, which was a symbol of aristocracy years ago, is now being manufactured from cellulose. The lace manufacturers engrave upon cylinders wonderful designs, such as the minds of the women of years gone by never dreamed of, and the material, after passing over the different cylinders, is turned out in long lengths of lace of beautiful pattern. In these circumstances, the possibility of an Aristocracy is reduced, and the prospects of a Democracy raised. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth is endeavouring, in the best possible way, to do what it can to aid the wonderful science of wireless telegraphy. Will any one endeavour or dare to say what the future of wireless will be ? A vessel in a fog can be directed by means of wireless signals, and wireless can be used in many other marvellous ways, too numerous to mention. Australia must move forward in this wonderful realm, and I sincerely trust the Government will not allow the Marconi octopus to throttle our forward movement in this direction. I appreciate the position of the members of the Government, some of whom were members of the Committee appointed to inquire into the proposed agreement between the Commonwealth and , Amalgamated Wireless (Australia) Limited. I am sure the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> and the other members of the Cabinet realize the great importance of wireless to Australia, and I trust the Government will do everything possible to make this Department a striking success, because it is along these lines that a great deal of the future success of our Empire lies. In conclusion, may I add that the circumstances under which the Government has been formed suggest that one should look for some analogy, and I am reminded of a chariot-driver and his horses. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> has a team to drive. It has to go forward. He cannot stop it if he wishes. He cannot say with the mechanistic philosophers, "Let them alone; they will go when they must." He has to let them go on. If they go off the road they must be guided back. He must keep his team in operation to carry on the functions of government. For guidance he appeals to the facts with which he has to deal - the structure of the vehicle, and nature of his team; on the other hand, to his idealism, his innate feeling concerning the proper destiny of this Commonwealth. He must appreciate the fact that along the road he is driving there lies either damnation or salvation. One has to be avoided and the other aspired to. Where is he going? Is there to he a haven of realized ideals of stability. He does not know; but the winds of God blow in his face, and the dawn of a new day lights the eastern sky. I trust that that new dawn will bring to Australia all the good things which she richly deserves. </para>
