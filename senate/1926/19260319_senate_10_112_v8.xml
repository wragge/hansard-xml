                    <para>When the paid-up value of any shares distributed out of taxed profits has been included in any assessment under the Income Tax Assessment Act, as being income within the meaning of paragraph (6) of section 14 of that act, and income tax has been paid on that value, any refund of the income tax so paid made by -the Commissioner prior to the commencement of this act shall be deemed to be, and at all times to have been, as lawfully made as if that value had been exempt from income tax under that act. </para>

                <para>The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford),</inline> in moving the second reading, did not give the Senate a great deal of information. I find that the measure provides for the validation of the refund of certain tax paid in respect of bonus shares that had been distributed from accumulated profits, and it validates the non-collection of certain other amounts of tax. A perusal of the bill reveals many technicalities that, in some instances, may be puzzling; but it is clear that the Government, as the result of its interpretation of the decision of the High Court in the Webb case, refunded moneys collected on bonus shares. I noticed that the Commissioner of Taxation, in his ninth report, refers in these terms to the High Court&#39;s decision: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The High Court ruled that the tax was not payable on shares in a new company issued in substitution for shares in an old company reconstructed. The Government, after consideration of the views of the Solicitor-General, the Crown Solicitor, and the Crown Counsel in the Webb appeal, decided to announce in Parliament that this money would be refunded. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">It will be observed that the Commissioner stressed the point that the decision applied to new companies upon reconstruction. There appears to be no doubt that the Government decided, upon a wrong course of action. I hold that the <inline font-style="italic">money was legally collected,</inline> and illegally refunded, and that this bill has been introduced to validate the illegality. Three years have elapsed since the refund was made, and Parliament is now asked to validate a wrong action. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so; but Parliament should be very careful in validating wrong acts. When a citizen breaks the law, he, ordinarily, has to pay the penalty. When the Government acts illegally, however, it simply asks Parliament to validate its action. The Minister did not inform us as to the amount of money involved in this repayment, and I hope that he will supply that information.

                        <para>- This bill suggests that there is one law for the wealthy and another for the poor. We know that a number of wealthy men have evaded the payment of land tax in this country, and they have not been punished. This  bill is inequitable and unjust. It is evidently intended to benefit the rich man, or, as a Nationalist member of the other branch of the legislature termed him, the &#34; fat &#34; man. The royal commission that inquired into taxation made certain valuable recommendations. The gist of its suggestions was that dividends or bonus shares should be added to the income of the shareholder, and assessed at the individual rate, less the flat rate already paid by the company. By that system there would be no double taxation. Companies are formed in many cases for the purpose of evading taxation. A company may put certain profits into its reserve account in one year,&#39; and pay them, out to its shareholders in the form of bonus shares the next year. Thus &#39;the Commonwealth is deprived of tax. If the money, instead of being put into reserves is paid out in dividends, the persons receiving it have to pay tax on the dividends as well as the company tax. When the bonus shares are distributed in respect of the current years&#39; profits the tax must be paid on them; but, by paying the money out of reserves in the following year, taxation, with the exception of the company rate, is evaded. Although the measure could be commented upon at considerable length, I think that I have said sufficient regarding it. I presume that it will receive similar support in. this chamber to that given it in the other blanch of the legislature, ;and will become law. It is really a piece of class legislation, protecting a certain section of the community that is well able to pay this tax. Parliament is again asked to validate a wrong action on the part of the Government. It should hesitate before doing so. The Government has access to the best legal brains in Australia, and there is- no excuse for the blunder. I, therefore, oppose the measure </para>

                    HENRY BARWELL  (South Australia) &#91;11.16&#93;.  -  I am sorry that I was unavoidably absent yesterday when the Minister, in his second-reading speech, explained the provisions of this bill. This appears to be an extraordinary measure. Apparently, the Commissioner of Taxes has not only refrained from taxing the shareholders of companies in respect of bonuses which were credited or paid to them, but he has also gone further, and repaid to other taxpayers the amounts paid by them by way of income tax in respect of bonuses. In my opinion, those who were taxed in respect of those- bonuses, or bonus shares, were rightly taxed. I, therefore, consider that no repayments should have been made. It seems extraordinary that such, a state of affairs should have arisen. I assume that the Government acted on legal advice.

                        <para>- In the Income Tax Assessment Act the definition of income from personal exertion is clearly worded ; it includes income derived from various sources in. Australia, such as earnings, salary, wages, fees, bonuses, and so on. In the Webb case, which dealt with the reconstruction of a company, the position was entirely different. It was held in that case that no part of the shares of the new company which were allotted to a member of the old company could be regarded as profits or bonuses credited or paid by the old company to the member of the new company within the meaning of section 14 of the 1915 act, and that the member was not liable to assessment in respect of those shares. That was an entirely different case from that of the assessments made by the Commissioner in respect of which this validation is now sought. The assessments covered by the Webb case were in respect of the reconstruction of a company and the issue of shares to its. members. </para>

But Webb&#39;s case in no way authorized an exemption of bonuses paid by a continuing company to its members.

                    BARWELL.T appreciate the difficulty which confronts the Government; but it is unfortunate that this situation should have arisen. The Government is treating it as a matter of honour, although the decision in the James case was that the action of the Commissioner of Taxes, in assessing those shareholders on their bonus shares, was legal. Because of the promise given, moneys which were rightly collected have been repaid.

                        <para>- It is unfortunate, &#39;but the Government is bound by the promise of the then Treasurer. Were payment again demanded from them, hardship would be inflicted on those taxpayers to whom repayments have been made. Although to a certain extent the honour of the Government is involved, no blame can be attached to it for having taken action on the legal advice tendered. In the circumstances, I cannot see that the Senate can do other than support the second reading of this bill, and thus validate the action of the Government. </para>

                        <para>. -  I propose to test the feeling of the committee on this clause, which after a lapse of three years authorizes the repayment of certain moneys. The principle is pernicious. The Government should have been more wide awake. It is not right that this Parliament should now be asked to pull the chestnuts out of the fire. I have always hesitated to vote for validating legislation, especially where vital principles are involved, and where it is evident that attempts have been made to evade obligations. To pass this bill would be to encourage a repetition of similar acts. Believing that money rightly due should be paid, I shall vote against this clause. </para>

                    <para>. -This is the most important clause in the bill, and it deserves the serious consideration of every honorable senator. During the recent war Australian citizens were told that no sacrifice could be too great to win the war and to make the world safe for democracy. But it is common knowledge that many who spoke in that manner did not practise what they preached. The shareholders of many companies in Australia got back in three years by way of profits the whole of their capital investments, and, in addition, they received substantial dividends and big. bonuses. So great did the profits become that many of the companies started  a  watering-down process. No restrictions were placed on them in that respect. </para>

                        <para>- &#39;Half a century ago there was no Federal Parliament, and what happened then has no application to the subject we are considering. A number of these companies well watered their stock, and from time to time issued bonus shares. Those associated with companies have frequently told working men and working women that they ought to make provision for a rainy day. What provision did the companies make for a dry season ? They certainly never looked seriously into the future. There is evidence of that in the stock and share register. Honorable senators who live in the atmosphere of the government benches know that what I am saying is correct. Companies which a few years ago were on a high financial level are not so well &#34; circumstanced to-day, and the explanation is that their stocks have been too much watered. </para>

                        <para>- I do. It is wrong to refund taxation which, according to the Government, was justly paid. It was paid under an act which Parliament passed. Many cases have been decided by the High Court in the last few years, and too large a proportion of them have been decided against the Government and the community. It is time that we looked into the matter from an &#163;. s. d. point of view. </para>

                        <para>- This Government does not settle constitutional matters; the High Court settles them, and, occasionally, also &#34; settles &#34; the Government. The Minister explained the bill in a manner characteristic of him. He has a genial way of submitting business to the Senate. He has a pleasing personality, and is not disposed to annoy or ruffle any one unnecessarily; but, in justice to himself and his Government, he ought not to have been so brief. I know there was some anxiety to get the bill through before the dinner adjournment. He simply told us that it was a validating bill. The Treasurer in another place gave an explanation that was historical, but the Minister here says in effect that it is &#34;a mere matter of form . &#34; It is not going to be &#34; a mere matter of form &#34; with me. I shall endeavour to ascertain from the Minister the amount of taxation refunded to companies, or to persons associated with companies, and I am also anxious to know the names of the companies. </para>

It hits every facility for obtaining the best legal advice, and if those in charge of the Law Department had done their work as well as we have a right to expect of them, this bill would not be before us. Similar validating legislation has been submitted to us in the past. It is a serious thing to  exempt any section of the community from what the Parliament has decided is a just responsibility. The average person is never too eager to pay taxation, and we can assume that those associated with companies will secure the services of the best legal luminaries in Australia in an effort to evade the law. On several occasions citizens of this country have successfully contested the validity of acts of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have already informed the committee, by interjection, that information as to the amount involved is not available, and that to obtain it would take considerable time and involve great expense, as it would necessitate an examination of thousands of assessments. I cannot see that the amount involved is at all material to the issue. We have to decide whether it is right or wrong to validate the repayment of taxation collected on bonus shares. It is immaterial whether a few. pounds or ?100,000 is involved; it is a question of whether the clause is right in principle. Complaints have been made because I did not give the Senate more information in moving the second reading of the bill, but I felt at the time that I gave all that was necessary, particularly as the measure does not deal with the principle of taxing bonus shares. That matter was dealt with in the consolidating bill passed in 1922. This is simply a short amending measure to give effect to the intentions of Parliament, and also to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Taxation which reported that bonus shares should not be taxed first in the hands of the company and then in the hands of the individual shareholders. It has been said that profits should be distributed by companies in the form of dividends as earned, but anyone with commercial experience will recognize that that would be wrong. One of the reasons why Australia is so prosperous at present is that companies as well as individuals have not distributed all their money as it has been made, but have placed a certain amount to reserve, and as their businesses &#39;have expanded have converted their reserve funds into capital  and issued what are. termed bonus shares. That is not watering stock, as alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> because for every share issued an equivalent in cash is retained in the business of the company. I believe a majority of senators are of the opinion that we ought to encourage rather than discourage such a practice, because as the businesses of the country expand increased capital will be necessary to conduct them, and that will be obtained very largely by joint stock companies placing a reasonable amount to reserve every year and. issuing it from time to time in the form of bonus shares. It would be unfair to tax bonus shares in the hands of shareholders, because although a certain amount may be placed to reserves from year to year, and taxation paid on it by a company, bonus shares may be issued perhaps once in ten years, and taxation on those shares would probably have to be paid by the holder in one year. In such cases his rate of tax might be three or four times greater than if the amount represented by the bonus shares were added to his income year by year as earned by the company. The purport of the bill is to make retrospective the law in regard to bonus shares as was intended when the consolidating bill of 1922 was passed. It was believed at that time that the provision had a retrospective effect, but as it was decided otherwise by the High Court in the James case, this amending measure is submitted to correct the omission inadvertently made. </para>

                        <para>.- The purport of this bill is to grant an extension of time for the repayment of advances made and in some cases to release growers from the responsibility of repaying advances under the Dried Fruits Advances Act of 1924. I understand that the principal act provides for the repayment of the advances made on the 1925 crop, plus interest at the rate of 6 per cent. The only feature of the bill to which I object is the appointment of a board to carry out the work entailed, which I think could be performed by departmental officers. Will the proposed board cost very much ? </para>

                            <para>- Could not all the work be done by Government officials ? I understand that a number of returned soldiers will benefit if this measure is passed. The Minister stated that 4,500 people participated in the advance, and. received &#163;204,000. He also quoted figures to show that the prices received for lexias and currants in 1925 did not pay the growers, the decline in values being&#163;65s. per ton in the case of lexias and &#163;9 3s. per ton for currants. I realize what a handicap this means to the people engaged in the industry. They deserve assistance. I intend to support the bill, particularly since the Minister has assured us that the cost of inquiry will not be heavy. </para>

                        <para>.. - Those who will be affected by the measure represent a section of the community  whose hours of labour are long, whose work is hard, and whose financial return has not been commensurate with the amount of work performed. When this subject was before the Senate some time ago,  I told the Minister then, and I tell him to-day, that we ought to hesitate before we proclaim from the housetops that there is room in Australia for any number of people to settle on the land. </para>

                            <para>- Of course there is room. But is there a reasonable prospect of their being successful ? There is room, for instance, for millions of people on either side of the east-west railway, but they could not make a living there. Would the Minister and those who support the bill encourage relatives from overseas to come to Australia, and settle in an industry like this, where people are asking for government aid ? This kind of settlement at present does not spell progress. The Minister can afford to smile, because, whilst he is in the industry himself, he knows that, be the seasons good or bad, his income as a Cabinet Minister will go on until June next. Other people in the same industry are not in that happy position. They deserve our sympathy. I am not opposed to government assistance, but I question the wisdom of inducing other people to come to Australia to engage in this industry. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister&#39;s optimism is not endorsed by other men who ought to know what they are talking about. If the prospects of the people in the industry are as the Minister suggests, where is the need for the appointment of a board to consider cases of hardship ? I know there is a disposition on the part of some of those people to be relieved of their liability altogether. The Minister has assured us that each case will be dealt with on its merits. He has told us that the cost of the inquiry will not be more than &#163;250 or &#163;300. If members of the board intend to travel to different parts of Australia to inquire into individual cases, the expenditure will be very much in excess of the sum stated by the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, we know that the Minister is the only business man on the Government side ! It is a pity that the South Australian electors did not give him a further lease of political life, so that the Government could continue on sound business lines ! If his department has been conducted on business lines, is it not absurd to appoint a board to inquire into cases of hardship ? No  doubt, the Minister considers himself an up-to-date business man, and unlike old-time Cabinet Ministers, has in the department over which he presides all the essential information concerning this industry. And yet he talks about the necessity for the appointment of this board ! </para>

The Minister stated yesterday that the sultana industry was in a more favorable position. Are we to understand that the growers of currants who, it appears, have to be helped with a subsidy each year from the Consolidated Revenue, are to be encouraged to go out of the business and concentrate on the production of sultanas? If this course is adopted, is it not likely that there will be a glut in sultanas, with the result that those engaged in the business will be in the position of the currant growers of to-day? </para>

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has indicated, it will be a serious matter if men on the River Murray settlements have to be carried by the Government for three or four years until their areas come into profitable production again. If we have to vote money every year for the industry, I doubt whether it is worth while continuing, in the business. Failure in soldier settlements is not confined to areas set apart for settlement on the River Murray. In the Stanthorpe, Beerburrum and Samford districts of Queensland, there has been a large number of failures owing to the fact that inferior land was made available for soldier settlement by the State Labour Government. Some of the country made available to soldier settlers within 20 or 30 miles of Brisbane had been passed over by practical primary producers as unsuitable for cultivation. </para>

                            <para>- The sum of &#163;204,600. At the time when I asked the Senate to agree to the original measure, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> criticized it, and asked whether it was wise to bring about an increased production in this industry. At that time the market prospects for sultanas were anything but satisfactory, and the Government anticipated that currants would prove profitable. Unfortunately, currants were a bad selling proposition, but sultanas, on which most of the money was advanced, yielded remunerative returns. The price obtained1 last year was ?68 a ton, equal to ?48 at the drying sheds. If that price could be maintained the industry could be profitably conducted. Although ?165,000 out of the total advance was devoted to the growers of sultanas, only ?13,800 was given to the currant-growers, and ?25,000 to the growers of lexias. Since then, the Government, by its assistance to the wine industry, has created a market for the surplus product. The distilleries have been largely availed of this year, and although the prices paid by them have not been highly satisfactory, they are much in advance of those paid for the two previous years. The Government is not prepared to spread the repayments over two years until a strict inquiry has been made, and, therefore, it has decided to appoint a small board. </para>

                            <para>- The whole expenditure will not exceed from ?250 to ?300. The department has complete data with regard to the advances, and every case will be considered on its merits. Most of the sultana growers are in a satisfactory financial position, while those who have gone in for lexias and currants must naturally be in difficulties. We have to consider whether we shall extend the period for repayment over the next two years, or give further relief. I admit that a waste of money would be incurred in appointing a board that would travel extensively throughout Australia. The Government felt that Parliament should be consulted in this matter, and that a small board within the department could economically accomplish all that is desired. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing in the bill to say what the board will do. When Mildura was first opened up, the absence of railways increased the difficulties of the early pioneers. Many of them suffered, not only inconvenience and hardship, but also financial loss. After federation efforts were made to grant those engaged in the fruit-growing industry, especially those producing currants, a measure of protection, and after persistent efforts a duty of 3d. a lb. was placed on imported currants. With the whole of the Australian market before them, many of the growers did exceptionally well. Their success encouraged others to engage in the production of curl rants, with the result that in time the supply was sufficient to meet the requirements of the home market. At that stage their difficulties really commenced. Yet the Minister, in an effort to solve those difficulties, proposes to place more men on the land to grow more currants. </para>

I assume that those applications will be for release from their financial obligations. How have those obligations been incurred ? I take it that the board will inquire into all cases which are brought  before it, and that it will have power to summon witnesses. Will the board, when its work has been completed, make a report to Parliament? I do not wish to see the men engaged in this industry saddled with obligations and responsibilities which are too great for them. I desire to see them obtain from their holdings returns which will enable them to realize some of their anticipations when they took up the land. Two members of the board are to be appointed by the Minister. Will the third member be appointed by the growers? </para>

It is true that the information available in the department will he accessible to the board, but the Minister, as a business man of wide vision and sound judgment, must know that nothing broadens a man&#39;s views so much as does travel. Rather than that the board should live in a departmental atmosphere, . it should travel into the fruit-growing areas, and ascertain for itself the conditions there. It should see how the settlers are housed, observe the progress they are making, and inquire whether they are married or single. Honorable senators will realize that the responsibilities of married men are greater than those of single men. </para>

I have in mind the settlement at Red Cliffs, in Victoria, where in recent years a great transformation has taken place. A few years ago there was no settlement there, but to-day a different scene presents itself. The same is true of other portions of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia. </para>

                        <para>He <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Walter)</inline> explained that it was optional whether his services were retained or not after passing the age of 60 years, and admits that his retirement is within legal right, but complains of the manner in which his services were terminated. I must confess that I know of no other proper manner of terminating an officer&#39;s services except the legal and constitutional method laid clown by the Public Service Act and the Superannuation Act, and this procedure is being followed in this case. The position is simply this: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> is within two months of the age of 64 years. It is considered that efficient administration will be , best served by retiring <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter,</inline> and in exercising the option which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> admits, and which the act has provided, a precedent is being followed which has been sanctified by the custom of all governments which have ever held power . within this State. At random I could name half a dozen senior officers, including one higher-salaried official and one resident magistrate, all younger than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter,</inline> and I could name a dozen others, including another magistrate, who were a&#39;lso younger than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter,</inline> who were retired by previous governments for the same reason, or to effect some doubtful advantages. Into the reasons given it would&#39; not be desirable to probe. It is strange that what has been a virtue in the past, or at least has not called for even a passing comment, should today be termed &#34; political vindictiveness &#34; by one who has been treated in exactly the same way as a considerable number of younger  men who have gone before. I may remind him that what he characterizes as a conviction for an alleged &#34; disloyal utterance &#34; was nothing of the kind. His judicial training should make him more careful. There was a charge of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> &#34;statement likely to prejudice recruiting,&#34; which wa? dismissed. It was upon a charge of a &#34; statement likely to cause disaffection &#34; that a fine of &#163;25 and costs was imposed, with the ultimate result of the remission of the fine and the&#39; ordering of a refund of costs  by the  Commonwealth Government - a tacit admission of a stupid prosecution and an improper conviction. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter&#39;s</inline> statement that a report was current of a threat of his retirement ten minutes after Labour came into power is barely worthy of notice. </para>

I have read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier&#39;s</inline> reply, as contained in the telegram forwarded to me, and I have also read an extract from a letter handed to the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian,</inline> dated 28th May, 1924. I venture to say that what I have read is a complete refutation of the  assertion  made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> which was, in the first place, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> was dismissed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> had imposed a fine on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier.</inline> Secondly, it answers the charge that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier&#39;s</inline> first act as a Minister. </para>

In one he states the fine was remitted by the Commonwealth Government, and in another he asserts that it was remitted by the High Court. I see no reason what- ever to withdraw what I have said in regard to this matter. The assertion I made was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> who at that time was, I think, the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia and the leader of the Labour party, did in fact come before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter,</inline> and was, in fact, fined. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter,</inline> in his judicial capacity, found him guilty of the charge, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> at that time made the threat against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> which I have indicated, and which is not denied. As soon as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> became Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> was relieved of his appointment as a magistrate. </para>

                            <para>- BROCKMAN.That statement might have some merit if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> had never threatened <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter,</inline> and it would also have some merit if it had not been the practice in Western Australia for many years to extend the tenure of such appointments where men were fit and capable of carrying on the work, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> is capable of doing to-day. There might also be some merit in the defence now put up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier&#39;s</inline> behalf if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> had appointed a younger man to carry out the work previously performed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter;</inline> but, as a matter of fact, he appointed a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidson,</inline> who is much older than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter.</inline> Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidson</inline> are personal friends of mine, and I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidson</inline> was appointed in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter&#39;s</inline> place. In view of these facts, the defence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> is, to say the least of it, very thin. It was considered very thin by the people of Western Australia, who have not accepted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier&#39;s</inline> pronouncement as a true statement of the facts. I come back to my original assertion, that when we find men of the type of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> - who is probably the fairest and most decent of Labour leaders in any of the States - whether of his own volition or at the instigation of those behind him, capable of vindictiveness of this sort, then having regard to this fact in particular, we should not be justified in asking police magistrates under the control of State Governments to carry out judicial functions involving deportation as a sentence. That was the point I was endeavouring to make when I originally addressed myself to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - This morning I asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> a question relating to cable matters, to which I received a reply which I consider more than unsatisfactory, and which has excited a certain amount of resentment on my part. To me it is most extraordinary to supply to a member of this Parliament such an answer to a question submitted for the purpose of eliciting information either for the benefit of the Senate or in the public interest. The question I asked was - </para>

                    <para class="block">The administration of the Pacific Cable Board is not directly the concern of the Commonwealth Government and, no doubt, the Government, has supplied this answer in good faith and at the instigation of the board, because the question would be referred to it for a. reply. It is, therefore, the board that considers that no useful purpose would be served by giving these details. I wish to ask, in all sincerity, not only for my own benefit, but also for the information of other honorable senators, if. an outside body such as the Pacific Cable Board or its officials is to determine whether any question asked in the Senate for the purpose of obtaining information would or would not serve any useful purpose? The Pacific Cable Board is, to an extent, a semi-public body, as the Commonwealth Government has a one-third interest in the enterprise. We do the largest measure of traffic over the cables owned and controlled by the Pacific Cable Board, and yet there seems to be on the part of the board a deliberate attempt to withhold information from this Parliament and from the public. The accounts are kept, the reports couched, and the tables in the report prepared in such a way that, instead of giving the fullest information to this Parliament and those desirous of knowing what the board is doing, they deliberately cover up its operations, and thus prevent honorable senators, members of another place, and the public from knowing what it is doing, and what measure of support is being  given  by Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I considered that aspect of the matter before I asked the question. I have no desire to be responsible for information being supplied to rival companies in which the Commonwealth has no interest. The particulars which I sought would not give &#39;to other concerns information which could be used against the board. They have other means of obtaining the information. In fact, the total figures and the business done by the board are given in the report; but the trouble is that the Australian figures are grouped with those of New Zealand, and it is impossible to ascertain exactly what Australia is doing. Seeing that the Commonwealth holds a one-third interest, we should know what business is being done by the board in Australia as compared with New Zealand. It is impossible for us to compare the progress of the work from year to year. We might be doing much more business than the rival company, which is a private concern. The answer to my question states that the particulars, are to be found in the annual report of the Postmaster-General. I say that they are not. The figures published in that report are for the year from 1st April to 31st March, whilst the figures in the report of the Pacific Cable Board are for the year from 1st July to 30th June, so it is impossible to get from the annual report of the Postmaster-Genera&#93; the basis of comparison which I desire to obtain, upon  certain phases of the Pacific Cable Board&#39;s business. I feel very strongly on this subject, and resent very much the manner in which my questions were answered, as well as the attitude of the board generally. If 1 cannot get the information which I desire in any other way, I shall table a motion asking for the preparation of a return. . Honorable senators will then have an opportunity to see for themselves whether the affairs of the board are being conducted properly. This cloak of secrecy thrown over the whole business of the board arouses suspicion. </para>

                            <para>- If a semi-public business concern such as the Pacific Cable Board does not clearly state what business is being done by it in Australia, one begins to wonder why. It is absurd to say that the preparation of the figures I have asked for would involve considerable expenditure. I am informed, on very good authority, that the information has to be compiled in order that the  total amount of the terminal charges each year may be assessed. I believe that the board has the information, and can supply it readily enough, so if T cannot get in answer to a question, I shall have to take other action. </para>

                            <para>- That, at all events, was the reply furnished by the Prime Minister. I cannot see in what way the public will be benefited by being informed as to the receipts in respect of traffic to&#39; and from Australia. It has not yet been proved that the information contained in the annual report of the Pacific Cable Board is not as complete as it should be. The honorable senator also desired information as to the maintenance of staffs and stations in Australia. We know that the Pacific Cable Company is in strong competition with a rival company, and it might be inadvisable - I do not advance this as a reason why the information was not supplied - to furnish its rival with certain details of the Pacific Cable Board&#39;s business in Australia. </para>

                            <para>-  My questions were inspired because of a strong commercial agitation in Sydney for a reduction of the terminal charges and the rates fixed by the board. The board has declared that reductions cannot be made, because of the traffic, but it is believed that if the information I have asked for is furnished, it will be seen that the board can afford to reduce the charges. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman did not say that before. Probably the course which he has suggested, namely the tabling of a motion for the preparation of a return, is the better one to adopt. The honorable senator may then advance what he has now said as a reason why the return should be prepared, and if there is any reason why the information should not be supplied the Minister will bo able to indicate it when replying. Obviously the Prime Minister satisfied himself with the answer supplied by the Pacific Cable Board because it had the approval of the Government. I have no doubt that the board gave the Prime Minister good reasons why further details were not supplied. </para>
