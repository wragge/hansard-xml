                            <para>No. The figures of the Treasurer of Western Australia are, obviously, on&#39; a wrong basis. He estimates the receipts of land tax in Western Australia at &#163;65,000, whereas the Federal estimate is &#163;80,588. He is reported to have stated that &#34; head office collections are not known, but it is fairly safe to assume that the Federal Treasurer has overstated the amount.&#34; The ninth report of the Federal Commissioner of Taxation shows that the actual assessment of Federal land tax for Western Australia for 1922-23 (the last year for which final figures are available) totalled &#163;81,823. This clearly justifies the Federal Treasurer&#39;s estimate of &#163;80,588, and shows that the State Treasurer&#39;s estimate is under the mark. As regards estate duties, the State Treasurer is reported to have said that the Federal Treasurer &#34; has allowed for an amount more than double what the State might reasonably expect to obtain.&#34; The Federal Treasurer&#39;s estimate is &#163;47,252. The distribution amongst States of the actual assessments for 1924-25 (the last year for which final figures are available) shows that the actual assessments for estates in Western Australia totalled &#163;61,869. This is wore than three times the amount which the State Treasurer is reported to have said would be a fair annual average. In the case of income tax, the State Treasurer estimates the collections at &#163;70,000 less than the Federal estimate. He does not disclose the basis for his estimate. The Commonwealth figures are based on the actual assessments, with allowance for the reduction in rates of tax and for the growth of taxes and for the distribution of central office assessments of income tax. In these circumstances, the estimates of the State Treasurer cannot be accepted. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to ascertain from the Minister representing the Minister for Works and Railways the intentions of the Government concerning the ballasting of the east-west railway. Honorable senators who have travelled over the line realize that the section through the Ooldea Hills, owing to the peculiar nature of the country, needs ballasting, not only to ensure a greater rate of speed over the whole system, but also to minimize discomfort to passengers. During the summer months the dust in that locality is a source of trouble to the mechanical equipment, and also causes inconvenience to travellers. It has been admitted by those who have travelled the world that the service is excellent, but the Minister controlling the department should be reminded that improvements are necessary in order to make it even more efficient. </para>

                        <para>- On what portion of the line? I should like to see the money expended wisely, and greater attention given to the ballasting of the sandy country than, say, the Nullarbor Plain, where the rock formation is close to the surface. Heavy trains swinging round curves on the unballasted portion of the line necessarily damage the permanent way considerably. In this matter of ballasting we should, I think, hold to the maxim &#34;first things first,&#34; that is to say, ballast first those portions of the line that most need attention. </para>

                    <para>. - The government of the day established an excellent precedent by applying a considerable portion of the profits from the note issue to the construction of the east-west railway. In this way the sum of &#163;3,428,518 was provided without interest, and although the total cost of the line at the 30th June, 1924, was &#163;7,425,845, the amount upon which interest has to be paid is only about half that sum. This has been a very substantial help to the finances of the line. As the profits now being derived from the note issue and, to a less extent, from the operations of the Commonwealth Bank, are not being used for the extension of the bank&#39;s business, some portion should be set aside for either the construction of the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs or for the unification of the railway systems of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The east-west line is provided for in this schedule to the extent of &#163;130,000, and we have just been informed that about &#163;40,000 will be expended on ballasting. That portion of the line which crosses the wonderful stretch of country from Tarcoola to Golden Ridge, is almost unique. It follows almost a straight line for 330 miles, the blue bush on both sides of the line giving the traveller the impression day and night that the train is crossing an ocean. It should not cost very much per mile to ballast that line, because the quarries are readily accessible, and the country is of hard limestone formation. My chief concern is to persuade the Government to set aside some portion of the profits from the note issue, free of interest, for the construction of the railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. </para>

                        <para>- It would reduce the interest charges on cost of construction, and as, according to the latest information, the line is not likely to be profitable for a great many years we should, if possible, keep down the interest bill as has been done in connexion with the capital cost of the east-west railway. I hope that the Treasurer will pay some attention to my suggestion. I notice that the sum of &#163;1,240,000 is provided for new railway construction. Does this mean that the Alice Springs to Oodnadatta line is to be proceeded with without delay? Up to the present I have not had any information as to whether the trial or working  surveys have been made. I should like to know how the matter stands. Furthermore, in view of the decision in favour of the standard gauge of 4ft. 8&#163;in., has it been definitely decided that the line to Alice Springs shall be built on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge? </para>

                    <para>. - On page 5 there appears the item, &#163;252,500 for expenditure under the River Murray Waters Act 1915-23. If the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> has the information available, I should like him to give me some idea as &#39; to the amount of money that has been spent to date, the amount which it is now proposed to spend, and the total that is likely to be involved before the River Murray Waters Commission accomplishes its purpose - if, indeed, that purpose is not to be everlasting. </para>

                    <para>. - There is one aspect of this matter upon which I should be exceedingly pleased to be furnished with definite information. I have tried on a number of occasions to obtain it, but for different reasons it has not come to light. We know that the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and the Commonwealth are responsible for the construction of the Hume reservoir, beyond Albury, and they are making a good and a quick job of it. It will be one of the largest reservoirs in the world. A vast volume of water is to be impounded. Arrangements have been made for the locking of the Darling and the Murray at various points. At many of those points the locks are already in operation. But a dead silence is maintained in regard to the intention respecting one of the most important parts of the whole scheme, the outlet to the ocean. Hitherto the influence of Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide has prevented steps from being taken to ensure the construction of a suitable Outlet for the river Murray. In the past that has been due to interstate jealousy. A deep water port at the mouth of the Murray would be the natural outlet for the produce of that immensely fertile area. </para>

                        <para>- Had settlement been begun at the mouth of the Murray, instead of on Sydney Harbour, the subsequent settlement of Australia would have proceeded upon lines entirely different from those that it has followed. The basin of the river Murray is probably one of the most fertile in the world. It has a watershed of probably a little over half a million square miles. The natural outlet for the produce from, the Darling and Murray watersheds is the point at which the Murray enters the sea, yet nothing has been done to make it possible for deep-sea vessels to go there. Apparently no portion of the &#163;7,000,000 that has been made available under the River Murray Waters Act has been expended at the mouth of that river. </para>

                        <para>- I have not; but I have been at the Hume weir, and have travelled for considerable distances along the river. The land along both sides is equal to land that can be found anywhere. It is time that interstate jealousy, which has been responsible to a greater or less extent for the lethargy that has been displayed by the commission - in regard to works at the mouth of the Murray - was brought to an . end. I should like the Minister to tell me whether he has any information as to when the commission proposes to take steps to provide a satisfactory outlet to the ocean. Has it any intention in that direction ? If it has not, will he consider the advisability of placing upon the commission persons who will take a wider, a more up-to-date, and a more progressive view of the situation than appears to have been taken by the existing members ? </para>

                    <para>.- The locking of the Murray is one of the finest works in the Commonwealth. The States of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria, in conjunction with the Commonwealth, have entered into a partnership. The River Murray Waters Commission is composed of the Ministers of Public Works of the States and the Commonwealth, and, in addition, there is a River Murray Waters Conservation League, of which I am a vice-president. This, very fine work will considerably develop the Riverina district, and will make available land that will be of untold value to the Commonwealth. I believe that the locks at Mildura and Wentworth have been completed. The. commission has under consideration the carrying out of work at the mouth of the river, with a view to allowing deep-sea vessels to load there. I feel sure that, with the engineering ability and brains that are available, a tangible scheme will be devised for getting over the present difficulty. I have not found any interstate jealousy manifested in connexion with the scheme. When it is completed, the people of the States concerned - but particularly the settlers who will reap the direct benefit - will commend the governments for the excellence of the work. It will be a legacy that coming generations will deeply appreciate. A considerable amount of settlement is bound to take place, because the land along the Murray fiats is amongst the finest in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - In reply to questions that have been asked, I have to say that of the &#163;130,000 set down for the transcontinental railway, &#163;44,000 is for ballasting between Kingoonya and Tarcoola. The Oodnadatta to Alice Springs Railway Act provides for the construction of a railway of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, a distance of approximately 300 miles, at an estimated cost of &#163;1,700,000. The preliminary work is well in hand, and orders for the rolling-stock; &#38;c., have been placed. No provision for a port at the mouth of the river Murray is made in the act under which the River Murray Waters Commission operates. The whole of the works under the jurisdiction of the commission are set out in the schedule to that act, which also stipulates the amounts to be contributed by each of the States concerned, namely, Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia, as well as by the Commonwealth. Last session&#39; amending legislation was passed varying the schedule in certain particulars. </para>

The sum of &#163;252,509 set down for works in connexion with the river Murray represents the Commonwealth Government&#39;s share of the estimated expenditure for 1926-27, in respect of works to be carried out in pursuance of the River Murray Waters agreement. The total expenditure is estimated at &#163;1,010,000. The works on which it is proposed to incur this expenditure are - In New South Wales, Hume Reservoir, &#163;390,000; weir and lock No. 10, &#163;110,000; surveys and borings, &#163;5,000. In Victoria, Hume Reservoir, &#163;170,000; weir and lock No. 11, at Mildura, &#163;70,000 ; surveys, investigations, and supplies of material for other weirs and locks, &#163;30,000. In South Australia, weir and lock No. 2, &#163;73,000; weir and lock No. 4, &#163;75,000; weir and lock No. 5, &#163;30,000; weir and lock No. 6, &#163;40,000; weir and lock No. 9, &#163;5,000; Lake Victoria storage, &#163;12,000. The expenditure incurred during 1925-26 on works carried out. by the River Murray Waters Commission was &#163;785,294. The total expenditure to the 30th June, 1926, was &#163;4,225,185, of which the Commonwealth Government&#39;s share was &#163;1,074,125. </para>

                        <para>- The opening of the mouth of the river Murray has, to my knowledge, been a subject of discussion for many years. The only solution that seems possible is, so to speak, to shift the mouth of the Murray about 60 miles along the coast, to a point referred to by Admiral Creswell in a pamphlet issued by him some time ago. It is a new plan, which involves making use of that natural sheet of water, the Coorong, for river traffic, and providing for a port in the vicinity of Kingston, where there is fairly deep water, and where produce could be loaded from the river steamers and barges into overseas vessels. That, possibly, is a State concern; but I do not suppose that any State could carry it out without assistance from the other States. Even Queensland produce is sometimes conveyed along the river Murray. It is high time that either the Commonwealth, or three or four of the States combined, made some provision in the direction of ascertaining the engineering possibilities of this scheme. It appears to be absolutely hopeless to expect a satisfactory port in the vicinity of the Murray mouth, as must be admitted by any one who has been there, and has seen the ceaseless surf which not only makes navigation impossible for large vessels, but might also in one night shift silt and sand that it would take years to remove. </para>

The only excavation would be a few miles at its southern end. I think that something might be done to ascertain whether such a project is feasible from an engineering point of view. I rose to get the information which the Minister has so kindly supplied, and not in any way to criticize or pour cold water on the project which is now under construction. </para>

I should like to know if they are to be placed on the land, or if they are to be permitted to enter into competition with Australian youths in secondary industries. Already many Australian parents are faced with the problem of what to do with their boys. They cannot get them apprenticed to trades as readily as they would like, and if boy migrants are to be permitted to come into competition with them, the position in this regard will be still more acute. The Minister should tell us if these boys are to be placed on the land and trained to be farmers. He might also tell us when the Development and Migration Commission is to be appointed. Judging by the haste with which the Development and Migration Bil&#93; was rushed through Parliament, it is to be appointed forthwith.

                    give the actual amount expended last year in advances to the States for the purchase of wire and wire netting ? This scheme originated when I was the Leader of the South Australian Government, and we then said that as we had an Advances for Wire Netting Act under which settlers were generously treated, there was no occasion for the Commonwealth to interfere. We contended that it was a matter for the States. The South Australian Government said that as it did not need the advances it was not going to accept them; but we were placed in the unfortunate position of having to contribute towards the costs of administration and the interest charges on the advances made to the other States. Wire and wire netting was supplied to settlers under conditions laid down by the Commonwealth, whereas the South Australian Government was making more liberal advances under its own act. That led to unnecessary duplication. I do not know whether advances are now being made to South Australia, but if not, it is very unfair that that State should have to contribute towards the cost of those made to other States. I do not think it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to interfere, but I should like to know what expenditure has been incurred, and the extent to which the different States have participated.

                        <para>. - The principal feature of the measure is to provide an additional sum of &#163;500,000 for the construction of the . Grafton to South Brisbane railway. I am not opposed to the additional amount being granted, but I should like further information before I support the second reading of the bill. The unification of the railway gauges of Australia has engaged the attention of the Parliaments of Australia probably more than any other subject, and even now it is doubtful if a tangible commencement has been made, although a number of men are employed on the construction of a line from Grafton to Kyogle. Simultaneously with the construction of the line from Kyogle to South Brisbane, the Government should build a line on the 4-ft. 8&#189; -in. gauge from Kalgoorlie to Perth. It has always been understood that that work would be undertaken by the Western Australian Government, but as that Government has apparently no intention of doing so, the Commonwealth Government should shoulder the responsibility. The Government should also undertake the construction of a line from Hay to Port Augusta, in order to connect the 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge in New South Wales with the line of that gauge now terminating at Port Augusta. In view of the proposal to transfer the Seat of Government to Canberra at an early date, consideration should also be given to the question of continuing the 4-ft8&#189;-in. gauge from Wodonga to Benalla. If that were done, the journey from Melbourne to the Federal Capital would be considerably improved. If that were done, the Victorian members of this Parliament would not show the same reluctance as they now do to the early removal of the Seat of Government to Canberra. I do not know what the cost would be, but it should not be very much. The Government is asking for &#163;4,000,000, all of which is to be expended on construction work between Grafton and South Brisbane. More provision should be made for a great national work of this character. If the Ministry was in earnest, it would immediately set about the unification of the gauge between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle, and also extend the standard gauge from. Wodonga to Benalla. We all expect that before long the Government will construct a line to connect Canberra with Yass Junction. This work should be undertaken by the </para>

                            <para>- It was part of the duty of the New South Wales Government to construct .a line, and I am surprised and disappointed that it has not been done. That connexion, when made, will materially lessen the distance between Melbourne and Canberra. The New South Wales members of the Federal Parliament will, I am sure, be very pleased when they see the first train leaving Canberra with Victorian members on board after the first meeting of Parliament at the Seat of Government. But it would afford them much greater satisfaction if, instead of having to make the journey via Goulburn, they could go direct to Y.ass Junction and join the express there. And if, as I suggest, the standard gauge line is extended as far as Benalla, the train journey between Melbourne and Canberra will be robbed of many of its unpleasant features. 1 hope that the Government, supported as it is by so many South Australian and Victorian members, will give early and favorable consideration to this suggestion. We have been informed that additional provision has to be made for the survey of the line, the acquisition of lands, for rails and fastenings, signalling and interlocking, railway station at South Brisbane, locomotive depot and transhipment station at South Brisbane, railway watering station  <inline font-style="italic">en route,</inline> construction work from South Brisbane station, outside that for which the contract had been let. This accounts for a total extra expenditure in New South Wales .of &#163;112,000, inclusive of provision for a 44-hours week, and in Queensland of &#163;967,000,- or a total of &#163;1,079,000. It would appear that the original estimates of the cost were made on insufficient information, but I fail to see how we can avoid voting the additional sum now required. There is one phase of the subject to which I wish to direct attention. Honorable senators will recollect that a few days ago at Ardglen, on the main northern line in New South Wales, where there is a single-line tunnel, the driver of a goods train lost his life through suffocation, and the fireman was rendered unconscious by fumes in the tunnel. The train was entirely out of control until the fireman recovered consciousness about 2 or 3 miles after the train had emerged from the tunnel. The Railway Council, which has charge of the construction of the Kyogle to South Brisbane line, comprises men of recognized railway ability in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> Commonwealth Railways Commissioner ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davidson,</inline> Railways Commissioner of Queensland; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frazer,</inline> Chief Commissioner of Railways in New South Wales. It is unfortunate that they have decided upon the construction of single line tunnels. It is not too late, even now, for them to review their decision. From every point of view it is a shortsighted policy. We have had convincing evidence of the foolishness of constructing single-line tunnels in  New  South Wales. There was one infamous tunnel at Otford. It was so dreaded by all drivers and firemen that finally it was scrapped, and a double-line tunnel built alongside it. We have had similar experiences in connexion with many other single-line tunnels in my State. There are now double-line tunnels on the whole of the railway line up to Walarobba. The long tunnel at Woy Woy was built to carry two lines of rails, although only one was laid down. The Government has made provision for the storage of an additional 1,000,000 acre feet in the Hume reservoir, and has taken similar action in connexion with the Cotter river dam at Canberra. The Sydney Harbour bridge has been designed by a man with a vision. It is 169 feet wide. There is provision for several railway and tramway lines, as well as ample room for motor traffic. Nevertheless, it. has been said that if Sydney develops as rapidly in the future as it has of late years, another bridge will be required in the near future. It is extraordinary that in the construction of this line the Government should make provision for only single-line tunnels. The railway will be a very important link between Sydney and Brisbane. It will shorten the distance between Brisbane and Sydney by over 100 miles, so that practically the whole of -the traffic between the two capital cities will be diverted over the shorter route. This traffic will be so heavy that, in all probability, the duplication of the line will be advisable. Consequently, double-line tunnels should  be provided now. In my judgment, this decision in favour of single-line tunnels is a fatal mistake. I have endeavoured to ascertain the probable additional cost of double-line tunnels. I am not sure that my figures are correct, but I understand they are not far out. There are three tunnels on the New South Wales side. One is 250 yards long, another is 198 yards, and the third 1,240 yards, or a total of 1,653 yards. On the Queensland side there are two tunnels, their respective lengths being 226 yards and 462 yards, or a total of 688 yards. The grand total is 2,341 yards. To take the railway over the mountain range the track on the New South Wales side has had to be carried along a spiral, and in the language of the aviators the train loops the loop. As one of the tunnels on the spiral is 1,240 yards long, it is obvious that the train crews and passengers will be seriously inconvenienced whenever there is a following wind, as it will be impossible to ventilate the tunnels properly. I am informed that single line tunnels cost &#163;150 a lineal yard, making a total of &#163;351,150. Double-line tunnels cost &#163;200 a lineal yard, or a total of &#163;468,200. The difference is only &#163;117,050, which, at 5 per cent., represents &#163;6,000 a year. That sum should not stand in the way of the construction of tunnels which will carry a double line of rails. If at a later date it is decided to duplicate the line, either other single-line tunnels will have to be constructed, or the present single-line tunnels discarded, and double-line tunnels constructed. That would be a wicked and wanton waste of public money. The Government should obtain from its responsible engineers a report as to the extra cost that would be involved. The through and the local traffic warrant the construction of double-line tunnels. They would make for the safety of the employees and thepublic, and the proper working of the traffic. I offer no objection to the expenditure of an additional &#163;500,000. The work is being carried out under the day-labour system in both New South Wales and Queensland, and I have no doubt that it will be done a good deal better and cheaper than if it were carried out under the contract system. I urge the Government to take every step possible to have the true facts placed before honorable senators, so that, if necessary, we can provide whatever additional sum is required to construct tunnels that will carry two lines of rails. </para>

We have before us an illustration of the adoption of very loose business methods by those who have been in charge of the compilation of the estimates. We are entitled to ask for an assurance that there will be no repetition of this procedure. If an ordinary contractor or business man adopted methods similar to these he would find himself in the bankruptcy court, and he would not have a Parliament to relieve him of his liability.

This railway is only the first to be constructed in accordance with the generally accepted policy for the unification of the railway gauges of Australia. Doubtless it will not be long before we shall be asked to give our approval to the construction of other links in that chain ; and unless steps are taken to ensure accuracy in the estimation of the probable expenditure Parliament will be asked to consent to the voting of other large sums to rectify mistakes that have been made in estimates or to provide for additional costs caused by rises in wages or reductions in working hours. That is not a proper way to conduct the business of government, and I shall certainly not be a party to it in the future. </para>

                        is aware that contracts for railway construction do not make provision for the payment of a lump sum, but are based upon the number of cubic yards of earth works involved, the bridges that have to be constructed, and other factors. Deviation from the estimates is always a possibility. The contract makes provision for a decrease or an increase in the price in the event of wages falling or rising respectively.

I admit that there have been increases in the cost on account of the curtailment of working hours and the payment of higher rates of wages. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> in hoping that the committee will not again be asked to vote money in similar circumstances. </para>

                            <para>.- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has claimed to have established a record, because on this occasion he presented the financial statement of the Commonwealth within eight days of the close of the financial year. It is true that he has done that; but that is no cause for satisfaction. If ho had presented a complete budget I could have congratulated him; but he has not done so. Information that we should have is not contained in the budget. A  President  of the United States of America once said, &#34; Government is finance, and finance is government.&#34; The budget is the foundation of all governmental activities, and when presented to Parliament, it should contain full particulars of those activities. In view of our present financial position, the Treasurer should have placed all possible information before Parliament. But this budget is incomplete. In his complacency, the Treasurer stated that the information contained in the budget was sufficient. I do not agree with him. Like many proposals of the Government, the budget is ill-considered and incomplete. The Treasurer places his views before us, and expects us to accept them without question. </para>

                            <para>- Yesterday the Leader of the Senate was annoyed because some honorable senators interjected while he was speaking. He told them that he had not reached the points to which &#34;they referred. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> ;that I have been on my feet only a few minutes, and I suggest that he possess his soul in patience. This Government has a mania not only for rushing legislation through Parliament, hut also for establishing boards and commissions. Parliament now is working against the clock, mainly because the Prime Minister will be leaving for Great Britain shortly to attend the Imperial Conference. </para>

                            <para>- If the Government were true to its election promises, Parliament would remain in session during the Prime Minister&#39;s absence. The ex-Prime Minister, the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes, was regarded by many as an autocrat; but when he went to Great Britain Parliament did not go into recess; the business of the country was conducted under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook. Before the present Primo Minister left for Great Britain in 1923, Parliament was &#34; bludgeoned &#34; - .to quote the public press at the time - in order to pass necessary legislation. What happened then is being repeated to-day. We are asked to pass legislation in a hurry. Time after time this session, the Leader of the Senate has moved for the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders in order that certain bills might be passed without delay. Notwithstanding that all the legislation promised in the Prime Minister&#39;s policy speech has not been placed upon the statute-book, the business of Parliament is being rushed in order that the Prime Minister may go to England. I do not object to his presence at the Imperial Conference. I think that all the dominions should be represented at that conference, because matters of great importance to the </para>

                    <para class="block">Empire will be discussed there. But, in addition to the Prime Ministers, representatives of the Opposition in the various dominion parliaments should also attend the Imperial Conference in order that both sides of the nation&#39;s thought might be expressed. The Opposition appreciated the compliment paid to it, when the Government decided to include the Leader of the Opposition in another  place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> as a member of the delegation to the Fifth Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva. The precedent then established should be repeated in connexion with the Imperial Conference. The Assembly of the League of Nations is certainly a gathering of great importance; but so is the Imperial Conference, and the views of  His  Majesty&#39;s Opposition should be heard at it. The present Government is composed of members of the Nationalist and Country parties. </para>

                    <para>It may be said that I am reviving ancient history; but there are times when these matters ought to be. mentioned. Not long ago members of the Country party were violently opposed to the gentlemen with whom they are&#39; now associated. Before <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Page</inline> joined the Cabinet he was most hostile in his opposition to the Nationalists of that time. He moved no less than sixteen votes of no-confidence in the Nationalist Government, but because the County party was divided the Government won on each occasion. After the 1922 election, when the Nationalist party got a heavy set-back, negotiations were entered into between the Nationalist and Country parties for the formation of a composite Ministry. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Page</inline> was then, as it were, the king-pin. At the commencement of negotiations the Country party stipulated that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Page</inline> was  to be Prime Minister, otherwise no binding alliance would be undertaken, but merely a working arrangement. Eventually, the Country party gave way on that point.

It came into the political arena a young, vigorous party, determined, like the Labour party, to stand alone, paving its own way and carving its own destiny. But when the lure of office was held out to its leader, he fell. He thought more of office than he did of the fate of the party he was leading, and, as a result, his party was swallowed by the Nationalist wing of the Parliament.

In any case, the Government had at hand sufficient statistics and information to prove the necessity for a child endowment scheme without referring the matter to arbitration court judges. </para>

                            <para>- Of course; but pending the determination of the basic wage by the Arbitration Court the legislation for. child endowment could have been brought in. Some time ago, when the right honorable W. M. Hughes, as Prime Minister, appointed a royal commission to inquire into the basic wage he said that he would give effect to the recommendation of that commission, but when it submitted a unanimous report fixing a basic wage and the right honorable gentleman was confronted with his promise to put it into operation, he declined to do so. All he did- was to send a memorandum to the  chairman  of the commission. The present Government should have anticipated the fixing of a basic wage by introducing legislation for child endowment, which no doubt would have assisted the body appointed to determine the basic wage. </para>

                    <para>In regard to national insurance, all we know is that the royal commission is still inquiring. I am not alleging that it is in any way dilatory, but it has spent a considerable time in inquiring into a matter of great urgency and vast importance. And when one realizes that legislation dealing with national insurance is in force in other parts of the world, one must come to the conclusion that we might have reached finality in this regard long ere now. I believe that the commission has presented some interim reports. However, I am not blaming it. I blame the Government for not endeavouring to hasten its determinations. </para>

                            <para>- Although salaries and wages are higher to-day than they were in the pre-war period, their purchasing power has considerably diminished. The additional expenditure to which I have referred has not been occasioned by the payment of higher salaries and wages, but in other directions which I shall mention later. The present Treasurer, when a private member, complained of the numerous appointments being made, but he is now a member of a government which is making new and important appointments almost every week, and consequently increasing expenditure. The additional amount paid in salaries and wages to public servants is not a big factor in this connexion, but that incurred in meeting the cost of boards and commissions is enormous. Many of these boards and commissions have been appointed during the regime of the present Treasurer. A commission has recently been established to control development and migration, whilst the Department of Markets and Migration, which is already in existence, should be able to do all that is required. In these circumstances are we likely to return to a pre-war standard of finance? </para>

Commonwealth taxpayers are, therefore, carrying a burden of &#163;3,000,000 greater than they were when the present Treasurer was a private member.

Despite that compact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is still a member of a Cabinet that has imposed higher duties. My position on the fiscal issue is well-known.

I shall listen with interest to the honorable senator  when he addresses the Senate, in the hope  that I shall be able to ascertain his views on fiscal matters generally. The Customs revenue in 1922-23 totalled &#163;32,872,000, and in 1925-26 &#163;39,198,000, the increase being over &#163;6,000,000. This does not suggest that the tariff is protective so much as revenue producing. Certainly it has been responsible for a substantial increase in indirect taxation. </para>

                            <para>- According to the newspaper reports, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel stated that our defence system was in a precarious condition. The Labour party has been taunted from time to time with having no defence policy, but I venture to say that it would stand the closest examination of any unbiased military expert in the world. Since the signing of the armistice in November, 1918, successive Nationalist Governments have spent approximately &#163;40,000,000 on defence. What have they given us for that expenditure? Recently General Monash who, will be accepted as an authority on this subject, said we were less prepared for war to-day than in 1914. He also stated that our Air Force was a sham. The Labour party has been charged with having no defence policy. As a matter of fact, we have a very definite policy, especially as regards the provision that should be made for munitions. Part of our defence platform is the establishment of factories which, in times of aggression, may be converted for the manufacture of munitions. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel has told us that, if war found us, we could not last 24 hours. In other words, if a hostile army landed on Australian shores we should not have sufficient munitions to keep our forces in the field for. 24 hours. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. In seven and a half years Nationalist governments have succeeded in spending on defence &#163;40,000,000 of the taxpayers money, and to-day, according to the report of the Inspector-General, our military forces could not last 24 hours, in the face of an invading force. Some time ago ex-Senator . General Drake-Brockman said that we were not getting full value for the money we were spending on defence. Recently the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> made a scathing attack on the Government&#39;s defence policy. The Minister, when I read portion of it, endeavoured to show that the writer was not an authority on the subject. Since then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel has made a still more damning statement about our unpreparedness for defence. It is evident that for years the Government has been throwing away millions of pounds. In 1924 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash stated that the present system of compulsory training was farcical. Here, again, is the statement of a military expert. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> who did his &#34;bit&#34; during the war, will admit that Australia&#39;s untrained men proved to be admirable soldiers. Therefore, we are justified in assuming that, even without a system of compulsory military training, we would have the men available and, provided they had adequate supplies of modern munitions, they would be able to defend Australia. This Government, following the lead of earlier Nationalist governments, has wasted millions of pounds on defence and has nothing to show for it, yet Ministers have the audacity to condemn the Labour party for desiring to abolish a system of compulsory military training which has. proved to be useless. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> in an attempt to combat the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Chauvel, stated - </para>

We know full well that battleships become obsolete in a very short period. Science is constantly discovering improvements, and it frequently happens that, before a vessel has been completed, additional improvements have been devised. I admit that that argument can be applied also to submarines. Science is daily endeavouring to improve that arm of defence. Australia would need a navy as large as those of Great Britain and the United States of America combined to adequately protect its shores in the event of aggression. I shall quote  the remarks of prominent naval authorities in support of my contention that the day of the battleship has passed.

During the election campaign the composite party that comprises the Government stressed the point that it intended to make available a sum of &#163;20,000,000 over a period of ten years for road construction. Many persons at the time considered that that was an exceedingly generous offer. But no sooner was the Government returned to power than it was made manifest that there was a catch in the proposal. In the first place, the condition was imposed that the States should provide &#163;2,000,000 for every similar sum provided by the Commonwealth Government. That condition was subsequently reviewed, and the contribution of the States was lowered to 15s. for every &#163;1 contributed by the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth proposes to raise it for them. It is now intended to impose a duty on petrol, tires, and chassis to enable this Government to make good its promise to provide &#163;20,000,000. If that is not &#34; robbing Peter to pay Paul,&#34; what is it ? The Prime Minister, in his policy speech, said that the provision of good roads should be regarded as a national problem. I entirely agree with that sentiment. It naturally follows that the nation as a whole should find the money for the upkeep of our roads. The right honorable gentleman also stated that the money necessary to finance the scheme would be raised through the Customs Department; but he did not explain in what manner it was to be carried out. The majority of the people believed that the expenditure would be defrayed from ordinary revenue, not that one section of the community would be singled out to &#34;foot the bill.&#34; If the duty on petrol which has been introduced by the Government is agreed to by Parliament, the Standard Oil Company, the British Imperial Oil Company, and the Vacuum Oil Company will pass on the increase, and John Citizen will have to shoulder the burden. The proposed petrol tax is neither more nor less than a revenue-raising device. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that it would be right even in those circumstances. But if it is passed, a number of citizens in Australia will suffer. Already two of our States impose a petrol tax to enable them to raise revenue for the maintenance of their roads; they are the States of South Australia and Western Australia. As I view the matter, other persons in addition to the users of roads will be penalized. If it were confined to road users, there might be some equity in the proposal. The farmer, who uses petrol to drive his farm machinery, will be obliged to pay an increased price; and numbers of persons in other occupations will be similarly situated. This is really an invasion of one of the functions of the States, and in view of the fact that two of the States are already operating in this field, I can see no justification for it. </para>

                    <para>I now desire to make a few observations in relation to the condition of the gold mining industry in Australia, but particularly in Western Australia. The Government of that State has offered assistance to the mining companies. Those who have closely followed the affairs of the gold-mining industry are aware that it is in a very unsatisfactory state at the present time. It has been one of the greatest industries that Australia has had. Up to 1923 something like &#163;616,000,000 worth of gold was extracted from Australian mines, but during the past few years the industry has been gradually declining. In Kalgoorlie to-day the mines are closing down, and men are leaving the district to find work elsewhere. </para>
                    <para class="block">Glancing through the budget, I notice that &#163;217,000 was paid out by way of bounty to the wine industry during the last financial year, and that the iron and steel industry received assistance to the extent of &#163;242,000. Up to September, 1924, different industries were assisted by way of bounty to the extent of approximately &#163;5,000,000. </para>

I have always supported by voice and vote the payment of bounties, though it appears to me that practically every industry except the gold-mining industry is able to secure assistance from the Government. I do not lay the entire blame at the door of this Government, because its predecessor in office was approached, and declined to give assistance. </para>

I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Andrew</inline> that that amount could easily be disposed of in one portion of Kalgoorlie alone. It must be remembered that &#163;10,000 of that &#163;25,000 is allocated to the Northern Territory, leaving only &#163;15,000 for the remainder of Australia. That is a mere pretence at giving assistance to the mining industry. It was never intended to assist the industry as a whole, as the grant was specifically confined to prospecting in new areas. To show how mining, and especially gold-mining, has decreased in Western Australia, let me quote the following figures :  - </para>

                            <para>- I admit that there is a lot of low-grade ore, which, because of the high cost of production, is unprofitable to work; but a saving in overhead expenses would probably alter that. The Western Australian Government has made suggestions in that direction. The Commonwealth Government could assist the State Government in its efforts to get the best possible results from the gold that is there. During the tariff debate I endeavoured to secure a reduction in the duty on mining machinery, but the Government refused to grant it. </para>

                        <para>Briefly, the alarming and continuous decline of mining is attributable to the great increase in working costs since 1914, which precludes the treatment of any but high-grade ores. Of this increase the two principal causes are the war, with its general enhancement of prices, and the high Federal tariff. </para>

Not only is it untrue, but it i&#171; also unworthy of one who, for many years, whether rightly or wrongly, has occupied a high place in the public life of this community. I cannot imagine that those sentiments are shared by any member of the Federal Parliament, or by any considerable section of the people of Victoria. </para>
