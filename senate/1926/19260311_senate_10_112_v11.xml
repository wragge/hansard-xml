                        <para>- Can the Minister for Markets and Migration tell me if it is a fact, as stated recently in the press, that, after considerable delay, which was quite unnecessary, the Government of Queensland, on the eve of a State election, has decided to sign the Immigration agreement? I should also like to know what States are now standing out, or whether the scheme can be gone on with now that the Queensland Government has displayed some common sense by signing the agreement? </para>

                            <para>- Quite recently the Premier of Queensland informed me by telegram that he intended to sign the agreement, and accordingly it was forwarded . for his signature by the earliest mail. A few days ago I was pleased to learn through the press that he had signed it. The only States which have not yet signed the agreement are New South Wales and Tasmania, but I am very hopeful that, without much further delay, it will be signed by New South Wales, and wo shall then be in a position to get on with the necessary work of reconstruction in my department. </para>

                        <para>. - Before we adjourned last night I was dealing with a point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes.</inline> The honorable senator, during the course of his speech, had made the assertion that there is ample provision in the existing law to deal with the people contemplated to be dealt with by this bill ; but I think I showed definitely that there is no provision in the Arbitration Act to deal with them. The assertion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> has also been made by a great many other  members of the Labour party, both inside and outside Parliament; but the honorable senator is the first man to my knowledge who has produced definite evidence on which to base it. The evidence he has produced is section 5 of the Arbitration Act, but a mere cursory glance at this section last night was sufficient to show  that the honorable senator was entirely wrong in this- respect. It is rather amazing that a man with the honorable senator's undoubted intelligence should seriously make such an assertion in this chamber, and expect honorable senators to believe it. I could understand his getting away with it when talking to a ' collection of uninformed people of the type over whom he usually presides, but that he should have the effrontery to ask honorable senators to believe such twaddle is . beyond my comprehension. The honorable senator's speech was quite interesting.  His  delivery is attractive, and it is pleasing to listen to him. One can easily . understand- how he has attained the very high position he has reached in the industrial world, and  readily recognize how he' comes to exercise great sway in that arena. For that reason, it is incumbent upon him to be very careful in the statements he makos, both inside this chamber and in his union. A great responsibility rests on a member of Parliament who is the head of an organization comprising 130,000 Australian workmen. The men who listen to his statements are naturally not as informed on the. law as are honorable senators. They have not the opportunity that we have to obtain information, and, therefore, . they believe that the man who is at their head as presiding officer of the union is advising them correctly when he professes to be dealing with facts. The assertions made by SenatorBarnes and by other members of the Labour party, both in and out of Parliament, are deliberate camouflage to conceal the fact that they  take their instructions from outside organizations dominated by communists. Whether or not honorable senators opposite are really at sea as to the real issue at the last election, is doubtful ; but we are assured by Senators Needham, Graham, and Findley, and other honorable senators that deportation was the main issue. </para>

In . order to ascertain what the real question was, one must turn to the Prime Minister's policy speech, in which there was not a single reference to either Walsh or Johnson. Except in response to questions asked of the Prime Minister at the various meetings addressed by him, he never mentioned those individuals by name. </para>

                        <para>The Ministry is determined to defeat the nefarious designs of the extremists in our midst, and, armed with the mandate of the people, will take all necessary steps to accomplish this end. Although under our Constitution there is a King's peace of the Commonwealth which co-exists side by side with the King's peace within each of the States, up to this date in the history of Australia there has been little need for the Commonwealth to take  action .for its preservation. Generally speaking, the authorities and laws of the' States have been adequate to deal with what may be generally regarded as breaches of the King's peace. Recent happenings have clearly demonstrated the existence of actions prejudicial to the peace of the Commonwealth. The time has now arrived when the Commonwealth Parliament should exercise its powers and pass effective legislation to deal with offences against the peace of the Commonwealth, including action against those persons who are actively engaged in associations and propaganda work having as their object the overthrow of the Constitution, interference with Commonwealth activities, resistance to its laws, and generally taking part in unlawful  action  for the purpose of subverting external and internal commerce and intercourse in Australia. The paramount issue in this campaign is the maintenance of law and order, and the supremacy of constitutional government. </para>

                    <para>The' issue that was placed before the electors of Australia was clear, concise, and definite. It was repeated by every Nationalist candidate from every platform throughout the country. The issue was not the deportation of Messrs. Walsh and ' Johnson - they were not important enough for that. The matter of those two men was merely incidental to the determination of the Government to deal with men of that type. The mandate given to the Nationalist party on that issue is being carried out in Parliament to-day. This bill has been introduced in- consequence of the undertaking given by the Prime Minister that law and order would be maintained, and constitutional government upheld. When the Government resolved to deport Messrs. Walsh and Johnson on account of their actions in Australia prior to the election, there was great consternation in the hearts of a great many persons dominated by communists. I refer in the main to the whole of the Labour party. So concerned were they, that at the instigation of their masters, some of the principal members of the party, both in Parliament and out of it, met in Sydney to devise means whereby they could defeat the law, and the mandate that the Government had received. Included among them was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> who went- to Sydney to assist others in an attempt to defy the law, the Government, and the Constitution. </para>

We must judge them by their actions rather than their words. Anybody who is an avowed communist is ostentatiously thrown out of the Labour party ; but anybody who, while acting as a communist, refrains from declaring himself to be one. may remain in the party. The communist subscribes to the Labour platform, because the platforms of the communists and of the Labour party arn identical. The Labour party's object.ive is the socialization of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, and the platfrom  of the communists is stated in identical terms. </para>

                            <para>- It is unnecessary for me to go into the history of the changes in the platform of that party. The point I wish to make is that the objectives of the two parties, as declared by them, are identical. The only difference is that the Labour party avows that it will attain its objective by constitutional means, while the communists propose to attain it by any means, and particularly by force. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator says that he is not a communist, but he stands condemned out of his own mouth. In due course he will be called upon to answer to the people of Western Australia, and I am sure that they will deal with him when the time comes. The honorable gentleman has stated that he is prepared to defy any law of the Commonwealth that does not meet with his approval. If that is not revolution, I do not know what is. Where would the honorable senator draw the line? If a man does not want to pay taxes, all he need do, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> is to refuse to pay. Again, if a man does not like the law that provides penalties for stealing, he may with impunity defy it and steal another person's goods. This bill, he tells us, manufactures crime. The action of the communists in Australia has produced a state of affairs that makes it necessary for this Parliament to again define a further series of crimes and prescribe the punishment. In this respect we are doing what every Parliament in the Empire has always been doing, namely, making new laws for the protection of the community. No public man should do anything to undermine the authority of the law. Unfortunately, that has been done in this chamber, which is the highest tribunal in theland, and by those who claim to be leaders of the working-class movement in Australia. It is deplorable that leaders in the industrial sphere of the Commonwealth should give utterance to statements such as we have heard during the debate on this bill. </para>

Every person, poor or rich, is in the enjoyment of equal rights. And yet we hear this absurd talk about establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat. They tell us - I have heard it very often - that the poor have nothing to lose but their chains. </para>

                            <para>- Th e honorable gentleman is now abusive. He and other honorable senators opposite are not in a very comfortable position over this bill. Perhaps they are entitled to our sympathy. I honestly believe that many of them are under instructions from elsewhere to oppose it against their better judgment. Some, I believe, are honestly opposed to it, but others are absolutely dishonest in their opposition. They understand its purpose, but, at the dictation of people outside, they are opposing it. Only now and again do we find a man, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden,</inline> with sufficient courage to state his views fearlessly. No new principle has been introduced into this bill. It is the fundamental right of every sovereign State to say who shall come into, and remain within, its terri tory. That principle has been in existence for many centuries. In Great Britain it has been in existence ever since there has been a definite form of government there. It can unquestionably be said to be the fundamental right of sovereignty. It is the right upon which our policy of a White Australia is based. We are certainly not going to lessen that right in any respect. It is the principle that underlay the objection that was taken by Australia last year to the Geneva Protocol. If honorable senators peruse the measures that are upon our statute-book they will find that one of them is the Immigration Act, which asserts this very right - a right that has been constantly exercised under it. It is a further fundamental right of the Commonwealth to enforce its laws and to exact penalties for any breach of those laws. It is, moreover, the duty of the Government to enforce the law. It is also the duty of Parliament to provide penalties for a breach of any law. That is what this bill proposes to do. Every citizen has the right to object to any law, and he may, if he wishes, endeavour to induce the people to agree to its alteration. So long as the Labour party takes - up that attitude, it will be on firm ground. But immediately it begins to defy the law it will be on very dangerous ground. The Commonwealth has until recently invariably had the assistance of the States in its efforts to. enforce Commonwealth laws; the members of the Police Force in the various States were readily placed at the disposal of the Commonwealth until recently, when an appeal was unavailingly made to the Premier of Western Australia to allow the police officers of that State to assist in quelling trouble that occurred at Fremantle. </para>

The officials of the Commonwealth were unable to administer the law, because the Premier and the Government of Western Australia declined to supply the necessary police protection.

                            <para>- If that attitude is persisted in it may be necessary to establish a permanent" police organization under the control of the Commonwealth Government. It would be deplorable if the citizens of Australia were compelled to shoulder that additional expense; but if governments of the type of those in Western Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland, continue along those lines, it will become increasingly obligatory upon the taxpayers of Australia to make that provision. We are told bv honorable senators opposite that it is proposed to provide for the imposition of a double penalty. I think I am right in saying that in the British Empire the act of deportation has always been a political and not a judicial act'. There have certainly been occasions in Great Britain when deportation has been a portion of the sentence of the judiciary. But my view, which" is accepted throughout the Empire, is that that is fundamentally wrong, and that deportation is essentially a political act that ought not to be one of the duties of judicial officers. An excellent illustration of' that principle has been afforded in Western ' Australia and Queensland. During the course of the war the present Premier of Western Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collier)</inline> was prosecuted for a breach of a Commonwealth law before a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter,</inline> who was resident magistrate at Kalgoorlie. In the ordinary administration of the law, and upon the evidence that was adduced, he was found guilty and fined. He then announced that his turn would come, and that when it did he would dea) with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter.</inline> In the course of time he became the Premier of Western Australia. One of his first acts, if not the first, after his accession to that office, was to sack <inline font-weight="bold">Mr-. Walter,</inline> merely because, as a magistrate administering the law of the Commonwealth, he had performed his duty. </para>

                            <para>- I could quote several similar instances which illustrate the principle upon which Labour politicians work. Of all the Labour Premiers in Australia <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> is the mildest. Yet he took that action. Notwithstanding that fact, honorable senators of the Opposition argue that deportation should be a sentence of a court, and not the act of a government. Any offences that are committed under this legislation will be dealt with, not by judges of the High Court, who have a life tenure, and cannot be interfered with by politicians, but by the lesser State courts. I ask honorable senators to picture the results to these unfortunate individuals who give effect to the law if they dare to carry out its provisions, in view of what happened to certain magistrates in Queensland and Western Australia because they had sufficient courage to . administer the . law. Seeing that we have governments of this type in Australia from time to time, it becomes our obvious duty, if we desire that the law of the Commonwealth shall be administered justly, to relieve the lower courts of the responsibility of interpreting and applying it; for they are usually presided over by magistrates not protected by life appointments, who are liable to incur the hatred of this great Labour party, which preaches against victimization and practises it on every possible occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> was on firm ground in one statement that he made. He protested against the common practice of decrying everything Australian, and of alleging that Australia, being over-legislated for in her industrial arena, is in a constant state of industrial turmoil, and so is the  happy hunting ground for strike agitators. It is true, unfortunately, that many people do decry Australia. It is also true that the prevailing opinion in Great Britain is that Australia is in a more or less permanent condition of industrial turmoil. This is accounted for by the fact that some public men and newspaper writers here, who disagree with our policy of compulsory industrial arbitration and the various schemes for preserving industrial peace that are subsidiary to it, give wide publicity to every disturbance that occurs. 1, personally, am a great believer in arbitration. Australia has set out on a great experiment in this regard. I do not assert that she has passed beyond the experimental stage, but I do say definitely that the success that has attended- her experiment so far" justifies her in persevering with it. So far from it being true that we have more strikes here than any other industrial country in the world, the fact is otherwise. We have less industrial turmoil than any other country, with one exception. - This fact justifies us in continuing to develop our arbitration policy. I wish to point out that approximately four-fifths of our industrial disturbances occur in the coal mining and transport groups. </para>

                            <para>- BROCKMAN . - About 20 per cent, of our unionists, but less than 10 per cent, of the total number of our employees, are engaged in these industries. I am sorry . that I have not; the exact figures by me, but I shall take the opportunity of quoting them on another occasion. The disturbances in these two groups alone have created the feeling that Australia is always in a state of industrial trouble, and it is in them that the communists have so strongly entrenched themselves. They have done so because these are key industries, the operation of which profoundly affects the whole of our commercial life for good or ill. The commnnists have not fastened themselves very firmly to any other group of employees. It was the obvious duty of the Government to take steps to counteract the activities of the communists. I have prepared a good deal more matter on this subject, but I shall not use it just now. I desire to say, in conclusion, that the Government, having a full knowledge of the circumstances in Australia, would have failed in its duty if it had not presented this bill to us, and the great Labour party will fail to discharge the solemn obligation placed on it by the people whom it purports to represent here if it continues its resistance to the passage of the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- As one who has been associated with trade unionism since it first took root in Australia, I regret very much that there is necessity for the introduction of a bill of this character. Honorable senators opposite have been very weak in their opposition to the measure.In fact, I cannot remember weaker resistance by them to any bill. The reason for it, of course, is that they have no faith iu their own arguments, and that they know the introduction of the bill is justifiable. No one believes more than I. do in the constitutional methods that Labour has used in the past to achieve its ends, and I regret, that those who lead the movement , to-day have a tendency to adopt other methods, which threaten to destroy the whole fabric of our society. In the early days, the trade union movement was subjected to severe criticism., and its leaders to much persecution. I have been surprised to hear some honorable senators on this side of the chamber speak iu such glowing terms of the high ideals and objects of the Labour party of a few years ago. If they had been as broadminded then as they seem to be now, affairs would never have reached the present deplorable condition. Years ago. the great majority of. leaders in the trade union movement were persecuted iu every conceivable way. I speak from a good deal of personal experience. We were told at that time t&lt;&gt; seek to remedy our trouble by political instead of strike methods. The workers took their advice, and went into politics, with the result that time after time Labour majorities were returned to Parliament. Another result was that a big endeavour was made to settle strikes by means of arbitration. It took many years to convince some of the unionists that they should adopt arbitration for the settlement of disputes, and it took much longer to convince the public of Australia that arbitration was necessary, but finally, after a great deal of agitation and trouble, Arbitration Acts were placed on our statute-books. What has been the result ? To-day, owing to the misuse of the power given under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, we have a greater tyranny than previously  existed in Australia. In the days of voluntarism there were few strong unions in Australia. The strongest was what is now known as the Australian Workers' Union, but it had not anything like the numbers it has to-day. There was no union in Australia at . that time which embraced in its ranks all the employees in an industry. There were large numbers of free labourers or non-unionists - they were called other names, of course - and, until compulsory arbitration was instituted, all the strikes which occurred were broken by them. Through these strikes the workers experienced a great deal of suffering, with very little gain, and it was finally drilled into their minds, that they could obtain salvation only through the ranks of political Labour. When compulsory arbitration was provided for by law, it was followed by compulsory unionism, with preference to unionists. The key to the situation is preference to unionists. If we deprived the unions of preference to unionists, they would fade away to the weak condition in which they existed before compulsory arbitration. The unions owe their present strength to the legislation of this Parliament and other Legislatures in Australia, and not to their leaders, their organizers, or their numbers. It is the law which has built up the tyrannical organizations of to-day. Although I have been a unionist since boyhood, I have never been in favour of preference to unionists.I did not dislike joining a union, and I always did my best to persuade my fellow workers to join a union, but I have the strongest objection to the law stepping in and compelling me to do something to which I have conscientious objections. The whole trouble in the industrial world to-day has arisen out of the fact that, under the law passed by this Parliament, judges have given preference to unionists. No one can remain in a calling to-day unless he joins a union. </para>

                            <para>- What is that but preference to unionists ? Under our arbitration law every man engaged in an industry must become a member of  a  union, whether he likes it or not, and once he becomes a member he must continue in the union or starve. I do not blame the unions. Parliament has done this. The consequence is that inexperienced men, with no sense of responsibility, obtain the highest positions in the unions. In the early days the remunerationgiven to union leaders and secretaries was hardly a living, but to-day the officers of these organizations ride about in motor cars, and enjoy princely salaries, and because all the workers engaged in  a  particular industry are compelled to be members of their union they exercise  a  power greater than that of Parliament. They are responsible only to those who put them in their positions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Walsh's name has . been mentioned a good deal here. He did' not organize the Seamen's Union. I knew that union when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Sangster in Victoria, ex-Senator Bob Guthrie in South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jack</inline> Davies and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sam</inline> Smith, of New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charley</inline> Seymour, of Brisbane, were associated with it. That was before compulsory arbitration. The union did not then embrace half the seamen engaged on the coast, but now that the Arbitration Act compels every seaman or fireman to be a member of the union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Walsh has become mightier than the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. He can hold up the transport of this country in defiance of the law, and he gets the power to do so from the fact that this Parliament has passed an act which compels men to join unions or starve. Has arbitration prevented strikes ? It has not. Prior to the passing of the Arbitration Act there were not half the strikes there are to-day. Irresponsible men, wanting in sense and experience, lead their unions into strikes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Walsh has declared his reason for doing so. He wants to break down the capitalistic system. He does not bother about wages or hours. He simply wants to paralyze the capitalistic system by strikes. And he gets the  power to bring about a strike because every seaman on the coast must be a member of the Seamen's Union. If a man dares to take the place of a striker, we know what happens to him. It is idle to talk of Australian liberty. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> got his power,not because of his innate ability or initiative, but because if a strike is commenced no one dares to take the place of the strikers. As soon as a strike is settled, the man who takes the place of the striker is wiped out. That has recently been proved in New South Wales. In 1917 a loyalist union was formed to load our transports and get our ships away with food for pur soldiers at the front, but the Labour Government in power in the State recently passed an act to wipe the members of  this union out of existence. Where is the call for men to leave the ranks of their union even to serve the Government in a patriotic cause ? During the miners' strike in New South Wales the Victorian State Government started a mine, but as soon as the strike was over the non-unionists who worked in that mine were thrown on the scrap-heap. </para>

                    <para>SenatorREID. - That does not matter. I am giving the facts. All the condemnation of the actions of the Labour party and the union is due to the laws passed by this Parliament. If we want to settle these troubles, and restore industry in Australia to the position it previously occupied, we shall have to abolish preference to unionists. There is no alternative. When a strike is declared a man cannot be compelled to work, although the effect of the Commonwealth arbitration law is to compel every employee to join a union. If a workman refuses to do so he is called a " scab." The- wharf labourers, simply because they were afraid of being called " scabs " if they did not support the seamen in their strikes,- were dragged at the coat-tails of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh</inline> year after year until they became sick of him. Many times, against their better judgment and against the wishes of the majority of their members, they were forced into that position. Therefore, this Parliament, and not the Labour party, is responsible for any success that communism has achieved in </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia. I claim to know the opinion of the workers of this country, and I am not afraid of the communistic bogy. It is good window dressing, of course; the fact is that the law has built up huge industrial organizations which compel the workers to join them, and the communistsare using the position to advance their own ends. I do not . believe that 5 per cent, of the members of unions are communists, although the latter cause a lot of trouble by attending the union meetings, and bully-ragging any decent man who expresses an honest opinion. The law is at fault, as I have already said, because its effect has been to compel men to join the unions.  </para>

                            <para>- But. as I have already pointed out, arbitration awards have had that effect. I remember when the shearers were paid 15s. and 17s. 6d. a hundred. When they demanded £1. and succeeded in obtaining it, they thought they had scored splendidly.' As soon as the Arbitration Court- gave the Australian Workers' Union power to compel every shearer to join the union, the rate was increased from £1 to <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 5s. a hundred. That increase was obtained, not by virtue of the strength of the union, but because of the awards of the Arbitration Court.. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Parliament itself is responsible for the present' situation. I am apprehensive because the communists in the unions are doing what they can to upset the capitalistic system. It is only a pretence to say that they have been turned out. of the Labour party. They are in the unions which represent the strength of the Labour movement in Australia, and the extremists who pull the strings are, for the most part, the unmarried and irresponsible trade unionists who came into the enjoyment of the franchise when they reached the age of 21 years. That was another mistake made by the legislature of this country. The Australian Workers Union, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> is the  president,  has set a good example to all the other industrial organizations in Australia. It has always stood for arbitration, and, as far as the extremists have allowed it, the Australian Workers Union has never turned its back on that principle. The recent state of affairs in Queensland was referred to in the course of the debate yesterday. Gladstone for several weeks was the centre of a very serious industrial disturbance.  Finally the primary producers took the law into their own hands, for the simple reason that constitutional government had failed, and, clearing the communistsout of the district, carried on the work themselves. The movement spread subsequently to Bowen and to Cairns. I should like to know where it is going to end. </para>

I claim to know something of the means by which they have reached their present happy state, because in the earlier years of the Labour movement I worked for them. Everything was obtained by constitutional methods, and all rights and privileges now enjoyed by the workers of Australia can only be retained in the same way. I intend to support the bill, because I think it will strengthen the hands of the Government, and enable it to deal effectively with those extremists who are a menace, not only to the trade union movement, but to the Commonwealth.

The honorable senator knows also that the industrial leaders in Australia have nothing to fear from the bill so long as they keep within the law. I have not much to say about the deportation provisions of the bill, except that I would prefer to have, all offenders dealt with in Australia.

" Exploitation " is a full-sounding phrase that is calculated to make unionists wave the flag and yell " Hurrah !" It is a nice piece of camouflage. I wonder who will provide a definition of " exploitation " ! I expect it will be provided by the proletariat. Subsequently the whole of the camouflage was removed, and a comprehensive, straight-out statement was made. In 1921, at the Trades Hall in Brisbane, a further conference of the party was held. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> at that conference, made one of his famous speeches in opposition to the red-raggers. He had made similar speeches on previous occasions, but, when the screw was put on him, he became a rubber stamp. Throughout his career, although he frequently spoke against the red-raggers, he always gave them everything that they wanted. In passing, I should like to say that on one occasion he fought the parliamentary caucus, and a split occurred. He and his Ministers walked out of the party room, expecting that that action would induce his critics in the party to again fall in behind him. It had the contrary effect .; those who were left behind immediately proceeded to elect a fresh Cabinet. So alarmed were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> and his followers that they rushed back into the caucus and regained control of it.

The experience that I had gained showed me that communists were entering the industrial movement, and white-anting it. They were becoming such a power behind the political party that it had not a soul to call its own. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> was compelled to back down whenever he put up a fight against them. The honorable senator cannot point to one Labour man in Australia to-day who has been sufficiently strong to fight the trade unions. I fought them right to the last, until 1 was beaten in the executive and in the committees. I then left them fairly and squarely. When the honorable senator " ratted " on this country during the war. I came into the open, and spoke mv mind. It was he who " ratted " not only on Australia, but on civilization and the Empire. I would fight him again on the same issue. </para>

On the other hand, I have no regrets for what I did on behalf of the Labour movement. It was a necessary movement, because of the tyranny of the employing classes in the early days. I am in favour of .every law that it placed on the statute-book. My great desire is to see the law administered and order maintained in a constitutional .way. If Labour departs from constitutional methods its opponents will' also do it, and we shall have a state of chaos in the country. </para>

                    <para>SenatorREID. - That the honorable senator will not admit the existence of danger shows his lack of foresight or his ignorance of the situation. I believe that in his heart of - hearts he knows that the communists are a danger. Their strength is in the fact that unionism in this country is compulsory. The communists are compelled to join trade unions in order to get a living, and they use the unions to serve their own ends, who frighten every Labour government in Australia. If the Labour party had the moral courage to denounce the communists, they would help trade unonism, and. this legislation would be unnecessary; but they lack the courage. </para>

                            <para>- They did not. In the old days unionism was voluntary, but today it is compulsory. Every working man is- forced to join a union and contribute to its funds. If we were to abandon our policy of preference to unionists the whole thing would collapse. In consequence of the tyranny that trade union leaders are practising in some instances I think that there is a great likelihood that the people of Australia will some day rise up and sweep away preference to unionists. They are tired of the great public inconvenience that unwisely organized strikes cause throughout the country. The transport strike, a little while ago, paralysed' industry throughout the Commonwealth just as the Queensland railway strike paralysed it in that State. I can well remember the time when there were hardly half a dozen unionists in the Queensland railway service. The only crafts that were represented were boiler-making and carpentry. But to-day the union movement has grown so strong under government protection that it is the " boss " of ibe Government. It dictated its own terms during the railway strike, and even named the date on which trains would resume running. </para>

                            <para>- But it collapsed, whereas the strikers in Queensland compelled the Government to eat out of their hands. When the strike was ending in Queensland the union leaders, after having been granted all that they asked for in the way of stop-work meetings and so on, informed the Government representatives that a meeting of the committee would be called on the following Thursdaynight to decide the day on which trains would resume running. The men decided to begin work the next week. That was nothing but trade union tyranny. Hundreds of men who are now members of trade unions would never have come near the unions if they had not been compelled by law to do so. Among the Queensland railway strikers - I speak principally of the old employees, most of whom I know personally - there are many who were opposed to the strike. At first the public of Queensland was with the strikers. The members of the Cabinet entirely alienated the sympathy of the public, for, after having reduced their own salaries and the wages of the civil servants generally by 5 per cent., they restored their own emoluments to the full figure, and also those of the higher classes of the civil service, but did nothing for the poorer paid men. That is what a Labour Government will do. But the unionists entirely lost public support by the tyrannous policy that they adopted. They treated a weak Government and Premier with absolute contempt. The railway strike, and the shipping strike caused such widespread antagonism to the Labour party in Queensland that supporters of tins Government swept the polls, with one exception, at the election last November. Queensland returned only one Labour man, and if the campaign had lasted another month he also would have been defeated. </para>

                            <para>- No one can deny that the doings of Walsh, and Johannsen caused thousands of people who have hitherto voted Labour to vote for the Government, with the result that the Labour party in Queensland, so far as representation in Federal politics is concerned, was almost wiped out of existence. </para>

                            <para>- He was only a side issue. The people of Australia generally showed their common sense by voting for the National party. They knew that they had to do so in order to protect their rights. There was a large Labour majority on the Brisbane City Council, but when the Labour Government extended the boundaries of the city to a radius of 13 miles, and made the city the largest in the world in point of area, many property holders were in a terrible funk. They thought that there would be a Labour majority in the enlarged council, and that their property would suffer. Without being egotistical, I claim to know something about the workers of Australia, and I told the people I met in Brisbane just prior to the Greater Bris bane Council election not to worry. I pointed out that in politics the average Labour man always thinks he is going to get something from the fat man, and is always reaching out to get something for nothing, but that in municipal matters affecting his own little home, which is liable to be taxed on its unimproved value, he is not too anxious to allow taxation to b'e assessed by his fellow Labour men. The result of the elections was exactly what I thought it would be. Only four or five Labour councillors were returned. One of the greatest safeguards against revolution that we have is the fact- that the average worker is possessed of a little home of his own, and whenever Labour wants to put its hands into his pockets and take money out, there is trouble. That is the principal reason why nearly all the Labour candidates who sought election to the Greater Brisbane Council were defeated, and at the following Federal election every Labour candidate but one was defeated . </para>

                        <para>. - I shall be very brief in my reply, but during the debate there have been one or two rather amusing incidents to which I wish to refer. First of all, we had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> discovering mares' nests. In an endeavour to hold up the Crimes Bill to ridicule, he found a clause in it dealing with straying stock, and said, " Fancy the Nationalist Government making that a crime !" Unfortunately for the honorable senator it was' made a crime by a Government of which he was a member. The provision to which he referred was not in the bill, but in the principal act which ' was passed when he was Assistant Minister for Defence. Apparently, he had forgotten that interesting fact. Next we had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> saying  that he did not believe in deportations.  His  words were echoed by other honorable senators opposite. Again they were unfortunate, because they were supporters of the. Government that passed the Immigration Restriction Act, which provides not only a penalty for certain crimes, but also for deportation in addition- to a penalty. That act has been on our statute-book for years. It was passed by a Labour Government. It declares that if a man within three years of his entry into Australia is convicted of a. criminal offence, he may be deported; and, under it, over 60 white people who have committed crimes against: the laws of the Commonwealth and the States have been deported, some of them by Labour Governments. Yet honorable senators opposite say that they are totally opposed to deportations. They have been quiescent for a long time. They have been a long time discovering that they are against deportations. They declaim against the imposition of double penalties; yet Labour Governments have been imposing them. Europeans have been dealt with by the courts and imprisoned, and, subsequently, deported by Labour Governments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has apparently forgotten this. He was also unfortunate in referring to the electioneering incident in which I took the opportunity to draw the attention of the electors of Western Australia to a photograph in which he figured prominently. The facts may be interesting to the Senate. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This was a photograph of members of a conference which assembled in Sydney, and I drew public attention to it because at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> was busy assuring the electors of Western Australia that he had nothing at all to do with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden,</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden</inline> was an opponent of the Labour party, and had as such stood at the recent New South Wales elections, at which he had polled only a very few votes. In reply I directed the attention of .the electors of Western Australia to the fact that this was a photograph of a conference at Sydney, the members of which had ..'iven it out to the press that they had met to draw up plans so that if the Nationalist Government attempted to give effect to a law, which had been passed by this Parliament, by deporting persons who were then instigating and carrying on the British seamen's strike, its attempt to do so would be defeated. In the photograph appear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham, Mr. A.</inline> E. Green, the member for Kalgoorlie in another place; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Beasley,  president  of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, a declared communist; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> Garden, secretary of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, also a declared communist; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holloway,</inline> of the Melbourne Trades Hall, and one or two others. I said to the electors of Western Australia that it was singular that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> should assert that he and his party -had no connexion with communism and refused to associate with communists, when this photograph, taken two months prior to the election, indicated  that he and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Green,</inline> two Labour members, were actively co-operating with communists to devise means by which the Commonwealth Government could be defeated. I am therefore rather surprised that the honorable senator should have mentioned this incident. </para>

                                also said that we had a tendency on this side to exaggerate industrial troubles and make it appear that there was a tremendous  loss of time in Australia arising out of industrial disputes. This sort of talk, he explained, would give Australia a bad name throughout the world.

                                has effectively dealt 'with that agrument. He has pointed out that there is not a great deal of lost time, and that there are not many industrial disputes among the great mass of the trade unionists of Australia, but that the point we make is that an insignificant minority of trade unionists in this country is responsible for the overwhelming majority of the disputes and for most of the loss of time occasioned by them .

                    <para>This bill is aimed, not at the great mass of trade unionists in Australia, nor at the trade union leaders of this country, but at that insignificant minority of revolutionary leaders - those law-breakers who have been responsible for the overwhelming majority of the industrial disturbances we have had in Australia during the last few years. Then we had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> saying that the mandate the Government was given at the last election was obtained by the unscrupulous tactics of the Nationalist- party. I should 3ay that we are the veriest novices, .as compared with our friends opposite, in the use of unscrupulous tactics. It is indeed a case of the pot calling the kettle black when our friends, who brought out that notorious Fascisti letter, with all its inaccuracies, which was so easily exposed because of its clumsiness, talk about unscrupulous tactics. Fancy the party responsible for the allegation about the raid on the <inline font-style="italic">Labour Daily</inline> newspaper office in Sydney talking of unscrupulous tactics ! </para>

                        gallantly dashed into the arena industriously waving a red flag in an attempt to divert the bull's attention to himself. Unfortunately for

                        failed to divert him from his course, and

                    <para>I was surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Reid  saying that to some extent communism was a " bogy." To show honorable senators that it is by no means a. " bogy," I shall quote one fact only. One of the Labour candidates for the Senate in New South Wales was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> Grant. He had formerly been a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, an organization stigmatized by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> Premier of New South Wales, as being 75 per cent, criminal. He had been convicted before a judge and jury of carrying out acts of sabotage, which are laid down in the plan of campaign of the Industrial Workers of the World, and he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Subsequently he was released on the report of a royal commission appointed by a Labour Government. This gentleman was chosen as one of the Labour candidates for the Senate at the last election. The Labour organi zation of the State issued an appeal to its followers to give their first preferences to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> We all know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has been in the public life of Australia for very many years. He is the leader of the Labour party in the Senate, and I take it he is also  deputy  leader of the Labour party as it is organized to-day. Notwithstanding the appeal to supporters of Labour to give their first preferences to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> more than 25,000 electors in New South Wales gave their first preferences to the ex-" I.W.W." criminal, Donald Grant, and not, as they were requested to do by the Labour organization, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline></para>

                        <para>Zinovieff, the  Chairman  of the Third (Com- . munist) International, in a speech lasting many hours at the Congress of the International in Moscow, devoted particular attention to Great Britain. </para>
                        <para>It was necessary, he declared, immediately to concentrate special efforts on every sphere of British activity, because the trade union movement had taken a revolutionary turn which recalled Chartism. This was not yet communism!, but it had created a favorable atmosphere for the infusion of communism, so they must seize the opportunity and adopt every possible means of creating a.' really great British Communist party. The congress has formed a special British commission for the handling of British problems, with the Finnish communist, Kussinen, as  chairman.  The members of this commission include the most active of the Russian communists - Zinovieff, Bukharin, andRaskolnikoff - the Japanese Katayama, the Canadian Bruce, the Australian' Monteliore - </para>
                        <para class="block">I pause here to interpolate that a gentle man rejoicing in. the name of Montefiore attempted to enter Australia last year, but, because of information that had reached the Government in regard to him, he was refused his passport, and was not allowed to land. This incident has a bearing on the speech I am quoting - and representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Czecho-Slovakia, Norway, Bulgaria, and Poland. The task of the commission is to consider present British conditions in all their bearings and draft a special programme,, arrangements for the carrying out of which are to be made by the British delegates Stuart, Macmanus, Wilson, Douglas, and! others, under the direct, superintendence of. Moscow. Zinovieff informed, the congress that, in view of the present influence of Great Britain, " when we have expanded the British Communist party to mass dimensions, we shall already have conquered half Europe." The congress endorsed the view expressed by Zinovieff, and decided that the International must cultivate the fruitful, British, field more than any other until the British Communist party has- become a real power, dominating the trade unions and the whole of the Labour movement. </para>

The communists, although: few in number, were by their energetic efforts rapidly obtaining power within the trade unions. Murphy declared that the only way to conquer the British labouring classes was to work within the existing organizations of the Labour party. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators opposite have submitted an amendment by which they wish to show that they are not against legislation dealing with unlawful associations, but are opposed to the rest of the bill. What a hypocritical attitude for them to adopt! The meaning underlying it is that, in order to save their faces, before the great electorate that has recently passed judgment upon the communists in Australia, they say-,. " We are against unlawful associations, but we are not against unlawful acts:You can' do- any of the things that the unlawful associations advocate doing, so long as, you do them as individuals. The only thing- that is wrong is to combine to do them. You can carry on sabotage^, and you can plot to  overthrow the Constitution by force. We will not agree to make those acts crimes, nor will we penalize you for doing them. We will not favour deportation for those offences." </para>

                            <para>- That is the attitude of honorable senators opposite. What hyprocrisyr: If it is wrong to form an association to advocate the- overthrow of constituted authority by force, it is just as wrong to take that stand as an individual. If it is wrong in the one case, it is equally so in the other. Unlawful associations are at the back of the revolutionary strikes that have been experienced recently in Australia. The communists and! the I.W.W. . were responsible for the seamen's strike. The Labour party will support the Government in legislating against unlawful  associations, but it will not uphold it in dealing with individuals guilty of carrying out the principles advocated by unlawful associations. </para>

The Leader of the Senate described our non-opposition to the provisions dealing with unlawful associations as hypocrisy. He said that, whilst we were objecting to punishment for membership of an unlawful association, we were in favour of individuals doing unlawful acts. The right honorable gentleman has a very fertile imagination. It appears to be futile for honorable senators on this side to reiterate that they are opposed, not only to unlawful association, but also to unlawful acts by an individual. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that if I think a law is unjust, I will break it, and take the consequences. I am not receding from the position which I took up in the second-reading debate, simply because of criticism this afternoon. We should have sufficient courage to deal with all offenders in Australia. Under our immigration law, we can prevent  the entry of certain criminals and persons suffering from infectious diseases. Why should we unload our undesirables on the people of any other country? If necessary, we should impose a heavier penalty for offences against the law, but we should deal with law-breakers within Australia, and not by deportation. </para>

                        <para>- I am endeavouring to address myself seriously to an important issue. A distinction has been drawn between a citizen who was not born in Australia, and an Australian native. Why should a man who was born overseas be treated differently from a man who was born in Australia if they are both members of an unlawful association ? I cannot see any reason for it. Should not the Fascists be considered an unlawful association ? We are continually being told by the Government that it stands for law and order and constitutional government, and that it has received from the people a mandate to govern Australia along those lines. Can it not, therefore, function without the assistance of a semimilitary body such as the Fascists? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> ridiculed the suggestion that the British Fascists have a command in Australia, and that its commanding officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hatcher,</inline> is a member of the Commonwealth Public Service. It may be as well for me to read the form of enrolment adopted by the British Fascists in Australia. It is as follows: - </para>

During the twelve years which ended on the 31st December last, no fewer than 48 white persons were deported under the provisions of that act. There were 27 Germans, 16 British, 1 Lithuanian, 1 American, and 3 Italians. The honorable senator will thus see that it is rather late in the day for him to take exception to a law which for years has been administered by Labour as well as other governments. It does not follow that everybody who has been found guilty of an offence will be deported. For a comparatively minor offence, there would not be deportation. Where a person was evidently an undesirable citizen, deportation would probably be ordered. I do not know what the British Fascists stand for, but if the members of that organization -contravene this law they will be as liable as members of the Industrial Workers of the World or the Communist party. The document which the honorable senator read indicated to me that it stands for the upholding of the Constitution, not for its disruption. </para>

That statement has been made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, andby the Minister in charge of the bill in another place. It would not have been made if there had not been evidence which in the opinion of the Government was sufficient to justify it. I am astonished, therefore, that the Government did not long ago take steps to deal with those who are seeking the overthrow of constitutional authority in this country. I said during my second-reading speech, that the only evidence was <inline font-style="italic">that</inline> a man whose name began with " Z " had advocated openly that ail Russians should be linked up in Australia with the object of starting a revolution here, and, according to the Government, that man had been deported long ago. There cannot be many revolutionary Russians in Australia to-day, because, according to the Leader of the Senate, the Government has for some time prevented Russians with revolutionary tendencies from entering Australia.Under those circumstances, I regard the clause relating to unlawful associations as so much camouflage. The Government has to save its face, because it made so many incorrect and alarming statements during the election campaign. </para>

I could set up a perpendicular " I " in the same way if I desired to do so-; but I shall content myself with saying that I believe as firmly as any man in industrialism, and I want toprotect trade unionism. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know about that; if they accept it, why should they be excluded from the party ? It is quite clear, from the remarks made by the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> that, even if this proposed new sub-section becomes law, men and women may without let or hindrance continue to advocate communistic doctrines in Australia, without making themselves liable to punishment. It is only when they seek to use force that they will become liable. It seems to me to be ridiculous to suggest that, because a very small section of the community advocate the overthrow of our present social order by violence and sabotage, we are in . grave danger. Honorable senators opposite have seriously said in the last few days that, although the circumstances of the working classes in Australia are better than exist in any other country, and although many of our people own their own homes and have fairly substantial banking accounts, they are likely to join in a revolution that may result in dispossessing them of everything that they have struggled hard to obtain. Our people are not likely to throw away thoughtlessly the millions of pounds that they have deposited in our savings banks and to sacrifice the advantages that have been won through generations of effort. If honorable senators were to make those statements to any assembly of working men, they would be told to go home and develop some common sense. The working people of our community undoubtedly desire reforms; but they advocate the attainment of them . by constitutional means, and not by revolution. It is well known that in every organization there are a few wild spirits. They are associated indirectly with the National party as well as with the Labour movement. We have frequently heard it said by supporters of the Nationalist party that it would be a good thing for the country if all our parliaments were abolished. </para>

                                <para>- That is 'not my fault. I am endeavouring to point out that the unlawful associations which we have heard so much about are purely imaginary, and that, therefore, this proposed new sub-section' is unnecessary.. Before the last election the Government sounded an alarm bell throughout Australia, and its supporters joined in a hymn of hate of the Labour party. They- created a false atmosphere. There are no unlawful associations that' we need to worry seriously about, despite all that has been said in that regard. </para>

                            <para>. -  The form of application for membership in the British Fascists contains the following headings: - Name, address, occupation, age, former service (with separate columns for branch of service, rank, period of service, and decorations), married, place of birth, nationality of father, nationality of grandfather, religion, do you own a car, can you drive  a  car, remarks, subscription, donation, signature, date. It also contains the following note: - Cheques,&amp;c., payable to honorary treasurer, J. O. Hatcher, trust account. The imprint is " Bussau and Company, printers, 289 Little Lonsdalestreet, Melbourne." I suggest that if  the  Government has an earnest desire to disband unlawful associations it should deal with this semi-military body which  has  been formed, so we are told, with the object of assisting in the administration and enforcement of the law. We have been told that the Government has no power to disband unlawful associations,  and  it seems that it must be so, for the branch of the British Fascists that has been formed in Australia has not been interfered with. So far as I have been able to ascertain, it is formed on the same lines as the Italian Fascisti. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pleaded ignorance of its existence, but his simplicity in the matter amazes me. As a matter of fact, I believe that he knows all about it. I understand that this body has been allowed  to  direct its members to obtain arms and munitions in order that they may be equipped to assist the Government if any trouble should arise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has suggested that I am a communist because I . have* appeared in a photograph with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden.</inline> Heunblushingly told the Senate that he had featured this fact during the election campaign.

                                <para>- The conference I attended was endeavouring not to break any law of the Commonwealth, but to bring about industrial peace, which the Government made no attempt to do during the British seamen's strike. Furthermore the law of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is speaking has since been declared invalid, illegal, and unsound; and therefore the charge against me fails. I was busy at that time along with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Green,</inline> the member for Kalgoorlie,  and others in an attempt to bring about industrial peace. </para>

This provision deals with unlawful associations. There are no more unlawful associations in Australia to-day than there were six or soven  years ago. If they are a menace to Australia, why has not the Government taken action against them long ago? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has admitted this afternoon that these associations are in existence. He declares that he knows their strength. It is a change of front on his part. A few days ago he was saying that Labour had not taken action in regard to communists, and yet he now admits that we have taken action against them. The right honorable senator knows perfectly well that at a conference held in Melbourne in October, 1924, it was determined that communists should not belong to the Labour party. He knows that similar action was taken by the State Labour conference in Western Australia, and by a conference of the British Labour party in 1925. </para>

                                <para>- The clause with which we are dealing also refers to free speech. I remember the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> openly preached republicanism. He was not a supporter of a limited monarchy; he was a republican, and as' big a red-ragger  as there was in Australia at that time. A republic would mean the overthrow of the existing form of constituted government? If I were to advocate that we should cut - the painter, and have a republic in Australia, it would be unlawful on my part, and if I were a member of an organization that advocated the overthrow of constituted government in this way I should come under this provision of the bill. About twenty years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was advocating republicanism and the brotherhood of man. </para>

No Government worthy of the name should be afraid of the people of Australia speaking their minds. Advanced leaders of thought who spoke their minds freely years ago were the real founders of the social system of to-day  and it is quite possible that there are today people of advanced thoughts who should be allowed to speak their minds freely with the object of still further improving our social system. Surely this Government with its great mandate does not need the flimsy pretext of a bill of this character to enable it to handle affairs. This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> talked about camouflage. </para>

                                <para>- A few years ago we had a Republican League in Australia, and some of our most prominent ' citizens were associated with it. The head of it was the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> L. Purves, Q.C., once  president  of the Australian Natives Association. If we compare this bill with the resolutions which were carried at a specially convened conference of this league at Albury we shall find that the objects of this organization, although it was not advocating sabotage or revolution as some people understand it, were revolutionary so far as Australia was concerned. We should have had a republic in Australia, as opposed to a monarchical form of government, if that organization had been successful. At that time the present High Commissioner in Loudon supported republicanism. </para>

A person might in all innocence offer for sale a publication containing something which, in the opinion of the Government, would make the primer and seller liable under this bill. We are informed that a paper known as the <inline font-style="italic">Workers' Weekly</inline> is published in Sydney. It is alleged that it contains no- advertisements, and' the suggestion ]m! aide by Ministers and their supporters is that that publication is financed from, an, outside source. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> would have some people believe that it is financed from Moscow. I have seen that newspaper exposed for sale, but never having purchased a copy I am not ' conversant with the nature of the matter published in- it. Some members of the Ministry, and some of their supporters, however, boldly state that they regularly subscribe to it. Is their object to obtain information that will be of assistance to them, or axe they so interested in the articles printed in that journal that they are haK way to  conversion to communism ? The bill contains nothing to prevent the pub:lication of that newspaper unless it advocates the alteration of the existing, social order by means of revolution or sabotage. Since Ministers, apparently, have kept themselves well informed regarding that newspaper, have they at any time noticed in its columns, articles advocating the overthrow of constitutional authority? </para>

The Government therefore officially recognizes the publication,, and it may be taken for granted that at no time has it contravened the law of the Commonwealth. If it has done so, the Government has been negligent of its duties. It is darkly hinted that in all- probability the . <inline font-style="italic">Workers' Weekly</inline> is financed from Moscow; but I point out that money can only, be sent from Moscow to Australia through established financial institutions. </para>

During the war period a certain organization was, according to the government of the day, a menace to the peace, order and good government of Australia, and legislation was introduced to deal specifically with it. This bill, however, applies to all and sundry organizations-. One would think that constitutional government was within the danger zone. The Government, I know, has to present a bold front in order to justify itself in the eyes of the people. Ministers claim that the Government has a mandate for this class of legislation. I deny that claim. The provisions of this bill were never placed before the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>.. -  I should like te know if the bill contains any provision, for an appeal against the imposition  of  a penalty. Clause 10 states that amy proceeding in respect of an offence against the act, although declared indictable-,  may,  in certain circumstances, and with the consent of the defendant, be heard and determined by a. court of summary jurisdiction.. Under the sub-clause under discussion the person convicted may be imprisoned for a period not exceeding two years, and, in addition, if he was not born in Australia, may be deported. There should be the right of appeal. Recently a man was sentenced by one of the State courts to two years' imprisonment for an .offence. After he had commenced to serve his term his counsel appealed to the Supreme Court, which quashed the conviction. </para>

In his second-reading speech the honorable senator said, in reference to the soldier whom he had in mind - </para>

                    <para>His widow could not get a pension because, under the present system, pensions are not payable to the widows of soldiers who lived a certain time after their return from abroad. . Later, he said -  </para>
                    <para>If this man had died earner, his widow would have received a pension, but because he lingered a little longer than tha specified period, she has been deprived of. that right. </para>
                    <para class="block">The act does not contain any provision of the nature alleged by the honorable senator. Regulation 89i provides that a living allowance may be granted to the widow of a returned soldier who has died from causes unrelated to war service within three years of his discharge. At the present time 165 widows - are receiving a living allowance under that provision. The widow of any soldier whose death was due to causes arising from his war service is entitled to a pension regardless of whether he himself was drawing a pension, and of the time that elapsed between his discharge and his death. </para>

The pension payable to widows is fixed at not less than £2 7s. a fortnight, but it may be increased, at the discretion of the Repatriation Commissioners, to <inline font-style="italic">£A</inline> 4s. a fortnight, and the majority of the widows of soldiers are in receipt of that amount, in addition to a certain allowance for each child. Section 40 of the. act contains the provision that claims cannot be granted after the expiration of seven years unless the soldier was, at the time of his death, receiving a pension. The royal commission on repatriation recommended the amendment of that provision., and that has been done by regulation.' It can, therefore, be said that there is not now any time limit, the only requirement being that the death was caused by disabilities due to war service. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> said that his proposal would not involve a very great sum. Anybody who1 gives the matter the slightest thought, however, must see that in course of time the additional expenditure would be considerable. Our experience would probably be similar ito that of the United States of America, which, according- to the latest figures that I have been able to obtain, is paying pensions to 362.277 civil war soldiers and ito. 286.080 widows of civil war soldiers, despite the fact that that war was fought 80 years ago. The article from which I have abstracted those figures states - </para>

                    <para class="block">Girls of seventeen or eighteen years of age married veterans who had reached the age of 70 or 80 years, rendering it possible for them to draw pensions for 50, 60, and even 70 years. I am quite satisfied that a similar experience is not desired in Australia. Nobody begrudges the amount which the Commonwealth is paying by way of pensions. It may not be out of place to remind honorable senators that the expenditure on pensions is at present £7,000,000 a year, and on other repatriation benefits an additional £1,000,000 a year. Those sums represent one-eighth of the total expenditure of the Commonwealth. There is no doubt that if this amendment were made to the act our expenditure would increase enormously, and- continue for ' a greater number of years than it should. In dealing with claims the commission gives every consideration to widows. New claims are still being received, and in many instances granted, from widows whose husbands did. not claim a pension on .their own behalf. It is very difficult to deal with those cases where the presumption is either that the husband was not very ill, or that he had not a good claim. There are cases in which, for some reason or other, the soldier did not make a claim, and upon his death his widow found herself unprovided for, and had .to apply for a pension. Where it has been established that a soldier's death was in any way due to his war service the claim has been admitted and the pension paid. T trust that the Senate will reject the. bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret the opposition of the Government to the bill. The Minister has placed a wrong construction uponSenator' Gardiner's intention. That honorable senator did not want pensions to be given to widows <inline font-style="italic">ad- lib</inline> . , or to flappers of seventeen years of age who married elderly soldiers, and in a short while became widows. The object which he had in view was quite  a simple one, and it should have the support of honorable senators. The bill proposes that every widow of members of the forces shall receive a pension of not less than £2 7s. a fortnight. </para>

                            <para>- Either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> did not hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> correctly, or he is misinterpreting his speech. Many pf those widows who are at present receiving a pension draw less than <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 7s. a fortnight.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> pointed out that even <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 7s. is quite inadequate. With the addition of the allowance for children, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> referred, a widow is not receiving too much. That is one of the points which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had in view. The purpose of the act is to grant pensions to widows and dependants of soldiers under certain conditions. One provision is that the soldier must have died as the result of war ' disabilities. Trouble has been experienced in deciding what a war disability is. The commission itself has sometimes misconstrued the meaning of the term. Every man who enlisted for service overseas was, prior to embarking, medically examined and declared to be sound and in good health If upon his return to Australia he was in ill-health, surely that must have been the result of his war activities! </para>

It was said at that time that every man who went overseas to help the Allied cause, whether as a soldier in the ranks, or as a munition maker in England, would receive every consideration and assistance on his return; and that his dependants, in the case of his death, would be paid a pension. Surely every man who went yonder to make munitions helped to win the war. Munition makers were just as important as soldiers in the trenches. </para>

                            <para>- I pin my faith to the promises that were made during the war to the men who served the country abroad. According to a statement made by the then Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> on the 19th March, 1918, there were something over 55,000 deaths among the 415,000 odd soldiers who had enlisted ' at that date. It is reasonable to assume that approximately 8,000 or 9,000 wives have since lost their ex-soldier husbands. </para>

                        <para>. - The bill, in my opinion, is  cruderly  drafted, and I am surprised that an honorable senator with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> long political experience should have introduced it in this form. If I understand its purport, it is to pro- vide a pension for the- widow of every ex-soldier irrespective of whether his death was caused by war service, or a disability aggravated by war service. Returned soldiers claim fair, just, and reasonable consideration for their comrades in distress, but I do- not think that they have ever asked for or would favour legislation of this character. It is not fair, reasonable, or just. The intention of the Australian people in regard to pensions for soldiers- and their dependants was- generous, and unmistakable; and, although the working of the Repatriation Act has at times been slow, and cumbersome, on the whole our ex-soldiers have had a fair deal. I had hoped to get details of the specific case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in introducing, the bill, but I have been unable to do. so. May I suggest to the honorable senator that the best course for him to take to help- the person he had in mind is to refer the matter to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League, of which I am proud to be a member. If the claim has any substance in it, the officers of the league will press it until justice is done. To ask the people of Australia- to pay pensions to the widows of all returned men, irrespective 'of' whether death was or was not due to war service, is preposterous. It would be just as reasonable to ask for pensions for the widows of every policeman and civil servant. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> moved to amend the Repatriation Act to provide for the' payment of a minimum pension of £4 4s. a fortnight to the widows of ex-soldiers entitled to a pension, I should have supported him, for I have been fighting for that for a long time. At present the minimum pension ' is <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 7s. a fortnight, although I believe that in most cases it is brought up to £2 2s. a week. I have not had a lengthy political experience, but, if I may apply a billiards phrase to this bill, I would . say that it is a " trap for young players." I regret that the honorable senator introduced it in such a crude and unsatisfactory form. It is not a fair thing to ask of the people of Australia. The returned soldiers as- a body are not asking for it, and, for my part, I propose to oppose it. In doing so I am not to be understood as being opposed to my " cobbers " or their dependants getting a fair deal. I may be doing the honorable senator an injustice, and I have no desire to impute any motives to him, but I regard this bill as nothing but a political dodge. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> has suggested that this bill is rather crudely drawn, because of the extravagant wideness of its provisions. This, no doubt, he thinks was due to inadvertence, but if the honorable senator will peruse the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> in moving the second reading, he will see that it was deliberately designed to be as.  wide  as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> justified this on the ground that the New South Wales Government proposed to pay a pension to all widows, and it was quite in consonance with that policy that the honorable senator should seek to- lessen! the burden on that Government by asking the Commonwealth to pay pensions to all widows of returned soldiers. It is, there-  fore, quite by design that the bill has been made as wide as possible; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> would go a step further. He would move an amendment to include munition workers in the definition of the word " forces ''' in the original act. Thatwould be going far beyond the provisions of the original act. </para>

                            <para>- It is- difficult for a returned soldier to. oppose a measure which is intended to benefit the widows of men who, returned from- the war. because even those of us who had a comparatively comfortable time abroad had our lives shortened to an appreciable extent by the hardships we had to endure even under the best conditions in the field. But once you enter that aspect of the question you are confronted by considerable difficulties. Some men went to the war at eighteen years of age; others concealed their real age and went when they were nearly 60 It is hard to know where to stop. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> has pointed out. the United States act includes the widows, of veterans, whom they married in the last stage of their lives, merely for the purpose of getting a pension. That position was. no doubt, reached by sympathetic endeavours from time to time of the nature intended by this bill. In the administration of our Repatriation Act, for a considerable time great difficulty was experienced in having the claims of a widow recognized where the husband died after his return.. The attitudeof the department was. distinctly hostile to recognizing that a death in such circumstances was due to. war service, unless- a definite wound leading directly to the death could bo shown, or a continuation of illness down, to the date of death could be established. However, I am glad to say that there has been a tremendous improvement in this regard since the advent of the present Minister for Defence SixNeville Howse. I have had, recently/,, a very striking instance of this. A young man- joined nip with me- at thai very beginning, and by almost miraculous good luck served from the beginningto the end of the. war without getting a scratch. He did not miss, an engagement,and except for short periods of leave, was not absent from the firing lira© from the beginning to the end. Hie was- a little, over eighteen, years of age when he* joined-, and we- can well imagine <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> strain which the war imposed on the nerves of a young fellow like that. He was present at the landing atGallipoli, and f ought at Helles, Lone Pine, and all' the other engagements on Gallipoli. He afterwards participated in the chain of fight's in Prance. He married on his re.turn, and during his wife's accouchement was worked' up to such a pitch of worry and excitement that he went out of the house, walked into a dam, and drowned himself. Prom my experience I had not very much hope that the claim of his widow for a. pension would' be recognized, but I narrated the facts of the case to the present Minister for Defence. I told him what that boy had been through, and that probably his experience had had such an effect on his nerves that he could not face his wife's agony as a sane mam would. At Lone Pine that youth was a sergeant holding a post- similar to that which was held by Captain Tubb. and exposed to the same- attacks the repulse of one of which gained for Captain Tubb his Victoria Cross. He told me about the situation in which he found himself on that occasion, and I repeated his experience to. the Minister. The Minister had no hesitation in granting a pension to the widow and the child that was born and survived. </para>

                            <para>- To my mind, it undoubtedly  was, but it is very difficult to convince a certain type of individual that in such circumstances the death of a man who has no visible injury, such as a wound, was due to war service. It was, no doubt, the graphic description that I was able to give of this, young man's experience that helpedthe Minister to come to a decision. I merely mention this case as an illustration of the sympathetic attitude of the present administration of the department to the returned soldier. The provisions of the existing act are already wide, and as long as a definite connexion between the soldier's war service, and his death can be established, the soldier's widow and dependants can get the full benefit of the act. But this bill is aimed at something very far beyond that, and in its present form would admit those cases which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> has instanced, cases in which men in their last days marry young girls whose only object is to become State pensioners. I have great sympathy with the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> that the pension for widows should be increased, but in that case also we have to count the cost. The country is already paying between £7,000,000 and £8,000,000 a year for war pensions. It is a big burden, and it is questionable whether we should really benefit the community if we were to add to that amount to any large extent. To do so might hinder the expansion of industry, and thus hamper our efforts to establish the children of soldiers' widows in businesses. All . these aspects of the question have to be weighed most carefully if we are  to do the best for the country, which includes the soldiers who have suffered and their dependants. I do not think I need say any more than that I oppose. the bill in its present form. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; it involves a waste of money on a line running into a desert; but the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra is a matter of national importance. Honorable senators were told that they were bound to vote for the north-south railway because of an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia. Although there may have been some doubt upon that question, there is no room for doubt that, when the people of Australia voted for Federation, it was clearly understood that the Federal Capital was to be established at Canberra. Twenty-five years have elapsed, and this Parliament still meets in Melbourne. The people of New South Wales, are entitled to know exactly when the transfer will take place. If the Minister can state definitely that the change will be effected within the next few months, I shall be satisfied. Unless the Ministry is favorable to the early transfer of the Seat of Government, all sorts of objections to it may be raised. Five years ago the Ministers in the Senate were the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> D. . Millen, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell. Senator Pearce</inline> has always been favorable to the proposal, the lateSenator Millen was an ardent advocate of Canberra, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> was always agreeable to the transfer. But the Ministers now in the Senate arcnot all so enthusiastic about the matter. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is still anxious to honour the agreement; but the Minister for Markets and Migration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> stated five years ago that he had been to Canberra once, and never wanted to go there again. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> who is now a Minister, remarked at that time&gt; "Let us go there in the sweet by-and-bye.'' </para>

                            <para>- But the Prime Minister is not in charge of the Senate. The Minister in this chamber, who' represents the Prime Minister, might reasonably be asked to make a statement on this subject. Surely five minutes might be allowed for .its discussion. If the representatives of New South' Wales had advocated the transfer to Canberra with half the zeal with which honorable senators from South Australia put forward their claims to the building of the north-south railway, Parliament would have been summoned to meet there long ago. </para>

                        <para>. - I have great pleasure in seconding the motion. The summoning of Parliament to meet at Canberra is long overdue. Those honorable members who object to the proposal live in luxury and comfort in Melbourne, and they are particularly fond of preventing honorable senators from New South Wales and Queensland from catching their trains on Friday afternoons, thus compelling them to remain in Melbourne over the week-ends. On two or three occasions, I have missed my train on that account; but I hope to be able to retaliate when Parliament meets at Canberra. I should like to see some of those honorable senators on the Yass railway platform at 4.50 o'clock on a winter's morning, with a good breeze blowing off the snow-capped mountains. </para>

                            <para>- The first part of the year means till June. As we shall require to remove sufficient of the departments to enable the government to function at Canberra., it will be necessary to arrange for the transfer of at least 1,000 officers. This means that we shall have to provide office accommodation, and also housing 'for the officers, because we cannot expect them to camp in the bush. The transfer of the Parliament is a more important .undertaking than <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Thomas</inline> seems to think it is. This Government has taken definite action with this end in view by appointing the Federal Capital Commission. Every one who knows anything about the present position admits that the commission is doing all that is possible, and in the most business-like  way, to expedite the removal of the Seat of Government.. It is impossible at this juncture to state what will be the arrangements for the sittings of Parliament in the present calendar year. We can only make a forecast. It is anticipated that the present session will continue until July or August, when Parliament will prorogue to enable the Prime Minister to leave in time to attend the Imperial Conference. It may be necessary, before the end of the present year, to have another session to deal with matters arising out of that conference. It is too early yet to say what may happen, but we should provide for such a contingency. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas's</inline> motion is carried, it will be necessary for Parliament, in the next session, and perhaps before the end of the present year, to meet at Canberra . </para>

                    <para>That, as I have shown, will be absolutely impracticable, because the essential departments will still be in Melbourne. The removal of the Seat of Government has been thoroughly investigated by the Public Works Committee, and the Government, and it has been found that the transfer of Parliament without the necessary departments would be merely a camouflage removal. The Government proposes a genuine, not a camouflage, transfer, and it is endeavouring to effect the removal efficiently and economically. This will meet the wishes of the people of New South Wales. Any one who knows anything about administration will realize that the removal of the Seat of Government means the transfer, not only of Parliament  itself  , but also of .all the necessary governmental machinery. </para>

                            The people knew, when they voted for the Constitution, that part of the contract was that the Seat of Government should be in New South Wales, not less than 100 miles from Sydney, but the Victorian Government placed this magnificent building, rent free, at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government, so there was no reason why the removal should be made at express speed. During the recent trying weather we have been experiencing, there was no cooler place in the whole of Victoria than this legislative chamber, and I imagine that some honorable senators, who affect to favour the removal of the Seat of Government are not very eager to leave this comfortable building. I am not one of those who advocate the break ing of contracts. I supported the Canberra proposal at a time when it was not very popular to do so. It is my wish that the Seat of Government' should be established there within a reasonable time,' but the transfer should be carried out 'in a business-like way. To remove the Seat of Government before all the necessary conveniences for governmental administration were available at Canberra would be the height of absurdity. Although, politically speaking, I have no respect for the present occupants of the Treasury bench, I think the Government has very fairly met the demand of the New South Wales members in . both this chamber and another place to remove Parliament to Canberra as speedily as possible. To that end, more practical work has been done within the last two or three years than in the - previous twenty years. I thought that we would approach the consideration of this subject in a broad national spirit, and that Parliament' would meet at -Canberra in a fraternal atmosphere. I find it difficult, however, to support the motion wholeheartedly after the threat made by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline>
                            that when Parliament is removed to Canberra he and other honorable, senators, from his State would give us a dose of the medicine to which they had been subjected during their stay in this city. With great glee he pictured, the plight of those who had their homes in Melbourne, and arrived ' at Yass- on a cold winter's morning with the temperature below zero. He said that in such circumstances he would be an extremely happy man. That is not fraternalism. If the honorable senator desires the Parliament to get to Canberra quickly he should refrain from making those threats. I shall vote against the motion if it is taken to a division.

I take it that I have the assurance of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that the Government, is doing its best to open Parliament at Canberra on the 26th January, 1927. I am, therefore, prepared to withdraw the motion. </para>

The law relating to ordinary offences provides that after a verdict has been given an appeal can be lodged with the Court of Criminal Appeal. I should like an assurance from the Minister that before the final act of deportation a convicted person will have the right of appeal to another tribunal. </para>
