          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HENRY</inline>BARWELL (South Australia) &#91;11.3&#93;. -It is gratifying to every honorable senator on this side, as it should be to honorable senators opposite, to know that the Government has taken the earliest opportunity to give effect to the clear and unmistakeable mandate of the people, given at the last election. It is puerile for members of the Labour party, whether in this Parliament or outside, to attempt to deny that mandate. I was greatly disappointed  with the speech of the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> yesterday. I had thought that he, of all honorable senators opposite, would state dearly and definitely the case for Labour regarding this bill.  His  presentation of the case was, however, extremely weak. While he advanced no plausible arguments against the bill, he like other honorable senators, denied that the Government had received a mandate from the people. I ask him and other honorable senators opposite why no Labour senator was returned to this Senate at the last election. The issue, which was placed clearly before the electors by the Prime Minister, was whether law and order should be maintained. The reason for the failure of Labour was due to one of two  causes: either the electors were strongly and overwhelmingly opposed to the general platform of the Labour party, or they felt that they could not trust that party to do what was necessary to maintain law and order and the supremacy of constitutional government. </para>

The first step necessary is to pass this legislation. It is clear to any right-thinking person that the downfall of Labour in the recent election was due f.o one&#39; of the two reasons which I have given.

            <para>- If honorable senators do not admit that the failure of the Labour party was due to the first reason, it must have been that t.he electors were not prepared to trust the Labour  party  at this critical stage in the nation&#39;s history. The position was placed forcibly before the Senate last night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who made it clear that the issue before the electors was the maintenance of law and order as against mob rule, and that, that issue was settled by them, on the principles of true democracy.  The election result proves that Australian liberty is safe, because it rests upon the firm foundation of the free and enlightened will of a patriotic people. </para>

            <para>- This legislation will maintain law and order without imposing the slightest measure of injustice on any person or class in the community. Yet it is bitterly opposed by the Labour party. Why? That party opposes the bill for the same reason that it has consistently opposed all action which has ever been taken against communists and extremists in this country, whom it actively assists to carry out their nefarious designs. Labour senators may say that that is untrue, but their denial docs not alter the facts, which every right-thinking person knows. I have no desire to misrepresent the opinions and aims of the Labour party, or of any honorable senator, but I know of no way of judging a party other than by its profession of policy and its actions. Where its actions are inconsistent with its policy, one is perforce obliged to judge it by its actions.- In that way the Labour party is being judged to-day, not only by honorable senators on this side, but also by the people generally. In that way the Labour party was judged by the electors on the 14th November last; it was weighed in the balance, and found wanting. It has been frequently said - it. has been said during this debate - that there are very few communists in Australia. If bv that is meant that the number of the members of communist associations is small, I agree with the statement. The communists in Australia are few in number. They are so few that they would be comparatively harmless were it not that they receive the sympathy and active support of a very large section of unionists. </para>

Does any one think that the whole of the shipping of Australia could be held up by the mere handful of people who are members of communist associations unless they received active support from many trade unionists throughout Australia? Let me give further evidence that the extremists of Australia are not confined to the members of communist associations. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HENRY</inline>BARWELL.I was about to refer to a convention which was held in Sydney last week by the extremist element in the Labour movement, commonly known  as the &#34; Reds.&#34; This convention of extremists was held as a preliminary to the AllAustralian Labour party conference, to be held at Easter. The number of delegates at that conference was approximately 100, representing 42 unions, with a total membership of something over 120,000 industrialists. I notice from the report, evidently supplied to the press, because it was the sa&#93;ne in all the newspapers, that this convention received a congratulatory message from Moscow, which the report stated was suitably acknowledged. We have not been given the text of the message from Moscow, or of the suitable acknowledgment, but that fact proves that 120,000 industrialists are in close and direct touch with Russian bolsheviks. The men are all members of the Labour party, and they will be represented at the Easter conference by men of their own choosing. &#34;What is more, we shall find that the result will be exactly the same as it has been on previous occasions, seeing that the extremists control the Australian Labour party, as they have done since June, 1921. That was the time referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> when the objective - the first plank in the Labour party&#39;s platform - was changed from the nationalization to the socialization of industry and the means of production, distribution,  and exchange. </para>

            <para>- Three parties were represented. There were the extremists who wanted the retention of socialization by revolution, a second party which was not quite so extreme and more tactful, and a third section, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> which desired the retention of the old objective. Mir. Theodore was hopelessly beaten. Then came the question of whether the main objective, socialization by revolution, should remain or whether it should be altered to socialization by constitutional means. What the extremists pointed out was perfectly true. They said it. was absurd to alter it to socialization bv constitutional means, because that was impossible, as it involved a total overthrow of the present social order. It involved, amongst other things, the private ownership of property. The question was put to the conference, the proceedings of which were reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> of October. 1921. Is it to be thought that any one would give up his property  simply  because an act was passed which, provided that he had to surrender it? It could not be done by constitutional means, and the only way in which it could be done was, as pointed out at the conference, by revolutionary means. In view of the argument of certain members, the objective was altered to socialization by constitutional means, because it W BS thought that it would be fatal to have socialization by revolution appearing as an objective of the Labour party, although it was admitted that the objective could be achieved only by revolution. What is the use of the Labour party denying the facts ? Its members have been making statements which they know to be false. </para>

            <para>- I shall deal with that in a moment. It has been said that this bill is a blow at trade unionism. It is nothing of the kind. If it were, I should not support it for a moment. I believe in trade unionism. I do not say that I believe in trade unionism as at present conducted in this country because it is political unionism. If a person follows a certain occupation, he is compelled to join a, union before he can get work. He must join a union or starve. A man who joins a union has to subscribe to the objectives of the party, which are in essence the planks of the Labour party. It is pure tyranny. Irrespective of political opinion, a man is forced to join a union, which is not a trade union, but a political union. This measure is not directed against trade unionism. The provisions of the bill which honorable senators opposite object to are directed against any person or any association of persons who preach or practise sedition or revolutionary action, or who in periods of serious industrial strife seek to paralyze transport, industry, or the public services of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- That is perfectly true. Unfortunately, this bill does not go as far as I should like. For constitutional reasons it is necessary to restrict the provisions of the bill to industrial disturbances connected with transport and the public services of the Commonwealth. That is unfortunate, because, just as much harm and damage can be caused by industrial disputes in other big industries, such as the coal-mining industry, and the gas and electric light services. It is to be regretted that we have not the constitutional power to include in the bill provisions in regard to disturbances in other industries unless they are connected with trade and commerce with other countries, or between the States. The power of the Commonwealth to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Australia is not as wide as it ought to be. That will be dealt with when the Constitution is under revision, as promised by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce).</inline> The provisions of this measure are necessarily restricted in a way in which they &#39; would not be if the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament were wider. The bill,&#39; as far as it goes, is most reasonable. It places no restriction whatever upon legitimate freedom of speech, or the freedom of action of any person or organization. It endangers the liberty of no man who is not the active enemy of those who support established government, or the present social system. The measure is so reasonable that I am certain that honorable senators opposite would be supporting it if they were free agents. They will vote against this measure because they have not the liberty to do otherwise. </para>

              <para>- The fact that these reasonable provisions in the bill are opposed by Labour politicians at the dictation of Labour leaders and industrial agitators outside Parliament proves conclusively that if the elections had resulted otherwise we should have had in power at a critical period of our history a Government too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction, and too servile to it to maintain law and order in this country. Surely the existence and activities of the revolutionary and destructive forces in Australia are sufficient to cause the deepest anxiety to any patriot. Surely the danger to be feared from communists, and those who actively co-operate with and support them, is evident enough to point to the urgent necessity of the Parliament taking the necessary steps to restrain and suppress these revolutionary forces. I cannot understand honorable senators opposite opposing this bill. If they are not weak as water, and blind as bats, they will support the measure in their own interests, and in the interests of the great organization to which they belong. I often wonder whether men, such as the  Deputy  Loader of the Opposition, realize that they are like putty in the hands of the agents of Moscow. </para>

              <para>- Most of our difficulties in Australia are caused by artful and designing men, who are ever ready to foment discord and inflame the natural jealousies that exist between different sections of the community. A government that declared itself powerless to deal with such men, and to confine them strictly within the limits prescribed by the law of the land, would be unworthy of the name of Government. Such men are for the most part mere parasites, who live upon their fellow men. The difficulty that has to be faced is that they increase in numbers and importance during times of industrial strikes like vermin in the midst of corruption. That is why legislation of this kind is particularly necessary. I understand that the provisions of the bill to which the strongest objection is taken by Labour members are those covered by proposed new sections 30j and 30k. The first point to be noticed about the former is that it is purely an emergency provision. It is to operate only when the Governor-General issues a proclamation that, in his opinion, there exists in Australia a serious state of industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States. In other words, it is to operate only when it is specially brought into operation because of some serious national crisis. It further provides - </para>

          <para class="block">I have already pointed out that, because of the restricted powers of the national Parliament, these provisions are limited to transport services - to services affecting trade between the States or with other countries - and the public services of the Commonwealth. It is a great pity that they could not be made to cover all industrial disturbances which bring about a state of chaos in the national life of Australia. The national government should have the power to deal with any: thine in the nature of a national crisis. It has not that power at the present time, and we cannot confer it. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> said that it would be a great mistake to make the operation of this provision dependent upon the will of the Governor-General. He knows, as well as I and every other honorable senator, that the act is the act of the executive government: it will not be at the personal or arbitrary discretion of the Governor-General. I point out that this is only an emergency measure, but it confers upon the national government a power that it ought to possess. I admit, however, that that power must be very carefully and very sparingly exercised. Deportation should be resorted to only when it is absolutely necessary for the maintenance of law and order and the general well-being of the community - that is to say, it should not be resorted to as a punishment, but merely as a safeguard of the people&#39;s liberties. That is the answer which I make to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare,</inline> who asked why punishment should be heaped upon punishment. This is not a question of adding one punishment to another, but of providing for the imposition of the punishment of imprisonment by the judicial authorities of the land, and. in the case of a man who was bora outside Australia, deportation at the discretion of the Attorney-General, if he considers that action to be necessary to safeguard the community. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> took the objection that this power might be abused. He said, or implied, that a government might issue a proclamation merely for the sake of downing a political foe, or to serve its own party ends. No government, whether it be National, Country party, or Labour, is likely to so abuse this power. It must be remembered that behind the government, and in reality over the government, stand the people of Australia. We can he quite sure that, the great body of citizens in </para>
          <para class="block">Australia will never permit this or any other government to do an injustice to any section of the community. The force of public opinion is a very real and very potent factor in the government of this country, and no government dare ignore it. So I say that 1 do not apprehend - and I feel sure that no reasonable man can apprehend - any abuse iu the exercise of this power. Although nominally it is being given to the government, in reality the people of Australia, through their representatives in Parliament, are taking it unto themselves. I, for one, am prepared to trust the people of Australia, but apparently our friends opposite are not. The other provision to which objection is taken by honorable senators opposite, is proposed new section 30k. T. ask honorable senators to pay particular attention to its wording. It makes it an offence, punishable by imprisonment, to obstruct or hinder, by violence, threats, intimidation, or unreasonable boycott, the transport services of Australia, or the public services of the Commonwealth. Surely there is no valid reason why such dastardly acts as those should not come within the ambit of the criminal code; and no reason can be advanced in opposition to their being punishable by imprisonment without the option of a fine. Of course, it is urged by honorable senators opposite that that provision is aimed at trade unionists and labour leaders. Such an objection would not be taken were it not that they have a guilty conscience. They evidently feel that the provision will operate against them, because they are liable to offend in the manner indicated. Do honorable senators opposite think that labour leaders in particular should be exempt from liability for acts such as those which are specified? Do they think they should have the right to obstruct or hinder, by violence, threats, intimidation, or boycott, the transport services or the public services&#34; of the Commonwealth 1 That is exactly the point that they make. They think that,, merely because they are members of labour organizations, they ought to have the right to do what this proposed new section forbids; to commit the diabolical acts at which it aims. Surely there should be some provision- in the criminal code against acts of that kind, and it should be made wide enough to cover  every person in the community. I should like to deal shortly with the amendment that was moved yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition. It is a most extraordinary amendment. He proposes to leave out of the motion all the words after the word &#34;That,&#34; and to insert in lieu thereof the following words :  - this  House is of opinion that  the  bill should  be  withdrawn  with a  view  to  redrafting, so  as to  eliminate  the  obnoxious clauses referring  to  industrial disputes, as such clauses associated with the Crimes Act  are an  unwarranted affront  to  the great bodies of organized labour. </para>

Has ever a more extraordinary amendment been moved to a motion for the second reading of a bill?

              <para>- I do not agree that that is a merit if the result is to inflict upon us again the speeches to which we have already had to listen from honorable senators opposite. I have not heard one plausible argument advanced against the bill. I do not want to sit here and listen to a rehash of what has already been said, and I shall not do so. I doubt if the amendment is strictly in accordance with our Standing Orders, but I do not propose at this stage to raise that point. I have not mentioned other provisions in the bill, because, I understand, that they are being supported by honorable senators opposite. I wholeheartedly support the second reading of the bill. </para>

            <para>. - A quarter of a century has passed since the Commonwealth came into existence. During that period we have had many general elections, and on every occasion Labour candidates have had to fight against a powerful purse, a prejudiced press, and poisonous propaganda. The last election was no exception. On the contrary, so far as the non-observance of the ordinary canons of political decency were concerned, it outstripped them all. We were confronted with the most unscrupulous tactics that have ever been employed against us. We had to fight against the masters of mammon, against mountains of misrepresentation, and a veritable Niagara of vilification from 98 per cent. of the newspapers of Australia. Our opponents succeeded in creating, for party purposes, an entirely false atmosphere. Unfortunately some people were persuaded that Australia was on the verge of a revolution. I regret to think that, as the result of this campaign of misrepresentation, Australia - the land of my birth - received the worst advertisement it has had since the Commonwealth came into existence. From platform after platform the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> and those associated with him in his opposition to Labour candidates, declared that the eyes of the world were centred upon the elections which were decided upon the 14th November last. That, of course, was a grossly-exaggerated statement of the position. People overseas were led to believe that Australia was upon the brink of a red revolution. </para>

That bill contained a proposal to which we took, and still take, the strongest exception. . V challenge was issued to the Government by the Leader of the Labour party in another place, to go to the country on that issue. That challenge was not accepted at the time. A little later the Prime Minister visited Wonthaggi during a tour of his division, and when he was asked if he intended to accept the challenge, he replied emphatically in the negative. </para>

It is said, however, that certain things happened in the allegedly united and happy family opposite and that the decision to go to the country was made after a threatened mutiny in the ranks of a certain section of our opponents, who are not numerically stronger than they were prior to the last election. But, assuming that the challenge was accepted on the issue mentioned, I remind the Senate that, during the election campaign, the Prime. Minister and his supporters declared that they could not, and would not carry on the &#39;Government of the country unless they were given power to deport two men, whose purpose, they declared, was to disrupt Australia and dismember theEmpire! </para>

              <para>- All the election speeches of our opponents consisted mainly of a repetition of the statement that the Government intended to deport two men who, it was alleged, had been guilty of unlawful acts. As the result of gross misrepresentation of the position, thousands of votes were improperly won for Ministerial candidates. Ministers had been advised by legal luminaries, some of whom have been mentioned as likely to occupy seats on the High Court bench, though they are not there yet, that the measure to which I refer was constitutionally sound. Having been trained in a legal atmosphere there was, perhaps, reason to believe that they knew their business. One member of the Government went so far as to say, even before the board had arrived at a decision, that the two men would be deported from Australia before the elections were over. </para>

              <para>- Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page is reported to have said that these men would be sent out of Australia. Just imagine two men being a menace to a population of six millions ! The people were told, of course, that when those men had bean deported everything would be all right. Fortunately, we have an institution which, so far as the interpretation of the Constitution is concerned, is higher than Parliament. The Government considered itself above the law, but the High Court, when the issue came before that tribunal, intimated that the Government could not over-ride the Constitution. I said not long ago in this chamber that this is essentially a rich man&#39;s government. I repeat that statement. The Government appointed a  biased board which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, so it would appear from his reported utterances during the election, believed would bring in a finding in favour of deportation. The Ministry seemed to think that, having these two men in its grip, it would be comparatively easy to deport them from Australia, because it did not anticipate that the workers would provide the money necessary to carry an appeal to the High Court. What a sorry mess the Government has made of the whole business. The Government itself has been humiliated and the taxpayers of the Commonwealth have been involved in legal costs amounting to many thousands of pounds. In addition to appointing members of the Deportation Board at inordinately high salaries, the Government engaged a number of peace officers about whose duties very little is known. According to a statement, made by the Leader of the Opposition here a day or two ago, these peace officers appear to be employed chiefly in collecting the names of persons who are not of the same political faith as supporters of the Government. The Government went to the country for a mandate to deport two men from Australia. Now, so the Leader of the Government in this chamber informs us, they are to remain here notwithstanding their alleged offence. In the Immigration Bill provision was made for the issuing of a proclamation, after which those who took part in an industrial dispute were to be liable to be brought before a board, and, if found guilty, deported. The bill before us to-day is a much more drastic measure than that upon which the people expressed their opinion at the ballot-box. It contains provisions which were not before the people. The punishments for which it provides are much more drastic than those in the other measure. For instance, for certain industrial offences created under this bill, an Australian trade unionist is liable to one year imprisonment, and a trade unionist who is not Australian born is liable to be deported in addition to being imprisoned. The previous bill did not provide for imprisonment for trade unionists of any nationality. </para>

              <para>- During the Minister&#39;s second-reading speech he made only one reference to a lockout, but we know that employers can always dodge the law in relation to lockouts. We have heard a great deal about red revolution in Australia. Does any sane man honestly believe that there is a possible chance of a revolution in Australia? It is all so much fustian to talk about the possibility of a revolution, and about taking steps to deal with men who preach revolution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in explaining the provisions of this bill and the necessity for it, cited only one case of a man who advocated the overthrow of responsible government. That man was one whose name began with &#34; Z,&#34; just as there was a man in the last British elections whose name began with &#34; <inline font-style="italic">Z,&#34;</inline> and who was alleged to have forwarded a letter from Moscow which was afterwards declared to be a forgery. The man whose case was cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was deported long ago. Therefore the only dangerous person the Ministry has been able to unearth has already gone out of the country. According to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> this man urged the Russians in Australia to start a revolution immediately. How many Russians are there in Australia to talk about red revolution? Unfortunately, during the recent elections there were men who ought to have known better who saw red in the morning, red in the afternoon, and red as soon as they got on a platform, and after talking red all day dreamt red at night. Those were the men who created the atmosphere of red revolution. </para>

              <para>- Long before the last election there was trouble on the Fremantle wharf of a much more serious and dangerous character than that which was so speedily settled by the Labour Premier of the State during the course of the last election. Blood was shed, there was loss of life, and damage was done to property. Reference has also been made to a railway strike in Queensland, which unfortunately also took place during the recent Federal election. In Victoria some years ago we had a much more serious find disastrous railway strike. The Government of the day decided to fight the men, and as a result the whole of the railway service was dislocated, the public was subjected to inconvenience and much irritation was caused. That strike was settled in a way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> likes - by a fight to a finish; hut for many years afterwards there was no unity or harmony in the railway service of the State. The recent Queensland railway strike was settled in a different manner, and as a result harmony prevails in the railway service of the State where friction would have existed had the other method favoured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> been adopted. </para>

As a matter of fact, the British seamen were thoroughly dissatisfied with their conditions, and they struck of their own volition in Liverpool, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand before trouble occurred in Australia. </para>

              <para>- The strike broke out in Liverpool before it took place here, and it is absurd to say that the two men whom the Government sought to deport were responsible for it. As the previous bill, intended for the deportation of the two men much in evidence during the recent election, campaign, was found to be unconstitutional, it is probable that this measure, when tested, will also be found to be unconstitutional. It is wrong for any government to try by every means, fair or foul, to achieve its end. </para>

              <para>- I have not only read it, but I also understand it. During the last Parliament, the Government introduced a Bill to deal with industrialists. Apart from the judges of the High Court, it had access to the advice of the best legal talent in Australia. It was satisfied with the bill which it introduced; but, in effect, the High Court said that those who drafted and supported that measure did not understand the A B C of the Constitution. Now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says that I have not read the bill! I know that one portion of it deals with unlawful associations to bring about revolution and to overthrow responsible government in this country. I prefer to treat the utterances of men who talk of overthrowing the Constitution by violence as so much empty froth. The Government worked itself into a frenzy because some Russian named Zuzenko  urged all the Russians in Australia forthwith to start a revolution. All the talk about a &#34; red &#34; revolution in Australia is childish. Men who harbour such thoughts in free Australia, where, on polling day at least, rich and poor are  equal,  ought to be medically examined. Ever since the foundation of Australia there have been some such people in our midst. The present Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce&#34;* in days gone by spoke on the Yarra Bank. If we were to look up reports in the daily newspapers of 25 years ago, we should see that Senator Pearce was then a &#34;red-r agger&#34; who gave utterance to views just as strong and vigorous as are advocated to-day in the Sydney Domain or on the Yarra Bank, Melbourne. In those days, also, his next-door neighbour on the Yarra Bank was probably a man who advocated anarchism, while not far away were others who advocated nihilism. If any one had then suggested to Senator Pearce that special legislation should be introduced to deal with such persons, he would have said, &#34; What nonsense ; they are only blowing off steam. Take no notice, of them.&#34; We have been told that this bill will not affect trade unionism, but I point out that it will do more than that. The proposed new subsection 30,r brings within its scope any person who during the operation of a proclamation takes part in, or continues, or incites to, urges, aids, or encourages the taking part in, or continuation of, a strike or lockout. We are told also that the bill will apply only to transport workers. Do honorable senators believe that any organization which may, directly or indirectly, be affected by a strike among the transport workers will not come within the scope of this legislation? The bill contains drag-net provisions, so that all and sundry may be included. During the British seamen&#39;s strike, various organizations, encouraged, assisted, and supported the strikers. Labour newspapers and persons sympathetically disposed towards Labour&#39;s objective supported the strike. Certain clergymen, including the Rev. Maynard, of Queensland, and Dean Hart, of Melbourne, also advocated the cause of the strikers.</inline></para>

              <para>- Under our Immigration Act the Government has power to prevent certain persons entering Australia, and also the power to deport them. The Government should have that power, as it would be wrong to allow persons affected by disease, or who are mentally defective to enter Australia. But no one has previously suggested that men who commit industrial offences should be imprisoned for a period of up to one year, and if they were not born in Australia, be liable to deportation. After a man has served a sentence he is given an opportunity, which sometimes is not the best, to make a new start in life, but the opportunities given to a criminal of the worst type may be denied an industrialist, who, after he has served a term of imprisonment may be deported if he is not Australian born. It is problematical if any country will take back one of its citizens after he has been deported. We know of the handicaps to be faced by those who have been imprisoned. The fact that a person had been deported would be published throughout the world, and his opportunities in life would be seriously affected. </para>

              <para>- To send a man to another State is not to deport him. We are studying this matter from an Australian view-point, and are not taking into consideration imaginary boundaries. There are some persons in this chamber who have a most  ha7.y  idea of the political views of other members of the community. They look upon every man who advocates communism as a menace to the peace, order, and good government of the country. Some of the best men and women in the world advocate communism. It is not proposed under this measure to deal with a person because of the political views he holds. A person, however, who advocates the overthrow of constitutional government by force or violence is to be dealt with. The proposition is too ridiculous to be seriously entertained. It is foolish to suggest that persons could equip themselves with arms and ammunition, and would attempt the impossible, when, on election day, they can vote for candidates who, if returned to power in sufficient numbers, will give effect to the policy they favour. </para>

              <para>- Some years ago an important meeting was held in the Melbourne Town Hall to consider the acceptance of a tender by the Melbourne City Council of 4s. Hd. a day for the supply of a man, horse, and dray. I attended the meeting. The building was  packed. I advised the Mayor to keep out of the chair, but he said, &#34; I am the Mayor, and it is my duty to preside.&#34; I informed him that there was a very strong feeling against the acceptance of the tender. The Mayor took the chair, but the proceedings were so lively that the meeting could not be held, and the services of the police were requisitioned. At the gathering were one or two who advocated revolution and anarchy, but when I informed them that the police had been sent for they suddenly disappeared. Those men were as much prepared for revolution as are those who today speak of bringing about a changed condition of society by unconstitutional methods. Although the Government was successful at the last election it should not disregard the advice tendered iu the editorial columns of certain newspapers, and that given by members of the Opposition, who understand the industrial position better than honorable senators opposite. We ask the Government to hesitate before besmirching the statute-book of this country by placing on it a measure such as this. It is too dangerous a power to be placed in the hands of a Government such as we have in office today. The bill has been ill-digested, and as a writer in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> said, it will horrify the framers of the Constitution when it is tested before the High Court. It bristles with difficulties, and in the language of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> who introduced it in another place, it will provide more work for the lawyers. I trust the Government will accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> . </para>

            <para>. -  I have listened with a considerable degree of interest to the views that have been expressed by honorable senators on both sides, but more particularly to those which have been advanced by honorable senators opposite. I join issue with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in regard to the reason for the introduction of this bill, and the extent to which it will operate against certain members of the community. The honorable senator besought us to believe that the strikes which have been agitating the people of Australia for the last twelve months were so trivial that they might be brushed aside with a mere sweep of the hand. He spoke thus of the strike of railway employees in Queensland, and that of the Police Force in Victoria; but if we are to accept the opinions expressed by leaders of thought in the Labour movement in other States, we must conclude that the Queensland railway strike was a serious menace, not only to that State, but also to Australia as a whole. Metaphorically speaking, the railway workers held a fully loaded revolver at the head of the State Labour Government, and caused it to capitulate. It acceded to every demand, and within a week a strike bulletin was issued under the aegis of the Trades Hall, in which the statement appeared, &#34; If you can paralyze industry by folding your arms, why resort to arbitration?&#34; In that bulletin also there was the further statement to the railway workers, &#34; You have gained more by direct action in two days than you could hope to gain in two years by arbitration.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> informed) us yesterday that the Labour party had never advocated a resort to strikes, but that, on the contrary, it believed in arbitration. The arbitration legislation that finds a place on the statute-book to-day was mostly initiated by members of the Labour party, and in spite of its many defects, 95 per cent, of the people of Australia believe that it provides the only logical means for the settlement of industrial disputes. Briefly stated, the question before us to-day is whether we are in favour of constitutional methods or direct action - law and order or communism, the National Anthem or the Red Flag. The National Anthem is good enough for me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gillies</inline> was Premier of Queensland when the railway workers of that State went on strike. At the commencement of the upheaval he put on a bold front, but when pressure was applied he readily capitulated. A door of escape was conveniently opened for him, and he placed himself in a snug position, above the turmoil of party politics, at a remuneration of &#163;2,000 a year. Before he relinquished ministerial office, however, he said of the men who had caused the railway strike, &#34; I admit that these revolutionaries can destroy the government.&#34; </para>

              <para>- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> delivered an able speech in moving the motion for the second reading of this bill, and in the course of it referred to the outbreaks of lawlessness at Cairns, Gladstone, and Fremantle. Are honorable senators opposite going to throw dust in the eyes of the people of Australia by endeavouring to make it appear that the railway strike in Queensland was a comparatively mild affair, and that the outbreaks at Fremantle were merely an exhibition of braggadocio and hilarity on the part of the lads on the waterfront? We put up with these occurrences until the breaking point was reached. Our friends opposite appear to forget that the law-abiding section of the community, which represents from 95 to 96 per cent, of our population, must be protected from these bushranging  communists, who disregard their interests, and seek to make them bow to their behests. There is a point beyond which the people will not go. Every self-governing community has the inherent right to pass legislation to control the people within its frontiers by declaring certain acts to be offences punishable by deportation. If a person is guilty of an offence against society, will any honorable senator opposite tell me that a self-governing community has not the right to deport him? Although the power was adjudged by the High Court to have been wrongly taken under the Immigration Act, is there anybody who will contend that this Parliament is not entitled to pass a law creating certain offences, and providing such punishment for them ? If a person is so blind to not only his own interests, but also those of 95 per cent, of the people of Australia as to commit an offence against society, we have the right that is possessed by every self-governing country to deport him as an alternative or an addition to the imposition of imprisonment. My friends opposite put up a good, fight for a very bad case. That was the role which they were forced to adopt, also, during the election campaign. In that big fight it was recognized by many leaders of Labour that we were on the edge of a precipice. The people were asked by most of our opponents, however, to believe that there was no necessity for alarm, that the National and Country parties were raising a bogy - that communism did not exist in Australia - and that by subterfuge and nefarious practices we were endeavouring to gain votes that we did not deserve. But what had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> the Labour Premier of New South Wales, to say about these revolutionaries and communists? Although we may not endorse the whole of his dicta, his opinion on this subject must carry a certain amount of weight, and be entitled to a certain amount of respect. Ho said, in July. 1925- </para>

          <para class="block">Throughout the election campaign I did not hear of one occasion upon which any of my honorable friends opposite, or the advocates of the platform which they espouse, came into the open and castigated those who are trying to burst up the unions of Australia, to overthrow law and order, and to undermine all the advantages of civilization for which we have been striving during the last 150 years. Either they approved of the tactics of these people, or they had not the pluck to denounce them from a public platform. If the latter is the explanation, what is the reason for it? Is it that they realize that it would mean political extermination for them ? We went right through the elections without that denunciation on the part of Labour candidates, and the people were, therefore, left to judge for themselves as to which party was in the right and which in the wrong. The verdict was given in no uncertain way. Our friends opposite, and those to whom. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> referred, were told in unmistakable language that those who espoused the cause of Nationalism and the tenets of the Country party had right on their side, and that the people of Australia wanted law and order and good government to prevail, instead of direct action and unlawful methods. </para>

              <para>- When we went to the people last November, the National and Country party, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> clearly stated, sought a definite mandate for the maintenance of law and order and the supremacy of constitutional government. That was the paramount issue. It rested with the Labour candidates to answer the clear and perfectly direct statement made by the Leader of the Government. How did they answer it ? They endeavoured to persuade the people that the Prime Minister was misleading them, that there was no need for action against the communists, and that the Government was making, or intended to make, an insidious attack upon trade unionists, and the workers generally. As to the first point, I submit that the decision of the people at the. ballot box was a complete vindication of the appeal made by the Government. National and Country party candidates secured 1.593.533 votes, and Labour party candidates 1,313,949 votes, leaving a clear majority of 279,584 votes on the side of law, order, and good government. </para>

              <para>- There was a definite majority in favour of good government until the cloven hoof appeared in the Labour movement - until the advent of these communists, who have brought so much discredit upon the party, and upon those earlier leaders of the movement who had been able, by lawful and constitutional methods, by resort to the ballot box, to improve substantially the condition of the 700,000 trade unionists of Australia. Unfortunately the communists, although we are told they are only a thousand strong, have been able, by preaching their insidious doctrine, by throwing dust in the eyes of the workers and some of the champions of the workers&#39; cause, to do damage to the movement. What is more, they have played hell with the whole of our industries, particularly the primary industry, by interfering with the means of production, distribution, and exchange. They have practically held up 95 per cent. of the people of Australia, taking the bread out of their mouths, so to speak, and the money out of their pockets. They represent a small but noisy element. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden,</inline> the secretary of the Labour Council in New South Wales, they number only 1,000, and yet they have been able to dominate the New South Wales Labour Council, which represents the bone and sinew of the Labour party in that State. On the 31st December, 1924, the Sydney Trades and Labour Council issued a report signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden</inline> in which he said that although there were only 1,000 communists in Australia, they were able to impose their will on over 700,000 workers. How do our Friends opposite explain away the fact that 1,000 communists have such influence on the Labour movement in Australia&#39;? There are 120 unions in New South Wales. Of these, 67 are in the city of Sydney. These unions appoint twelve delegates to the Trades and Labour Council, and eleven of the twelve members of the executive of that council are avowed communists. In view of this fact, what, is the use of the Labour party telling the people of Australia that the communist menace is a myth? I think we are all at heart socialists. What more glorious ideal can any person have than that of doing something to uplift his fellow man. The greatest religion the world has ever known is based on that ideal. I have nothing to say about the private character of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden.</inline> In his earlier years he was a Methodist minister at Macleay, in the northern rivers district of New South Wales. There he engaged in the business of saving souls, and I have no doubt that in his probationary period lie did good work. He was engaged then in synthetic work, but to-day he is busy with his iconoclastic programme as a breaker of images, and is doing his best to destroy the beautiful edifice created by the earlier leaders of organized Labour in Australia. The Labour unions have no greater enemy to-day than men of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden&#39;s</inline> line of thought - the imported communists who are seeking to spread their terrible doctrine amongst them. He, and those who think with him, are doing their best to break down the existing social edifice. They invite the people to throw off the protecting mantle of civilization and revert to the era of the savage - to hark back to the methods of the semi-barbarians of the stone age. </para>

          <para>When we appeared before the people a few months ago the Labour party were not very active in their denunciation of the communistic doctrine. So it is not to be wondered at that the enlightened people of Australia - where the poor man, living perhaps in a hovel, enjoys the sam-e right to vote as the rich mau in the mansion, where we have free education, where our universities, through the medium of bursaries, are available to every boy and girl with brains, where the doors of opportunity are wide open to all - should have rallied to the support of the Government. </para>
          <para>Under our democratic form of government our people, starting from scratch - and,  having  regard to our earlier population, with not too good a &#34; kick off &#34; - have achieved a great deal. On our statute-books are many enlightened measures for the uplifting of humanity. In this respect we lead the world. Our people have &#163;175,000,000 on deposit in our savings banks; sufficient to pay &#163;30 to every man, woman, and child in Australia. These deposits have not been built up by any system of bush-ranging or direct action, but by the civilizing influences of our social system, and good government. Australia is not a fertile ground for the propagation of the communistic seed. Conditions hero are not analogous to those of Russia, which . are so often held up to us by men whose names begin, with &#34; Z &#34; or &#34; K.&#34; The people of this country have too much to lose to be led away by any false communistic doctrine. In Victoria alone three-fourths of the people have deposits to their credit in the savings banks, and in South Australia, to its credit, six out of every seven people are in the same happy position. The figures for the Commonwealth show that 65 per cent, of the people have credit balances in one or other of the savings banks - I exclude the cheque-paying banks from this return - and, as I have already stated, the total to their credit amounts to &#163;175,000,000. </para>

              <para>- The point I am trying to make is that where a community such as ours has been enabled by means of educational facilities and by social environment to develop its dynamic power, as against the static power of semi barbarians, it is rather a travesty to ask them to accept the communistic dogma of Soviet Russia, or any other country. Why do these communists seek to force their doctrine upon the people of Australia? </para>

              <para>- There are hundreds of laws in Australia which, if disobeyed, render persons liable to imprisonment, and when persons are found guilty of disobeying those laws, and are imprisoned, we applaud, and say that I he offenders&#39; have met their deserts. What do we find in this bill ? There are clauses dealing with unlawful associations. Honorable senators opposite do not approve of unlawful associations, and therefore any objection to the bill on the score that it is against unlawful associations is removed. Honorable senators opposite do not approve of people who are engaged in treasonable practices, nor of those who instigate others to commit crimes. Both of these offences are provided for in this bill. It seems to me that our friends opposite approve of everything in the measure except those provisions which impose  fines  and imprisonment after a proclamation is issued. My experience is that we always get a reasonable interpretation of any statute by those who are placed in power to administer the laws. It is apparent to any one who gives a second&#39;s thought to the provisions of this bill that proposed section 30j finds a place in it so that it may he brought into force when matters have reached the stage at which it is necessary to hit hard and pretty often. </para>

              <para>- No. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said that this provision was an attack upon trade unionism, and was aimed at the bona fide striker. No legislature has yet devised any power to take away from a body of men the ordinary right to strike. No body of men can be made to work if it does not wish to work. You can take a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink. But when the stage&#39; described in proposed section 30j is reached, when there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance,  prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States, the Governor-General, on the advice of the Executive Council, is empowered to issue a proclamation, and thereafter any person who does certain things must beware. The sword is there, but we do not say that it will descend. Honorable senators opposite want to keep their unions inviolate ; they want unionism to remain on the high pedestal to which it has been raised by their own efforts and those of others; yet when certain craven souls who have come into our midst uninvited have abused the rights of citizenship, they are not prepared to put them in their place. In those circumstances, it rest with the Government, particularly when it is backed up by the mandate of a majority of 250,000 votes, to say, not only to unionists, but also to every man in Australia, &#34; There is the law. You may break it, but if in your organizations, or by your propaganda, you carry on the breaking of the law to such an extent that there is a serious industrial disturbance, prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States, the power given by this bill will be brought into operation.&#34; The difference between this bill and the Immigration Act is that before deportation can take place, a conviction in a court of law must be obtained; whereas under the Immigration Act a prior conviction was not necessary. My friends opposite cannot claim that this law will be enforced against unionists or trade unions in Australia. It will simply be administered in the way in which other law? have been administered by the composite Government. No true-blue unionist who obeys the law will have any grounds for fear. It will really protect  him. against his own so-called friends - the men who preach the doctrines of which I have spoken, and endeavour to impose their will on the workers as well as the people of Australia. The method they adopt is to burst up the unions, create dissension among the ranks of the unionists, hold up our interstate and overseas trade and act in a vile conspiracy against 95 per cent, of the law-abiding people of Australia, who want to carry on in their own fair way, but are prevented from doing so by a handful of wrongdoers. This bill will give that sort of person short shrift, but the sword will fall only in the direction in which it is intended to fall. I am a newcomer to the Senate, but I congratulate honorable senators opposite on the case they have put up, poor as it is. They have had a particularly hard row to hoe. I admire the spirit in which the debate has been carried on, but, at the same time, every person who dispassionately reads the provisions of the bill sees that the law-abiding citizen, or the law-abiding organization, has nothing to fear. Any organization that is prepared to give the people of Australia a fair deal will be treated in like fashion by the people of Australia. We are situated 12,000 miles from the heart and hub of the universe. We are encircled by a sea coast-line 12.000 miles long. Within a week&#39;s sail of the Northern Territory, a quarter of the population of the world is to be found in China. A little farther off is India. If all the people of the world were paraded in front of us. one out of eight would be an inhabitant of India. Nearer at hand is Java, with its millions, yet in Australia we have a mere handful of people holding a continent. All that the worker has gained in Australia has been gained by constitutional methods. When we look about us and see the homes and other assets of a contented people, with money to their credit in the savings bank, and find that the prosperity of the country is very largely intertwined with the welfare of the primary producers, who have never been able to pass their imposts on to others, is it any wonder that the verdict was given on the 14th November last for law and order and good government ? The people are not blind to their own interests.  Many oof  those who voted for the National and Country party candidates were members of the Labour  party.  No man will contend that a government could carry on for one moment without the substantial backing of a great many of the toilers, whom we term the Labour people of Australia. I hope that no government will ever be able to carry on without that support. Otherwise, it would be legislating for one class only. The present Government has the backing of many solid Labour voters. These voters have said to the composite Government, &#34; Go ahead with your legislation. Get rid of the craven hosts of men who are prepared to break down everything near and dear to us. The sooner you do it the more satisfied we shall be.&#34; Honorable senators have only to recall the recent incidents in Queensland. When the strain had reached the breaking point, trains were run down to Cairns from as far back as Baron Falls and further west, and at every station they picked up from 20 to 40 toilers. They were, for the most part good Labour men. They had always voted for Labour, but they realized that an insignificant majority had taken the reins of government into their hands, and were prepared to dictate to the Ministry, and to declare that the primary producers, who get a return from their labour but once a year, could not have their produce removed but must see it rot on the wharfs. These people realized that they had to take charge of affairs in order to get any return at all for the sweat of their brow. Were they not justified in stepping in when others who sought to hold up industry caused starvation and penury and trouble to the best people in Australia? I regard those people who live out-back, who encounter all sorts of difficulties, and are deprived of all forms of social amusement and  comfort,  as the backbone of Australia. Every day we are saying, &#34;Put people on to the land; bring immigrants here, and populate our vast, empty spaces.&#34; I wish that we could do so. Along with the matter ot constitutional government, the populating of our empty spaces is the most important question in Australia to-day. But how are we to populate our vast spaces unless we have settled government, and can tell these people, &#34; Yes, plough your furrow, sow your seed, and garner your harvest; we shall take it to the market and see that you get the world&#39;s parity for what you grow?&#34; Is that asking too much ? Is one small section of the community to be allowed to take charge of everything ? Red revolution will come, if it comes at all, from those men who are deprived of their rights. If the other section of the community is to be allowed to behave to the people of Australia as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gillies</inline> and his henchmen behaved to the people of Queensland, then good-bye responsible government, good-bye our White Australia, good-bye Australia and everything near and dear to us. No unionist need be afraid of this bill if he is prepared to follow the straight and proper course. Many unionists are hoping that the bill will be passed because it will cleanse the Augean stable and remove from the Labour movement a parasitic growth which has attached itself to it in Australia, and taking its very life-blood. Instead of looking to a Labour government to clean up things, the majority of the people of Australia have given the task to the composite Ministry. The majority of the workers are quite satisfied to leave the destinies of Australia in the hands of that Government. </para>

              <para>- If a number of persons were discussing a sentence of, say, six months&#39; imprisonment imposed upon some man, some one would say, perhaps, that he deserved five years, and others that he should have received two years; but if one of the party asked, &#34; If we all got our deserts in this world, do you not think some of us would have done six months before now?&#34; they would probably hang their heads, and not say another word. An amending Immigration Act was passed. I do not say it was wrong, but under it a conviction could not be obtained. We do not wish to adopt unconstitutional means in our endeavour to deport undesirable citizens. What are we doing now? What is the purpose of this bill ? Surely the Opposition do not suggest that those responsible for the recent serious industrial disturbances in Australia should be allowed to remain in the Commonwealth, if they again misbehave. </para>

If those persons who are endeavouring to destroy everything that is near and dear to us continue as they have been doing, we should provide a means of sending them out of Australia. It is only these microbes, which, have come here from Russia, and, like the tick, have grown fat, that are endeavouring to induce the workers of Australia to adapt themselves to Russian ideals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> does not look upon them as a menace, hut wishes, apparently, to champion their cause. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; and he and others of his party are secretly glad that the Composite Government has undertaken that which they had not the pluck to do. We repeatedly hear the party opposite declare that they are championing the cause of the proletariat. We have no proletariat in Australia. I ask honorable senators to say whether I am wrong in that assertion. As far as the workers of Australia are concerned, the word proletariat is a misnomer. It has no application to patrician or plebian. Proletariat, as honorable senators know, is derived from <inline font-style="italic">proletarius,</inline> a citizen of the lowest class. In ancient Rome, it was the sixth and lowest class. We have no sixth class in Australia. The proletariat consists of a people who are untutored and unskilled. In Australia, where we have universal education and advanced industrial legislation, it cannot be said that we have a proletariat. It is true that at times we have unemployment, but that is also true of every large community. Reference has also been made to the meaning of the word &#34; sabotage.&#34; which is used in the bill, but which is not defined. Exception has been taken to its use. There can be no doubt however as to its meaning. Years after the French revolution, French working men and women always wore wooden shoes, which were known as sabots. Industrial trouble and unrest occurred in certain factories, men and women could not secure what they claimed to be their rights, and on one occasion a working man threw his wooden shoe or sabot into an expensive piece of machinery, and smashed it. And so the word &#34; sabotage &#34; came into use. The latest defintion of the word is to be found in Har ley&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Syndicalism.</inline> It is - </para>

I speak as one who has had 30 years&#39; experience amongst the producers in the back country of New South Wales. I have been associated with shearers and other industrialists, and therefore know what I am talking about. I say unhesitatingly that if we are to have a happy and contented countryside the primary producers must have some measure of protection, such as is to be given them under this bill. If we are to settle the broad acres of this marvellous Australia of ours, we must have at our disposal a means of dealing with the class of persons referred <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> in this measure. </para>

          <para>I have not dealt seriatim with the clauses of this bill, because they have already been discussed threadbare. I trust that the bill will be carried and that there will be no occasion to give effect to its penal provisions. Every legitimate trade unionist and worker, and the industrial organizations with which they are associated, will have nothing to fear from it; but if at any time unlawful associations carry their activities to such an extent as to come within its purview they will deserve all they get. I trust the bill will be placed upon the statute-book, and when it is, our friends opposite will wake up one morning to a realization of the fact that it is far-reaching and beneficent, but necessary. They will admit then that we have done the dirty but necessary work that they were not prepared to undertake, but which they were really pleased to see the composite Government take in hand and they will be forced to acknowledge that by doing so we have assisted trade unionists and built up trade unionism to a greater extent than-they themselves have done for many years past. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GRAHAM</inline>(Western Australia) &#91;2.391. - I wish to express my strong opposition to the bill, and particularly to proposed new section 30r Strikes occur at various periods in different parts of the Commonwealth, but it is clear to every one that it is not always possible to stop them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who has had considerable experience in the industrial arena, will admit that in many cases strikes are unavoidable. Many strikes have been caused by the difficulty experienced by trade unionists in getting before the Arbitration Court in order to have their grievances adjusted. An objectionable feature of the bill is that the leader of an industrial organization, the members of which are on strike may, if found guilty of an offence under it, be imprisoned for a period of two years. The members of the Labour party have always favoured arbitration, but the patience of. workers has often been tried to such an extent that they have been compelled to take extreme action. To give peace officers the power to arrest industrial leaders without a warrant is un-British and unjust. We are not in favour of the adoption of barbarous methods in order to settle disputes, but when they do occur it cannot be said that a union leader is more responsible than a member of the rank and file of his organization. He is merely carrying out his duties at the request of a majority of the members of his union. </para>

This measure is aimed particularly at the transport group, which includes, of course, the seamen, the railway workers, and other industrialists; but it is easy to imagine that in the event of a strike of transport workers the coal miners would also be involved. Even if strike leaders were imprisoned, work would not be resumed. If one man is taken there is always another ready to step into his place. I deplore strikes as much as any man. </para>

              <para>- Under it a man taking part in a strike may be arrested and brought before a tribunal. If he is Australian born he will be liable to two years&#39; imprisonment, and if he is not Australian born he may be imprisoned for twelve months and afterwards deported, for taking action that he was forced by his union to take. The deportation provisions will apply, not only to those who were born in Germany, Holland, Sweden, Norway, and other foreign countries, but also to those who were born in Great Britain. That is one of the reasons for my opposition to the bill. I have in mind a strike that took place in New South Wales in 1892. The leaders of that strike were arrested with the idea of forcing the men to submit, and thus enabling the Broken Hill mines to be reopened. Was that action effective? Those men were manacled and sent to Deniliquin for trial. I suppose that similar practices will be adopted under this pernicious measure. I do not stand for sedition, but I believe that this is too harsh a measure to apply to legitimate industrial agitation. It has been introduced to cover up the constitutional error into which the legal gentlemen associated with the Government led Parliament last year. The wording of the proposed new section does not do credit to the Government. Although I shall vote to have the bill sent back for redrafting, I know that the brutal majority behind the Government will not permit of that being done. Under the lag laws in the darkest days of Van Diemen&#39;s Land there was nothing worse than this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> informed the Senate that the bill was brought in to deal with certain persons who were considered to be unfit to remain in Australia. He said that it would apply to teachers in communistic and socialistic Sunday schools who were teaching, not socialism, but hatred and sedition. I believe that the right honorable senator is as unacquainted as I am with the proceedings in those institutions. The Government is playing the game pretty low when it endeavours to foist these provisions upon the industrial community. . Apart from the legislation in respect to which the Government got a setback from the High Court, there is already sufficient power to deal with the persons to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred. The bill is undemocratic, and un-British. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell,</inline> who is regarded as a well-informed lawyer said that the bill hardly went far enough, but as it was an emergency measure, he was prepared to accept it. He then went on to say that the power which it conferred would have to be used with extreme care. It is difficult to understand what the honorable senator really meant. The bill lays upon an arrested person the onus of proving his innocence. I assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> knows that in Western Australia there is an act which deals with gold stealing, under which a man can be arrested without warrant and has to prove his innocence. The right honorable senator will probably agree that this will not have a steadying effect upon the industrial movement. The drafting of the measure does not reflect very great credit upon the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham).</inline> A legally-trained mind is not necessary to formulate such trash as it contains. I am satisfied that he is not one whit better fitted for the position than the man whom he succeeded. References have been made to the possibility of revolution breaking out in Australia. My experience in different parts of the Commonwealth and New Zealand has convinced me that it would be impossible to stage a bloody revolution here. </para>

              <para>- Not at all. I have lived in Australia long enough to know that it is impossible for Labour to achieve its objective by the spilling of blood. There are times, such as during big strikes, when small riots may occur; but nothing is further from the minds of Labour men in general than the precipitation of a bloody revolution. I fail to understand why honorable senators who have preceded me have expressed a fear of such an occurrence. Apparently, they can see blood on every hand. I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott,</inline> and other honorable senators who took part in the recent war, and witnessed the spilling of human blood, did not appreciate the experience. They, too, know that a revolution is unlikely in this country, where a comparatively small population is scattered over a large area. It would he impossible to muster sufficient men at one time to foment a revolution here. Labour has advanced in the past by constitutional methods, and it is still prepared to carry on its work in that way. Some members of unions contend that Labour is not making sufficiently rapid progress, and they are prepared to &#34; crack the globe.&#34; No doubt, those honorable senators who had thousands of men under their command during the recent war will admit that they had to contend with the rowdy element; but it would be absurd to say that bloodshed is imminent in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> referred yesterday to transport being held up because of a strike, and he remarked, &#34;What would be done if the growers of wheat withheld it from sale, and refused to dispose of it unless they were paid 10s. a bushel? The authorities would step in and force them to sell.&#34; Let mo remind him, however, that, soon after the war, the people of Kalgoorlie  had  to pay 12s. 6d. a bushel for wheat, although similar wheat was sold in Germany for 7s. 3d. a bushel. On that occasion, the authorities took no action. </para>
