What happened was that the Treasurer in another place gave notice of motion for leave to introduce a bill, and the press formed their own conclusions and made their own comments. I am not responsible for those conclusions, and I do not propose to take any responsibility for statements that appear in the press. </para>

                        <para>- I know that a little heat was imported into the debate, but I now ask honorable senators, especially those who were returned to support the protectionist policy of the Government, to free their minds from any bias or prejudice, and deal with each case on its merits. Every honorable senator of protectionist proclivities must desire the development of Australian industries and the betterment of the workers engaged in those industries. Higher duties have been voted without hesitation in respect of other items, so honorable senators should have no hesitation now in supporting my amendment. I have already explained that, as far as boys&#39; caps are concerned, it will mean a reduction in the duty of 4d. for each cap. Whilst on this subject, I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> and other honorable senators that nearly all the college boys in Australia, and nearly all the boys attending our public schools, wear caps made in Australia from Australian material. </para>

                        <para>- Most of the. men&#39;s imported caps which I exhibited last night were made from what is known as shoddy material, and under sweated labour conditions, and imported and sold at a price below that at which they can be made in Australia. So acute has the competition become that some cap manufacturers have gone out of the business altogether, and, instead of making the caps in Australia from Australian material, they are importing these articles. The industry should almost be a natural one, because we produce the raw material, and our operatives have been doing the work. The . industry, properly established and adequately protected, should give employment to from 500 to 1,000 operatives, instead of the few who are engaged in it to-day. The Government&#39;s proposal is for a duty of 12s. a dozen British, on both boys&#39; and men&#39;s caps. That is certain to be carried. My amendment seeks to differentiate in the duties between men&#39;s and boys&#39; caps, and honorable senators who have voted for protective duties in respect of other items, to be consistent, should give this industry the measure of protection that I am asking for it. </para>

                        <para>- Australian caps are better than imported caps. The material in them is better, and there is a greater variety of design. We should encourage this industry. I cannot understand how honorable senators who profess to be protectionists can vote against this request. Do they wish to see our importations increased ? Notwithstanding the recommendations of the Tariff Board, which he helped to bring into existence,  and regardless of the fact that these proposals have been introduced by a Government which he professes to support, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> now has no good word for the Tariff Board or for the Government, and he also voices his &#34; hymn of hate &#34; against the party to which I belong politically and industrially. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to see our importations decrease and our industries develop. I shall not remain silent while Australian industries are being strangled because of importations which could be stopped if honorable senators would do their duty. The Government&#39;s proposals are quite inadequate. The material in an imported cap costs about 71/2d., the lining11/4d., peak and canvas1d., button and thread1/2d., making the total cost of the cap in Great Britain 101/4d. The caps are made in the homes of the poorer people under conditions which amount to sweating, and ave delivered f.o.b. London at 12s. a dozen. Adding -14s. 6d. a dozen for freight, &#38;c, the landed cost in Australia is 26s. 6d. per dozen. The cost of manufacturing men&#39;s caps in Australia, making no allowance for profit and not including the cost of material, is 20s. 3d. per dozen. For a dozen caps 21/2 yards of material at 5s. 6d. a yard is required. The total cost, therefore, is 34s. a dozen, or 7s. 6d. a dozen more than imported caps made of shoddy. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. The Government&#39;s proposals already provide for an increase of 50 per cent, on the old  tariff. Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would increase the old duties to 90 per cent. ; I am referring to the British tariff. The attitude adopted by the honorable senator bears out, to a marked degree, the statement of the Townsville Chamber of Commerce, to which reference was made last night. That view is still held by many people in Queensland. </para>

                        is certainly consistent; but one would imagine that this item, which he fights so- strenuously, was of such importance that to grant the additional duties would save the country from disaster. It is useless for honorable senators who believe in moderate protection to attempt, by logical argument, to stem this tide of fiscal madness.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                        asks the committee to raise an already high duty on men&#39;s caps to 90 per cent. That is stretching the principle of protection rather too far.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                        is concerned with this item only because the making of caps is a Victorian industry.

                    <para>. - If we are to continue a discussion of this kind we shall never reach finality in the consideration of the tariff. Parliament has&#39; appointed a tribunal to deal with tariff matters and  to  make recommendations. I, on. one occasion, came into sharp conflict with the Tariff Board because I thought that one of its recommendations was not justified by the evidence. We have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> nothing to justify our going beyond the recommendations of the Tariff Board, which, I understand, are embodied in the Government proposals. By them I am prepared to abide ; but I am not prepared in this chamber to traverse the whole of the arguments in favour of increasing the duty by 2s. or reducing it by1s. We have before us the maximum duty recommended by the Tariff Board. The facts which have been presented to us this morning were, no doubt, placed before the Tariff Board. If they were not, they ought to have been. If this commitee is to consider the whole of the details which should already have been presented to the Tariff Board, we shall arrive at a state of absolute confusion. What the Tariff Board recommends I shall stand for, but not more. </para>

No good case for additional duties was made out in connexion with the first item, but honorable senators voted for the recomendations of the Tariff Board.The argument which applied then should apply now. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> is consistent, and that he has presented his case well; but the arguments whch he has brought forward this morning should have been addressed to the Tariff Board. If that has not already been done, an opportunity to do so would readily be granted. Finality has not yet been reached. Seeing that the Tariff Board appointed by Parliament has considered this matter and made its recommendations, I shall stand by those recommendations. </para>

But, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would prohibit anything from entering Australia if he possibly could. There is evidently a desire on the part of the Government to accept the proposed rate of duty, which goes fax beyond the recommendation of the Tariff Board. 1 was astounded at the Minister, apparently after consultation with his officers, taking the advantage of the opportunity to procure more revenue; </para>

The workers who make these caps in London, if the invoice price of them is 12s. a dozen f .o.b., must get something like 3&#189;d.  each for them. The material of which they are made is shoddy pure and simple, whereas the Australian-made caps are of Australian tweed. If honorable senators prefer the importation of these caps made with the shoddy material to the establishment of another Australian industry, they are indeed lacking in a true Australian sentiment. There is nothing to indicate that the caps described as being made in Great Britain are not made in Japan, Sweden, Germany, or some other country, and stamped as &#34; Made in Great Britain.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I am nob saying that there was evidence to support the board&#39;s recommendation in that regard. I Supported the honorable senator in his opposition to the increases. He and I and others rejected  the  recommendation, and decided the issue on the evidence as it appealed to- us. In regard to the duty on caps,, the Tariff Board submitted a certain recommendation, but when the matter was under consideration in another place, the Minister for Trade and Customs said that he would give further consideration to a request for a higher duty. He has apparently done so, because to-day the Government has accepted the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> for the imposition of a higher duty. I believe that if the Tariff Board had had time to go into the question, it would have recommended the higher rate. It is eighteen months since it first inquired into the matter. Capmaking  is, no doubt, a small industry; but, as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> many of our large industries started in a small way. They cannot grow up all at once. The wearing of caps&#39; is more&#39; common in Australia than it has been. The further you go into the tropics the more they are worn at night time, and in the cold climates of Melbourne and Sydney young people are wearing caps during the day time to a greater extent than formerly. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, eighteen months ago, but in the meantime the manufacturers of these caps have secured from the factories the tweed they could not obtain &#34;previously. It was one of their drawbacks that they could not obtain this tweed. Some of the imported caps would not be fit to wear after a shower of rain; they are made of shoddy and would shrink. It ought to be recognized that there are far more boys&#39; caps worn than men&#39;s, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> proposal to reduce the duty on boys&#39; caps will mean a big reduction for the fathers of children who have to wear caps.

                        <para>- The proposed increase on the recommendation of the Tariff Board on men&#39;s caps is 3s. The reduction on boys&#39; caps should balance the increase on men&#39;s caps, because there are two boys&#39; caps worn to every one adult&#39;s cap. The material made in the local mills and used in manufacturing the men&#39;s caps exhibited in :the chamber is a credit to them. The manufacturers of woollen cloth in Australia have had a long struggle. The industry is struggling even now. </para>

                        <para>- If that is correct, it is the best news I have heard for many a year, because our woollen mills have not been fully employed, and their employees have been working half time. Not long ago I inspected six factories in Geelong. One of them was working only half of the week, and the others were not working full time. If they are now all working full time to execute orders, it is the best evidence we have that the increased tariff is required. The tweed of which the caps exhibited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> are made is 20 per cent, better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne&#39;s</inline> shoddy, out of which he would have our overcoats made. The people who are ask ing for this duty tell us that the cost of manufacturing in Australia without a profit, not including the cost of material, amounts to 20s. 3d. a dozen. There are 2&#163; yards in a dozen caps. Australian cap tweeds cost 5s. 6d. a yard. The  co3t  of the tweed in a dozen caps is, therefore, 13s. 9d. Adding this amount to the cost of manufacture, we see that the total cost is 34s. a dozen without profit, or 7s. 6d. a dozen more than the cost of imported caps. We have arbitration awards in Australia fixing certain wages and hours of work. We have factory laws requiring the industries to be carried on under certain hygienic conditions. These conditions, these hours of work and rates of wages, have not to be observed by employers in other countries. It is only reasonable, therefore, that when the Australian manufacturer has to compete with the manufacturers of other countries, he should have an amount of protection which will enable him to do so, even if it appears to be somewhat in the nature of a tax upon the consumer. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am in favour of encouraging manufacturing industries in Australia by imposing reasonable duties. I understand that the cap-making industry in Australia is only in its infancy, and, if that &#39; is the case, it is worthy of more support than some industries which have had the benefit of fairly high protection for a number of years. The samples of Australian tweed produced are of a very satisfactory quality, and there does not appear to be any reason why men&#39;s caps should not be made of such material. If the father of a family has to pay, perhaps, ls. more for his own cap, he will receive a corresponding benefit by being able to purchase caps for his boys at a lower rate. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is eighteen months since the Tariff Board investigated this matter, and in the meantime tweed suitable for cap-making has been manufactured in Australia. Frequent reference has been made to the fact that the workers will have to pay additional prices in consequence of the higher duties imposed, but it is peculiar that the members of the Labour party, in this chamber, and in another place, are solidly supporting the higher duties. It cannot, therefore, be said that the higher Customs duties inflict hardships upon the working classes. </para>

I do not think it is an extraordinary proposal to reduce the duty on boys&#39; caps and to increase the rate on men&#39;s caps. I wish to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> who said that we should adhere to the decision of the Tariff Board, that a considerable period has elapsed since this matter was investigated by that body, but the honorable senator should know that if additional evidence is submitted the matter should be further discussed. In opposing the requested amendment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> said that he would stand by the recommendations of the Tariff Board, because it had heard the evidence for and against higher duties, but he qualified his statement by saying, except when he thought it &#34;had acted on insufficient evidence.&#34; In this instance the honorable senator considers that he is a higher authority than the Tariff Board. This committee has, of course, greater powers than the Tariff Board, and as further evidence has been tendered to justify the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> we should be guided by it. </para>

                        <para>- Conditions have altered since the Tariff Board&#39;s inquiry. Suitable tweed is now being manufactured in Australia, and as the cap-making industry is in its infancy it deserves a higher protective tariff than those industries which have been established for some time. Honorable senators have not referred to the time the industry has been in existence, but it is admitted that it is only now becoming established. I am a protectionist, but, as I stated on the second reading of the bill, I shall not support the continuance of high duties to protect industries which have been established for some time. In this instance, I am quite consistent in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> requested amendment, which has been moved with the intention of assisting a new industry. </para>

                        <para>- It was, but, unfortunately, it has been strangled. The representatives of the industry . appeared before the Tariff Board, and the Minister  for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten),</inline> the Comptroller-General of Customs, and the accountant in the Department of Trade and Customs visited the factory. After a most careful investigation into the industry had been made, a promise was . given that it would receive adequate protection. In the first place, a deferred duty was proposed, and the payment of a bounty was also considered, but up to the present, the only notification received from the authorities is that the matter will be brought before Cabinet. The factory is now closing down, and the unfortunate workmen, who have not been paid for the last fortnight&#39;s work, are being thrown out of employment. Capital will not be invested in such an industry until investors are assured that it will receive adequate protection. The factory to which I . refer is the only one of its kind in Australia, and . as everything but the bobbins . and needles are produced locally, surely it should be encouraged by means of a bounty. This has been done without any assistance. The industry should be encouraged by means of a bounty until it is properly established. People who are in poor circumstances require a reasonable respite from high protection. That applies with particular force to widows who have children to maintain. </para>

On behalf of their parents and the people generally, I appeal to honorable senators not to further increase the cost of Irving by imposing excessive duties, even on caps. Australia could get along very well with a moderate measure of protection. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> says, a reasonable amount of protection is not sufficient, let the industry go. The Government made a very temperate proposal, but they have agreed to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> suggestion to increase it. I consider that the item, as it stands, is sufficient to build up that industry, and I shall, therefore, support it. </para>

                </quote>
                <para>I have just given the figures- to the Senate- are the result of investigations by the Victorian Wages Board, and are based on the cost of living compared with Australian standards of living. If any higher wages are paid in Victoria, it indicates that the industry was, under the 1921 tariff, sufficiently well protected to pay such higher rates. </para>
                <para class="block">Although the industry was well protected under the 1921 tariff, those identified with it now come along for an additional 10 per cent, protection. What justification can they offer? It is all part and parcel of a definite campaign to secure favour after favour from this Parliament. As I have said on previous occasions, it is time to put a period to the process. We should think of other people. At the moment I am thinking of the vast number of people who have to buy socks and  stockings, and also of those who, owing to their unfavorable position, are in danger of being unable to buy socks to wear. I want some relief to be given to them. I shall test the feeling of the committee on this matter. If my amendment is carried, I shall move for corresponding reductions in the intermediate and general tariffs. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the committee will not agree to the honorable senator&#39;s request, because it would seriously affect the position of one of our most important secondary industries, in which about &#163;4,000,000 is invested in buildings and plant, and which gives employment to a large number of people. Prior to the introduction of this tariff in September last the manufacturers of woollen hosiery had practically ceased operations owing to the large importations, due principally to big surplus stocks being held in the United States of America and in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- That commodity is not under consideration at &#34;the moment. It is estimated that if the whole of our requirements in hosiery are manufactured in Australia the industry will give employment to an additional 2,500 persons. The increased duties have been in operation for over nine months, and my information is that there has not been any noticeable increase in the cost either of socks or stockings in that time. Our manufacturers now supply the greater proportion of the Australian demand, and they are employing a large number of operatives. Under this tariff the import duties on yarns for the manufacture of socks and stockings are increased by 10 per cent. An important Australian industry will be seriously injured if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> &#39;s amendment is agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- This proposal ought to be considered from a commonsense point of view. I want honorable senators to go back to 1921, when, in face of a great deal of opposition, the British duty on socks and stockings containing wool was increased to 35per cent. There was a great deal of opposition to the proposed increase to 45 per cent. British. Notwithstanding that it was shown clearly that the imposition of a duty of 35 per cent.., as against the previous duty of 25 per cent., would only have the effect of increasing the cost to the people, the extra duty was agreed to, the Government of the day, believing that that protection would be ample to enable the hosiery manufacturers of Australia to command a fair proportion of the trade. It is now proposed to further increase the duty. If the object is to prevent the importation of British hosiery, it will fail. </para>

                        <para>- No. I give place to no honorable senator as a judge of textiles. Some time ago I bought some Australian-made articles of clothing which were of&#39; good texture and appearance. They were made of pure merino wool. As I am not a small man, I obtained the largest size made, and when I first wore them they fitted me. But after five washings - not at a laundry, but at home, by the most approved method - they were not large enough to fit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare.</inline> I also bought some Australian-made cashmere half hose, measuring11&#189; inches along the foot. After four washings those socks were only 9&#189; inches long. I interviewed the secretary of the factory which made them, and told him that I had heard that he had represented that the reason the production of his factory had diminished was that British hosiery had been dumped in Australia, but that the real reason for the decline of trade was that the workers had not learned the art of shrinking the yarn before manufacturing it into garments. I received the reply that I did not know what I was talking about. If the Australian factories will produce an article which will give satisfaction to the wearers, it will find a ready sale. The effect of this higher duty will be to increase the price of &#34;hosiery made in Great Britain by6d. or 9d. a pair. But it will not decrease the quantity sold to Australian people. Increased duties will give no greater protection to the Australian manufacturers. I do not say that every Australian factory turns out unsatisfactory hosiery. Some of them produce excellent articles. </para>

                        <para>- They do not make woollen goods. I bought garments from the mills that I have mentioned because I was a shareholder in the company; but since the experience to which I have referred I have purchased no further goods made in that factory. I hope that by this time they have overcome their troubles. I wish them success. But higher duties will not increase their turnover. They will increase the cost of imported hosiery without protecting the local industry. </para>

                        <para>- A protection of 30 per cent. or 35 per cent. is ample so long as the goods turned out by Australian factories are satisfactory. A duty of 35 per cent. gives an effective protection of about 45 per cent., when we consider the natural protection afforded by reason of freight and other charges on the imported article. </para>

It is farcical to suggest that any business man would do what has been suggested. He could not afford to do  so.  I could understand the manufacturer of  a  commodity which had gone out of fashion sacrificing it to get rid of it. Brat that is not the case with hosiery, which is in continual demand. I enter my emphatic protest against this additional duty. It is not necessary for the development  of  Australian industries. All that is needed is that Australian manufacturers shall produce satisfactory articles. Many of them are doing so. So far as I know, everything which I am now wearing is of Australian manufacture. I buy Australian goods when I can; but in view of the experience to which I have referred I now carefully avoid purchasing certain brands of Australian made clothing. A man cannot  afford  to buy unsatisfactory garments. The committee would be well advised to agree to the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is a- protectionist only when something affecting Tasmania is concerned. For instance, he is prepared to vote for an increased duty on woollen yarn because Messrs. Paton and Baldwin have established in Tasmania a factory for making it. No section of the wool-manufacturing industry in Australia is more deserving of increased protection than the knitting branch. We have i:i the mills of Messrs. Foy aud Gibson at Collingwood, and the Lincoln Mills at Coburg, some of the best equipped knitting mills in the world. The Lincoln Mills can produce woollen half-hose for 21s. a dozen.  Is  that an excessive price for articles made of pure merino wool? The machines in these mills are the best obtainable; the operatives working them are as efficient as any elsewhere; and for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> to say that those mills are not turning out satisfactory articles is pure humbug. I have bought underclothing in London, Paris, and New York, as well as in Australia. For the past four or five years I  have worn no underclothing or socks which have not been made in Australia by Australian people.  I  have not found them to shrink.  I  say without fear of contradiction that it is the best underclothing manufactured in any part of the world. A few years ago, because of ah over-production in some English factories and pressure from the banks to reduce their overdraft, some English manufacturers sent large quantities of their manufactured goods to warehouses in Flinders-lane. Goods which the Lincoln mills were selling for 21s. a dozen wholesale were offered at about 15s. o dozen. That has been admitted in evidence. The percentage of overproduction might not have been more than 10 per cent. ; but in considering this question we must have regard to the size of some of those European manufacturing concerns. They go in for mass production. One mill makes nothing but one class of goods. As a consequence, their output is enormous. Ninety per cent, of it is probably sold in the home market at a profit, and thus they can afford to dump their surplus in overseas markets, selling it for practically nothing. The knitting industry in Australia was absolutely shattered two years ago, and half the mills were forced to close because of the goods dumped here by mills in Great Britain, who had been called on by their bankers to reduce their overdrafts. </para>

                        <para>- The knitting mills of Australia were hoping for higher protection than this schedule affords to them. In my plea for a higher rate of duty, I am speaking, not on behalf of the big concerns with a large amount of capital behind them, but mainly on behalf of the small knitting mills. This is a branch of the woollen industry which is specially adapted for country towns. A knitting mill does not require the huge outlay of capital needed to establish a big woollen mill, and it has been found possible to set up quite a number of these knitting mills in small country towns. It brings about decentralization, an object we should all have in view, but many of these small mills have failed on account of the inadequacy of the protection afforded to them. If I had my way, we should not import a pound&#39;s worth of woollen socks. In Australia the manufacture of knitted articles is carried on very efficiently, and affords employment to a great many people, besides helping to bring about that decentralization we so much require, and it is an industry that we should protect up to the hilt. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it will. I should like to see a big dumping duty in addition to this. The value of woollen socks and stockings imported into Australia in 1923-24 was &#163;759,571. This increased, to over &#163;1,000,000 for the year ending the 30th June, 1925. It is an anomaly for the greatest wool-growing country in the world to be importing woollen goods to such an extent. It is worse than an anomaly; it is a disgrace. Any honorable senator claiming to be a democrat who makes the cruel assertion that our knitting mills are not properly equipped, and turn out rubbish, and, that the goods they produce wear badly and shrink, is stating something that is contrary to fact. I cannot understand the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne;</inline> it has puzzled me. The honorable senator decries the products of the Lincoln mills and Foy and Gibson. </para>

I shall oppose most sincerely any attempt to wreck the woollen industry of Australia, and more particularly the knitting branch of it, by reducing this duty, which, in my opinion, is not high enough. </para>

We have to remember that the knitting firms of Australia are using the same raw material and the same machinery as are employed in the manufacture of knitted goods in Great Britain. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> tells us that because certain goods are made in Australia their quality is inferior to that of similar goods manufactured in Great Britain. One of the greatest handicaps on the Australian manufacturer is that there are not many people in our midst who are anxious to push the sale of the local article.. For some reason or other the employee in the average retail establishment will try to force English articles on his customers to the detriment of Australian articles. </para>

                        <para>- Quite recently when I went into a retail establishment to purchase some socks I was not sufficiently patriotic to insist on articles of Australian manufacture.

                        <para>- At any rate, while some honorable senators are not prepared to give proper protection to one industry, they are most ardent in their advocacy of duties on industries in which they or their States are interested. I recognize that the Government and the Parliament of Australia has been generous to the State of Queensland by imposing protective duties on some of the great primary industries of that State. I think that in these matters we should adopt a policy of give and take. As a Queenslander I feel that if the people of the other States are prepared to give Queensland industries a fair amount of protection to enable them to progress, Queenslanders should, in their turn, extend the same amount of protection to industries located in other States. I do not think that that is an illogical attitude to take up, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is willing to penalize other States in order to establish the newsprint industry in Tasmania. There is also no more ardent advocate of a duty on carbide than he is. </para>

                    <para>.- Owing to inexperience in the manufacture of hosiery some Australian factories at the outset of their operations produced socks and stockings which, when washed, shrunk considerably, and that was responsible for a reduction in sales. The difficulties experienced in the early stages have now been overcome, and the manufacturers are placing goods on the market which are equal to anything imported. From personal experience in Queensland, where the climate is hot, and also in. Victoria where lower temperatures prevail, I have found the quality of the Australian product all that could be desired. I have tried the Jaeger brand, and have found the locally-produced article equally good. </para>

Some of the factories which are placing hosiery of the best quality on the market and are experiencing difficulty in marketing the articles of a cheaper grade, are asking for higher protection on the cheaper goods in order to keep their plants in operation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> said that from a business viewpoint he could not understand manufacturers disposing of their goods at less than cost unless the goods were out of date, but in some instances it is done to keep the factories going. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> quoted the wages paid in Great Britain and in Australia for similar work, and endeavoured to show that those paid in Great Britain were higher than the flat- rate paid to Australian workers. I find, that according to evidence given before the Tariff Board the piecework rates paid to Australian operators and mechanics are much higher than those paid in England. Some of the girls engaged on piece-work in Australia earn up to &#163;6 8s. a week, and junior mechanics from &#163;6 5s. to &#163;7 5s. a week. Expert mechanics in some factories earn up to &#163;14 a week. The manufacturing costs in Australia and in Great Britain are as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">In view of these figures it will seen that protective duties are necessary to ensure the success of the industry. The Tariff Board, which has conducted exhaustive inquiries into this matter, has reported that the manufacturing costs of mercerised cotton hose in England are ls. 8d. a dozen as against 7s. 7jd. a dozen in Australia. On cashmere stockings the respective manufacturing costs are 2s. 5d. and 8s. 2d. The board has also reported that certain hosiery mills have gone out of business, and that local plants are quite up to date. It is further stated by the board that &#34;sales are being effected by the importation of socks and stockings of equal appearance to those locally produced, but of inferior quality, the staple and the yarn being shorter. Local spinners are unable to spin yarn from short staple wool. The short staple would not give the wearing qualities of the longer staple. The increased duties asked for are for the purpose of protecting local manufacturers against the cheap end of the trade, namely, the &#34; shoddy trade.&#34; </para>

                    J. B. HAYES  (Tasmania) f2.17&#93;. - When I first entered the Senate two or three years ago, I was a very strong protectionist. I am still a protectionist, but, like thousands of others in Australia, my faith in very high protection is becoming less and less as time passes. I think that the majority of the duties are too high, and that they will result in a greater cost of living, which in its train will bring bigger wages, and the vicious circle will commence again.

                    on another item said that one could not tackle a tariff schedule without being illogical. I have endeavoured to keep an open mind upon this matter. My friend
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                    made the statement that &#163;1,000,000 worth of socks and stockings is annually imported into Australia. I presume that he quoted the invoice price, and that the price to the people of Australia would be very much greater. It is a shame that a country which produces wool, and is continually talking about the manufacture of woollen goods, should find it necessary to import woollen materials to that extent. I believe that one of the causes is lack of efficiency. Although we now have a 35 per cent, tariff, I am still faced with the position that some of these mills are not doing well. This matter has been inquired into by the Tariff Board, and on that account I feel disposed to give the knitting mills another chance; but they will have to consider the desirability of increasing their efficiency. If they do not do so, any future requests for additional duties may be given a cold reception. I cannot help contrasting the treatment that is accorded to the town and country districts. We have enjoyed a wonderful measure of prosperity for a considerable period only because we have been obtaining high prices for our wool and wheat.

We shall have to do more for ourselves, and the manufacturers will have to follow the example of the primary producers. The wool and wheat producers have not the benefit of a duty. Butter is being sold in London to-day for a little over1s. 6d. a lb. An honorable senator trotted out the argument that the dairying industry in Victoria was given a bonus about 35 years ago. If it had to conform to a 44-hour working week, and observe the holidays that are enjoyed by those who are engaged in some of the secondary industries, no butter at all would be produced. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps it is a good thing that they cannot. Those who are engaged in the production of wool, meat, and wheat have my wholehearted sympathy. The duty on socks and stockings under the 1921 tariff was as follows: - Woollens, British preferential 35 per cent., intermediate 45 per cent., general 50 per cent. ; silk, British preferential 30 per cent., intermediate 40 per cent., general 45 per cent. The present proposal is, woollen 45 per cent., 55 per cent. and 60 per cent. respectively; silk, 35 per cent., 45 per cent., and 50 per cent. respectively. The manufacturers contend that the increase of 10 per cent. in regard to woollens and 5 per cent. in regard to silk, is insufficient. Australian mills cannot compete with the cheaper lines of socks and stockings that are manufactured abroad. The value of the importations of woollen socks and stockings in 1923-24 was &#163;760,000; and in 1924-5 &#163;1,076,000, an increase of over &#163;300,000. The importation of silk stockings showed a reduction in those years; but despite the increased duty, which has been in operation since the tariff was tabled in the other House, the value for the first three months of this year has doubled that for the corresponding period of last year, as will be shown by the following figures : - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">Those figures prove that the increase of 5 per cent. in the duty on silk socks and stockings is insufficient, as the value of the imports has increased by over 100 per cent. During the last two years the value of the imports of hosiery reached the &#163;3,000,000 mark. It is estimated that two-thirds of this trade could be diverted to Australian mills, with the result that &#163;1,000,000 per annum would remain in Australia instead of being sent overseas. That would represent, approximately, 750,000 dozen pairs of hose, and would give employment to an additional 2,250 operatives, whose wages would amount to approximately &#163;350,000. The capital invested in this industry amounts to &#163;4,000,000, and the employees engaged number 6,000. The present increase will enable the Australian manufacturers to hold their own with the better class of hosiery, but they are unable to compete in the cheaper lines of artificial silk stockings that are landed in. Australia at from 24s. to 27s. a dozen, and are being sold retail at from 31s. 6d. to 36s. a dozen. The manufacturer in Australia cannot supply the retailer with a similar class of goods at a figure lower than 36s. a dozen. A flat rate, or some similar proposal, ought to be adopted to enable our manufacturers to keep their machinery fully employed. I have here  samples of both the imported and the Australian article, and honorable senators can see at a glance that there is no comparison between the two. A number of the machines <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the majority of the factories are to-day lying idle when they should be fully employed. With adequate protection, or a flat rate, for that particular class of goods, our mills would be working full -handed. I should like to know if it is possible for these people who are applying for a flat rate to appear before the Tariff Board in order to present their case ? </para>

                <para class="block">Under the  1921  tariff carpets were protected to the extent of  10  per cent. British,  15  per cent. intermediate, and  25  per cent. general. The Government&#39;s proposal is to remove the duty on British carpets, and reduce the general tariff from  25  per cent. to  15  per cent. I understand that when the Tariff Board inquired into this industry it was advised that no carpets or floor coverings were being manufactured in Australia. That is not so. For the last two or three years a factory in New South Wales has been producing some excellent carpets. I do not desire to make any invidious comparisons between the Australian product and imports from overseas. I do not wish to say anything derogatory to the products of the Motherland. I content myself with saying that the articles being  turned out by the Australian factory in large quantities are as good as, if not better than, similar commodities that are being imported. It is not desired that the duty shall apply to those carpets and mats that are not being made in Australia. We do not want to force people who prefer to buy that class of goods to pay an increased price due to the imposition of Customs duties merely for the protection of a different branch of the industry. Those connected with this Australian enterprise will be satisfied with tariff protection on the lines they manufacture. When I consider the protection asked in respect of other items in the schedule, I blush at my own modesty in proposing that, in this item, the duties be 10 per cent. British, 15 per cent, intermediate, and 25 per cent, general, and I am satisfied that there will be little, if any, opposition. I understand that the Minister is prepared to accept my proposal, which will give the necessary protection to a bona fide Australian industry that is producing a first-class article. It will enable it to meet the competition in jute goods of a similar nature from other countries. If this Australian enterprise develops, as it is anticipated it will develop, and subsequently begins the manufacture of other classes of floor coverings and carpets, I have no doubt that it will then be accorded the necessary protection. </para>

                        <para>- The pioneers of this industry were, I understand,  Gattino  in Sydney. I am informed that this firm has installed a plant capable of supplying 20,000 yards of carpet annually, but that its product is only about&#39; 12,000 yards per annum. The firm says, further, that in competing with imported carpets, it is limited to the lower grades, because the tariff on the better class of goods is not sufficiently high to enable them to be produced here. The factory has been in existence at Waterloo, Sydney, for nearly three years. When the old tariff rates were in operation, they had representatives in different parts of the Commonwealth to secure orders for their goods. </para>

                    <para>. - Despite the invitation of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford),</inline> I shall not unduly prolong the discussion. Already there has been a painful reiteration of arguments during the debate on the tariff, and, as there is a danger of our becoming weary and nervy before it is finally disposed of, I shall endeavour to confine my remarks strictly to the item before us. In support of the requested amendment, I would point out that there is a likelihood of at least two companies, for the manufacture of carpets, being established in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the Opposition chorus, I would remind the committee that the duty proposed in this instance cannot be regarded as ultra-protective, since it is only 10 per cent. Representatives of Tasmania have raised no objection to duties of 10 per cent. on other items; our opposition has been only to the imposition of very high duties. A telegram has been received by the Customs Department from the Premier of Tasmania, pointing out that with a duty of 10 per cent. there is a possibility of carpet-making factories being established either in that State, or Victoria. Our policy should not be to wait until an industry has become practically bankrupt before granting assistance to stabilize it. Rather should we endeavour to encourage new industries by assisting them from the beginning. Here we have an opportunity by means of a moderate duty to encourage a new enterprise, and ore should avail ourselves of it. The people of Australia are undoubtedly in favour of the policy of protection, and, in this instance, the protection sought is extremely moderate. This duty, while it may assist a new industry in Tasmania, will not clash with the interests of the Commonwealth generally. The land for the establishment of the factories has been bought. </para>

                        <para>- No. In New South Wales there is already one factory in operation, and some protection is required forthwith. In this tariff schedule we are assisting other industries, and why should a departure be made in this instance.) If unwarranted protection is given to some industries, labour will be drawn to them from equally essential but less protected enterprises. The manufacture of carpets and rugs is an industry for which Australia is eminently suited. It is therefore worthy of assistance in the direction suggested. </para>

                    <para>. - The request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> explains the beautiful symmetry of this wonderful schedule. We are assured that this industry, which is in its infancy, will be able to survive with a 10 per cent. protection. Yet other industries, which have been established for years, have been granted a protection up to 60 per cent. ; and some honorable senators have &#39;Considered even that to be insufficient. What a beautiful mosaic this tariff is ! The 10 per cent. protection granted to an infant industry is increased to 60 per cent. when that industry has attained to what may be termed manhood. The moral to be learned is that we should not take the first false step. </para>

                <para class="block">Generally, an industry requires more protection in its infancy than when it reaches the adolescent or manhood stage. If we start them off as infants, we must continue supporting them as infants, but here we have just the reverse position, an industry proposing to start off with the watery stuff of 10 per cent. duty. It brings me back to my original statement that it is impossible to be logical in dealing with this tariff. For my part, I prefer to be illogical rather than irrational. I consider that a 10 per cent. duty is not enough for this industry, which is about to be started, but I am satisfied with the crumb that has fallen from the table overflowing with our generous gifts to manufacturers generally. I am mainly interested at the moment in pointing out the hollow mockery of all the protectionist arguments we have heard in this chamber. If a 10 per cent. duty is good enough for this industry, it ought to be the standard applied to other industries. </para>

                        <para>- It is satisfying to have the assurance of the Minister that it is not proposed to increase the duty on towels. I ought to say how pleased I was recently when I visited Sydney to find the towel-making industry satisfactorily developed. Bond and Company are putting out a splendid article under the protection afforded by the tariff of 1921. They are making what are known in the trade as terry towels, but they arc not making what are known as honeycomb, huckerback, or crash towellings. Will these towels come in under the duty obtaining hitherto if they are finished towels ? </para>

                    <para>. -  The Minister stated that he hopes these goods will be manufactured from Australian-grown cotton; but as I am a representative of what is known as the &#34; Dixieland &#34; of Australia - Central Queensland - I should like to know how the industry will be affected if raw cotton is to be admitted free. It seems anomalous to impose high Customs duties on cotton goods, and pay a bounty to stimulate the production of cotton in Australia whilst at the same time we admit raw cotton free and cotton yarn at a low rate of duty. I hope that before very long Queensland, at any rate, will be in a position to supply Australia&#39;s requirements of raw cotton. </para>

                    <para>. -  If milling silk is used to meet the lavish requirements of those with a somewhat refined taste, I do not see why it should be admitted free of duty. I suggest that this is possibly an article on which revenue could be obtained, which is in keeping with my previous declaration that anything in the nature of a luxury or a non-essential should be heavily taxed. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit this request in the interests  of  the copper-mining industry, which at present  is in  a particularly bad state. Scrap-iron and steel are used in leaching copper, and if the industry  is to  receive consideration, and men are to be kept  in  employment, the importation of these materials free of duty would be  of  some assistance. I trust the  Minister will  explain the necessity for imposing these duties, seeing that prior  to  the introduction  of  this tariff scrap-iron and steel  were  admitted free. Honorable senators representing States in  which  copper mining  is  being undertaken should  support  my request,  and  thus assist  in  giving necessary relief  to  the industry. </para>
