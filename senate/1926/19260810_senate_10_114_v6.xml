          <para>. - I had almost finished my remarks on this subject when we adjourned on Friday. I &#34;was then about to make a few comments on the Australian Commonweal&#39;th Shipping Line. When the bill relating to the Line was before this chamber, I advocated that accounts covering the operations of the Line should be taken out every six months, and if it were found that the Line was losing money, which I felt sure would be the case, the Government should sell the ships, and get out of the business. Considerable time has elapsed since then, and it seems to me that my prophecy has been fully borne out. There is no doubt that the Line has been losing money, and the disquieting part of the whole business is&#39; that, whilst a number of ships have been sold, we have no assurance that the. money received from their sale has not been absorbed in meeting the general losses that have been incurred, instead of being applied to a reduction of the capital indebtedness of the Line. My attention was particularly directed to this subject by an article in the well-known British shipping journal <inline font-style="italic">Fair Play,</inline> in which the following appears: - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>It now appears that, during the twelve  months  ending 31st. March, 1925, the gross earnings of the lino amounted to &#163;1,831,640, and the expenses to &#163;1,967,462, showing a loss of &#163;135,813, to which has to be added &#163;94,317, office expenses. After allowing for brokerage fees and various commissions, the loss for the year is &#163;209,364; but, if depreciation and debenture interest are added, it is increased to &#163;593,879. It is stated that during the year 65 complete voyages were made by 24 vessels, which resulted in a deficit of &#163;130,459, while additional losses on voyages completed during the previous year, together with laid-up expenses during the year, totalled &#163;5,354, making the &#163;135,813 referred to above, lt is pointed out that the Bay steamers and chartered vessels made a profit of &#163;41,938, the remaining  boats  losing &#163;177,751, exclusive of depreciation. The capital value of the fleet on the 1st April, 1924, was &#163;4,103,000, from which has to he deducted &#163;195.000 for steamers sold during the year, and &#163;200,445 for depreciation, leaving it at &#163;3,921,685 on the 31st March last year. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is a loss that I do not think honorable senators would like to see continued. It has been stated that the line exerts considerable influence on the rates of freight, but I venture to say that it does not. Freights have been brought down recently without pressure .being brought to bear upon them by the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line. My advice now, as it was three years ago, is that the Government should sell out and get out of the shipping business as quickly as possible. </para>

          <para>.- The general tenor of the discussion up to the present time has been one of utter condemnation of the budget, even by the Government&#39;s own supporters, and I think that it is due to me, or some other honorable senator, to say a word or two in support of the Ministry that has suffered such severe castigation at the hands of its friends. No Government can escape criticism or even condemnation at times, and probably I shall have something to say along those lines ; but I believe that it has done some good things, as well as some that it would have, been better to have left undone. I commend it for the attitude it adopted in introducing special legislation last session to protect the public from the contamination of a few individuals who wanted to dictate the policy of not only the Government, but also the country. I believe, too, that its proposal to seek increased powers for the Commonwealth Parliament is to be commended. I join issue, however, with Ministers regarding some of the. matters submitted to Parliament, since they might easily jeopardize the success of the referendum proposals. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> in the budget speech, spoke of the prosperity of Australia, but I doubt whether the country is really prosperous. We may be living in a fool&#39;s paradise and enjoying a fictitious prosperity. The Commonwealth and State debts have now reached the enormous total of about &#163;1,000,000,000, or closely approaching &#163;200 per head of the population. The Treasurer used figures, to support his argument, showing that there was an increased number of depositors in the savings banks, and that the sum deposited per head had also largely increased. But that is not an evidence of real prosperity. In view of the huge expenditure of borrowed money, it&#39; would be surprising if the working classes and the general community could not show a credit balance in the savings banks. The Federal and State Parliaments should cease visiting the pawnshop: they should, so far as is possible, discontinue public borrowing. Australia pays her way and balances her trade overseas by exporting a few commodities, particularly wool and wheat. A period of low prices for these two commodities would soon bring Australia face to face with a very serious problem: our apparent prosperity would then be shown to be fictitious. In this morning&#39;s press I noticed a statement by the Tariff Board which is pregnant with meaning. It bears out what, on many occasions,  I have told the Senate and the country, namely, that a high tariff increases wages, and that those higher wages make further duties inevitable. Those increased duties necessitate still higher wages; and so the vicious circle is pursued. We cannot forever continue in this way; we must cry a halt. The worker and the manufacturer must both be told that this state of affairs can no longer be permitted. I am glad that the Government proposes to send an industrial delegation to the United States of America, where there is a higher standard of living than we have in Australia, and where the highest wages of any country in the world are paid. </para>

            <para>- Statistics, which are our only guide, show that wages in the United States of America, whether taken on the daily or yearly basis, are the highest effective wages of any country in the world, notwithstanding that in that country there is no industrial machinery such as we have here. High wages in the United States of America may be due to a greater application of mechanical aids to the workmen than there are in this country.&#39; I cannot think that they are due to greater efficiency on the part of the workmen themselves. I claim that Australian workmen can more than hold their own with those of any other country. Moreover, the prosperity- of the United States of America is, to a large extent, the result of a more general adoption of the system of piece-work. The Government is acting wisely in sending a delegation to the United States of America to ascertain the cause of that country&#39;s great prosperity. The reason that unemployment is not now, and never has been, a problem in the United States of America is .in itself well worthy of investigation. </para>

        <para>I have rejoiced to see that honorable senators, irrespective of party, have adopted an independent attitude in their criticism of the Government&#39;s proposals. 1 should be glad if they would go further and register an independent vote. The Senate was once an independent Chamber. It was created to conserve the interests of the States, and to review the legislation passed by another place. From those high ideals it has departed. With the passing of time, the Senate has become a mere gramophone, repeating the policy of the Government and the decisions of another place to an extent that is to be deplored. I should like the Senate to assert its authority and to regain its vanished prestige. It should adopt an independent attitude, instead of bowing down abjectly before the party Joss, and sacrificing all those great principles of independent judgment which the framers of the Constitution expected of it. </para>

        <para>I wish to make a few remarks regarding the proposed alteration in the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and States. I followed closely and with interest the remarks which were made the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell.</inline> I did not read the debate which took place on the Surplus Revenue Act of 1910, but I have gone pretty carefully through those of the convention of 1898. The most serious problem which confronted the members of the convention was the financial relationship of the States and the Commonwealth. &#39; That occupied a good deal of the time of both the convention and the different sub-committees which were appointed, and finally, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> informed the Senate, a compromise was effected which formed the basis of federation. That compromise, which subsequently resulted in the payment of a capitation grant of 25s. per head, embodied the intentions of tie framers of the Constitution, and is the true basis of the Federal union. Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland would not have federated had they not been absolutely assured of some fixed and secure payments towards their revenues. </para>

            <para>- That is not my argument. I say that the obligations of the States, as well as of the Commonwealth, were considerably increased. My main concern is the way in which the proposed alteration in the financial relationship of the two authorities is likely to affect the States. The Commonwealth Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has said that, under this scheme, each State will be &#163;50,000 a year better off than under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grant. I understand that it is not the intention of the Government to submit, to Parliament this session a measure embodying the proposals, but that it is withholding it for twelve months to ascertain the actual amount of revenue that can be collected during the ensuing year, so that the States will know exactly what revenue they can derive. That will not be a fair test. No State government will be able to collect by means of the land tax, the probate duties, and 40 per cent, of the income tax, the amount that the Commonwealth is able to collect under existing conditions. A taxpayer who has assets in Tasmania, Queensland, and other States can be compelled to furnish to the Commonwealth a true return of his income in all States, but no State has either the machinery or the authority to pursue him beyond its own borders. </para>

            <para>- I have not been able to find where any allowance has been made for it. Although the Commonwealth Treasurer has said that it does not represent a very big sum, it will mean some loss to the States. There is a further weakness in these proposals. The Commonwealth Government is able to impose a land tax. The Governments of the States will experience difficulty in inducing their Legislative Councils to assent to a measure providing for the taxation of land; and, even if such a measure were passed, the rate would not  be as high as that which is charged by the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- Apart from that aspect of the matter, I contend that the State &#39; Governments will not be able to raise the amount estimated by the Commonwealth Treasurer. It is self-evident that they will be severe losers by the proposed alteration, and I am, therefore, opposed to it. But I am not opposed to some modification of the financial relationship of the Commonwealth and the States. A better scheme can be evolved, and provision for it is actually made in the Commonwealth Constitution. Section 105 of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth may take over any portion of the State debts, although formally it was able to take over only the State debts which existed at the time of federation. When a referendum was taken in 1909, on a fixed payment of 25s. per head to the States, and on the question of the State debts, a fixed payment to &#39; the States was defeated by a small number, but the proposal in regard to State debts was endorsed by the Commonwealth electors. The words in section 105 of the Constitution, which provided that the Commonwealth could take over the State debts &#34; as existing at the time of federation,&#34; were then excised, leaving it open to the Commonwealth to take over  any portion of the debts of the various States. When the Commonwealth&#39;s financial arrangements with the States are altered, the Government should take over a proportion of the State debts. This is not only a constitutional provision, but it was endorsed by a vote of the people. Such a scheme is sound in principle as the Commonwealth, with the assistance of the Loan Council, would then have some control over the future borrowings of the States. The continual run on the pawn&#39; shop is one of the greatest evils with which we are faced to-day. I may be told that the Loan Council does not function effectively, because New South Wales has refused to be represented upon it, but the present Government of New South Wales will not always be in office, and when a wiser and more reasonable Government comes into power, it will appoint a representative to the Loan Council. We shall then be able to reach the ideal of the founders of federation, and effectively control future State borrowings. </para>

        <para class="block">Is is certainly worth waiting a few years, if there is a possibility of making a better arrangement than the one proposed. For the reasons I have given, and owing to the fact that the State Governments will not be able to raise the same amount of revenue as the Commonwealth does from various sources of taxation, I hope the Government will abandon its proposed financial arrangements. If the States cannot secure sufficient revenue under the proposed system to balance their budgets, and there is a loss on the aggregation of incomes or on land taxation, the result will be that those who have all their assets in one State will have to carry an unnecessarily heavy burden. The primary producers in particular will be more heavily penalized than under existing conditions, and I warn the members and supporters of the Country party of the inevitable consequences. I am surprised that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> who has ruined the Country party, and who is now threatening to bring about the downfall of the Government, should pursue such a foolish policy. </para>
        <para>It was my intention to refer at some length to the Navigation Act, but, apart from a few observations which I shall make at this juncture, I shall reserve further comment until the Appropriation Evil is before the Senate. An alarming statement was made in the press a few days ago, to the effect that our mercantile marine is decreasing to such an extent that our coastal passenger tonnage has been reduced by 80,000 to 100,000 tons during the last year or. so. The Navigation Act was passed to encourage the mercantile marine, but the effect of its operations has been to penalize almost every section of the community. The act should be amended in the direction of easing the coastal provisions so that our interstate and intra-state trade will be profitably carried on, and the produce of primary industries enabled to reach the market as rapidly and as cheaply as possible. </para>
        <para>We have to ask ourselves the serious question of whether Australia is really prosperous, and if the Federal Government is not departing from the real functions of federation. It was never intended that the Commonwealth Government should embark upon a roads policy, or undertake a housing scheme. These are works which the States can effectively perform. </para>

        <para>At a recent conference of Health authorities, the statement was made that during the last seventeen years no fewer than 70,000 people had died in Australia from cancer. That is a most alarming statement. This subject should receive immediate attention at the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. Here is an opportunity for research work. Coupled with cancer, is that other dread disease, tuberculosis. The statistics show that during the last seven years between 25,000 and 26,000 persons have died in Australia from that disease, which is well designated the White Plague. Some spasmodic attempts have been made to check it, but, unfortunately, lack of funds has prevented anything from being done on an extensive scale. Any proposal for the treatment of tuberculosis should include adequate provision for dependants of sufferers. Clinical observation, hospital treatment, and sanitoria are essential features in any scheme to deal with it. Unfortunately, tuberculosis is very prevalent in mining .centres where men are obliged to work under more or less unhealthy conditions. In Bendigo we  have established an X-ray laboratory, a sanatorium and hospital- accommodation, but, as I have stated, the stumbling block is then  necessary  financial provision for the maintenance of dependants. I trust that the Government will give this subject careful consideration, and devise some scheme to forward the movement. </para>
        <para>Yesterday I was privileged to attend a lecture delivered by Colonel Pottinger, who recently completed a tour of 20,000 miles through India, and I wa3 impressed by statements which he made as to the  possibility  of opening un the Indian market for our surplus primary products. Colonel Pottinger stated that at present the market is being supplied by the United States of America. Since India is much nearer to Australia than to America, we should be able to secure a good footing there.. During the war the native population acquired a taste for European food products, particularly flour and fruit. We should take advantage of our proximity to that market and seek to develop our . trade in that country. Standardization of all labels is important,  because  the natives buy mostly on the label. Colonel Pottinger stated that on one occasion when he wished to give a present to one of his Indian servants, he gave him a choice of three knives. One pocket knife was a combination affair, with which we are familiar, but to his:  surprise  the native chose a smaller knife. He gave as his . reason that it was a Rodgers cast steel knife. That brand, I understand, is well known to the natives, &#34;who believe it to be the best article of its kind produced. </para>
        <para>Recently, Australian  apples  have been a glut on the English market. The landed cost, exclusive of orchard charges, is about 8s. 7d. a case from Tasmania, and 8s. 4d. from the mainland, and yet they -were sold at from 5s. to 9s. a case. &#39;If, owing to our distance, -or to the fact that our season clashes with the season in countries that are nearer to Great Britain, we are unable to dispose of any of our surplus primary products at a profit on the London market, we should consider the possibility of developing trade with India. </para>
        <para>On several occasions I have directed attention to the policy of the Pensions Department in withholding a certain  pro  portion of pension payments in cases where pensioners are inmates of public institutions. The practice. is to pay 10s. 6d. to the institution, and 4s. to the pensioner and to retain the balance. In the budget statement, the liability on .account of invalid and old-age pensions is stated at &#163;1 a week, and the excuse is made that where pensioners are inmates of a public institution, it is necessary to retain some portion of the amount to cover administrative expenses. It should be less costly  to  pay a number of pensioners by one cheque than to distribute the amount of pension money -to a large number of individuals. I have been supplied with the following particulars of Victorian institutions which provide homes for invalid and old-age pensioners: -  </para>

        <para class="block">As a general rule, the old people only become inmates of such institutions when they are unable to look after themselves. Consequently, their maintenance is more costly than otherwise it would be.

        <para>Not long ago we passed a measure authorizing the payment of &#163;25,000 for assistance to mining, but as &#163;10,000 of that amount will be paid in respect of operations in the Northern Territory, only &#163;15,000 will be available for the development of mining throughput the Commonwealth. The whole of it could, with advantage, be spent on one mine. The Government would be well advised to provide a much larger vote, if it wishes the industry to be revived. </para>
        <para>Recently, also, we passed a measure for the payment of 4d. a gallon on the production of power alcohol from cassava. I opposed that proposal on the ground that it was not comprehensive enough. If bounty is to be paid on the production of power alcohol, it should not be restricted to one source of production, but should be paid irrespective of the substance from which it is produced. It could be manufactured from the huge heaps of sawdust that lie at the timber mills in the forests, and also from the refuse of the  canefields  and the wine presses. If its production from all sources were- encouraged, Australia would be in a fairly independent position in the event of the stocks of petrol from over-&#39; seas being withheld. I commend the Government for the work it has done during the session, and I am confident that the electors will be satisfied that it has made every  effort  to comply with the mandate given by them. </para>

          <para class="block">Provision is made in the measure for a comprehensive scheme of road-construction throughout Australia from funds to be made available by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States, on the basis of &#163;1 being paid by the Commonwealth for every 15s. contributed by the States. The agreement, which is embodied in the bill, was arrived at by negotiation between the Commonwealth and State Governments, in conference and by correspondence, and the proposal of the Commonwealth Government to make available, under the conditions set out in the agreement, &#163;20,000,000 for allocation to the States on the basis of three-fifths population and two-fifths area, was fully discussed. While the Government realizes that road -construction generally comes within the jurisdiction of the State Governments, it recognizes, also, that, in view of the rapid development of motor transport, the provision of suitable roads has now become a problem of national importance, and of too great magnitude for the various State Governments to handle without the aid of the national Government. The following statement sets out the amounts allocated on the &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis to each of the States, in pursuance of the main road grants from 1923 to 1926, the commitments entered into, and the actual expenditure up to the end of the last financial year: - </para>

          <para>It will be noted that the total actual expenditure amounts to &#163;1,316,580. This sum includes only that expenditure which &#39; has been finally examined and passed by the Auditor-General. A considerable sum has been expended, the audit of which has not yet been completed. In addition to the sums allotted from the grants amounting to &#163;1,500,000, the Government, during last year, made a further grant of &#163;250,000 to the States, free of any contribution by the States, for expenditure on the reconditioning of existing roads. The allocation of the whole of this additional money has been approved, which indicates that the States have taken full advantage of the grants and that the expenditure is proceeding at a satisfactory rate.&#39; Considerable benefit has accrued to Australia as a result of the assistance rendered to the States under the Main Roads Development Acts. The expenditure of these moneys, together with the corresponding State contributions, has resulted in the following works being completed : - </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">Those works could not otherwise have been completed for years to come. The bulk of the expenditure has been incurred on entirely new roads, requiring in many cases complete surveys, and relocation of proposed roads, in localities varying from wet, hilly, heavily-timbered country to dry, sandy, and open plains. The Commonwealth and State authorities have co-operated in every possible way, with a view to securing the best results from the moneys made available. As to the proposal to make available to the States the sum of &#163;20,000,000 for expenditure on roads over a period of ten years, as set out&#39; in the bill and the agreement attached thereto, the intentions of the Government in this connexion were referred to in the policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister in October, 1925. I need not enlarge. on the necessity for good roads, nor refer to the handicaps which are being . experienced in this connexion in every part of the Commonwealth. In the United States of America, the&#39; central government has fully realized the necessity for encouraging the expansion of the road system throughout the union. It endorses the view that the progress of a nation depends largely on the reduction of its transport costs and the facilities provided for the economical and expeditious marketing of its products. Up to the end of June, 1925, the total length of Federal-aid roads completed in the United States of America, since the Federal Aid Road Act came into operation in 1916, was 46,485 miles. The mileage of the roads under construction and nearing completion was over 12,000. The appropriation of Feder.al funds for this purpose amounted to some &#163;100,000,000. It is proposed, under the Federal-aid highways system of the United States of America to construct some 200,000 miles of highways, the Federal Government&#39;s contribution towards the cost of which will be on the basis of &#163;1 for every &#163;1 of State expenditure. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> H. MacDonald, chief of the United States Bureau of Public Roads, describes highway transport as the &#34; new great force in our national life.&#34; At the International Road Congress, held at Seville  in 1923, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Riggs stated that &#39; &#39; the problem in transportation in the United Spates of America was the most vital thing in the nation to-day.&#34; If this is true with regard to America, which is within a week&#39;s journey of the European markets, how much greater must be its application to Australia with its great distances from the sea-board, practically devoid of natural waterways, and five weeks&#39; sail from the world&#39;s greatest markets? While the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States cannot hope at the present time to undertake a scheme approaching the magnitude of that adopted in the United States of America, it is claimed that the proposals now submitted will provide a system of Federal aid roads which will be of inestimable value to the Commonwealth generally. The proposals were fully discussed at a conference of Ministers representing the Commonwealth, and the six States which sat in Melbourne in February last, the agreement embodied in the bill being the outcome of those discussions. The scheme proposed will, in effect, be the first instalment, and will form the basis of a national roads system. When completed, it will be capable of extension in such a manner that the whole of our future roads construction .will dovetail into the works now proposed. The scheme is an amplification of that which has been in existence for the last three years. It will be found that the general plan will include most of .those sections of roads which have already been completed, and will, to that extent, shorten the length of many roads which will be included in the general scheme to be undertaken under these proposals. No scheme of this magnitude has ever been undertaken, or even contemplated in Australia previously. It involves an expenditure of &#163;35,000,000 over a period of ten years. The agreement was arrived at after very lengthy conferences and consultations with representatives of the States. It is -wrong to suggest that only country districts will benefit from the construction of good roads under the agreement. Roads in country districts that are good enough to carry motor traffic are largely used by motorists from the cities.. The cities, also, will benefit in the highest degree, because good roads mean cheaper transport, and cheaper transport means cheaper food and raw materials for the residents of the cities. Cities and city motorists will thus derive direct benefit from the construction of good roads in the country districts. Further, it is only just that the cities should contribute through the tariff to the welfare of sparsely settled areas, seeing that the cities obtain so much benefit from the tariff in the shape of thriving industries and increased population. The road policy is a national one, providing that the more highly developed and wealthy parts of the country should contribute something to the welfare of the less developed districts. It is impracticable and absurd to expect that, in a country like Australia, each area or each section of the community shall look after only its own needs. Clause 1 of the agreement reads - </para>

              <para>- It is a matter not of dictation, but of arrangement. It is very necessary that many of the lengths of really good roads that were laid down in the State some years ago should be re-conditioned; and the State is, by itself, unable to recondition them. The. Minister for the time being would, in all probability, permit Tasmania to spend up to 75 per cent, of the amount provided on the reconditioning of existing roads. But of the total amount provided, there must not be less than 25 per cent, spent on the construction of new roads. So far, there has been no interference with the States. The whole of the proposals for the construction of new roads with the assistance of money provided . by the Commonwealth have originated with the States. We stipulate in regard to roads, the grade, the width of the road, and the depth of metal. In the first place, a scheme for five years will be drawn up by the States themselves. Each State will submit its own proposal to the Road Board. </para>

              <para>- That power is limited. The municipalities are not bound to do it. Assuming that a mile of new road was required to be constructed within a town at a cost of &#163;3,500, the Commonwealth&#39;s contribution towards that amount, would be &#163;2,000, and the State&#39;s contribution &#163;1,500. The State would be able to recoup itself from the municipality to the extent of 50 per cent, of the &#163;1,500. The Government does not intend that the States shall make a levy on the municipalities for roads outside the boundaries of towns. One can readily visualize long stretches of road which pass through poor country, where the municipalities, if they were called upon to contribute &#163;500 or &#163;750 a mile for 15 or 20 miles of road, would not be able to take advantage of the offer of Commonwealth money. In that case, there would be a break in the continuity of the road, and the object of the scheme would be frustrated. Clause 8, sub-clause 1, reads - </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Duncan</inline>did not exercise his powers of observation, or he would have realized that the Minister made a very effective speech. &#39; At the outset of my remarks, I admit the necessity for having good main roads. Although our opinions regarding the means that should be adopted for defraying the expenditure may be divided, I think I can say without fear of contradiction by any of my honorable friends opposite, that we are all agreed as to the necessity for having good main roads. The development and prosperity of the Commonwealth depend, to a large extent, upon that provision being made. I shall&#39;, therefore, support the second reading of this measure. It must not, however, be concluded that I speak for my party.. I have simply stated my own opinion. Doubtless other honorable senators who sit on this side hold different opinions, and will give expression to their views. There are one or two matters to which it might be as well if I called attention. The scheme embodies too many provisos, and there does not appear to be anything definite about it. </para>

              <para>- With my colleague, I admit that this Government has been proceeding in a somewhat indefinite way, and hedging its proposals to such an extent that we scarcely know where we are; but I must be candid and say that, with such a huge area to develop, we must give our attention to the construction of good main roads. I realize that this measure will be of assistance to the State of Western Australia, which contains a vast territory that successive governments have had extreme difficulty in developing. </para>

              <para>- I accept the rebuke of my colleague. I may have &#34; slipped &#34; as a Federalist, in the same way that my colleague, as a Himalayan protectionist, &#34; slipped &#34; on corsets when we were discussing the tariff recently. There are at least three phases of the question of main roads to which one may refer without having levelled against him the accusation of being a States-righter ; they are defence, transport, and the opening up of the country. It is well known that one of the planks in the platform of the Labour party is the provision of good main roads and railways for purposes of defence. I abhor the mention of war, but dealing with the proposal from a defence viewpoint, the rapid transport of. troops in the event of an invasion must be considered. Australia is essentially a primary producing country. Fully 95 per cent of our produce consists of primary products, and as our primary producers have to rely upon rapid and cheap transport to enable them to profitably market their commodities, good roads are essential. There are still large tracts of uncultivated land that could be opened up if good roads were constructed, and as development follows the building pf railways&#39;, increased settlement should follow the construction of good roads. I do not know if it is still proposed that townships with a population of over 5.000 should be excluded from the benefits provided under the bill. Clause 7 of the agreement reads: - </para>

              <para>- Yes. At the moment, I am thinking more particularly of the road from Perth to. Fremantle through Claremont which is an important municipality in Western Australia. There is also Subiaco, and as these and other municipalities have to defray the cost of maintaining the main roads passing through them, some relief should be afforded. If the Government persists with its proposal to continue collecting an additional 2d. a gallon on petrol, fully 70 per cent, of the money will be provided by the users of roads in the metropolitan area. During the election campaign last year, the Prime Minister said that the Government would make available to the States &#163;20,000,000 over a period of ten years, for the construction of roads, but it was understood that the money would be obtained from ordinary Customs revenue, which in 1925 was buoyant. It was thought that the cost of a main roads scheme would be paid .out of revenue without a special impost such a i is now being collected. The public works departments of the States should also be entrusted with the control of the construction of main roads without the intervention of the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways, as hitherto when the - Commonwealth Government undertook the construction of  any  Commonwealth work within a State, the Public Works Department of the State became the supervisor for the Commonwealth. Invariably, the advice of the State authorities is adopted by the Commonwealth. In this instance, however, the whole work is held ur&#62; until the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways approves. </para>

But I am afraid that under this measure the State Governments may be prevented from spending money on roads which, in their opinion, are most urgently needed. As I said at the outset, I speak for myself only. Other honorable senators on this side will, no doubt, express their  own views on this important subject. </para>

I do not intend to traverse the whole of the ground covered by those honorable senators, because their -speeches dealt largely with the desirability of good roads in Australia. Every one will agree that the provision of good roads is of the utmost importance. But that is not by any means the whole question which we have to consider.- When I was speaking on the budget a few days ago I intimated that I would oppose the Government&#39;s roads proposals. My first reason for objecting to the bill&#39; is that, in my opinion as. a lawyer, the proposals are unconstitutional. That is a matter about which I have no doubt whatever. I may add that my opinion is- endorsed by that of every other lawyer who has publicly expressed his views upon this subject, including even the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham),</inline> as I shall show. </para>

He stated in unequivocal language that that measure was unconstitutional. He takes a. different view of this bill, although, as a matter of fact, it is similar to the measure dealt with last year. This bill, he says, is all right, because it provides for financial assistance to the States.

              <para>- Undoubtedly, the Commonwealth Government has full power with regard to defence. If it wished, it could have brought in this bill as a measure to provide for the construction of certain roads for strategic purposes. If the proposals were based upon those considerations, to use the words of the Attorney-General, they would be within the power of the Constitution. </para>

Section 96 of the Constitution contemplates the granting of financial assistance only to States that need it and make application for it. </para>

              <para>- I shall reduce that argument to an absurdity. If it were sound, the Commonwealth could enter any State sphere. It could, for instance, with regard to education, say to the States, &#34; You require monetary help ; we are going to give it to you and dictate the terms under which that assistance is to be given and the policy to be adopted. It is absurd to argue in that way. To put my arguments consecutively, I contend that section 96 presupposes two things - that there is a State in. need of financial assistance, and that it applies to the Commonwealth Government for it. Then the Commonwealth is to inquire into the merits of the case, and grant such assistance as it thinks necessary, and upon such terms as it thinks fit. Every honorable senator must admit that the sphere of the States is being invaded by the Commonwealth Parliament. I do not see how it can be argued otherwise. It cannot be maintained that the Commonwealth has a right to interfere with the States in the matter of road construction, or maintenance. Under the Constitution this Parliament has strictly limited powers which are enumerated and particularized in the Constitution itself. Whatever powers are not expressly conferred by it are withheld, and those powers are exercisable by the States. The power with regard to roads is not conferred upon the Commonwealth by the Constitution; consequently, it is a power withheld and a power exercisable by the States. </para>

            <para>This money is being spent upon a basis involving a consideration of both area and population. The result is that the States, which have already developed their territory from their own funds, are now being called upon to assist in the development of States which are larger, and whose development commenced later. It may be that this is a proper thing; that the main roads should be a charge upon the whole of the people of Australia, instead of on the people of the several States; but in that case this matter should be considered by the whole of the people of Australia. If they want this Parliament to deal with our main roads, let them say so. </para>

              <para>-&#39; No. He is the Attorney-General in the Ministry that is taking this action; he practically has the Commonwealth Government for a client. It is a case of special pleading. How does he try to distinguish the present proposal from that of 1925 ? All he says is that the present measure grants financial assistance to the States, and under section 96 of the Constitution it is possible to do that. In 1925, however, he dealt with that very point, and said that there was no escape from the fact that since the States were not in need the matter was not covered by that section of the Constitution. </para>

No less an authority than the Attorney-General himself said that a bill which was on all-fours with this was unconstitutional. I defy any lawyer to distinguish between that bill and the one now before us. The opinion of the Attorney-General and of the Crown Law officers of Victoria and South Australia, as well as of eminent outside counsel employed . by both Governments is that the action proposed to be taken is unconstitutional. I repeat that, before voting on this measure, every honorable senator should satisfy himself as to its constitutionality. It would appear that some honorable senators, whose States want the 5116 <inline font-style="italic">Federal Aid</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Roads Bill.</inline> money, and have signed the agreement, are afraid to face the question, fearing that if they do so, they must come to the conclusion arrived at by the Attorney-General last year in relation to a similar measure.

The Senate is not merely a house of second thought; it was established primarily to preserve the rights of the States. No duty is more pressing on honorable senators than that of satisfying themselves regarding the constitutionality of the Government&#39;s proposals, particularly when they threaten the sovereign rights of the States. That is the position which now confronts us. The sovereign rights of the States are being threatened by the unconstitutional proposals of the Government. Honorable senators should vote according to their convictions ; and if they do so in relation to this measure, they must decide  that it is unconstitutional. </para>

For this legislation to be constitutional, the States must be in need, and must apply to the Commonwealth for assistance. </para>

A State Government could enter into an agreement with the Imperial Government to borrow money; it might even submit to conditions and terms; but that would be entirely different from the position here. In this case the Commonwealth Government is forcing the hands of the States. Although the .Commonwealth Government might be willing to make money available to the States for road construction and maintenance, it should not attempt to lay down the terms under which that money shall be spent. It should not attempt to dictate the policy of the States; yet that is what is intended in this legislation. </para>

              <para>- The position of the State which does not accept the money will be similar to that occupied by South Australia when the Commonwealth Government made advances for wire netting. South Australia already had its own legislation dealing with grants for wire netting, and refused to come under the Commonwealth scheme ; nevertheless, that State had to contribute towards the cost of providing wire netting to land-holders in the other States. </para>

I cannot understand any State placing itself in the humiliating position which the acceptance of this agreement would involve. Although South Australia is now controlled by a Labour Government, I congratulate that State upon the stand it has taken in this matter. The Government of South Australia, in view of the opinion of its Crown law officers, as well as of independent eminent counsel, that this legislation is unconstitutional, has rejected the Government&#39;s proposals. It is not a question of the States wanting the money, but rather the intrusion by the Commonwealth into the sphere of the States. The States might be in dire need of the money ; but some of them are not prepared to accept it from the Commonwealth if to do so means that they are condoning an unconstitutional action by which the Commonwealth will dictate their policy. </para>

          <para>Let me refer again to a matter upon which I touched when I was discussing the motion for the printing of the Estimates and budget-papers for 1926-27 ; that is, the inconsistency of the Commonwealth Government. When it advanced its proposals for the re-adjust ment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States it said, &#34;We ask you to accept these proposals, because they are based upon the sound principle that each Government should be responsible for the raising of the money that it spends, and the .States should be made as independent as possible of the Commonwealth.&#34; Yet it now insists upon raising money for the States to spend. Is that in accordance with the sound principle which it. then laid down for its own guidance and the guidance of Parliament? Consider its second proposition - that the States should be made as independent as possible of the Commonwealth. This scheme proposes to make the States dependent upon the Commonwealth for&#39; portion of their roads requirements. Instead of doing that, the Government ought to retire from the field of direct taxation and to that extent allow the States to raise additional revenues with which they could supplement their present road proposals. </para>

              <para>- That is not necessarily so. The States will probably reduce the amount that they would otherwise spend by a sum equal to that which they receive from the Commonwealth. The taxing power of the States must be reduced in proportion to the additional taxation that is imposed by the &#39; Commonwealth, because the revenue is taken from the same taxpayers. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HENRY</inline>BARWELL.That is a matter which, under the Constitution, can be dealt with by the Commonwealth. I point out that these proposals are a direct violation of what the Commonwealth Government said were sound principles, to be observed in the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Road construction and maintenance are essentially local and provincial matters. Even the States themselves adopt the policy of decentralization and leave these matters largely in the control of district councils. What is the best policy to pursue? The States know far better than the Commonwealth what their requirements are in regard to road construction and maintenance, what money is necessary to meet those requirements, and how it can best be raised and expended. The money for this grant will have to be raised by the imposition of special taxation, provision for which is made in a separate bill. I, therefore, confine myself to the argument that the bill is unconstitutional; and that, even if it is not unconstitutional, interference by the Commonwealth in this sphere of the States is unnecessary; because the matter can be handled far better by the Governments of the States and their local governing bodies. Again, if the Commonwealth insists on advancing to the States, money to bc spent upon that which, according to the .terms of the Constitution, is entirely within the jurisdiction of the States, it should not lay down conditions governing the expenditure of that money. I understand that the States are to be practically forced to accept this grant. The amount is to be allocated among the various States on a population and area - basis. Any State which refuses to accept it is to be treated like a spoilt child who refuses food; the amount allotted to it is to be held in the trust fund until the sulks pass. </para>

It is of the utmost importance, because in it is involved the constitutionality or otherwise of the action of the Commonwealth. The present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> said last year, as a private member, that the action which the Government then took along similar lines was unconstitutional. That opinion is supported by leading counsel throughout Australia. I again appeal to honorable senators to endeavour to arrive at a proper decision upon the question whether the action of the Government is constitutional. But, apart altogether fr.m that aspect, they should resist any encroachment by the Commonwealth upon the rights <inline font-style="italic">rf</inline> the States, and any usurpation of powers which, under the Constitution, are conferred upon the States; and they should frustrate the determined effort which is being made to bring to the feet of the Commonwealth the States and their people. </para>

            <para>.- I listened with very great interest to the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell.</inline> He has given serious consideration to this bill, but particularly to one aspect of it which apparently some honorable senators are disposed to treat with levity. I refer to the constitutional position. The honorable senator ranks high in the legal profession, and in a measure he has staked his professional reputation on the opinion that what this bill proposes to do will be found to be unconstitutional. He has backed that up with the opinion of other legal authorities. Some honorable senators have said that the representatives of the States have in a measure expressed their approbation of the main provisions of the bill, and that some of the States are without hesitancy prepared to accept anything in the way of financial assistance that the Commonwealth Government is disposed to offer them. Why is that so? It is because they need the money? When the representatives of some of the States accepted the offer which was made by the Commonwealth Government they believed that no responsibility or liability would be incurred by them. </para>

              <para>- I do not intend to argue the constitutional question involved. I speak merely as a layman. Some honorable senators have said that whether the bill is constitutional or unconstitutional they intend to support it. Why were these offers made by the Commonwealth to the States? Because at that time this Government was embarrassed with riches. If it had more money than it expected to receive, why did it not proceed with development works in its own territory. I give place to no man in my sincere desire to advance the interests of Australia as a whole. I have intense affection for this, the land of my birth, and, if there is one part of Australia about which I am seriously concerned, it is the Northern Territory, which is under the control of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is able to advance money to the States for developmental purposes, but little or no money is available for constructing roads in the Territory under its control. To encourage land settlement a Development and Migration Commission has been appointed, and the Government expects us. to believe that these modern wizards will, with a magic wand, develop Australia as no other four persons possibly could. If we are to accept the utterances of the Minister who introduced the bill under which the commission has been appointed, they will also make Australia safe from a defence view-point. The North Australia Commission has not yet been appointed. </para>

Should not the money which the Government apparently has to offer to the  States for road construction and developmental purposes be spent in the Northern Territory? The Government has disposed of some of its surplus moneys by assisting the States in purchasing wire netting. It is now offering to aid the States in road construction. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> that if the Commonwealth Government can constitutionally assist them in roadmaking, there is nothing to prevent it rendering financial assistance in the matter of educational facilities. The schools in Victoria, for instance, are overcrowded, and that is true, also, I daresay of other States. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but the members of the Labour party tell the people clearly where they stand, whereas this Government speaks only of cooperation and co-ordination of effort with the States. What coordination is there between the Commonwealth Government and the States in connexion with this proposition? In the first place, a majority of the States favoured the scheme until a certain proposition &#39; was put forward. I know the difficulties which beset the people, particularly that section which is settled in the more remote parts of the Commonwealth. If it be true that the Government proposes to help the States financially in the construction of roads by imposing a special tax for the purpose, I shall not support it. To specially tax the users of roads is an antediluvian proposal; in this instance, however, it is not intended to tax all the users of roads. If the&#39; statement published in the newspapers is true, that an additional tax is to be permanently imposed for this purpose, we are going back to the days of the toll-gates. </para>

            <para>. -  The continuous repetition of any statement by a large number of people, and, perhaps, more especially by members of Parliament, not infrequently comes to be regarded as an established truth. In the debate on this bill we have been told over and over again that good roads are highly desirable, the suggestion, of course, being that a considerable number of people hold the opposite opinion. I have never heard any one condemn good roads. On the contrary, every one is in favour of good roads.  This,  however, does not necessarily mean that they approve of any scheme that may be submitted to ensure the construction and maintenance of roads. Most people are in favour of a good system of universal education, but there is a wide difference of opinion as to the details of the curriculum. So it is with regard to many other subjects. Fortunately, honorable senators have not been asked to express an opinion as to the best methods of road-making. The Ministry is asking the Senate to agree to vote a large sum of money annually as a subsidy to the States to enable them to launch out on a comprehensive roadmaking policy. This function, I submit, was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution. It was never anticipated that the revenues of the Commonwealth would be expended in the making of roads. I can quite understand the need for expending Commonwealth money on roads purely for defence purposes, but the granting of a Commonwealth subsidy to the States for the making of roads that should be constructed by the States ought not to be countenanced. The bill is so drafted that no State can very well afford to stand out, because the money will be raised from the people of all the States, and handed over to the latter to be used in the manner indicated. For this reason I believe that ultimately all the States will be obliged to accept the agreement. One would think that the Commonwealth was making a present to the States of the money which it is proposed annually to vote in continuance of this policy. Nothing could be further from the truth. The amount to be provided will be raised by taxation. It would be better if the Commonwealth Government attended to its own business, and &#34;allowed this work of road-making to be carried out by the States. There are many directions in which the Commonwealth could more advantageously expend the money proposed to be raised under this scheme than by handing it back to  the States for road construction. It would be better still if, instead of raising more money by taxation, the Commonwealth reduced taxation by the amount proposed to be expended on these proposals. The Government has no moral right to collect more money than it requires. From time immemorial roadmaking has been regarded as tb.p function solely of local-governing bodies. District roads boards, with power of taxation, have been appointed to carry out the construction of lengthy highways throughout the States, and if further funds have been required the resources of the State have been drawn upon. This bill is a continuation of a policy launched by the Commonwealth Government some time ago to  infere  with work which .properly should be carried out by the States. Since the advent of the motor, roads are now used by people who formerly hardly ever saw them, and, of course, better roads are desirable. But the main question is: Who should pay for them? The bill is discreetly silent upon that point. I should be out of order if I attempted to discuss the means by which the Government proposes to raise the revenue to meet this expenditure, but I should like to point out that one of the immediate results of the making of good roads will be an increase in the value of all lands adjoining or in the vicinity of those roads. </para>

              <para>- It would not be a bad idea, because, with the rapid increase in the population of Melbourne, especially in the direction of Sorrento, it will be necessary before long x&#62; improve the road along the foreshore, and I think I have shown that at least one land-owner would reap a very substantial benefit if that were done. Consequently, instead of the Commonwealth revenue being drawn upon to meet expenditure on these proposed new works, men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and others who own land that might be benefited by good roads, should be called upon to make substantial contributions. But the bill does not propose to do that. It contains no provision to raise money in that way. </para>

              <para>- I agree with you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and I am glad that I was allowed to say as much as I have. I may have an opportunity later this evening, or perhaps early to-morrow morning, to discuss that matter when another bill is before this Chamber. In the meantime, I content myself with stating that the Government proposes to levy heavy taxation upon certain people for the purpose of collecting a large sum of money, which it intends to hand over to the States. Although it might be heresy on my part, and not in accordance with my official view, it is my personal view that the proper authority to expend money is the authority that raises it. I object to the States receiving road grants from the Commonwealth, since taxation for that purpose should be levied by the States themselves. I differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> as to the constitutionality of the proposal. It seems to me that the Commonwealth is entitled, if it so desires, to hand surplus revenue back to the States for road construction or any other purpose, because the actual work is to be done by the States. If, however, the Commonwealth has more revenue than it knows what to do with, i*s proper course is to reduce taxation. The bill should be opposed at every stage, and,, if possible, defeated. </para>

The subject of the  constitutionality  of the proposal has not been considered in a manner calculated to promote the best interests of the object we all appear to have at heart. The present bill diners  considerably  from past practice so far as the relations between the Commonwealth and the States regarding road construction are concerned. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> has been charged with having denounced, as unconstitutional, a- similar proposal in 1925, and with now claiming that the present bill is constitutional. I propose to show that this measure, in certain respects, differs tremendously from the previous bill.

              <para>- Under this bill the Commonwealth is, in no sense, obtruding itself into the matter of road construction, but merely proposes to advance certain money to the States for the purpose of road construction, and to control that expenditure in a certain way. The bill of 1925, however, contained no reference to co-operation with the States, and. in that respect, the present measure distinctly differs from it. The 1925 bill consisted of roads legislation h&#34; the Commonwealth Parliament, but this is a bill for the purpose of appropriating moneys to be handed over to the States on certain conditions which are laid down in the  agreement  contained in the schedule to the bill. It needs no stretch of imagination to reconcile the position under this measure with the constitutional powers of &#163;he Commonwealth, and to show that the power sought to be exercised is constitutional. Apart altogether from the provisions of section 96 of the Constitution, there is a considerable . body of public opinion in this country that holds that the original proposals of the Commonwealth were constitutional on the broad ground that the Government was only appropriating moneys to be spent in a specific way. I know of nothing in the Constitution that prevents the Commonwealth from appropriating moneys for the purpose of building roads. We have been told that the States, not the Commonwealth, are responsible for road construction, but I point out that, in the United States of America, Federal grants for that purpose have been made for a considerable time. It is competent, I maintain, on broad grounds, for this Parliament to appropriate money for this and other purposes. Undoubtedly, this Bill is constitutional, because of the provisions of section 96. </para>

            <para>Even without the express mention of terms and conditions, the Parliament, as the party in whose discretion it is to either grant or refuse assistance, would have been able to make its own terms. But though apparently superfluous, the words are not really so. They help to place beyond doubt the intention of the section, and make it clear that the discretion of the Parliament is absolute, and that no duty is imposed upon it of giving assistance without demur and without enquiry, whenever assistance may be asked. The section is not intended to diminish the responsibility of State Treasurers, or to introduce a regular system of grants in aid. Its object is to strengthen the financial position of the Commonwealth in view of possible contingencies, by affording an escape from any excessive rigidity of the financial clauses. It is for use as a safety-valve, not as an open vent; and it does not contemplate financial difficulties, any more than a safety-valve contemplates explosions. </para>

          <para class="block">It has been contended this evening that before section 96 can operate there must be some approach on the part of the States. With that statement I venture to disagree entirely. It is for the Commonwealth to say whether it thinks that States require assistance, for what purpose, and in what quarter. In the present case the Commonwealth Government has said to the States: &#34; We think you require assistance in the development of your roads.&#34; What section of the community does not agree with that view of the Government? There is an express provision in the Constitution, it is true, in relation to railways, but not in regard to roads, and that fact may be used as an argument against me. But throughout the Constitution we find that this assistance is always to be given with the consent of the States. Paragraph xxxiv of section 51, refers to &#34;Railway construction and extension in any State with the consent of that State.&#34; It is clear that under an agreement such as that contained in the schedule to the bill, it would be possible, with the consent of a State, for the Commonwealth to agree to construct a railway in that State, and I believe that at the present moment the construction of a railway is about to proceed in my own State under that very power. How does that power differ from that now to be exercised under this bill in regard to roads? Everybody agrees that they are absolutely necessary. This Government says to the States :. &#34; We think that your roads, which are a national necessity, are insufficient, and we shall endeavour to help you.&#34; This power does not necessarily connote that the States must come cap in hand asking for financial assistance from the Commonwealth. It indicates to me that the Federal Government may say to the States : &#34; We think that you require a scheme of national development in reference to your roads.&#34; So far from the States being forced into acceptance of the agreement, they are at liberty to refuse to accept it. I cannot conceive why the State of New South Wales has refused to enter into the proposed agreement, and has fought it all along. It  i3  not for us to discuss when or how the money will be obtained, but I venture to say that we should not have heard a word as to the constitutionality of the measure if the proposal was that the money should be granted out of surplus revenue, or a windfall that the Government had received. When on the hustings I stated that I was wholeheartedly in favour of this proposal, which I regarded as a bold one. I knew then that it would involve extra taxation on the people of Australia. I do not think that the statement that the States are being forced into accepting this agreement can be justified; any State that so desires may stand out. There may be in connexion with these proposals certain inequalities, and even injustices; but I know of nothing which will do more to develop the country than will a proper system of road-construction and maintenance. The Commonwealth is setting its hand to a national scheme of development, the work being entrusted to the States, subject to some control by the Commonwealth Minister. That control the Commonwealth should retain. The money should not be handed over unreservedly to the States. An agreement has been entered into between the Commonwealth and certain States under which the Commonwealth advances certain moneys to the States. The power to do so is conferred upon the Commonwealth by section 96 of the Constitution, which also empowers the Commonwealth to lay down conditions governing the advance of money. Up to that point no constitutional objection can be raised to this legislation. The only possible objection on constitutional grounds to this legislation is that the final control rests with the Federal Minister for Works and Railways, who has the right to say whether a scheme submitted by a State shall be proceeded with. Subject  only  to that qualification, the .Commonwealth is competent to make advances to the States. It is possible that, when the Attorney-General in 1925 expressed the opinion to which reference has been made to-night, he took too narrow a view of the powers of the Commonwealth in relation to the appropriation of moneys. This bill is a bill to appropriate money for a certain purpose. The Attorney-General has been assailed this evening for having changed his views; but the circumstances in connexion with this bill are different from those existing in 1925, when he expressed the views referred to. The preamble to the bill reads - </para>

              <para>- The question of the manner in which the money is raised has nothing to do with the bill before us. The Imperial Parliament would introduce a bill in the same way that this bill has been introduced, and it would appropriate moneys in the same way. In the past, the powers conferred by section 96 of the Constitution have been exercised in various ways. Specific grants have been made to various States. Although not specifically classified in that way, the power exercised by the Commonwealth in relation to the Murray waters agreement must depend upon the exercise of the power in section 96 of the Constitution. </para>

The proposals embodied in this measure were part of the Government&#39;s programme submitted to the electors. Honorable senators who supported the Government&#39;s- policy must have recognized that it would involve taxation of some kind. They might have expected a wheel tax; but whatever form the taxation took, we all clearly understood that the Government intended to introduce legislation of this nature. Honorable senators will admit that the Commonwealth has power to make advances to the States, and to lay down certain conditions concerning them. I repeat that the only possible objection to this legislation on constitutional grounds is that the final control rests with the Commonwealth Minister. But for this Parliament to relinquish that control would be to regard its duty lightly, in view of the fact that &#163;20,000,000 is involved. Were the control which will be exercised by the Minister for Works and Railways abandoned, no possible exception could be taken to this measure on&#39; the ground of its unconstitutionality. </para>

              <para>- I have already expressed my view regarding the ambit of section 96 and the view held concerning it by the framers of the Constitution. I fail to see that the Commonwealth is intruding into the sphere of the States. Hitherto .we have regarded the making of roads, as we have the making of railways, as the function of the States. But the Constitution confers on the Commonwealth the power to construct railways with the consent of  the  States. 5126 <inline font-style="italic">Federal Aid</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Roads Bill.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">Similarly, under section 96 of the Constitution the Commonwealth has power to advance moneys to the States for any purpose, and on any conditions. This bill proposes that money shall be advanced to the States, and that the Commonwealth shall exercise a measure of control. That does not contravene section 96 of the Constitution. The limited powers vested in the Commonwealth have been referred to. It is true that the Constitution limits the powers of the Commonwealth in many ways; but it does not do so in respect of financial matters. It was intended that the Constitution should authorize the Commonwealth to have certain works carried out by the States, not that they must necessarily be undertaken by the Commonwealth. It has been said that in this legislation an attempt is being made to dictate the policy of the various States. That may be so; but surely the States are prepared to assist the Commonwealth in carrying out a national undertaking, such as the construction of roads through-&#39; out the Commonwealth undoubtedly is. </para>

While in New South Wales last week, I took the opportunity to examine some roads which are being constructed near Sydney under what is regarded as a modern system of road construction. I was far from satisfied, because I found that some roads which have been constructed only a short time were showing unmistakable signs of wear. This is not a dictation to the States; and even if it were there would be warrant for it. </para>

This scheme will lighten the burden that is upon the shoulders of those men. There may not be very much ground for complaint regarding the roads in the vicinity of Adelaide, but immediately outside its precincts they are in a very bad condition, and in some parts of the State they are almost impassable. The need that has been made evident for so long warrants the Government in saying to the States, &#34; For too long you have been inactive; let us have a broad national scheme which will be worked more economically and advance the interests of not only the States, but also the nation as a whole.&#34; </para>

              <para>- Earlier in my speech I did so. I do not regard this as a breach of the Constitution. At first blush it might look like a contravention of the spirit of the Constitution, on the ground that these domestic matters ought to be left to the States to settle; but, when all is said and done, is not the construction of national, developmental roads a matter in which the Commonwealth is competent to assist the States ? Section 96 of the Constitution gives it the power to do so. No objection would have been taken during the last three years if control had been vested in a board constituted of representatives of the States and the Commonwealth, or even one which was independent- of either of those parties. I cannot see any vice in the proposal. It falls within the terms of section 96 of the Constitution ; and, in the light of the new spirit in which the Constitution has been interpreted, I venture the opinion that if it comes to trial it will be proved to be constitutional. The States would be well advised to accept the arrangement, in not only their own interests, but also those of Australia as a whole, and our national development. </para>

            <para>.- I intend to support the bill. This proposal was given the  greatest  prominence in the policy speech which the Prime Minister delivered at Dandenong on the eve of the election campaign, and I referred to it at every meeting which I addressed. So far as I was able to gather, it met with the utmost favour. No criticism was offered at that time by any of the newspapers in this State, which are now offering such strong opposition to it. I cannot conceive how it is possible for any honorable senator who sits on this side of the chamber to oppose the measure. Such opposition should have been manifested when the programme of the Government was announced. </para>

              <para>- We are at liberty to inform ourselves of the state of public opinion, without any reference, to those who temporarily occupy a seat in the State Parliaments. In supporting this measure, I am not adopting an attitude that is antagonistic to the interests of the State that I represent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> dealt at length with the constitutional aspect of the matter. While not claiming to be an authority on the interpretation of the Constitution, -I consider that a great deal can be said on the other side. There can be no question, for example, that the provision of good roads has been always the first subject to which the military nations of the world have directed their attention. The Roman Empire - the greatest military nation the world has ever known - constructed a wonderful network of roads, which have lasted up to the present day. Napoleon was responsible for that excellent system- of national roads which we admired in France. In war-time, the transport of men, guns, and ammunition is not possible unless good roads are provided. The Constitution gives to the Commonwealth Government the power to legislate in matters of defence, and it is not difficult to bring roads within the scope of that power. There is a whole chain of decisions of the High Court of Australia which support that theory. </para>

Having decided that in the affirmative, its duty would be not to inquire any further. That is made still clearer by the judgment of Chief Justice Griffith, who suggested that the test to be applied in all cases was - &#34;Can the measure in question conduce to the efficiency of the forces of the Empire, or is the connexion of cause and effect between the measure and the desired efficiency so remote that the one cannot reasonably be regarded as affecting the other? </para>

The court has made it plain that if any matter can, in the remotest degree, be considered as affecting or likely to affect the efficiency of defence measures, the Commonwealth has power to legislate in regard to it. Roads clearly are connected with defence. Therefore, it would be no business of the court to inquire whether this or that road was strategically or tactically necessary for defence. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; and the court, realizing its limitations, would not make it a matter of evidence whether the roads were strategical or tactical. The defeat of the Germans at the Battle of the Marne was largely due to the use by General Joffre of large fleets of motor buses, which he took off the streets of Paris, filled with troops, and manoeuvred in such a way as to deliver an unexpected attack on the German lines. In time we may have whole fleets of tanks or armoured cars for defence purposes, and the provision of good roads will, therefore, become increasingly necessary in order to ensure the adequate defence of the Commonwealth. There can be no doubt that the High Court would admit that good roads are essential for the defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>In his opinion, it would be merely necessary for the Commonwealth to say that roads were to be used for defence purposes, and it is obvious that the court would not question the constitutionality of the Government including the words to which reference has been made. The majority of the court, however, brushed aside as a technicality the opinion expressed in the dissenting judgment, and said, &#34;Is this incidental to the defence power of the Commonwealth?&#34; It came to the conclusion that it was. The court was then dealing with an action taken under the War Precautions Regulations forbidding interference with private property, and even in that instance it upheld the defence power of the Commonwealth. That being so, how can there be any doubt concerning the Commonwealth&#39;s power to spend money on the construction of roads? </para>

              <para>- Yes; those roads could be used for the transport of troops and irrespective of the place at which such roads commenced and terminated, they would be of advantage for military purposes. If they ran from the Mallee they would be of use to transport grain and other supplies to the troops. If they led to a port they could be used to repel an invader. Obviously, the court could not set itself up as technical advisers; that is the responsibility of the Government. All the court is concerned with is whether roads can be used as an aid to defence. </para>

              <para>- No; but it is of great importance to the people. In my  5130 <inline font-style="italic">Federal Aid</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Roads Bill.</inline> opinion, the action of the Government is morally wrong, and, therefore, should not be legalized. Parliament has no right to force upon the States something which they have declared they do not. want. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> said that the South Australian Government has made a very poor attempt to carry out a progressive roads policy; but, in fairness to that State, he should have mentioned that a tax was imposed by the South Australian Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue for road construction, and as it had only been in operation a short time the Government of that State should not be charged with inactivity. The South Australian Government was carrying out a satisfactory roads policy when the Commonwealth Government said that if it persisted with its petrol consumption tax, legal action would be taken, and a writ has now been issued by the Commonwealth against it. The Commonwealth Government is now saying to South Australia, and to certain other States, &#34; Here is our policy, you have to accept it whether you like it or not.&#34; If the scheme is not accepted by the States which have declined to sign the agreement, I understand the money to be allocated to them will be placed to their credit in a trust fund until they are forced to use it. That is morally wrong. This Government has set up a dictatorship. Why should it force upon a State Government a scheme that is not wanted ? &#34;Under the agreement, it will not be possible to spend any portion of the money upon feeders for main roads. The Commonwealth Government will determine where and how the money shall be spent. The making of roads is a State function, and I submit that the State authorities are the only competent judges of what are the most urgent proposals. </para>

              <para>- The fact that Queensland has accepted this proposal is no reason why other States should have it forced upon them. But they will be . obliged to come in because the money will be collected and placed to their credit in a trust fund. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> stated that he had advocated this scheme from every platform during his election campaign. I do not doubt the honorable gentleman, but I am sure that neither he nor the Prime Minister indicated the means by which the necessary revenue would be raised. The Government should hand the money over to the States, and allow them to expend it on roads which, in their opinion, most urgently need construction. </para>

              <para>- My point is that the South Australian Government does not approve of the agreement. It considers it has a better policy for road development in that State. I agree with the general principle of the bill, but the agreement should not be forced on States that do not approve of it. It is sound policy that the people who use the roads should pay for them; but the States should have the right to determine which roads shall be constructed. It would have been better if the Government had allowed South Australia and Western Australia to work out their own destinies in connexion with this roads policy. </para>

            <para>. -  I think we are all agreed that better roads are a pressing need. In my State, we have built a considerable length of light roads out of loan moneys, and we are now facing a huge interest bill on that expenditure. Unfortunately, we are unable to maintain our roads efficiently for modern traffic. Methods of transport have entirely changed since most of our roads were constructed. Roads 12 feet wide and with 9 inches of metal were good enough for the class of traffic that went over them several years ago; but with the improvement in road transport systems, it is necessary now to have wider and more expensive highways. When the Commonwealth scheme was announced, I welcomed it. I understand now, from a reply given by the Minister to a question which I asked, that the Government will allow Tasmania to spend 75 per cent. of its allocation in reconstruction of existing roads. </para>

            <para>- I like the word &#34; reconditioning &#34; better than &#34; reconstruction,&#34; and I hope that I am right in assuming that the Government will interpret the act sympathetically as far as Tasmania is concerned, because we have spent a big proportion of our revenue on road construction, and the reconditioning of existing highways is more important than the construction of new roads.I thought, when the bill was introduced, accompanied by a tax. that the money might reasonably have been obtained from duties on some other commodities, so that the motor users in common with the rest of the community could pay their share of the cost. The general taxpayer in Tasmania - I do not know what the position is in the other. States - pays over &#163;250,000 in interest on loan money that has been spent on roads. </para>

              <para>- No; a straight-out road rate, ranging from 1s. 3d. to1s. 6d. in the &#163;1. This would equal in many cases1s. to 2s. per ton on the produce that they cart over the roads. The farmers, in this way, contribute a big share of the cost of road maintenance. I do not like the petrol tax, but since I am anxious to see &#163;100,000 come to Tasmania every year, I intend to support the bill, and let the tax take care of itself, though I would like to see the money raised in some other way. The provision in the bill that 75 per cent. of the money allocated to Tasmania may be expended on reconditioning of roads removes a substantial grievance which we had, because, as I have said, it is essential for Tasmania to spend a substantial sum on existing roads. I reiterate that it would be better if, instead of imposing conditions as to the manner in which the money shall be spent, the Government would hand it over to the State authorities and throw upon them the responsibility for spending it in the right places. Under this scheme we shall have dual responsibility, and experience has taught us that where responsibility is divided it is impossible to sheet home blame if the money is not expended to the best advantage. It will be possible for the State authorities to say that it was a Federal responsibility, and the Federal authorities will have a good answer. They will be able to say that the State Governments must have approved &#39;of certain schemes, or else the money would never have been spent upon them. </para>

              <para>- I am aware of that, but we all know that mistakes occur under any system of dual responsibility. I have seen money spent in the wrong places, but I have been unable to interfere. I know there is a tendency in the Federal Parliament to say that, as the Commonwealth is providing the money, the Government should have some control over its expenditure, but I submit that as it will be impossible to have a common roads scheme for the whole of the Commonwealth it would be better to hand the money over to the State authorities, and make them entirely responsible for its economical expenditure on road schemes within their respective spheres. Another provision which I do not care for in the agreement is the clause which states that municipalities will not be compelled to find more than 50 per cent. of the money to be raised by a State Government. I am afraid that the clause will be interpreted in some localities as meaning that the municipalities should find half the money; but in my opinion they have plenty of work to do in looking after the by-roads, and should not be expected to provide any portion of the funds to be made available under the scheme. I hope that that clause will be eliminated. Controversy has arisen over the fact that city roads will not be improved under this bill. While I should not vote for. a reduction of the amount to be allocated for country roads in order to assist the cities, I should support a special grant, if the Government could see its way clear to make it, to those cities that feel aggrieved. The scheme is capable of improvement, but I welcome it most heartily. Evidently a great deal of thought has been given to it, and I consider that the proposed expenditure will prove one of the greatest boons that Australia has ever enjoyed. Road engineers differ on the methods of construction, but all are agreed that the more money available for road construction the better the roads will be. The proposed tax should not fall heavily on the people. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> has declared that the tax will not be passed on to them ; but, even if that were done, the measure would still be beneficial.  </para>

              <para>- The extra duty on tires was operative on the 9th July, but I purchased tires after that date at the old price. In that case, the extra duty had not been passed on to the public. I believe that the Australian tire companies promised that the tax on tires would not be passed on, and that owing to the increased demand for their products that would result from the proposal of the Government they even hoped to reduce prices. The benefits that the bill will confer will more than outweigh any disadvantage due to the tax on petrol. </para>

Although State Governments representing three-fourths of the population of the Commonwealth do not want the bill, this Government holds a revolver at the heads of those States, telling them that, whether they accept the measure or not, the tax will be collected from them. South Australia, I suppose, has more motor cars per head of the population than any other State ; but while Western Australia has &#163;336,000 allocated to it, my State will receive a little less than &#163;200,000. Naturally the people of South Australia will want to know why those who use petrol on the roads, and are to be specially taxed, should not be benefited in proportion to their numerical strength. I venture to predict that the bill, which will, no doubt, be passed, will result in endless litigation. The States that oppose it are almost certain to apply to the courts for injunctions restraining the Federal Government from collecting the petrol tax. If the Commonwealth Government had approached the States in a reasonable manner, possibly they would have accepted the scheme. </para>

This Parliament has no power to legislate for main roads. . . . The Commonwealth Government has no power to raise a finger to construct main roads.  It is only because the Federal Government has more money that it knows how to spend that these grants have been made.  If- we were to reduce Commonwealthtaxation, and to confine ourselves to our proper functions, the States would find it easier to raise the money required for their roads. </para>

            <para>The effect of the legislation in question is specifically to appropriate moneys to the purposes of constructing new main roads and reconditioning or strengthening existing main roads. It contemplates a complete control in the execution and choice of works by the Commonwealth in all respects other than the subordinate executive part, which is left to the States, which have no further or other control than, if tenders having been let for the works, they became the successful tenderers for the respective works. A perusal of &#34;The Commonwealth Government&#39;s Hoad Proposals,&#34; which contain details of the scheme, satisfied me that the Commonwealth Government are embarking upon a system of roadmaking, using the States as agents for the execution of the programme. </para>

            <para>In my opinion, the Commonwealth Government have no power to appropriate money for expenditure outside the Federal legislative area. I know of no decision  which  definitely establishes this view, but it seems to be the the only one compatible with the general scope of the Constitution, and particularly with the preservation of the residuary powers of the States. Chapter IV. of the Constitution, sub tit. &#34; Finance and Trade,&#34; passim, clearly indicates the limits of the Commonwealth power of expenditure. </para>
            <para>Section 81 provides that all revenue or money raised or received by the Executive Government shall form one consolidated revenue fund, to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by the Constitution. </para>
            <para>This provision connotes two things: - (1) The appropriation is to be for the purposes pf the Commonwealth. In my opinion, this confines and limits the objects of appropriation to those which can be lawfully administered by the Commonwealth. (2) Given valid objects of appropriation the manner of appropriation is restricted to that authorized by the Constitution, that is to say, in conformity with sections 53-57 of the Constitution dealing with the rights and privileges of the two Houses <inline font-style="italic">inter se</inline> with regard to money Bills. And see also sections 83, 87, 89, and 93. </para>
            <para>It follows, therefore, that the Main Roads Development Act 1923-1925, requires for its support that the subject with which it deals must fall within the subjects allotted to the legislative power of the Commonwealth. If I am right as to this there are, as it seems to me, only two powers to which the Act could possibly, by any sort of argument, be referred.. The first of these is the trade and commerce power, s. 51 (pi., 1) and s. 51 (pi. vi.), military defence. As to the trade and commerce power, I think this affords no support to the statute, for it fails to take notice of the necessity for roads of an interstate character, and deals generally with intra-state roads (sections 8 and 9 of the Main Roads Development Act 1923; sections 6 and 7 of the Main Roads Development Act 1925), nor does it limit its application to roads useful to interstate trade. See also regulations 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Statutory Rules, 1923, No. 104)&#39;. </para>
            <para>Similarly with regard to military defence the Act and the regulations ignore - indeed, negative - t.lip factor of utility for defence purposes. The regulations clearly disclose the plan of the </para>
            <para class="block">Commonwealth Government, at least in part, to open up and develop new country by means and with the aid of the statute (see regulation 4, Statutory Rules 1923, No. 104). I do not see, therefore, how it is possible to defend the Act either by reference to the trade and commerce power or to the military defence power. But I should say that if the Act is to be defended, the Commonwealth Government will rely upon section 96 of the Constitution. This provides that during a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. </para>
            <para>In my opinion, this provision does not apply to and cannot be used to support the Act, for the following reasons: - (1) The scheme contemplated by the Act is not intended as &#34; financial assistance &#34; to the States as such. It embodies the Commonwealth&#39;s own policy, and is thrust upon the States against their will. Section 96 contemplates a State in need of and willing to accept &#34; the financial assistance.&#34; If and so far as it does yield financial assistance to the States, this is merely incidental to the main purpose of the Act. (2) The section cannot be used, alio <inline font-style="italic">intuitu,</inline> so as to permit the Commonwealth to encroach upon the powers- left to the State. And if the course pursued can be justified as regards roadmaking, .it is not easy to see where the line can be drawn beyond which the Commonwealth may not transgress. It may, e.g., invade the field of education, housing, agricultural settlement, or any other purely State topic under cover of &#34;financial assistance.&#34; (3) It may be said that the financial assistance may be refused; that its acceptance only requires the voluntary assent of the States. But this is more plausible than sound, since the money to be raised to administer the scheme is drawn by the Commonwealth from all the people of the various States, so that any State which refused the &#34; financial assistance &#34; would still be bound to yield in taxation sums of money to be spent in other States which accepted the proposals. The scheme, therefore, is a mere simulacrum of voluntary agreement so far as the individual States are concerned. (4) Moreover, the scheme shows that the expenditure of the money is irrespective of the financial needs of the various States. Its allocation follows a stereotyped formula, and is distributable among all the States whether necessitous or otherwise. In short, it is a device to execute works outside the ambit of Federal power by the agency of the States, who have no voice in the application of the &#34; financial assistance &#34; except as an echo of the Federal command. (5) Lastly, the terms and conditions upon which the financial assistance is provided are those which &#34; Parliament thinks fit &#34; to exact. No doubt Parliament may delegate its powers to a Minister in an appropriate case and where no contrary intention appears. <inline font-style="italic">(Baxter</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">Ah Way,</inline> 8 C.L.R., p. 26). But I am disposed to think that on the true construction of this section the terms and conditions are those which Parliament itself  declares,  and not  such  as may be left to the discretion of the Minister. 5134 <inline font-style="italic">Federal Aid</inline> . &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Roads Bill.</inline></para>
            <para>I am accordingly of opinion that the Main Roads Development Act 1923-1025 is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> In my opinion, a suit may be instituted by the State of South Australia for appropriate declarations, challenging the Act and the appropriations made under it, and for an injunction forbidding the appropriations and their application to the disclosed object. </para>

The Victorian Government has done so on the ground that it considers that the money should be spent in the State in which it is collected. In South Australia, where, under a Labour Government, the people are so prosperous that the number of motor cars in proportion to the population is greater than in any other State, the reason is much the same. The Government of South Australia feels that it should not be called upon to build roads in Western Australia and Queensland, which are reputed to -be richer States.

              <para>- No; it is well governed. I can understand the attitude of an honorable member in another place, who said that he was prepared to accept the grant for his State with both hands. That honorable member came from Western Australia, which State, under these proposals, will be treated better than South Australia. I am here in the interests of South Australia, and I object to my State being called upon to contribute to the cost of roads in other States. Some of the States will not accept these proposals. Bad feeling will exist between at least three of the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>. - I am not particularly concerned with the legal aspect of this question, to which so much attention was paid by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell,</inline> who, I think, was effectively answered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan.</inline> As a layman, I consider that section 96 of the Constitution meets all objections on the grounds of unconstitutionality. I have had sufficient commercial experience to know that lawyers frequently differ and dependence cannot be placed on any opinion that they give. I rose particularly to say that as far back as March last, I received from motor users in Queensland a number of requests to which I sympathetically replied. I was urged by them to believe that the whole of the cost of this scheme would be borne by the motor users of Australia. Since then I have been subjected to a continuous stream of correspondence, which in the last few days has culminated in protests from all sorts of bodies. I have received telegrams and letters from personal friends, and from institutions with which I have been connected for many years. They have a very healthly fear that this will impose a tremendous tax upon those who use motors. If my friends had had the advantage of having the position explained to them as clearly as it has been explained to us, I feel sure that they would not urge me to protest against this measure. Motor users will have to bear only a portion of the tax. It is claimed that the owners of other vehicles should be called upon to provide a percentage of the amount that the Government requires. Unfortunately this Government cannot enter that arena, because it would undoubtedly be an invasion of State rights. It proposes to use the only avenue that is open to it, namely, that offered by the imposition of a duty. The acceptance of the agreement by the Queensland Government induces me to give the measure the support that it ought to have. That State especially is crying out for good roads. I have no doubt that at a later period the States which are now standing out will be pleased to come into the scheme. I do not anticipate the litigation of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh</inline> appears to be so afraid. I am not surprised at the attitude which is being adopted by the Government of New South Wales, because this Government is anathema to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> and his followers, and they would not accept any proposal that it advanced. I am pleased to find Victorian senators supporting the bill, and I am sure that eventually this State will accept the agreement. There is no occasion for the strong protests that have been made by the oil companies. They will derive an advantage from a larger consumption of petrol when an improvement in the quality of the roads brings about a greater volume of motor traffic. They will be justified in refraining from passing on the extra 2d. per gallon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> by interjection, said that these duties&#34; are always passed on. On occasions they are not. It would be wise for the oil companies to bear the extra cost. Even if the consumers of petrol are asked to pay a higher price, I&#34; am. assured by those who are qualified to express an opinion that good roads will enable them to effect a saving on tires, and in other directions which will more than cover the extra cost of petrol. The proposal is in the interests of motor users, the oil companies, and the nation in particular. I therefore have much pleasure in supporting the bill. </para>

            <para>.  - There can be no difference of opinion concerning the urgent necessity for a progressive roads policy for the Commonwealth. Australia cannot be developed without good roads.&#34; If we fail in that respect we shall be unable to keep pace with other countries which have given greater attention to the question of roads construction. We have also to recognize the fact that motor transport, which is essential for the proper development of any country, has not only come to stay, but is rapidly increasing. </para>

              <para>- When the Main Roads Development Bill was before the Senate last year, &#163;1,750,000, all of which came out of the genera) revenue, had been provided by the Federal Parliament for the inauguration of a roads scheme. That was contributed by the whole of the people, and I cannot understand why more extended reference has not been made to the injustice of asking a section of the people, as is now proposed, to contribute the whole of the money required to carry out a national roads scheme. </para>

              <para>- Yes; but &#163;1,500,000 will have to be found by a section of the people to provide works of general utility. After giving the activities of this and preceding Governments the closest attention I cannot discover one instance in which the Government has expended in the interests of the whole people, public funds which have been contributed by only one section. In perusing the bill I find that on certain roads essential to the community not one penny will be spent, although those who use them will have to contribute the money to be raised by the imposition of an additional duty on petrol. It would be impossible to mention any city in Australia which has not arterial roads leading to it that are of the utmost importance to those living outside. There are a number of motorists, commercial and otherwise, whose business never takes them beyond the confines of the cities, but who will have to make a heavy contribution towards this fund, and who will not benefit in the slightest degree. I have received two letters in connexion with this matter. One is from the Mayor of Hobart, and reads - </para>

            <para>I have received a letter from the honorary secretary of the Melbourne Metropolitan Conference <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. W. R. Butcher, Town Clerk, Collingwood)</inline> on the Federal Roads Grant, drawing attention to the fact that under the terms of the Federal grant all towns and cities whose population exceeds 5,000 are excluded entirely from the operations and benefits of the grant, and asking my council to cooperate in endeavouring to have this remedied. I must say that it appears to me extremely unfair that in cases such as Hobart, where at least three of our streets are practically main roads, we should not derive some advantage from the proposed tax, and I would be very glad if you will be good enough to give the matter your special attention and endeavour to obtain for us a reasonable amount of benefit from the grant. . . . </para>

          <para class="block">I have also received the following communication from the town clerk of the city of Launceston - _ </para>
          <para>It has been brought under the notice of the council that, under the terms of the Federal roads grant all towns and cities whose population exceeds 5,000 are excluded entirely from the provisions and benefits of the grant, despite the fact that the motorists of the above-mentioned towns and cities will contribute 70 per cent, of the revenue devoted to the grant. This will, doubtless, appeal to you as being a most inequitable arrangement, particularly as the bulk of the revenue to be devoted to the construction of country main roads is to be derived from additional duties on petrol, tires, and chassis from the motorists, of whom the abovementioned percentage operate constantly on metropolitan roads. As taxation implies service, it will be readily admitted that it would be sound in principle to give such service in the shape of good roads to those motorists who supply the revenue for roads, yet the claims of the city motorists have been entirely ignored. . . . </para>
          <para class="block">It appears to me that the representatives of these councils have made out a good case for special consideration if this project is to be carried out. When a member of the Tasmanian Parliament, I took a great interest in Tasmania&#39;s development, and since I have been a member of the Federal Parliament, in the development of the whole Commonwealth. No one has been more energetic and enthusiastic in advocating good roads than I have been, but, although I wish this scheme to become operative, I am entirely opposed to the method by which the money is to be raised. </para>

              <para>- Yes, because it is more imperative in the interests of the Empire than it has ever been to proceed with a progressive developmental policy, and no State is at present sufficiently strong financially to incur the expenditure inseparable from carrying out a  comprehensive roads policy. Notwithstanding all that has been said concerning the unconstitutionality of this measure, &#39; federation was established in the interests of the whole of Australia, and the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth can render financial assistance to the States in order to ensure their development. My principal objection to the bill is that it is not fair to ask one section of the community to meet three-fourths of the expenditure involved. In order to raise sufficient money to cover the .cost of road maintenance, every State has found it necessary to impose a special tax on users of motor vehicles and almost every other vehicle. This direct tax, which is fairly heavy, varies in amount, but, in addition, indirect taxation is imposed in the form of municipal rates, to which will have to be added the further tax which the Commonwealth authorities propose to levy. </para>

            <para>.  - I intend to support the second reading of this bill, as I believe it will assist the development of the Commonwealth. It is well known that the country districts cannot be properly developed under the present&#39; system of road construction, as the local governing bodies have not sum&#39;cient funds at their disposal to undertake extensive road-construction schemes. All their revenue is used in maintaining roads already constructed, and unless additional money is raised by way of loans, further construction is practically impossible. It was announced during the election campaign that if the Government were returned, it .would embark on a comprehensive roads scheme. </para>

A good deal has been said concerning the constitutionality of the Government&#39;s proposal to make grants to the States for road construction purposes ; but, in my opinion, section 96 of the Constitution permits that to be done. Even legal authorities, however, differ on the point. I was  chairman  of a Court of Petty Sessions for about six years, and gave a number of decisions, only one of which was challenged. Honorable senators, I think, have been somewhat confused by the difference in the opinions of legal gentlemen as to the constitutionality of this bill. All I can say is that, if it is unconstitutional for the Commonwealth to spend public revenues on road construction, possibly the States will be asked to repay the ?1,750,000 which they have already received from the Commonwealth Government for this purpose. I am afraid there will be very little chance of getting it. Roads are essential to the proper development of the Commonwealth. We have adopted the Government&#39;s migration proposals, and before long we shall be expecting a steady stream of migrants from the Mother Country. The other day I had a conversation with the head of the Salvation Army in Victoria on the subject. He told me- </para>

              <para>- The State Governments will be required to submit a roads  programme extending over five years. I am wondering if it will be possible to set aside some portion of the money for the construction of roads to open up new settlements. Unfortunately, the&#39; cost of construction is increasing from year to year. The first contract I made with gas companies for tar was on the basis of from 5d. to 6d. a gallon. To-day the price is about ls.- 2d. a gallon. It is impossible for the States, unaided, to carry out -a great- roads construction programme. The agreement provides that towns with a population exceeding 5,000 shall not participate in money allocated under the agreement. This will operate unfairly in the cases of a large number of municipalities which have main roads running through their territories. For example, the main roads from Melbourne to Echuca, and from Melbourne to Mildura, pass through a number of towns with a population exceeding 5,000, so the provision limiting any expenditure under this agreement to main roads outside the boundaries of such towns will penalize the municipalities mentioned. </para>

              <para>- I understand that municipalities in the metropolitan areas have made representations for an extra ?5,000,000 to meet their needs. No doubt that proposal will receive consideration in due course. Exception has also been taken to the roads policy being administered by the Commonwealth Government. On this point I direct attention to the clause which states that the Ministers for Public Works in the various States, together with the Minister of State for the Commonwealth, shall . comprise a board which shall have the direction of policy. From what I know of State Ministers, I am satisfied that their presence on the board will materially influence its policy. It has also been objected that the allocation to some of the States will be less than the amount contributed by them under this scheme. Probably Victoria will suffer to the extent of ?1,000,000, but we should regard these proposals from a Federal stand-point. We should not forget that the Commonwealth has&#39; contributed ?2,500,000 towards the cost of the river Murray . scheme, which will benefit primarily the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Nor should we forget that in four year&#39;s the Commonwealth has assisted the iron and steel industry in New South Wales to the extent of ?667,331, and South Australia to the amount of ?245,000 in connexion with the wine bounty. We should discuss all proposals such as this in a purely Federal spirit. I agree with the principle of the bill. The method by which the money is to be raised will be dealt with in another measure. I support the bill because I believe it will play an important part in the development of Australia. </para>

            <para>. - I direct attention to clause 7 of the agreement in the schedule, which provides that, where a road passes through a town whose population does not exceed 5,000, it shall be constructed as if the town did not exist. Does this apply only to new townships? Many municipalities whose population exceeds 5,000 are responsible for the maintenance of main arterial roads over which a heavy volume of tourist traffic passes. Are they to be shut out? I have  in mind such centres as Claremont, Iremantle, and Subiaco, suburbs of Perth, as well as similar municipalities in the metropolitan areas of the other States. </para>

            <para>. - The clause applies to every centre whether metropolitan or rural, and the governing factor is the number of its inhabitants. If there are 5,000, or more, no money can be contributed under this bill towards the cost of road construction in that centre, but if the population is under 5,000 a Commonwealth grant can be so applied. A desire has been expressed for certain amendments of the schedule, but I point out that it constitutes the agreement arrived at in conference with the States. If any amendment were made, the States as a whole would have to be consulted again; and since that would cause great delay, I suggest that the agreement should be not amended except for the gravest possible reason. </para>

            <para>.- The clause embodies an important principle, and I consider it wrong to restrict the scheme to towns not exceeding a population of 5,000. As the population, of towns increases, there is greater concentration of traffic on the main roads running through them, and the local authorities are unable to cope with the problem of maintaining those roads. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but las the numbers increase, the rate of taxation per head becomes greater. The main road from Launceston to Hobart, as it approaches the capital city, passes through the suburban areas of Glenorchy, Derwent Park, Moonah, and Newtown, each of which has a population of over 5,000.

            <para>It is understood that some months ago a deputation consisting of representatives of metropolitan municipalities on the mainland requested the Federal Minister for Public Works to recommend that, in addition to the &#163;20,000,000 grant for country roads, a special  grant, spread over ten years, be made to assist towns and cities with populations exceeding 5,000 in the construction of their main arterial roads, which bear an enormous amount of foreign traffic. The Minister would give no decision, but referred the deputation to the Prime Minister, who promised to look into the papers on the matter and reply, hut to date he has not stated his intention. </para>

          <para class="block">It would appear that this matter has been brought under the notice- of the Government, and I cannot understand why some provision of the nature requested has not been made. If towns and cities with populations exceeding 5,000 are excluded the scheme will break down, because when the municipal boundaries are reached the roads will be so bad that motorists and others will find their journey interrupted. The agreement ought to be referred back to the States which have&#39; signed it with a request that they should accept an amendment in accordance with the suggestions that have been made to-night. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>GRANT  (New South Wales) &#91;10. 58 J. - The agreement seems to have&#39; been hurriedly drawn as the result of a nominal conference which merely gave perfunctory attention to the subject. It is clear from correspondence I have received that there is the strongest opposition to the proposals contained in the bill. The Commonwealth Government has decided, wrongly, I think, to engage in the business of roadmaking, and that no part of the money shall be expended in towns or cities having populations exceeding 5,000. Presumably, a road from Esperance to Port Lincoln via Eucla would fulfil the requirements of the bill. A few years ago the present Attorney-General said that the Commonwealth Government had no constitutional justification for spending millions of pounds upon the construction of roads. But if the Government will persist in raising revenue for this purpose, and handing it over to the States to spend, it will do well to realize that they have a knowledge of roadmaking, and should be permitted to expend the money in a way they consider best, subject, possibly, to the formal approval of the Federal Minister for Works. It would be in the interests of the recipients of this assistance, and of roadmaking generally, if this bill were postponed until we could learn more fully the views of the people directly concerned. There is no reason why this legislation should be hurriedly forced through Parliament merely because the Government has a majority supporting;  it. </para>

              <para>-  I intend to do so. Moreover, the bill does not meet with the approval of &#39;some of the principal municipalities in Victoria. At a very important conference of metropolitan municipalities held in Melbourne, the delegates pointed out how unfair is the proposal to exclude cities with a population of over 5,000 inhabitants. A circular which I have received from the Town Clerk of Collingwood says - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>By direction of the  chairman  (Councillor A. J. Dunkin,  Collingwood Council) of the conference of metropolitan municipalities .on main arterial road construction, I am desired to draw the attention of all Federal members of both Houses, representing towns and cities with populations exceeding 5,000,- to. the facts that under the terms of the Federal Government&#39;s scheme for main road construction all towns and cities with populations exceeding 5,000 have been excluded from the provisions and benefits of the &#163;20,000,000 Federal grant for main roads. </para>
            <para>This will doubtless appeal to such members as being a most inequitable arrangement, particularly in view of the fact that the bulk of the revenue to he devoted to the construction of country main roads is to be derived through additional duties on petrol tires and chassis from the motorists of whom 70 per cent, operate constantly on metropolitan roads. As taxation implies service, it will be readily admitted that it would be sound in principle to give such service in the shape of good roads to those motorists who supply the revenue for roads. Yet the claims of the 70 per cent, mentioned have been entirely ignored. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>What answer can the Minister give? According to this circular, a deputation waited on the Prime Minister to ask for a grant of &#163;5.000,000, but it was given no definite reply other than that its representations would receive consideration. This clause does not apply to the metropolitan district of Melbourne only, but to all cities with a population of over 5,000 persons. We must remember that motorists from all parts of the country visit the cities, and if damage is done to roads by motor traffic, these people from the country contribute to that damage. Yet, the bulk of the money, under these proposals, will he collected from the users of motor cars in the big cities of . the Commonwealth. The principle underlying these proposals is wrong. No one section of the community should be singled out to provide revenue for the making of roads and, at the same time, be precluded from participating in the grants that are made. No one would oppose a sound proposal for the construction of good roads. When the Government&#39;s roads policy was announced it was not understood that only a  section  of the road users would be taxed. . The Labour party believes in good roads; but it also believes that all the users of those roads . should . contribute towards their cost. </para>

              <para>-  I am the last to take advantage of the Chair. At all times I endeavour to pay respect to the ooenpant of the chair, whoever he may be. There are many cities within the metropolitan area of Melbourne that hare grown considerably during recent years. A few years ago, Caulfield was not a city and its population was small. Now, it is a city with a population of considerably over 5,000 persons. Some of the roads &#39; in Caulfield are in bad order. More buildings have been erected in the city of Caulfield during the last few years than in any other municipality in Victoria, with the result that some of the roads have got into a state of great disrepair. It is well known also that some of the roads within the metropolitan area are so bad that children attending school are forced to walk through pools of water and slush, thereby contracting colds, which may lay the foundation for future ill health. Naturally, l am concerned about those municipalities whose population exceeds 5,000&#39; persons. I can well understand the anxiety which the conference manifested. I do not desire to delay the passage of the bill, but I wish the Minister to make a definite - statement respecting the request of the representative gentlemen who waited on the Prime Minister recently that &#163;5,000,000 should be spent within these municipalities. </para>
