                    <para>I intended to speak on the second reading of this bill, but, as honorable senators will remember, the acting Leader of the Opposition
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline>
                moved on Friday for the adjournment of the debate, and his request was refused, because one or two honorable, senators were then prepared to continue the debate.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline>
                I think, rose to speak at a moment when I was called out of the chamber, and I imagined that I should be quite safe in leaving my place for half-an-hour, but when I returned, I found that the next business had been called on. I understood that the debate had been adjourned, but, to my surprise, on looking at the notice-paper this morning, I learnt that the bill had been read a second time and passed through the committee stage. I, therefore, take this opportunity of making some remarks which I intended to offer on the second reading. For reasons which I think will appeal to honorable senators when  I state them, I am unable to follow the Government, so far as this measure is concerned. The enactment of a bill having provisions of this character, except  so far as they deal with advances. for the encouragement of prospecting in- the Northern Territory, is, in my opinion, entirely outside the powers of this Parliament. Those powers, as honorable senators know, are strictly limited, and cover only such matters as are declared by the Federal Constitution to be. within the executive power of the Federal Parliament. Full powers over all other matters are reserved to the States. I contend that the Government in asking Parliament to pass this measure is asking it to exceed its constitutional power. To my mind, it is -an unwarranted intrusion by the Commonwealth into the sphere of State activities.

                BARWELL.It is tending strongly that way; and thu interjection reminds me that it is not the first occasion on which the Commonwealth Government has intruded in this manner upon the sphere of State activities. Among the matters that occur to my mind at the moment is the provision of an amount in 1923 for advances by the Commonwealth to the States for wire netting for settlers. In 1924, and again, I think, in .1925, provision was made for advances by the Commonwealth to vh© States for the construction and maintenance of roads. Both those matters are entirely outside the Commonwealth's proper sphere of activity as laid down by the Constitution. ' They are matters with which the Commonwealthought not to concern itself, as they are essentially State matters. The intention of the Commonwealth to make advances to the States to assist in the building of homes has been forecasted. - In that also the Commonwealth will be departing from the constitutionally laid down sphere of its own activities. The position is exactly the same in regard to mining and prospecting for precious metals. The interference of the Commonwealth .in all these matters constitutes a distinct infringement of the rights of the States. I do not think that any honorable senator will disagree with me when I say that the maintenance, inviolate, of the exclusive right of each State to order and control its domestic affairs according to its own judgment is ' essential to the due balance of power upon which the smooth working of the federal system depends. It is quite time that this -Parliament called a halt to these .infringements of State power, which are in reality a peaceful penetration by the Commonwealth into the sphere of State activities. We  should refuse to be led along paths that we have no right to tread. I am not going to assist either this or any other Government to act in defiance or in breach of the constitution under which it  is supposed to function. The stand that I am now taking is not a new one. I have previously had occasion to deal with similar cases.

                    <para>- That -is so. I take exception to this because it is an exactly parallel case. As head of the South Australian Government in 1923, I emphatically protested against the action of the Commonwealth Parliament in passing the Advances to Settlers Act, which made provision in respect to the purchase of wire netting for settlers. On the 13th August of that year I sent the following telegram to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> - </para>

            </continue>
            <quote>
                <para>My Government protests strongly against the passing of the Advances to Settlers Bill, providing as it does for Commonwealth encroachment upon the States' activities. All necessary provision for supply of wire netting to farmers is contained in State legislation. This State does not ask for or require such  assistance as the bill provides for, and objects to contribute towards concessions that might be made to settlers in other States. </para>
            </quote>
            <para>The objection which I then raised applies to the measure that we are now considering. Let us look at theway in which the scheme may work out. One State may get little or none of the money that is to be appropriated for the purposes of this bill; it may get less than it is entitled to, or less than it thinks it is entitled to. Yet each State, through its taxpayers, will have to contribute towards the payments that are made to other States. That is not right. The Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> replying to an interjection that I made on Friday morning, said that the allocation of this money, as between the States, would not necessarily be made upon the basis of the present expenditure of those States, nor upon the basis of the population of the various States, nor, indeed, upon any defined basis. It is clear from what the Minister said, that the allocation is to be made merely at the will, or may be the whim, of the Minister who happens to be in control of the department at the time. It is quite time that this Parliament took steps to prevent the unwarranted intrusion by the Commonwealth into the sphere of the States. Let the Commonwealth mind its own business, and the States will mind their own business. The Governments and the Parliaments of the States know far better than does the Commonwealth Government what expenditure is necessary or desirable within their several spheres upon matters that come constitutionally within their control. What is more, the Governments and the Parliaments of the States will expend whatever money is desirable, provided that they are not financially crippled by the Commonwealth. That is the position in which we find ourselves at the present time. I speak strongly upon this matter, because I have been right up against it for a good many years. For nearly seven years, as a member of the State Ministry of South Australia - principally as Premier, and later as Leader of the Opposition - I was brought into close touch with the position of the States in regard to these matters. The States will carry out the functions that lie within their constitutional spheres, provided they are not financially crippled by the Commonwealth. When I addressed myself to the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Speech that was delivered by  His Excellency  the Governor-General, I said that the Commonwealth should get out of the field of income taxation and practice strict  economy. I say now that above all things it should function constitutionally, limiting its expenditure to matters that are properly and legitimately within its power and control. </para>

The point I make is that large and annually recurring surpluses cannot be made the excuse for an unconstitutional intrusion by the Commonwealth into the spheres of the States. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to strictly limit its revenue to its own legitimate requirements . </para>

                find the money, and leave the expenditure and the administration of the settlements in the hands of the States. I am in entire accord with the co-operation that at present exists between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to the raising of loans ; that is quite a good thing. The creation of a Loan Council had my approval. What I object to is the fact that the Commonwealth, merely because it has large surpluses, makes advances to States for State activities, and lavs down the terms and conditions upon which the money shall be expended.

                    BARWELL.With all due deference, sir, I am explaining the position, not merely in order to reply to an interjection, but because it is strictly pertinent to the bill. Under this measure the Commonwealth is making an offer of a grant to the States for a purpose that does not come within the Commonwealth sphere, and the question arises whether or not the States need accept the money. They need not. As a matter of fact the Commonwealth Government's advance for wire netting was not accepted by South Australia, not only because it was a matter outside the powers of the Commonwealth, but also because the State was already making advances to setters upon certain terms and conditions to provide them with wire netting. If the State makes advances for a particular purpose upon certain terms and conditions, and then the Commonwealth enters the fieldand also makes advances for the same purposes upon different terms and conditions, trouble is immediately bound to arise, and it is likely to arise in connexion with the Commonwealth's advance for prospecting. It may be argued that there is a provision in the Commonwealth Constitution enabling the Federal Parliament to give financial assistance to any State upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit. But that provision of the Constitution does not cover the cases to which I have already referred, or a grant to enable prospecting to be carried on in any State. It will, however, cover the proposed grant of £450,000 toWestern Australia. When a State comes to the Commonwealth and asks for financial assistance, the Commonwealth has the right under the Constitution to give that assistance upon such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. But those terms and conditions relate to matters of repayment, the provision of a sinking fund, the rate of interest to be paid, and so forth. They do not cover the matter of how the money is to be spent, that being a matter outside the scope of the Federal Government. In regard to the bill now before the Senate, the States are not asking for assistance to enable prospecting to be carried on. This grant is a case of unsolicited andunwarranted interference by the Commonwealth in State activities, and is, as I have already said, a distinct infringement of the rights of the States. Most of the States are so hard up that they greedily grab any money that the Commonwealth cares to advance to them. That is partly because of the difficulty they have in raising money by taxation for their own requirements, while the federal taxation, direct -and indirect, remains as high as it is; and it is partly because the States are afraid that these large accumulated surpluses which are being built up in the Commonwealth will be wasted if they turn down these offers of assistance. However, that reason does not touch the vital point of this legislation. . My first objection to the bill is that it is unconstitutional, so far as it provides for making advances for prospecting within the States. Of course, it is quite consitutional, in so far as itdeals with advances for prospecting in the Northern Territory.' The Commonwealth Parliament is certainly entitled to legislate in that direction, but it has no right whatever to legislate in regard to prospecting within the States.

                        <para>- In my opinion it is. The present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> put the position very clearly in a speech he made last year, when he said that the Commonwealth Government had no right to use Commonwealth revenue for the purpose of constructing and maintaining roads within the States, because it was not a matter placed under the control and power of the Commonwealth by the Constitution. Exactly the same argument applies in regard to advances to the States for prospecting, for the purchase of wire netting, or for the building of houses. I did not think that there would be any doubt on the point in the mind of any member of the legal fraternity. I have not the slightest doubt that, constitutionally, the Federal Government has no right to intrude upon State functions in this way. I have already pointed out that the Minister may not administer these funds in any particularly defined way, but may allocate them according to his own whim, while a State, through its taxpayers, is contributing to the expenditure not only in its own territory, but also in other States. That is my first objection to the bill, and, of course, it is vital to that portion of it which deals with advances to the States. But it seems to me that there is another very strong objection to the bill, and that is that it is merely a skeleton. It is merely an enabling bill authorizing the Commonwealth to advance money up to a certain amount. It provides no basis for the allocation of the money. It contains no provision as to the terms and conditions upon which advances are to be made. All that is to be dealt with by regulation. Honorable senators will have noticed, as I certainly have for two or three years past, that there is a growing tendency on the part of the Federal Parliament to legislate in this particular way. It passes an enabling bill, but the real crux of the legislation is dealt with by regulation or by proclamation. To me that seems to be a highly objectionable form of legislation. Surely Parliament can, and should, decide how this money is to be allocated, as between the States. Surely some basis can be laid down in the bill. </para>

                    BARWELL.The question is upon what basis is a differentiation to be made. My objection is that the bill does not provide any basis whatever. The Minister
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline>
                    admitted that full discretion would be with the Minister. The allocation may be made according to his wish, or, as I' said before, his own whim. That is highly objectionable. Surely it is also equally important that Parliament should decide the terms and conditions upon which advances are to be made; but there is not a word in the bill on that point. . The principles involved are of great importance. . The first is, I contend, vital to the constitutionality of the bill. The other matter is one of procedure. It is of the utmost importance that Parliament should not delegate to the Government its powers of legislation, and have effect given to them by regulations or by proclamation. Such a course may be necessary in regard to details, but in this instance the crux of the bill is to be dealt with under regulations. The principal functions of other legislation passed by this Parliament have been left to the Government to deal with either by regulation or by proclamation. This is a matter upon which the Senate should take a strong and determined stand. It is our duty to insist that all legislation passed by this chamber shall be within the powers of this Parliament. I have expressed my opinion that as regards the payment of advances to States, this legislation is
                    <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline>
                    and I, therefore, intend to oppose the third reading of the bill.

                    <para>. - Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell,</inline> I missed my chance to speak on the second reading of the bill, and I, therefore, desire to take this opportunity to say a few words with regard to it. I do not intend to discuss its constitutional aspect, as that is a matter I do not feel competent . to debate. I think, however, that it is unwise of the Federal Parliament to encroach upon State domestic affairs, and to attempt to deal with matters of which it knows very little, and for which it has not the necessary machinery. The Commonwealth Government seems to be adopting the policy of a benevolent godfather who has too much money to spend. The objection which applies in this instance also holds in regard to the main roads vote.I shall take an opportunity later of objecting to the Commonwealth Government levying so much in the form of direct taxation, and then making grants to the States. It would be better if the Federal Government vacated the field of direct taxation and left the management of the States' domestic affairs entirely to the States. The bill, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> has stated, is a mere skeleton, and one under which power is given to the Government to make advances to prospectors and companies. I trust the Government will do no such thing, except in the case of the Northern Territory. Any advances made under this bill should be confined entirely to grants to the States. </para>

                        <para>- If the expenditure of this money is authorized, it may be necessary and desirable to spend some on old fields, or to assist prospectors going out into the bush. Apparently, a good deal will be spent in an endeavour to locate precious metals, but the possibility of fresh discoveries in this regard are remote. It would be better to devote the money to the discovery of base metals, as the base metal industry leads to greater development, and is consequently of more value to the States. It appears, however, that the bill is almost entirely to encourage prospecting for gold. The value of o'smiridium, for instance, is. seven or eight times that of gold. As the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has stated that it is  not the intention of the Government to make advances to individuals or companies, but simply to make a grant to the States, my principal objection to the bill has been removed. I shall not vote against the third reading, but shall content myself by entering my protest against the action of the Federal Government in attempting to deal with domestic questions with which it is not competent to deal, and which should be left to the States. </para>

                    <para>.- If I thought that this bill possessed the demerits pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell,</inline> I should not have supported the second reading, or any other stage. But, in my opinion, those demerits do not exist. This bill, in common with the measures enabling grants to be made to the States for wire netting and for road construction, does not take from the States the control of the distribution of such grants within their respective boundaries. It, however, does come to the aid of communities in need of assistance, and in respect of those matters which demand attention more than others within the purview of the State Parliaments the States may be aided in a friendly and constitutional manner by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to suggest that we should look to another minion of the law. I look on this bill as being on all-fours with similar legislation which has already passed this chamber, and has given much-needed assistance to the States. The reason for the granting of that assistance is a different story. If the original provision in the Constitution with regard to the annual distribution of any surplus revenue had been continued, the present position would not have arisen. The surplus at the end of every year would have been divided amongst the States. But as that is not the present position, I look upon this grant as a somewhat tardy restitution to the States by the Commonwealth. It stands to the credit of this Government that it should have attempted to make restitution, on such a satisfactory basis as that embodied in this measure. The grants for wire netting and for roadmaking were made on the same basis, namely, that, of population and area com- bined. If the grant is to be made on this basis, I, perhaps, should feel even more inclined to support it. </para>

                        <para>- That is another question which, I admit, merits a full discussion in this Senate. The Commonwealth is receiving too much revenue. It could do with less. But if it is in the position to help the States, we should not prevent that assistance from being given. We must remember that we are dealing with present-day conditions. The Commonwealth has a large surplus, whereas most of the States show a deficit each year; and, in consequence, they are unable to carry out the public works which are essential for their development. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> refers to this attempt by the Commonwealth to assist the States as an unwarranted interference with the States. If I were in financial difficulties, and a wealthy neighbour offered to assist me, I should not describe his offer as an unwarranted intrusion into my affairs. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the Constitution anticipated a situation such  as  has now arisen, because it provides that nothing in the Constitution shall prohibit a State from granting aid to, or a bounty for, mining operations. As the Constitution provides that the powers of the States and the Commonwealth shall not conflict,the inference is that the Commonwealth shall be permitted to assist in the development of mining. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> will not press his opposition to this measure, because, although the amount of the grant is small, the disbursement of the money may have good results. </para>

                    <para>. - I am surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> say that the bill is unconstitutional. As a layman I would  hesitate, of course, to challenge his opinion; but let us, as laymen, consider what the Constitution provides. The only reference to the distribution of Commonwealth revenue, so far as I know, is to be found in section 87, which states - During a period of ten years after the es tablishment of the Common wealth, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the severalStates taken over <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>Prom and after the 3 1st day of December, 1910, section 87 of the Constitution shall cease to have effect so far as it affects the power of the Commonwealth to apply any portion of the net revenue of Customs and Excise towards its expenditure; and so far as it affects the payment of any balance by the Commonwealth to the several States, or the application of such balance towards the payment of interest on the debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>

As a matter of fact, under section 5 of the Surplus Revenue Act Parliament proceeded to do the very thing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> said would be unconstitutional; that is, it proceeded to differentiate between the States. It provided under section 5 for a special payment from Commonwealth revenue to Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It would be interesting to know how far <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> would push his conclusion. Would he say that the Commonwealth did an unconstitutional thing in devoting portion of its revenue towards the cost of the conservation and utilization of the waters of the river Murray, in which matter the Commonwealth came to the assistance of only three of the States? For some years Commonwealth revenue has been expended in that direction. Would the honorable senator say, for instance, that the United States of America was acting unconstitutionally - and  it3  Constitution is in this regard similar to that of Australia - in directing its Federal expenditure towards the construction and upkeep of roads, in conjunction with the States? The best and greatest highways in the world are those constructed in that country, by. such grants as this, as a result of Federal and State action. </para>

                        <para>- Neither under the Constitution of the United States of America, nor under the Commonwealth Constitution, is it clearly defined that the Federal authority cannot assist in the construction of roads in a State. Take another matter. The Commonwealth Government is now in consultation with two of the States in regard to the eradication of the tick pest. Is that action within the proper sphere of the Commonwealth? I understand that it is the duty of the States to deal with such matters; but is there anything in the Constitution to prevent the Commonwealth from co-operating with the States ? </para>

                        <para>- One might multiply instances where such co-operation is desirable. I am surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> raising the question of the constitutionality of the bill. I could, however, understand his raising the point, which, I think, was made by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> before he joined the Cabinet, as to whether it is advisable that the Commonwealth should raise more taxation than it requires for its own purposes, and, having raised more than it needs, give back the surplus to the States. But to say that ir. is unconstitutional to do so is to go further than any other member of either House has urged. </para>

                        <para>- If Parliament desired to make a grant to a State I think that it could attach any conditions it desired. I am not urging that it is advisable that Parliament should do so, but I think that it is not prevented by the Constitution from doing so. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden's</inline> point I may say that the Government certainly does not intend to deal directly with prospectors or companies in the distribution of this grant to the States. We shall only do that in regard to the Northern Territory. In other respects the grant will be made to the State Governments, who will deal with the prospectors or companies through their mining departments. </para>

                    <para>. - I have one or two criticisms to offer. With the principle of the bill I have no quarrel, but I venture to say that the Government might have gone further than it does under the measure. Provision is made for the payment of £60,000 for assisting the State Governments, companies, and individuals, engaged in the search for oil in Australia, and for carrying out boring operations . and geological surveys. In that regard I. think that the object of the bill is sound. We realize the great value of oil, and the important part it plays in the history of nations. Its economic value for industrial purposes, and for land transport is almost incalculable. The increase in the consumption of petroleum oil in Australia has been very rapid. In 1922-23 Australia consumed 46,000,000 gallons for all purposes, the value of which was £3,500,000. In 1924-25 90,000,000 gallons were used, and the value was £5,375,000, showing that in two years the consumption increased by approximately 100 per cent. The bill deals in the ' first place with assistance in boring for oil, and secondly with assistance in research work and geological surveys. The first objection I have to it  is the provision of the paltry sum of £60,000. I fail to realize how practical assistance in the search for oil, and in the making of surveys, can be given by means of such a trifling amount. It should be considerably increased, and the Government should act in conjunction with the State departments in making geological surveys. Another objection- I have is that the money to be allowed can be spent only in Australia. No portion of it can be allocated to any territory of the Commonwealth such as Papua, or the mandated territory of New Guinea, where, according to expert advice, there is a probability of discovering oil. It is true that the Commonwealth spent up to the end of 1925, £350,000 in the search for oil in that area. </para>

                    was operating in conjunction with the AngloPersian Oil Company and the Imperial Government, with whom the Government entered into a triangular agreement. I think that that was in 1915. Eventually the Imperial Government withdrew from the agreement, and the remaining two partners carried on under it. Since that time the Commonwealth Government has been spending money in exploring for oil in Australia, whilst the AngloPersian Oil Company has acted as its agent in its search for oil in Papua. Up to 1925, £350,000 had been spent in that particular area. To-day boring operations are being continued at Popo, where the bore has reached a depth of approximately 2,800 feet, According to expert advice the bore will have to reach a depth of 3,500 feet before it can be ascertained whether oil exists in commercial quantities. Obstacles to smooth working, many of which have been, overcome, have been caused . by, amongst other things, faults in the strata. Recently considerable delay was occasioned by an extraordinary fault in the strata. The drillers, however, are overcoming that, and I understand that drilling is to be continued to the depth at which it is expected the value of the area will be proved.

                    has. every confidence in the ultimate success of the bore, and he is one of the leading oil experts in the world. But should it, unfortunately, prove to be not successful, no assistance will be provided by this bill towards further prospecting for oil in that area. A! certain part of the mandated territory of New Guinea has been favorably reported on by

                    If we are to spend money in prospecting for oil our mandated territories should not be excluded from monetary assistance.

                        <para>- I am aware of that. I am referring to the expert opinion that was given to the Government by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade.</inline> We have been informed that £22,500 will be set aside for boring operations in the Fitzroy area, and in the vicinity of Price's Creek, in Western Australia, and that another £22,500 will be allocated to the area known as Belford Dome, in the Hunter River district of New South Wales. In addition to those sums, £5,000 is to be allocated to a geological survey of the areas around Longreach, Blackall, and Ruthven, in Queensland. Honorable senators will thus see at a glance that only £5,000 will be left for general research work. Oil is such an important commodity that every assistance should be given to those who desire to prospect for it, provided that they are backed up by expert opinion. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that the Government would be prepared to assist prospectors provided that there was expert evidence to the* effect that they, were not engaged upon any " wild cat '" proposition. There are areas available for testing, in connexion with which expert evidence could be obtained. The bill, therefore, does not go far enough. A very important part of the work is that which relates to geological surveys, and in that connexion I consider that the Government is not wholly performing its duty. It should establish a Federal geological survey somewhat on the lines of that which is in existence in the United States of America. .The Committee of Public Accounts took a considerable amount of evidence on this point and made certain recommendations to the Government. Perhaps I cannot- do better than quote from its report, in view of the admitted necessity for establishing a Federal geological survey that will enable the' Commonwealth to work in cooperation with the whole of the States. </para>

                    <para>The need for early action for Australia to obtain reliable information concerning its mineral oil resources so impressed the committee that, on 5th January, 1925, a communication in the following terms was addressed to the Prime Minister: - "Although the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in connexion with its present investigation of the expenditure on oil exploration, development, refining, &amp;c, in the Commonwealth and Papua, cannot be made available until Parliament is in session, there are certain features which have been brought out in the evidence already heard by the committee which, in its opinion, demand urgent attention by the Commonwealth Government. These features relate particularly to the possibility of Australia being made more self-contained in the matter of oil supplies, which are essential for her defence and for the maintenance of her industries. I have therefore been directed by my committee to address this communication to you at this stage of the committee's proceedings in the hope that early action might be taken to give effect to its recommendations. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely pointing out the shortcomings of the bill - the small amount of money provided and the fact that we have no Federal geological survey staff. My last point is,  that none of the money to be allocated is to. be spent in the , Territory of New Guinea.Reports have shown that geologists are of opinion that there is every prospect of oil being obtained in parts of the Territory. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 22nd January last, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> Stewart, of the Colonial Exploration and Development Syndicate, Melbourne, on his return from New Guinea, said that he was convinced that oil existed there in large quantities. I cannot say that oil will be found in the Territory, but, as the Commonwealth is entering the field of oil exploration, I think it only right that assistance should be extended to those who are searching for it in New Guinea.

                    <para>. - While I support the bill, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that the Government could have gone much further and have provided more money. Of the £60,000 proposed to be spent, the Government has apparently made up its mind to devote £22,500 to the Fitzroy River district, Western Australia, a similar amount to the Hunter River district, New South Wales, and £10,000 for further geological surveys in Australia, leaving only £5,000 for exploration in districts outside the Fitzroy River and Hunter River districts. In reply to an interjection, the Minister who introduced the bill in another place indicated that this assistance would be given on a.£l for £1 basis, but that is not provided for in the bill itself. I think it should be, because people would then know exactly what the Government intended to do. The bill makes no mention of South Australia. The South Australian Oil Wells Company has spent about £90,000 in an endeavour to discover oil in South Australia, and about £12,000 in what is known as the Glenelg River field, yet no mention is made in the bill of assistance to that company. Perhaps the Government is relying on the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade.</inline> In introducing the bill, the Minister said that if expert evidence was favorable, this company would be considered, but <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> had already reported that he did not see any seepage on the Glenelg River field. In my opinion, his report was most unfair, because, on his first visit, there was no drilling in progress, and he spent only twenty minutes at the bore on his second visit. How could any one pass judgment on an oil-field on such a short inspection? I 'wish it to be clearly understood that I have no interest whatever in the South Australian Oil Wells Company, but I have been asked to state that if any honorable senator visits the Glenelg River field, he will be shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton</inline> Dod, the field superintendent  of this company, a seepage in the Glenelg River from which samples of petroleum can be collected. A sample from this seepage was analyzed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> chief chemist in the laboratory of the Victorian Mines Department, and the pith of his report was as follows : - </para>

                    was engaged by the Sinclair Corporation, a large oil company, to make a geological survey of its holdings in the Argentine Republic, and afterwards he was appointed chief geologist to the Perija  Exploration Company, of New York, and reported on its holdings in Venezuela. There he chose a large area for development, which later was taken over by the Standard Oil Company, upon the advice of its chief geologist, who inspected the field with

He paid two visits - the first occupying ten days, and the second seven days. Later on, he visited the field on four occasions. After his first visit, he reported very favorably upon the possibility of oil being proved to exist there; and after his second visit, he reported :  -

                    <para>A week was spent in the vicinity of the seepage, studying the geology of the locality and investigating the seepage. The report of the seepage was true, and we found that there was certainly oil there, a crude petroleum seeping up through the mud on the river bank. There is an almost vertical cliff here, about 50 feet high, of miocene limestone, dipping at a low angle to the north-east. The structure is similar to that already described in my previous report. The northern or Summerhill anticline extends across the border into Victoria. On the river Glenelg, several exposures are seen showing the dip of the strata. These indicate that there is a closure to the structure, and give the eastern limit of the anticline. This seepage is important, in that it proves the presence of petroleum in the district. The probability of finding oil in this area is indeed excellent, as the three main factors necessary are present, viz. :  - </para>

                <para class="block">An analysis of some oil from the seepage was made at the Mines Department laboratory, the result of which I have already given. Last September <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyne</inline> received a cable from the Standard Oil Trust directing him to return to America to take up the position of chief geologist on that company's holdings in Veuezuela. The Minister will, no doubt, agree that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyne's</inline> credentials and experience entitle him to be regarded as  a  trained geologist, ranking among the leading petroleum geologists of the day. In these circumstances the Government should accept his recommendation concerning the South Australian Oil Wells Company, and by granting a subsidy assist it to properly develop its holding. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyne's</inline> services are of sufficient value to the Standard Oil Trust to necessitate his return to America, his recommendations should be of value to the Government. I do not know either of the gentlemen to whom I have referred, and I repeat that I hold no brief for this company; but since it has spent about £90,000 in endeavouring to discover oil in South Australia, it seems to me to be worthy of support, particularly as it has proved beyond doubt that oil exists in that area. I trust the Government will favorably consider the suggestion I have made, and grant to this company the financial assistance which it deserves. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government is to be commended for introducing this bill,the object of which is to encourage the discovery of petroleum in Australia. Large sums of money have been expended by the Commonwealth and public companies in searching for oil in Australia, but the results to date have been anything but encouraging. Under the measure the Government proposes to grant financial assistance to those searching for oil in certain prescribed localities, and in doing so is taking the precaution to see that the money advanced is judiciously expended. In its desire to spend money to the best advantage the Government is accepting the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade,</inline> who, I know, is a competent geologist. In the past the control over expenditure in searching for oil has been somewhat lax, and I am therefore pleased to learn that operations are to be subsidized only in such places as are recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade.</inline> The Government, in their desire to discover flow oil by boring, should not overlook the value of the very large shale deposits which exist in Australia.In conjunction with the proposal embodied in the bill, consideration should be given to the development of some of our oil shale deposits and to other prospective sources of supply. The Public Accounts Committee visited Tasmania some time ago, and conducted an inquiry into the oil shale deposits of that State, and although I am not in a position to quote its recommendations at the moment, it is well known that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> was very much impressed with the value of those deposits. About ten years ago the Tasmanian Government proposed to take over these shale deposits with the idea of working them, and entered into a tentative agreement with the Department of the Navy for the disposal of the total output of the works. Approximately £200,000 has been spent by different companies in an endeavour to invent a retort capable of effectively treating the shale deposits in the vicinity of Latrobe, and it is anticipated that the more recent developments will be a success. "Unless some financial assistance is given by the Government, the prospect of the industry being successfully established is somewhat remote. The cost of producing shale oil and the strong competition from- imported oil makes it practically impossible for the company to carry on. During the war period the Government experienced difficulty in obtaining an uninterrupted supply of imported fuel oil at a reasonable price, owing to the absence of local supplies, and in these circumstances careful consideration should be given to the possibilities of the shale oil industry. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt about that. The coal which was exhibited in Adelaide was said to have been found a few miles from that city. At my suggestion, an expert examined the coal, and he informed me that, in his opinion, it was Newcastle coal. No coal of the quality of the sample exhibited has ever been foundin the vicinity of Adelaide. My point is, that because of that sample the company was floated, and citizens of Australia robbed. It should not be possible  foi  these things to be done. If we grant a few thousand pounds to some of these shrewd individuals they will find oil in the same way that they are able 10 find oil when it suits their purpose to do so. Have honorable senators never heard of gold mines being salted ? The same thing is possible with oil. I ask the Government to provide every possible protection for the people of this country against unscrupulous company promoters.. We in this Senate may have our opinions regarding the existence of oil in Australia; but none of us is an expert in oil. We should, therefore, be careful in legislation of this nature. It is possible, in some cases, to buy the opinion of experts. Reference has been made to some experts who were in the employ of the Standard Oil Company. If they stood so high in their profession, and their opinions were of such value, why did the Standard Oil Company not retain their services ? </para>

                        <para>- I could give an answer to that question, but I consider that it is for the Minister to do so. I say emphatically that on many occasions the people of this country have been misled and robbed by alleged experts. One has only to read the history of gold mining in this country to know that. People are always anxious to get rich quickly, and, therefore, they are in danger of being robbed by unscrupulous persons. I wish to protect the poor people of this country. Particularly am I 'concerned with those persons who have a few hundred pounds available for investment, because they are the ones most easily caught. </para>

                        <para>- No measure should pass this chamber until it has been fully considered from every aspect. This National Parliament is greater than a parochial council, and the people of Australia take their lead from it. Our first object, therefore, should be to protect them. I shall always oppose the efforts of " wild cat " company promoters - I care not who they are.- It is the duty of the Government to protect its people against these confidence tricksters. I do not suggest that the Government has any more tender regard for them than I have, but I desire to stress the importance of safeguarding the people in every possible way. </para>

                    <para>. -  I wish to reply to some remarks made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham).</inline> The honorable senator referred to a conference of State geologists and others which was called together to advise the Government regarding various suggestions made by the Public Accounts Committee, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade,</inline> as to the best means of conducting the geological work of the States. That conference revealed that there was little or no  co-ordination  between the: geological departments of the various States; each was really a water-tight compartment. On the maps of one State a certain colour indicated a particular rock or mineral; on the maps of another State that colour represented a different rock or mineral. The conference agreed that a good deal of preliminary work could be done by the existing organization. No one will doubt that there are already sufficient demands on the public funds. It was, therefore, considered that, before superimposing a Federal Geological Department on the existing machinery, of the States, the commonsense thing to do was to obtain, so far as possible, co-ordination between the State departments. The Government has not deemed it necessary to accomplish in one year all that the conference recommended. It considered that the first requirement was that the States should set. their own houses in order, and obtain uniformity. I point out that officers representing all the States attended that conference, took part in the discussion, and assisted in framing the resolutions which emanated from it. They agreed that the first step necessary was that there should be coordination between the existing departments. Other improvements also can be effected later by the existing organization. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade,</inline> in all the States of the American union, the geological maps are uniform. That is what Australia needs. It can be done by the States working on proper lines; a Federal department, for that purpose, is not necessary. After that has been done there' will be some work for a Federal geological survey, working with the States. The Government has not rejected the proposal for the establishment of a Federal geological survey, although it does not propose to do anything in that direction this year. It believes that it is first necessary for the preliminary work mentioned to be done. The constitution of a Federal- geological survey should not be lightly undertaken, as it will involve, not only a ' large, but also a continuous expenditure. It is not sufficient to say that because money for the purpose is available this year, a Federal geological survey should be established, and that next year it could again be. considered. The members of the staff  would  have to be engaged for a term of years, and in the event of the work being no longer continued, they would be entitled to compensation. This part of the project has been left over until the preliminary work has been accomplished. Regarding the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare,</inline> I pointed out in my speech on the second reading of the bill, that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. "Wade</inline> had stated that there was still further geological data required to determine if, and where, boring was justified in the south-eastern corner of South Australia, and in the vicinity of the" mouth of the Glenelg River, and I indicated that the Government was prepared to co-operate with Victoria and South Australia in having- that additional work done. The sum of £10,000 is available, and some of it could be used for that purpose. I may remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> Hays that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade</inline> Spoke most highly in his report of the possibilities of Australian oil shales, and particularly of Tasmanian shales. He pointed out that if we should unhappily fail to discover supplies of flow oil in commercial quantities, we need not despair, because we- have the greatest deposits of oil shale to be found in any part of the world. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill, which purports to amend the Navigation Act 1912-1925, is insignificant in size, -but it involves a vital principle. I regard it as emanating from the famous mandate, about which one hears so much. The excuse that the Government has given for the bill is that on 14th November it obtained a mandate from -the people. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> the mandate that he received was that he should temporarily retire from the political arena. The word " mandate" seems to have become more blessed of late than that one time " blessed word Mesopotamia." Tasmania is to be assisted under the bill, in regard to its tourist traffic. I have every sympathy with that State in its difficulties due to its isolation, and my sympathy is so great that I would be prepared to- 'help in the erection of block and tackle to haul the island State, if that were possible, nearer to the mainland. I am wondering whether the bill will accomplish all that it seeks to do. My first doubt is as to its constitutionality. As a layman, it seems to me that it shows discrimination between States, and differentiating legislation is specifically forbidden by the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that aspect later. If the Government desires to assist Tasmania particularly it may do so under the act of last session, which empowers it to suspend by proclamation Part VI. of the Navigation Act, which is really the whole essence of the measure, since it deals with the manning of the vessels, the conditions of employment, the rationing scale, &amp;e. But the Government has refrained from suspending that part of the act, and has brought in this bill by virtue of its mandate. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> in his policy speech, stated that the Government proposed to introduce legislation to permit overseas vessels to engage in the tourist trade during the period when that traffic was not adequately provided for. If the object of the measure were to -relieve Tasmania of any difficulties under which she laboured throughout the year, one could understand its introduction, but it proposes to give relief only during a period when tourists are travelling to and from Tasmania. </para>

On the contrary, Tasmania has been at the door of the Commonwealth Government, seeking its aid throughout the whole of the remaining nine months.

                    <para class="block">The Prime .Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> distinctly indicated, in his policy speech, that legislation would be introduced to allow oversea vessels to engage in the tourist traffic to Tasmania. Since the passage of the Navigation Act, oversea vessels have not been allowed to trade between the mainland and Tasmania either during the tourist season or at any other time. Why? Because the act prohibited such, trading. For what reason was the prohibition enacted? Because oversea ships were not then - nor are they now - working in accordance with the provisions of the act, firstly because in some cases they employed black labour, and secondly because the wages paid and the conditions of employment did not conform to the Australian standard. We must ask ourselves whether we acted rightly or wrongly when, after years of deliberation, we enacted that the seamen engaged in our coasting trade should work under good conditions of labour and be paid decent wages. That is a principle which cannot be departed from. I maintain that we acted rightly when we passed that measure, and that honorable senators on this side are today acting rightly when they demand that the provisions of the act shall continue to apply. There is another principle which is greater than that governing the conditions of labour or the rates of wages. The people of Australia have for many years subscribed to that principle, which embodies the policy of a White Australia. I believe that the Government has a sufficient number of supporters in this chamber, as it had in another place, to enable the bill to be passed. If it is passed it will be a violation of our White Australia policy, and it will bring into competition with Australian coastal shipping vessels that are manned by black labour. </para>

                            <para>- A regulation can be framed only in accordance with the terms of an act of Parliament. If the regulation is unconstitutional, then I argue that the act itself must be unconstitutional. Giving his legal opinion on the bill in another place the Attorney-General quoted two High Court cases and referred to the decisions therein given. The first was the <inline font-style="italic">Barger</inline> case, or what is commonly known as the <inline font-style="italic">Harvester</inline> case. Parliament had, with certain exemptions, imposed an excise duty upon harvesters and other agricultural implements manufactured in Australia. Manufacturers who observed the conditions of labour that had been declared by Parliament to be fair and reasonable, or who complied with an award of the Arbitration Court, had not to pay the excise duty. By a majority of three to two, the High Court judges declared that legislation to be invalid. They said, amongst other things, that the legislation was of such a character that under it discrimination might take place between States, or parts of States, and in that direction lay its invalidity. That view is held also by the present Attorney-General, and I think that it is the correct view. </para>

                    <para>My main objection to the bill is not only that it violates the White Australia policy, but that it also directly contravenes all the principles contained in the Navigation Act. We all know the history of that act ; we know how long it took to place it . on the statute-book, and we know the prominent part <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Hughes played in framing it. He was  chairman  of the Navigation Commission appointed by the Federal Parliament in 1904 to inquire into the whole question with a view to drawing up a navigation law that would be an example to the rest of the world, and afterwards, when he became a member of a Labour Government, he was chosen because of his intimate knowledge of Australian maritime law to represent the Commonwealth at an Imperial Navigation Conference. He has now condemned this amending bill because it is antagonistic to our White Australia policy, and will be the means of lowering the wages df Australian seamen. No one in Australia has a better knowledge of the position than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> The bill will not permanently affect Tasmania. I said a little while ago that if we were anxious <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> relieve the State of its disabilities we should pass legislation that would help it all the year round, and not during the tourist season only. I realize .the island's isolation. Western Australia was just as isolated before the building of the transcontinental railway. </para>

If that were done there would be no need to destroy the whole of the provisions of the Navigation Act applying to the carrying of passengers and mails and the manning of vessels. If this bill is passed there will be a complete violation of the White Australia policy and a lowering of the standard of the working conditions of Australian seamen. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot allow a measure of this kind to pass without entering a strong protest against it. I do not propose to traverse the ground already covered by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham),</inline> but I wish to emphasize one or two sentences that he uttered. No more important measure has been passed by the Federal Parliament, or received such serious and sympathetic consideration in both Houses of the Legislature than has the Navigation Act introduced by a Government, of which I was a member, about fifteen years ago. It was submitted to this Chamber by the present Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who was a member of that Government. We all know that it had been on the stocks for a long time prior to the advent of the Labour Government, and that, in certain directions, there were powerful influences in opposition to it; but one motive that, more than any other, actuated the then Government was that it should live up to its declared policy - that the White Australia policy should operate along the coast of Australia. Special provision was made in the bill to safeguard that policy as well as to protect the interests of those who follow a seafaring life. Vessels which did not comply with the conditions laid down in the act were specially excluded from trading on our coast. So far as Tasmania is concerned, it has, time after time, importuned the Federal Parliament for assistance in various directions. No other State has made more appeals to Parliament than has Tasmania. One would think that it depended solely on the two T's - tourists and Tattersalls. We know that an effort was made to amend the Post and Telegraph Act in order to give the institution known as "Tatt's " a monopoly. That failed, and now an effort is being made to amend the Navigation Act to indue?, so we are told, more tourists to go to the island. </para>

                            <para>- Not a word on that question. No Tasmanian will seriously suggest that an amendment of the Navigation Act will attract more tourists to Tasmania. According to the report of the Royal Commission which inquired into the operations of the Navigation Act, the number who have travelled on vessels other than coastal boats during the tourist season has been infinitesimal. Although the tourist traffic to Tasmania during certain periods of the year is considerable, according to the report of the commission, the accommodation on the vessels trading between Sydney and Hobart has not always been fully taken up even during the busiest season of the year. </para>

                            <para>- Dozens of proposals are placed before the electors in a policy speech, and the electors have either to accept or reject the policy as a whole. I know how keenly Tasmanian senators feel on this matter. I have heard them speak in the strongest possible denunciatory terms of an industrial organization which they have said is hampering the trade between the mainland and Tasmania, and in doing so have made an attack, not only on trade unionism, b.ut also on the Navigation. Act. Some of these Tasmanians will not stop at anything. They want, not merely to break down the Navigation Act, but also to weaken the power of an organization the members of which are engaged in the coasting trade. They believe it would be better if this organization were not as strong numerically and financially as it is to-day, so that ship-owners would be able to carry on as they did before the Navigation Act was passed. The seamen brought the organization up to its present strength, and the coastal seamen's conditions are better than they have ever been. The Navigation Act was passed owing to the efforts of the Labour party, and the present condition of the men engaged in the coastal trade are due entirely to the efforts and energy of those associated with the Labour party. The Navigation Act is the work of the Labour party. </para>

The question naturally arises whether the Labour party of that day, or the present Labour party, shall be regarded as the better custodian of the principle of a White Australia. The decision to exempt Western Australia was the mature judgment of the Labour party of the time. That exemption permitted boats manned by black labour to carry passengers between Western Australia and the other States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> and I have both travelled on those boats. </para>

                            <para>- Well, Senators de Largie and Henderson did. The honorable senator cannot get away from the fact that, with the exception of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator R.</inline> S. Guthrie, the Labour party of that time agreed to vessels which employed black labour engaging in the passenger trade on the Australian coast. At that time there were no strikes such as have in recent years affected Tasmania so adversely, and caused the people of that State to be a beleaguered community.  Her  primary producers have found it almost impossible to make a living. If there was warrant for an exemption in the case of Western Australia, there is greater justification for a similar concession in the case of Tasmania because of her isolation and the strikes which have occurred. The figures referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> regarding the number of people travelling to Tasmania, and the difficulty of obtaining accommodation for those who do go there, do not take into account the number of people who would have visited Tasmania but who, through fear of being marooned, have stayed at home, or gone elsewhere. The entirely fallacious argument which was advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh</inline> and Messrs. Anstey and Yates in their report on the effects of the Navigation Act on Tasmania has been supported to-day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh.</inline> Honorable members who oppose any alteration to the Navigation Act would speak differently if they were primary producers in Tasmania, and after having striven for a year to produce a crop had seen it rotting because of the action of some members of the latter-day Seamen's Union. </para>

Had he studied the reasons for the introduction of this measure, he would have known that the utilization of overseas boats for the conveyance of passengers between the mainland and Tasmania, which this measure proposes, could not in any way affect that policy, nor could it affect the conditions which the Navigation Act provides shall apply to seamen engaged in the coasting trade of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- They entirely ignored Tasmania and the possibility of any injury being done to that State. They were, however, not permitted to ignore the disabilities which Western Australia would suffer, and consequently they made provision accordingly. Prior to the Navigation Act, oversea vessels carrying  tourists visited Tasmania regularly during the tourist season. Tasmania has lost not only a large proportion of her tourist traffic . and the chance of disposing of her early crop of apples at the best prices on the London market, but she has lost, also, the valuable trade which previously existed between Tasmania and New Zealand. Well-appointed vessels, which previously sailed from Sydney to Hobart, and on to the Bluff, carrying cargo and passengers, do not now call at Tasmanian ports unless a fairly large quantity of cargo - about 1,500 tons - is offering. As it would be useless for me to move a furtheramendment to the bill, I content myself with dealing with it in its present form. </para>

                            <para>- Tasmania's tourist trade, if fostered, will benefit not only Tasmania, but the people of the mainland, because they will be able to get away from the heat of the other States and enjoy a holiday in the beneficial climate of Tasmania, and return better fitted for the duties of their avocations. Many people who would visit Tasmania on a Peninsular and Oriental boat do not go there now, notwithstanding that many of the vessels visiting Tasmanian ports are well appointed. It is common knowledge that many passengers now pay first-class fares between Sydney and Hobart and yet, because the number of tourists is greater than the accommodation provided, receive only a " shake-down " on deck. The proposals contained in this bill do not endanger the White Australia policy, nor will they inflict any hardship on Australianseamen. </para>

                    <para>More oversea boats went into Hobart during 1023 to carry away fruit than ever went into it before in a single year. It is complained that there were only half the number of fast mail boats now going into their capital port. That fact applies to every capital port in Australia, because the oversea mail service is 50 per cent. below pre-war. The Commonwealth Shipping Line boats calling into Hobart carry away more fruit than the mail boats carried, and give a quicker dispatch. The mail boats lose two days going up the Gulf of Taranto to deliver mails. </para>
                    <para>There is an interstate market for Tasmanian fruit equal to the 1923 oversea record - 1,500,000 cases. </para>

In 1922 - since the act has been in operation - the traffic was 25,635, and in 1923, 24,213. </para>

                        <para>Before the Navigation Act operated there tourists came 'by what was known as the " apple trip." They could travel during the apple season by mail steamer between, say, Sydney or Brisbane-Melbourne-Hobart, and return by another mail steamer. It is contended that these vessels began to build up a separate branch of the tourist traffic. It is claimed that most of those people do not now visit Tasmania, because they desired comfortable travelling which, it is stated, is denied to them by the present facilities., consisting of comparatively small coastal vessels with frequently crowded accommodation, and the Launceston-Hobart railway. </para>
                        <para>According to statistics placed before your Commissioners, 500 people visited Tasmania by means of the " apple trip " in 1913, and in 1914 this number increased to 1,000. It is claimed that the number of wealthy tourists was increasing, and that this branch of the traffic was being built up when the war stopped it, and the Navigation Act prevented its revival. </para>
                        <para>As against this argument, ' evidence was furnished by representatives of the interstate shipping companies that the service provided by them is ample, and for more than half of the year their vessels from Sydney to Hobart, and Melbourne to Launceston, have a great percentage of empty passenger accommodation. This is proved amply, but evidence was also brought forward that during the tourist season these vessels are "always full, and are crowded to a great extent - that intending tourists are offered second-class accommodation and " shake downs " on payment of first-class fares, with the result that many people who will travel in comfort or not at all no longer visit Tasmania. </para>
                        <para>In regard to this complaint that the tourist traffic of Tasmania has been vitally affected by the prevention of mail boats from carrying interstate passengers, it is admitted by witnesses and shown by statistics that prior to the Navigation Act the number  of  tourists arriving at Hobart by mail steamers was insignificant compared  with  the numbers arriving by interstate vessels. The witnesses, claimed that the practice or habit of wealthy people from other States visiting Hobart by- mail steamers was in its infancy, and if it had not been for the Navigation Act, the numbers would have been largely increased. This is purely supposition. {Statistics were also produced by the State Government Statistician, showing that the number of tourists visiting Tasmania was back to the pre-war level, and further evidence was given that the tourist season at Hobart for 1924 had every promise of being a record. </para>
                        <para>Figures were placed before your Commissioners showing a large percentage of empty berth accommodation in interstate passenger vessels to Tasmania, and it was shown that only during holiday rushes were the vessels taxed to full capacity.

                        <para>With reference to your letter of the 18th March, relative to the effect' of the Navigation Act on the trade of Tasmania, I desire to inform you that, in view of the importance of the matter, and of the fact that reference is made in your letter to statements made by me on the occasion of my visit to Hobart on 1st February, your communication has been held over for my personal attention. You quote me as saying on die occasion mentioned, "The ships arranged for can carry twice as many apples as will be available for them. The latest estimate of the Tasmanian fruit crop for overseas this season is 1,000,000 cases, and. the steamers scheduled to call would, after providing for mainland requirements have space available to take 2,000,000  cases from Tasmania. Can you, in the face of these figures, say that the Act is inflicting any injury on your fruit trade?" and offer the comment that the figures as to production being correct, the information given by mc as to the space available was quite incorrect. In reply to this, I would state that I have had the data upon which I based my remarks carefully reviewed, and I find that ' the latter were, at the time they were made, a perfectly . accurate statement of the position. My information was obtained from an authoritative source - the shipping people who handle refrigerated shipping in Australia. It showed that at that time 29 ships were tentatively fixed to take, in the aggregate, nearly 2,000,000 cases of fruit from Hobart. And had conditions in the refrigerated products export trade remained as they were, as appeared likely, there is no doubt whatever that these ships,' would have actually taken away every case of fruit that the Tasmanian growers could offer. But the British markets for meat and butter, which were at that time perfectly dead, shortly afterwards revived, and in order to' apportion the tonnage available in Australia evenly between the trades concerned, the committee controlling the refrigerated ships, which i3 in no way connected with the Government or under Government control, withdrew certain vessels that were listed for Tasmania's fruits, and made them available to carry meat and butter. I have now obtained from my colleague the Minister for Trade and Customs a report as to this year's fruit shipments from Tasmania. This is made up to the end of April, which practically completes the export season. I am surprised and gratified to learn that, including a parcel of 35,000 cases which are to be sent by the <inline font-style="italic">Baradine</inline> this month, the exports of Tasmanian fruit will reach the record figure of 1,362,000 cases. I learn that there still remains some 200,000 cases of fruit for which space to British markets cannot be obtained. </para>
                        <para>From inquiries made .among the shipping authorities, it is ascertained that the reason why these apples could not be taken was that there was not available in Australia and New- </para>
                        <para class="block">Zealand sufficient refrigerated space to take away the fruit, meat, and butter offering. Tasmanian growers are not the only sufferers, as I am informed quantities of meat and butter have also been shut out. I am also in a position to definitely state, on the authority of the shipping people who handled these vessels, and who, it must be admitted, can speak with authority on the matter, that the Navigation Act is not responsible in any way for the shortage of ships. Had there been no Navigation Act, Tasmania would not have shipped a single additional case of apples. A statement has been made that but for the act three P. and O. steamers would have visited Hobart and lifted between them some 60,000 cases of apples. I learn that two out of the three vessels referred to were definitely fixed for mainland ports months before the apple season opened. And I am also given to understand that, even if these three ships had been scheduled to call at Hobart, an equivalent space in some one or other of the boats which have been sent to that port would have been allotted instead to mainland ports, so that Tasmanian exporters would not have been benefited in any degree by their calling. Reference to the gentlemen who control the export of fruit from Tasmania will convince you, if such is necessary, of the correctness of my statement. The" Minister for Customs has publicly challenged any one to prove, by any substantial evidence, that, leaving out of account these three P. and O. vessels which might possibly have called, but which in any case are insignificant from a fruit-lifting point of view, a single ship of average refrigerated capacity omitted Hobart from her itinerary on account of the Navigation Act. And I desire to point out, and to emphasize the fact, that the Navigation Act does not interfere in the slightest degree with oversea ships bringing cargo to Australia or taking cargo away from Australia. In this regard they are on exactly the same footing as they were before the act came into operation. Touching now on the passenger traffic with the mainland, in regard to which you complain that the service provided by the interstate licensed steamers is inadequate, I have obtained full reports on this matter which go to show that the <inline font-style="italic">.Riverina</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Westralia,</inline> the two licensed boats which have been engaged in the trade between Sydney and Hobart, have accommodation for 319 and 170 passengers respectively, and that there has not been a single occasion from 1st July, 1921, when the coasting trade provisions of the Navigation "Act commenced, up to the end of last month,  on  which the accommodation on either of these vessels has been fully occupied. </para>
                        <para>There may be, as you state, some few people who would take the trip from Sydney to Hobart if allowed to do so on a Peninsular and Oriental or Orient boat, but who decline to travel on the local steamers. Many of these, however, still visit the island, proceeding by rail to Melbourne and crossing to Launceston by the fast and comfortable, vessels employed in the Melbourne-Tasmania service.

                            <para>- Unfortunately, the provisions relating to the granting of permits have proved absolutely unworkable. A permit cannot be granted until the Minister has satisfied himself that there is not sufficient accommodation on Australian vessels. That provision worked very well when the coastal shipping companies were prepared to admit that they could not provide sufficient accommodation. For instance, at Melbourne Cup time hundreds of people cannot find accommodation on the vessels owned by Australian shipping companies, and the companies themselves are pre-  pared  to admit it. Therefore, it is an easy matter for the Minister administering the Navigation Act at very short notice to give overseas vessels permits to carry passengers at Cup time. But the shipping companies decline to admit that there is not sufficient accommodation on their vessels to cope with the Queensland tourist traffic, or with the traffic between Sydney and Hobart. The demand for space on interstate vessels is usually confined to a few weeks at Christmas. The local companies run their vessels for the rest of the year with their accommodation far from being filled, and they naturally regard with a jealous eye any attempt to cut into their monopoly at a time when there is the greatest demand for accommodation. From their point of view, the tourists can well wait" a week or two if they find the accommodation on the vessels fully taxed at Christmas, and, therefore, they will not acquiesce in any suggestion that the space they can provide is inadequate. In those circumstances, the Minister finds himself in a very  difficult position. If he institutes an inquiry to ascertain the facts, it means a delay of a week or two. The people who are anxious to travel will not bother to go before him, and give evidence, only to find that their opportunity for taking a holiday has in the meantime passed away, so it can easily be seen that the permit provisions in the original act have proved absolutely useless to meet emergencies at particular times of the year. Four but of seven members of the royal commission recommended a change in the Navigation Act, but so ' impressed were two of those four, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prowse,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seabrook,</inline> with the disabilities brought about by  the coastal provisions of the act that they recommended that the whole of those provisions should be repealed. They were satisfied that no modification Parliament had power to make would be of any use to the travelling public. While the other two, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and I, saw the necessity for a change in the act, we would not go as far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prowse</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seabrook.</inline> We, accordingly, recommended some modification of the unworkable coasting provisions. I should like honorable senators to compare the findings of the commission with the recent decision of the High Court in regard to the deportation case. It has been claimed that the High Court was unanimously against the deportation provisions of the Immigration Act. By the same line of reasoning it can fairly be claimed that a majority of the members of the royal commission on the effect of the Navigation Act were against the act in its present form. The Government is now endeavouring to give some effect to the finding of the majority of the commission. Since the presentation of the report of the commission there have been repeated instances of strikes inflicting the greatest hardship on people from the mainland, who found themselves in Tasmania unable to return to their homes. Honorable senators opposite admit that the conditions under which Australian seamen work are superior to those of any other country. Those conditions have been secured by the most powerful instruments we could devise - particularly the Arbitration Court - yet we find the seamen flouting this court, and saying that they would be better off without it. When men imagine they have a monopoly which enables them to dictate to the whole of the community, it is time steps were taken to restore them to their proper place, and bring them under some form of control. Therefore, I want it to be perfectly clear that if this bill does not effect an improvement I shall associate myself with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prowse</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seabrook</inline> in recommending the deletion of the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act. That is, no doubt, a warning, but we cannot tolerate tyranny by the seamen any more than Ave can on the part of any other bodywhich puts itself above the rest of the community. I thought honorable senators opposite would have raised their voices very emphaticallywhen the strikes occurred, to warn the seamen that they were playing with fire, and stood to lose that positionwhich had been Avon  for them by the operation of legislation enacted by this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I congratulate it on having been more fortunate than I thought it would be in its efforts to dispose of them. At any rate the remedy suggested by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> would be a great deal worse than the trouble he seeks to cure. A great deal has been said about the White Australia policy. Honorable senators opposite would have us believe that honorable senators on the ministerial side are advocates of a black Australia. My honest opinion is that our friends opposite do not really believe that of their opponents. I think I can answer for those who are supporting the Government that not one of them would advocate anything approaching a departure from the White Australia policy. On the other hand, what was the attitude of our friends opposite during the recent British seamen's strike? British vessels employing British seamen at £9 a month, the nearest approach to the Australian standard, were held up for months, while foreign vessels, manned by foreign crews, some of them coloured, and paid £3, £4, and £5 a month, were coming into Australian ports, getting quick dispatch from the waterside unions, and departing againwith cargo that should have gone away in British ships manned by British crews. Yet the people who permitted this to be done come here and charge honorable senators with trying to break down the White Australia policy, and introduce black labour. It is utterly wrong. Every honorable senator knows that this accusation is one of those political stunts that are made use of to please the unthinking. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is quite correct in saying that the Government has a mandate from the people.

                    <para class="block">That should be sufficiently wide. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham</inline> endeavoured to show from the quotations he read that Tasmania was not in need of assistance in the manner proposed, but he declined to give the authority he was quoting. Tasmania has for some time been ashing for relief in this direction, principally because she depends to a large extent upon the tourist traffic to assist her to raise sufficient revenue to meet her financial commitments. The tourist traffic is of great value to any country, as tourists not only spend considerable sums in making purchases and in travelling, but also advertise the country when they return home. The Canadian authorities spend thousands of pounds annually in England in inducing people to visit Canada, as they realize the benefit of the tourist traffic. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham,</inline> in opposing the bill, apparently overlooked the fact that prior to the construction of the transAustralian railway, Western Australia was isolated from the Eastern States in much the same way as Tasmania is today. Although the Navigation Act was passed in 1912, it was not proclaimed until 1920. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The act was not proclaimed until the trans-Australian railway was completed, and until then the Western Australian people had the privileges which the Tasmanians are now seeking. If it is right to protect Western Australia's interests, is it not equally right to honour our obligations to Tasmania, particularly when we can do so without detrimentally affecting the interests of any section of the community ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham</inline> referred to the trade between the mainland and Tasmania, but that is not affected in any way by this measure, which deals only with tourist traffic. Honorable senators opposite should act fairly, and in criticizing the bill should not endeavour to brand honorable senators on this side of the Chamber as men who are opposed to the White Australia policy. Such criti cism is unfair, and altogether unworthy of them. </para>

                <para class="block">We have been told by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> that when this measure becomes law there will be no discrimination as between States. That is admitted. The bill would be unconstitutional if it did not apply to all parts of the Commonwealth. While it is intended for the moment to apply only to Tasmania, senators can rest assured that an opportunity  will be found to apply its provisions to other States. The relief which Tasmania is now seeking could have been granted under the principal act if the Minister had been satisfied that the shipping facilities for tourists were inadequate, but apparently no such assurance could be given. It has been said that this measure will not in any way violate the White Australia policy; but with that I do not agree, us it will provide an opportunity to oversea ships employing coloured labour to enter the Australian coasting trade. We are informed that probably a number of oversea vessels which do not visit Tasmania at present will do so in the near future, and that 30 of these will employ white labour and seventeen coloured crews. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but I am dealing with the tourist traffic. On some vessels which are not licensed to carry passengers to Tasmania, white seamen are employed at about £9 10s. per month, and others are manned by lascars who are paid £2 or £3 per month. The wage paid to Australian seamen on the Australian coast is £18 5a. a month. Does any honorable senator suggest that the competition of ships on which British seamen and lascars are employed will not affect the ships engaged in the coastal trade ? </para>

                        <para>- Those honorable senators who declare that they are in favour of the White Australia policy will have an opportunity to show their sincerity by supporting the amendment I have moved. An important principle is involved. For that reason, and because the Government has declared that it will not be a party to a violation of that principle, I hope that the amendment will be carried. I have h§ard no reason advanced by Government supporters in opposition to the principle it contains. If preference is to be given, it should be given to Australian seamen and Australian ship-owners, and not to the Peninsular and Oriental Company. . In any case, it should be given only to vessels which employ white labour. </para>

                        <para>- I say it regarding this bill. Too much has been made of the inconvenience suffered by Tasmania by reason of the Navigation Act. Neither the report of the royal commission on the effect of that legislation, nor the evidence tendered on oath by various witnesses, contains anything which would justify any weakening on my part regarding the main provisions of the Navigation Act. This bill has been introduced to placate Tasmanian members of this Parliament, but in doing so a door is being opened to admit to the Australian coastal passenger trade vessels manned by coloured labour. It may be difficult to close that door. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the amendment will be agreed to. It will at least provide honorable senators opposite with an opportunity to show the sincerity of  their convictions regarding the maintenance of the White Australia policy. Unquestionably, that policy is at stake. If the amendment is carried, the danger that threatens it will be averted. Honorable senators have referred to the strikes which have caused inconvenience to Tasmania. I point out that in its present form the bill will not eliminate strikes. It will, however, grant permission to vessels employing coloured labour to engage in the conveyance of passengers between Tasmania and the mainland. That British ships are not immune from industrial troubles we have had evidence recently. Honorable senators who hope that this bill will entirely eliminate industrial disputes are living in a fool's paradise. The passing of this legislation will enable the Inchcape shipping combine to exploit the shipping business between Tasmania and the mainland of Australia. Let us reflect on the way in which that huge combine has grown. Between 1914 and 1917 its profits, after paying excess profits tax, amounted to £350,000,000. Those huge profits were made on a capital of £170,000,000, that being the value of the ships belonging to the combinewhich were on the British register when the war broke out. During the period mentioned, the value of those vessels increased from £170,000,000 to £500,000,000. This legislation is merely playing into the hands of that combine, which, we should not forget, was responsible recently for a reduction of £1 a month in wages paid to British seamen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> this afternoon said that the Labour party offered no objection to vessels engaged on the north-west coast of Australia obtaining an exemption from the provisions of the Navigation Act. The honorable senator was not correct in his statements. He should know that the act which this bill seeks to amend came into operation only on the 21st March, 1921. </para>

The records of Parliament will show that, notwithstanding that I refused to travel on vessels manned by coloured crews, I was able to do my duty as a member of this Senate. All that time I travelled by Australian vessels. Since 1917, when the trans-Australian railway was completed, I have only once travelled to Western Australia by boat. I have never travelled on a boat which employed a coloured crew, as the honorable senator has said. Moreover, the Labour party could not have acted as the honorable senator stated, because at the time mentioned by him the act to which he referred had not been proclaimed, and therefore, was not law. </para>

The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> stipulates that vessels carrying passsengers to Tasmania must be manned by white crews. During 1921 and 1922 I was secretary of the Trades Hall in Perth, and I know that during that time many protests were made by the Trades Hall to the Federal Government against permission being granted to ships to trade between Fremantle and the northwest ports with coloured crews. I think that I have effectively disproved <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> statements. I hope that the committee will agree to the amendment, and thus preserve the ideal contained in the Navigation Act, which was not passed until after full consideration had been given to it. </para>

Their report was unanimous, whereas the other members of the commission were unable to agree, either in their final judgment, or during the sittings of the committee. Usually, when a jury disagrees, the person on trial is released. None of the evidence placed before the commission showed that Tasmania lost anything because of the operation of the Navigation Act. Tasmania's tourist traffic is increasing year by year. </para>

                        <para>- A Sydney witness before the Navigation Commission advanced the feeble excuse, for the suspension of the operation of the coasting provisions of the' act, that he was not content to travel to Tasmania in a small vessel, but wanted the advantages which an overseas vessel provided. That was practically the only argument advanced against the act. The interstate shipping companies proved conclusively that ample accommodation was always available on their vessels for the requirements of passengers. It was shown that at any period of the year the travelling facilities were equal, at any rate, to those provided for passengers travelling from State to State by railway. I have been compelled to travel between Adelaide and Melbourne without the convenience of a sleeper; but that is no sound argument forintroducing coloured labour on the railways. The Premier of South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gunn),</inline> on a recent visit to Melbourne, had to sit up all night in a railway carriage because a sleeping berth was not available. The fact that Tasmanians cannot always obtain sleeping berths on steamers when they travel to Melbourne does not prove that the shipping service is inadequate. Even on the east-west railway, some of the passengers are occasionally unable to obtain sleeping accommodation when they are prepared to pay for it. The United States of America has passed an act-- </para>

I repeat what I said by way of interjection to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson),</inline> that' South Australia has rights equal to those of Tasmania. History was made when this Parliament passed the Navigation Act, which is a superior measure to that of the United States of America, under which only vessels flying the Stars and Stripes can trade on the American coast. I maintain that Australian shipping companies alone should be permitted to engage in the coasting trade of the Commonwealth. Why should coloured crews be allowed to rob white Australians of employment? Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> I suppose, will agree that an Australian sailor can do better work than a lascar. The Government, by this measure, practically states that a lascar sailor is preferable to an Australian, and there I join issue with it. That is what the bill really means. </para>

                    <para>. - The committee should accept the amendment. We should endeavour to have every vessel that flies the nation's flag manned by a white crew, at least on the Australian coast. This Government, however, has gone out of its way to give preference to vessels manned by coloured labour, and it has shown very little respect for the White Australia ideal. Surely the amendment, which gives preference to white crews, is British and broad enough for the Ministry to accept. The statement has been made that the consideration shown to Tasmania by this bill will be extended to the other States. The Government admits, then, that it is prepared to. permit coloured labour to be employed between, not only Tasmania and the mainland, but any other parts of the Commonwealth. I hope that those persons who desire to visit Tasmania will decline to travel on boats that carry coloured crews.We know of the pannicky state of mind into which coloured members of crews are thrown in times of shipwreck. They then commit acts that it would not be possible for a white crew to commit. When the Government next goes before the electors it will have to explain why it was not prepared to give preference to British crews. I cannot understand the attitude of honorable senators opposite who claim that they would not do anything to violate the White Australia policy, and yet oppose this amendment. If they do not support the amendment, they will en- courage not a white but a coloured Australia. </para>

                <para>I hope that this amendment will meet a fate different from that of the amendment with which we have just dealt. Although the committee has agreed to coloured labour being employed, we desire to see that Australian rates of wages are paid. I cannot imagine this  Parliament, which has laid down a certain standard of living in all industries, allowing any company to compete with Australian companies and pay a less rate of wage whilst they engage in our tourist traffic. The very pernicious principle that it is now proposed to authorize was  the cause of the recent trouble along the Australian coast, because the Commonwealth Line of Steamers chartered vessels on which black labour was employed, in defiance of an award of the Arbitration Court. If the amendment is carried, the principle that underlies the section of the act which deals with wages will be upheld. That is part 6 of the act, which contains the coasting clauses. It provides that only white men shall be employed on vessels trading on the Australian coast, and that those men shall be paid a certain rate of wage and work under certain conditions. All I ask is that the wages which the court has fixed  shall be paid to nien who are employed on unlicensed vessels. </para>

                        <para>- It should not require enforcement. The Government should provide, in this measure, that those wages must be paid. The act enabled the Australian seamen to secure reasonable wages and decent living conditions, whilst, at the same time, it protected the Australian vessels from the competition of oversea vessels that employed cheap coloured labour. I want to test the feeling of the committee on the question of the payment of Australian rates of wages, and the observance of Australian working conditions, on unlicensed vessels. Honorable senators may say, " That can be done by regulation or in some other way." But why should not Parliament itself insert the provision in this measure ? The committee has violated one principle for which Australia stands: let us now try to conserve the interests of these men who "go down to the sea in ships." At this particular season, when persons wish to visit Tasmania to enjoy its salubrious climate and the hospitality of its people, why not make sure that the men who take them there are paid the proper rate of wages ? That is* the object of my amendment. Surely honorable senators will not constitute themselves a wages-reduction tribunal. Surely the Government will not allow it to be said that it stands for the reduction of wages. It has already enough sins to answer for, since it has been given its mandate from the people, and I do not wish to add to its already long list of offences the. sin of reducing wages. </para>

                        <para>- I am worried at the efforts made by the Government, backed up by its supporters, to weaken the Navigation Act. That act was passed in the interests of the shipowners and seafaring men of Australia to protect them against unfair competition from overseas vessels, and, it was hoped, to make a White Australia possible for all time on the coastal shipping, service of Australia. The arguments - if they can be called arguments - advanced to-day by honorable senators opposite are the self-same arguments that were advanced by the opponents of the Navigation Bill when it was under consideration here some years ago. I hope that no one believes at the present time in placing the ship-owners and seafaring men of Australia at a disadvantage. It is true that some people prefer to travel on oceangoing vessels as against interstate steamers; but we should be anxious to give Australian industries and enter, prises every encouragement. We have passed a Customs tariff to prevent what we call unfair competition with Australian industries from overseas, and if at a time when there was a shortage of any particular commodity it was seriously suggested that the duties on the imported article should not be operative, there would be a hue and cry from one end of Australia to the other. Yet, because, according to some honorable senators from Tasmania, there has been a little difficulty in getting accommodation for tourists at a certain period of the year, it is proposed to abrogate some of the main provisions of the Navigation Act in the interests of certain sections in Tasmania. It would be unfair to allow overseas unlicensed vessels, employing whom they like, working them as long as they like, and paying them any wages they please, to trade between the mainland and Tasmania in competition with the established shipping industry of Australia. I do not know what the shipowners of Australia think about the matter. I am not, for the moment, concerned about them. They can look after their own interests; but I am concerned about those who1 are working on their vessels. It is said that the passengers who are likely to travel on the boats that will be allowed to trade between the mainland and Tasmania if the bill goes through in its present form, will have to pay higher fares than are charged by the Australian ship-owners. If that be so, it is an additional reason why the committee should agree to the amendment, because the overseas vessels will be making more profit out of the passenger traffic. I see no reason why this. Parliament should be a party to  giving to overseas ship-owners a greater profit than can possibly be obtained by Australian ship-owners. , The Government's policy in regard to shipping facilities for Tasmania does not meet with the approval of the Opposition, and we shall lose no opportunity of doing anything we can to protect that section of the community we are here to represent. I hope that the committee will compel the overseas ship-owners engaging in the Australian coasting trade to observe those conditions that are enforced by our Navigation Act on Australian ship-owners. </para>

                    <para>. - We hear a great deal about inviting people from overseas to come to Australia. I have even seen it reported that the German Government is making overtures to the Commonwealth Government to send some of the surplus population of Germany to Australia. One of the best ways to encourage immigration is to treat decently the men who visit our shores on overseas vessels. I hope that, in no circumstances, will black men be allowed to work in the trade the committee has been discussing to-night. I hope that the only men employed in this trade will be white men of the British race, because if they come here and see the possibilities of Australia, many of them, on their return to Great Britain, will want to migrate to Australia. We spend a lot of money on Australia House, and we have quite a number of men in Great Britain promoting the interests of the people of Australia - I think that before very long <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Victor</inline> Wilson will be one of them - but the best advertisers of the possibilities of Australia are those who come here and see the good conditions prevailing in the Australian coastal shipping service. They have no interest to serve but to tell the truth about us. If they come here and enter a trade in which they may have to compete with Australians, they will be good advertisers of Australia if they are asked to work under the conditions that apply on Australian steamers. But if they are asked to work under conditions which do not bear any comparison with those prevailing on Australian owned ships, they cannot feel very satisfied with Australia. We should try to send them away satisfied. I may be a little ahead of my time, but I suggest that any man who works on a vessel on the Australian coast should be paid Australian rates of pay as determined by our Arbitration Court. </para>

I feel that if we enacted a law providing that all seamen must, on the Australian coast, get white men's rates of pay and conditions of labour, it would help us, because of the good advertisement that visiting seamen would give us on their return to the other side of the world.

                    recognizes that Australia could not dictate to the world the rates of pay that should apply on vessels that do not come under the operation of Australian law. In the recent seamen's strike, we had a sad experience of an effort to dictate what wages should be paid on overseas vessels. The vessels which will probably take advantage of the amending legislation already visit Australia, and we are merely providing facilities to enable them to engage in the passenger traffic to Tasmania when the vessels at present employed in that trade cannot cope with it. In these circumstances the number of coloured men engaged in the trade will not be increased in the slightest degree. I therefore ask honorable senators to reject the amendment in order to give Tasmania the assistance to which she is rightly entitled.

I do not wish to infer for a moment that this Chamber is above criticism; but, on the contrary, would say that it welcomes criticism so long as it is reasonable and justified. The latest recruit in this enterprise is  His  Honour the Chief Justice of Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine)</inline> who, on the occasion of the opening of the Australian Natives Association Industrial Exhibition, in Melbourne, went out of his way to criticize this Chamber. It would appear that the words of  His  Honour on that occasion received fairly wide publicity throughout the Commonwealth, and it is because of the position which  His  Honour occupies, and the publicity his words received, that I feel that something needs to be said by way of reply. </para>

                        <para>THE SENATE AND ITS CRITICS. </para>
                        <para>Dear Editor, </para>
                        <para>From time to time certain critics arise to express views on our Federal system of government, mingling praise and blame in changing proportions. But a standing feature of this class of reviewer is the singling out of the Senate for censorious treatment. It is cited as a subject of unexpected disappointment. Whatever else happens to any other part of the system, in practice the Senate never misses its full share of the flail. " The Senate has failed," runs the shibboleth. This shibboleth has as much substance in it as the average one, ancient or modern, e.g., " An Englishman's home is his castle," " The Teeming East,"  "Perfide  Albion," "The colonies are a millstone round our necks," &amp;c, &amp;c. </para>
                        <para>The chief grounds of complaint urged against the Senate are - <inline font-style="italic">{a)</inline> "The Senate has failed to protect the rights of the States"; (o ) " The Senate is but a replica of the House of Representatives": (c) "The Senate is undemocratic, inasmuch as some small States have as much representation as a suburb of some of our big cities"; <inline font-style="italic">{d)</inline> "The Senate is antiquated and partisan, because it hearkens not to the voice of minorities " ; and so on runs the indictment. The Chief Justice of Victoria now arrives with two additional counts, viz., (e) "It is doubtful if the Senate has protected the rights of the smaller 'States as it was constitutionally designed to do"; and (/) "It has failed to tone down the transient political impulses of the hour as sometimes manifested in the House of Representatives." </para>
                        <para>In putting in a word of defence for that patient Chamber, one is puzzled to decide whether to give a categorical reply to those complaints, or simply keep the ring and let the various complainants urge their case and so annihilate each other. But they are so fond of clinging to the seductive realm of assertion and vagueness that, in default of getting closer to earth, the question is never pushed to the proof for want of the necessary details. Want of these make a contention dreary and unprofitable, so, by way of a change, I shall endeavour to supply some and call for a few others, if they are available. </para>
                        <para>Respecting charge (a), the discussion would be much illuminated if its sponsors would say when, where, and how the rights of the States were seriously infringed with the Senate as a willing witness and consenting party, in a manner not provided in the Constitution and not contemplated by its framers. The cause of the States collectively, though high and important as it is and will remain, is not conceivably the supreme cause. That exclusively belongs to the nation, and in this respect, in my opinion, the Senate has no right to stand  inferiorly.  Further, the charge, to have any granite in its foundation, must depend upon the presupposition that there is a constant, unchanging resolve on the part of members elected to the House of Representatives to enlarge the sphere of federal authority and simultaneously 'diminish the States' one. At the same time, those persons elected to the Senate, in obedience to some external mandate, presumably, but not to the electors, are to do the exact opposite and resist any such design. Just picture the electors of Victoria sending two sets of men to the Federal Parliament under such contradictory commands. To do so would require a, conflicting and dual mentality with a kind of water-tight bulkhead between dividing the will to attack from the will to defend. The experience is that no such thing happens. Both sets of representatives, springing from the same common stem - viz., the most fully enfranchized democracy in the world must have, generally speaking, common characteristics, otherwise the law of affinity is mythical. The contention, therefore, that the rights of the States, viewed as a whole, apart from the edicts of the electors, has suffered or needs vigilant defence, is wholly illusory. The High Court is there to do the work of demarcation. Not so in regard to the rights of certain of the States as against certain other of the States. This is a vitally different matter. To see that the balance was here preserved with equal poise was the original and seminal reason for the creation of the Senate. Any charge urged against the Senate on any ground other than this has little force or validity. </para>
                        <para>Now as to the more popular complaints, those under <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> and (e) seem to be in conflict, for, if the small States have been neglected as claimed to be the case under (e), this can- only happen through a corresponding aggrandise-  merit of the bigger States, which under  (a)  is firmly denied. Under this head all have  Buffered,  none benefited; (c) and (d), on the face of them, are hopeless of reconciliation. What is a hall-marked gem of rare brilliance in the one instance in the character of the Senate turns out to be a spurious counterfeit in the other. With microbic instinct they automatically eat one another. (b) and  (f)  have one point in common, and only one, in that they attempt to juxtapose the relationship of the two Houses from a slightly different angle, but, again, of course, to the disadvantage of the Senate. Fortunately, experience can throw some light on such glib complaints under these heads. Certain tests have been recorded that are useful. In 1914, when the two Houses were at loggerheads, not because the Senate was a " reflex " of the other Chamber, but a lion in its path, and in that of the Government of the day as well, the appeal to the electors unequivocally sustained" the Senate in its stand. The ballot-box confirmed it as the standard barometer of popular feeling - the " reflex " of the people's judgment, and nothing else, on that occasion of national trial. The nature of the issue has no bearing whatever on the charge levelled at the Senate nor the principle involved.  His  Honour the Chief Justice himself was the chief actor in the episode, and political fortune placed him on the losing side. After all, the Senate and its well-wishers would prefer to be what the electors declared it wason that occasion than certainly respond to the model of its pedantic and inharmoniousband of critics. In the recent elections those wayward " impulses " mentioned by  His  Honour, instead of getting encouragement by means of the newly-elected Senate, got through that Chamber particularly a repulse of first magnitude. Moreover, the party that believes in the use of those " impulses" believes also in the abolition of the Senate. </para>
                        <para>There is strong presumptive evidence that the reason why that party thinks we would be better off without the Senate is because they regard it as a " shock absorber " rather than a shock stimulator. Hence, it would seem that, if those " impulses " are to become a desirable and increasing feature of our national life, the first thing to be done is to put the Senate out of existence. Assuredly, when that is done,I am afraid there will be other work to do for the critics who now waste valuable time in picking out its fanciful failings. They will have more substantial worries on band. </para>
