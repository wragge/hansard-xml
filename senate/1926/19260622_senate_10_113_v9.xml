                        <para>.- Few questions have agitated the public mind so much as those dealt with in the bill now before the Senate. Proposals such as are contained in this bill have been before the people of Australia on other occasions. It would appear that the public mind is usually conservative. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">The party to which I belong has asked somewhat similar powers of the people, believing that this Parliament could not properly function and do the great service which the nation's Parliament should do for the people unless it were given more extensive powers than it at present possesses. On the proposals being submitted to them on two or three occasions, the people were stampeded into refusing to give this Parliament the powers asked for. Strange as it may seem, we now have what, from my point of view, is a conservative Government proposing to ask the people for the powers, or some of them, for which the Labour party first asked over sixteen years ago. Whilst the proposals contained in the bill are not so far-reaching as those which we considered necessary, they go quite a long way on the road to giving effect to the platform to which I am pledged as a member of the Labour party. The agitation in the minds of the people on this subject would appear to be due, more or less, to misunderstanding. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in his second-reading speech, in explaining to the Senate and the public the powers which would be wielded by the Parliament in the event of the Constitution alteration proposals being accepted, said that any authority that would bo appointed by this Parliament would be subject to any restrictions which might be imposed upon it by the Parliament. That is to say, this Parliament would bo in a position to circumscribe the activities of any authority created by it to regulate the industrial affairs of Australia. Although it could not directly declare that 48 hours should constitute a week's work, it could say to the authority, "You shall not go beyond a 44-hours' week in any award you make." The Attorney-General emphasized this in a later statement. As Minister controlling this legislation he should know the intention of the Government when the bill was drafted. At any rate, he said - </para>

                        <para>It would be possible for the Parliament to provide that no award, regulation or determination of an authority should prescribe more than a certain number of hours or legs than a certain number. That would be within the power of the Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking on that phase of the question for the moment. I am trying to remove from the public mind and from the minds of many Labour supporters the wrong impression that has been formed - that if this bill meets with the approval of the people, and an authority is appointed to regulate industrial affairs, it will be beyond the reach and control of this Parliament, and can do whatever it likes. My reading of the bill is that Parliament will have power to appoint an authority to regulate industrial affairs, and that the authority so appointed will not be beyond its reach. Parliament can clip the wings of an authority that does something which does not meet with its approval, and make it subservient to the will of the people. Therefore, it is not proposed to create something which will be superior to this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>Public opinion may simmer down presently, but at present it is very disturbed. Opposition to the proposed amendments has already been expressed, not only by half the Labour press and half the Labour leaders, but also by every Tory newspaper, and almost every Tory organization. In those circumstances, I. do not think the amendments will have  a million-to-one chance of being carried. But if the Government persist in submitting them to the people, I think the people should have a clear understanding of the questions on which they are asked to give a vote. For my own part, as I said the other day, I would clothe the Commonwealth Parliament with every power possible, because after each election it represents . the expressed opinion of the people of Australia. Every adult in the Commonwealth is entitled to go freely to the poll and exercise a vote; indeed, every citizen is compelled to realize his responsibility in this regard, being forced  under certain pains and penalties to record a vote. If any institution in Australia reflects the public will it is this Senate. When every person has the opportunity to express his political opinions by marking a ballot-paper, can there be any ground for complaint as to what is done by this Parliament? Therefore, as in the Commonwealth Parliament, all Australians can speak with an equal voice, I would clothe that body with every possible power. It is true that the representatives of the people in this chamber express divergent views on some of the matters which come up for consideration. As a life-long member of the Labour party, and an old trade unionist, I know something of the history of the trade union movement in Australia, and something of the means employed to relieve the workers of the disabilities they have suffered. The Labour party whole-heartedly advocated the adoption of compulsory arbitration. Throughout my life I have endeavoured to give people an opportunity to meet and discuss in a reasonable way those industrial problems which come before the country from time to time. When it comes to a real " show down " most men are amenable to reason. A shining proof of that is the success achieved by the Industrial Disputes Committee of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. That body has been in existence for about fifteen years. When trouble arises in any industry it is immediately reported to the Trades Hall Council, and the Disputes Committee gets busy. It asks the employers in the industry affected to meet if in conference and discuss the trouble with a view to arriving at a settlement so that work may continue. In the first year of its activities the committee settled 109 disputes out of 111 which occurred in Melbourne. That is a record which is not proclaimed in the press, or talked about where it should be made known. How can there be any truth in the assertion of those who do not know, that there is a desire on the part of industrialists to disturb the industries of Australia, when we go to so much trouble to appoint these committees, and place our ablest and wisest members on them to talk over matters with employers? Those employers will meet us in conference now, because they know that if they do not face a conference the law will compel them to face an industrial tribunal. It is no trouble now to get what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> calls a round-table conference; but it would not be obtainable were it not for the fact that behind the request for a conference is the compelling hand of the law. The employers know that, if they prove recalcitrant, they can be haled before the Arbitration Court, by whose awards they will be bound. My party is constantly striving to promote conciliatory methods; no sane unionist would advocate any other method of dealing with industrial disputes. What advantage do the unionists get from the holding up of, say, the coal-mines? Thousands of men who are not directly concerned in the dispute are thrown out of employment. If the men employed in the coal-mining, shipping, or transport services leave their work, nearly all other employments are affected. It is surely worth the while of this Parliament to evolve means by which such dislocations of industry can bo avoided. People must rid their minds of the idea that men go out on strike lightly - because they want a rest, or a few days' holiday, or for any other frivolous reason. They resort to the extreme measure of striking only when no other means of redress is open to them. That fact must be realized, so that laws for the proper regulation of industry may be put on the statute-book. </para>

                            <para>- The workers may make mistakes. I do not suggest that all their leaders are Solomons, but, broadly speaking, organized labour never resorts to extreme steps without warrant. I am not afraid of what the present Government may do if it is granted the increased powers that it seeks. If it abuses them, it can do so only until the next election, when the people will speak their mind very plainly. I do not fear the judgment of the Australian people. There is nothing the present Government would not do that it could do with impunity, but the great safeguard in a democracy is the power of the people at the ballot-box. That is the bulwark of our liberties. </para>

                            <para>- I regret that any Australian Parliament should have thought it necessary to punish any person by deportation.We should settle our troubles in our own country. If any man, no matter who he is or what his standing in the country, breaks the laws, he should be punished in Australia, and not passed on to some other country. Labour is able to do that in its own ranks. If members of Labour organizations get out of order, they can be brought to book, or pressure can be brought to bear upon them, to convince them that they are doing wrong. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> In the 40 years I have been in the Labour movement, I have been endeavouring to evolve an organization by which the will of the Labour movement might bo expressed through some recognized authority, so that when, in a crisis, it had delivered its dictum, every man in the Labour army would act like a well-disciplined soldier, fighting for the cause, regardless of whether he agreed or disagreed with the tactics -of the generals. I might differ from a policy laid down by the constituted authority, but I hold that if the Labour army is to achieve anything, if it is to make Australia fit for white men to live in, it must act unitedly, and individual opinions must be set aside. </para>

                            <para>- I am general secretary of the One Big Union, although when I attempted to register its constitution, I was opposed by 21 Labour organizations and eight employers' organizations, Since then nothing further has been done. The principle I am laying down is that, when the Labour party speaks authoritatively, I and every other unit in the organization must be loyal to its decisions, even at the sacrifice of his personal opinions. The movement is greater than the individual. It is not for me to pretend to be a Messiah, the one person qualified to direct the workers to salvation. As a Labour candidate I signed this pledge - </para>

                            <para>- -That is so; because one plank of the platform demands full legislative power for this Parliament. The Government does not propose to ask for anything like that power; but the proposed referendum will, if agreed to by the people, give to this Parliament greater power than it now possesses. I and other members of my party have fought two or three referendums to confer greater powers on this Parliament. We risked our political scalps in our effort to establish the authority of this Parliament to legislate on the lines of the Labour platform. The press, in declaring that I am supporting these referendums, is totally misrepresenting my position. I am doing nothing of the kind. I am supporting this measure, which seeks to give increased powers to the Commonwealth Parliament in relation to industry and commerce, and I will state my position on the second measure, dealing with essential services, when that bill comes before this chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I am always prepared to fight, if that be necessary. If, however, the progress of the Labour movement required that I should stand aside, what sort of a man would I be to object? I am but a unit in the party, and I recognize that the sacrifice of a unit is not a matter of consequence if it profits the movement. The Government is unwise in submitting these proposals now, because there is no chance of securing an affirmative vote. Probably, from £80,000 to £100,000 will be spent on the referendum, notwithstanding that ministers must know that the dice is loaded against them. These proposals ore strongly opposed by the great bulk of the Labour organizations, by the Labour press, and also by the tory press. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Robinson called a meeting of all the tories in Melbourne at Scott's Hotel last week. They have declared their determination to conduct a well-organized campaign in Victoria in opposition to an extension of these powers. Probably the movement will spread to the other States. Labour, also, is organizing to defeat the referendums. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot tell; but if the Government wishes to succeed it should submit the questions in the form adopted by a Labour government sixteen years ago. At that time about one-half of those honorable senators who are now supporting the Government were in the ranks of Labour, and supported them wholeheartedly. Indeed, they helped to draft the proposals. No one should be afraid to trust the democratic vote of the people. The electors are entitled to choose either a National Parliament or a Labour Parliament, and it should have sufficient power properly to govern Australia. If these questions are to be carried at the referendum they should be submitted in the form adopted by Labour. There will then be behind them the whole of the organized Labour movement, and we shall be able to clothe this Parliament with adequate power to legislate for the welfare of the Commonwealth. Much of the opposition to this proposed extension of power is due to the fact that some of the Upper Houses of State legislatures are not elected on a democratic vote. Do honorable senators realize that whilst I am one of the representatives of Victoria in the national Parliament, I am not qualified for a seat in the Legislative Council of that State? </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the property qualification for membership of the Victorian Legislative Council is the possession of £1,000 worth of freehold.I have not that amount of property, and, therefore, I am not qualified for membership of that exalted chamber. It appears, therefore, that Australia's destiny is really in the hands of people who are not elected by the democratic vote of the community. The States have sovereign rights within their own domain. This Parliament should at least have as much power. I said on Friday last that I would not hesitate to destroy the Constitution if necessary to obtain wider powers for this Parliament. It would then be able to enact whatever laws it considered necessary in the interests of the people, and I, in common with every one else, would be willing to live under its laws. They would be laws enacted by our fellow-citizens, who would have to appear before the electors within three years, and if they had acted contrary to the wishes of a majority they would have to answer for it to the people. The supreme power always rests with the people, and no one else. For the reasons I have outlined, I urge the Government to withdraw the bill at this stage, and to submit more comprehensive proposals which would be likely to receive the endorsement of a majority of the electors. There are some, of course, who rightly believe that under the present Government the Commonwealth is being mismanaged. The suggestion so frequently referred to that further consideration of these proposals should be delayed until a constitutional session of the Parliament is held is one which should receive the closest consideration of the Government. Legislation which is "broad based upon the people's will " must always command their respect and support, and in proposing such legislation we shall be acting in the interests of the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That may be the honorable member's view, but it is not mine. All questions such as these are decided ultimately by the personal opinions of the honorable senators who debate them, and in speaking now I am expressing merely my own  opinion. I would not try to state the views of other honorable senators, because, from what has already transpired, I imagine that it would take me hours to accomplish that task ; whereas  my intention is to speak for only a few minutes. It may be that the honorable senator was halfway through his argument before he discovered that there was a flaw in it. At any rate, he committed an error which has been committed at times by .honorable senators on both sides of the chamber; he divided the people of this country into two classes only - the employers and the employees. Like many others, he overlooked the great middle section of the public, whose vote must decide this and all other questions, and which is, I think, worthy of consideration. These electors have, at all events, an open mind on the questions it is proposed to refer to them, though they may not be greatly interested in them, and I hope that before the proposals are voted on there will be an opportunity to gain their interest in regard to them. I think, too, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> - I do not wish to criticize him too severely - is judging all the Labour organizations of the country by the great organization of which he is the distinguished head. I know it is the largest and best organization of its kind, at all events, in Australia; the honorable senator has told me so. Although this measure proposes an amendment of the powers of the Commonwealth in relation to commerce and industry, I look upon the industrial amendment as more important than that relating to commerce; and the first question <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> have now to consider is whether the industrial affairs of this country have been satisfactorily controlled hitherto. Looking at the matter dispassionately, and at the results achieved under the present system, I think the answer to the question is emphatically in the negative. But although the results have not been satisfactory, I do not, on that account, utterly condemn the system of arbitration. I condemn, not the system, but its application, and I feel sure that with the knowledge we have  gained  from the experience of other parts of the world, it is possible for this Parliament, having said that it will control the industrial affairs of the Commonwealth, to place on the statute-book legislation which will prevent the mistakes of the past, and will bring a happier future than is possible under our present legislation. In the first speech that I delivered in this chamber I deplored the fact that the application of Federal arbitration awards had been disastrous to Western Australia; first, because of the remoteness of the State from the Seat of Government, and, secondly, because of the conflict between the Federal and State jurisdictions. If the people of Australia assent to the proposals contained in the bill, the Federal </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament will be able - it will be obliged to do so when it has the power - to create such courts, or to continue such tribunals now in existence, as will enable the obstacle of remoteness to be overcome, and thus ensure the proper dispatch of hearings and the decision of cases. More important still, our legislation will, I feel sure, embody provisions enabling the Arbitration Court to enforce the decisions which lit gives. In the past trouble has arisen because effect could not be given to the decisions' of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and the judges themselves have complained of this weakness of the system. -We should see that in the future the arbitration judges, whoever they may be, shall not labour under that handicap. I understand that much exception is being taken by the two schools of thought that are represented in this chamber by Senators Barnes and Barwell to the proposals of .the- Government concerning trusts and combinations of employers, and the part which the Government will play in the control of their operations. It has always appeared to <inline font-style="italic">me</inline> that there is a good deal to be said in favour of the control of some of these trusts and combinations. We have not very far to look for evidence of the necessity for that control from the point of view of both the trusts and combinations themselves, and of the people of Australia generally. We might, as the right honorable gentleman who leads this Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> indicated, follow the example set by the governments of the various States, in connexion with the control and regulation of friendly societies, although some of the trade union organizations to which our legislation would apply do not altogether deserve the term " friendly." If this proposed control leads to the promulgation of a new law relating to companies, our time will have been well spent. I look forward with interest, and a greater degree of hope than that which was expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> to the forthcoming referendum. There is every reason for supporting the bill in its present form, and I intend to do so. The referendum should be taken without the modifications that have been either alluded to, or suggested by honorable senators on both sides. The future of Australia depends to a very great extent upon the fair, impartial, and reasonable administration of the industrial affairs of Australia. For that reason, and also because I am hopeful of the best results accruing to Australia, I have every pleasure in supporting the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no desire to give a silent vote upon such an important and far-reaching measure. I listened with a considerable degree of interest to the speech which was delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> on Friday, and again to-day. He is well worth listening to when he undertakes the task of advising the Senate as to what he considers the best course to adopt. On this bill he has raised two very important points. The most important argument which he advanced was that the Government would take over the control of cur industrial affairs to the extent of issuing directions to the authorities that are to be appointed as to the manner in which they should discharge their functions. That, to my mind, would be most undesirable. My understanding of the position is that it is intended to remove this matter altogether from the realm of party politics, so that it shall not be affected by the party struggles that frequently characterize the debates in the national Parliament. The Government will not be able to take any action for the appointment of authorities before bringing down legislation for the consideration of this Parliament, which, in its wisdom, will decide whether or not the authorities appointed under the act shall be allowed to carry 'on their work in the way that is desired by the majority of the people of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> also argued that this Parliament would not have sufficient power to take whatever action might be thought desirable. If the proposals which the bill contains were advanced separately, I feel sure that the whole of the labour organizations would support one portion, and the capitalistic organizations the other. Their inclusion in the one measure has led to the amalgamation of those forces. Our experience of industrial and commercial affairs, since the termination of the war, must have convinced every reasonable man that drastic alterations are necessary in connexion with industrial organizations and combinations of capital. I do not believe that this Parliament would outrage the feelings of the community in any legislation that it might pass. I am pleased at the absence of ill-feeling from this debate. It has been conducted in a most friendly manner, the views of  each side having been stated in the frankest spirit. That augurs well for the success of the campaign when these questions are submitted to the people. The proper angle from which to approach the question is, in what way will Australia be affected ? It is admitted, on every hand, that industrialism is not at present upon a satisfactory basis. Since the termination of the war, there has been so much interruption of industry as the result of strikes, that every reasonable citizen must agree that it is the duty of the Government to endeavour to improve the position without delay. We have very little knowledge of the combines that are operating in our midst, but it is the general belief that they are not working in the best interests of Australia. It would be an almost criminal act for a government to introduce legislation affecting labour organizations, if it did not concurrently introduce other legislation dealing with trusts and combines. I believe that if the people would adopt these proposals we should be able to do a great deal to improve our present unsatisfactory methods of dealing with industrial disputes. Notwithstanding the pessimistic views expressed by some honorable senators, it would be to the undoubted advantage of the community if this national Parliament had complete authority over matters affecting industry and commerce. I am quite prepared to admit that wages boards, round-table conferences, and other similar means of adjusting differences between employees and employers have been used with advantage to the general public, but I do not imagine, as opponents of these proposals have said, that their use will be dispensed with if the people sanction these constitutional alterations; for we have been told quite definitely that the Government intends to maintain them. The chief object in introducing this bill is to get power to prevent overlapping. At present some factories have to comply with the terms of anything from 20 to 50 different awards, and have to employ special highly-trained officers to keep track of all the determinations by industrial tribunals which might affect their business. That is making a comic opera of industrial arbitration. These proposals have been designed to remedy that, and to bring about a better understanding between employers and employees. Every one who is interested in the welfare of our great Commonwealth must regret that capital and labour are at present in antagonistic camps, and that instead of sympathy, there is a feeling akin to hatred between them. That must be altered before this country can prosper  in the highest sense; and I feel that any move this Parliament may make to alter it will be welcomed by the great" bulk of the people. It is unreasonable to expect workers to wait patiently for twelve months, or even two years, for a settlement of their claims, as they are obliged to do now in some cases. The long delays that occur have considerably increased the irritation of all parties concerned. Personally I have no doubt whatever that that state of affairs will be remedied speedily if the people approve of these proposals : and that henceforth industry and commerce will go hand in hand to the advantage of the Commonwealth. It has been urged that this is a clumsy and costly method of trying to bring a spirit of greater harmony into our industrial relations; but it has been shown quite definitely in the course of the debate that an amendment of the Constitution is necessary before we can do very much to improve the present position. This plan for amending the Constitution is provided in the Constitution itself, and Parliament has simply to take it and use it. In my. opinion we should make greater headway if those who spend their time complaining and fault-finding would, with a willing spirit, advocate these proposed amendments. It is not at all likely that this, or any other government, in this democratic community, would attempt, in the exercise of larger powers, to introduce legislation that would victimize a section of the community, for it would know very well that it would soon get its deserts. We should have a more reasonable and rational method of determining industrial disputes, and the adoption of these proposals will, in my opinion, give it to us. I regret that so much publicity is given overseas to the statement that Australia is the land of strikes, but such excellent speeches as that delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> will do a great deal to remove those unwarranted aspersions on our industrial community. Australia, of course, has her industrial troubles just as every other civilized country has; but they are fewer and of less magnitude here than in a good many other countries. Before people will come and settle here, we shall have to remove these unjust suspicions, which, it appears to me, are circulated by those who are opposed to our arbitration methods for the settlement of industrial disputes. Possibly the guilty persons are afraid that similar arbitration courts may be established in their country. It is wicked and cruel that in most countries only the arbitrament of hunger is used to settle industrial disputes. It is unthinkable that Australia should go back to that sorry condition. For 25 years we have been trying to build up an effective industrial arbitration system, and I believe the adoption of these proposals by the people would be a step in the direction of making our efforts something more than a .by- word. Notwithstanding the comparative failure of the system so far, I believe that no one in Australia would wish to go back to the methods that existed before its introduction. I am astonished at the opposition to this bill. One section of the community the ,11:E that it goes too far, and another that it does not go far enough. It is strange t.&gt; see a small section of the community - the wealthy men who will be affected by the commerce provisions of the bill - in league with extremists in the Labour movement. </para>

                            <para>- I think so, because of the noise they are making. As a rule, the smaller the numbers, the bigger the noise. When these opposing factions are found to be in agreement, one is justified in believing that reforms are sometimes opposed merely because they have been introduced by a certain political party. Unfortunately, that is often the case; but I hope that, in considering this bill,' and in dealing with the referendum proposals on the public platform, we shall forget our petty political differences and deal with the Government's proposals from the point of view of their effect upon Australia. If the electors will consider the future of their country, rather than a temporary gain to any political party, these proposals will be carried by a large majority. The bill has my wholehearted support. During the last election campaign, I found that feeling ran high, and that it was necessary for me to declare my attitude towards certain questions then agitating the public mind. I made my position abundantly clear. I told the people of South Australia that, if the existing laws were not broad enough to deal effectively with industrial matters, I was prepared to support the Government in any action it took to remedy that state of affairs. On each occasion my remarks were applauded by the majority of those present. I do not think that the people of Australia have altered their opinion since that time, and I, therefore, feel confident that these proposals will receive their support. I do not agree with those who say that this legislation has been brought before us with undue haste. The electors have known for many months that legislation of this nature has been contemplated. If consideration of this bill were postponed, or the referendum proposals were not submitted to the electors for another year, I do not see that any benefit would accrue. The electors of Australia are not so stupid as some would have us believe. Most of them are anxious that the country shall be free from a repetition of the industrial upheavals from which it has suffered during recent years. I shall have pleasure in supporting these referendum proposals before the people, and shall do my best to convince them of the desirability of an alteration of the Constitution in order to deal with industrial disputes and those combines and organizations which, unquestionably, operate to the detriment of the people. No section of the community which is not acting detrimentally to the interests of the people as a whole, or disobeying the country's laws, need fear this legislation. I stand always for the supremacy of the country's laws, and, therefore, I shall support this bill. </para>

                        <para>. - The discussion on' this bill h-is thrown a good deal of light upon what is, probably, the most important subject with which this Parliament could deal. At the outset, I wish to make it clear that I am in favour of arbitration as a commonsense way of settling industrial disputes, and I believe that the  majority  of the people of this country are of the same opinion. Some honorable senators appear to have erroneous ideas regarding the manner in which trade union business is conducted. It is my privilege to be closely acquainted with the workings of various trade unions, and I have no fault to find with the way in which their affairs are conducted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> when introducing this hill, drew an analogy between friendly societies and trad. unions. In that both exist for the mutual  benefit and protection of their member*, he was right. The Minister said, also, that it was desired that the books of trad.3 unions should be inspected by qualified auditors, in the same way that the books of friendly societies are audited. To that trade unionists, in the main, have no objection, so long as the persons appointed to do the work are fully qualified. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> told the Senate that the books of each branch of the Australian Workers Union must, under the rules of that organization, be audited at certain intervals by at least one certified auditor. Trade unionists are endowed with an ordinary amount of common sense, and are anxious to conserve their own property. Having a voice in the distribution of their union funds, they can be relied upon to see that those funds are not misused. Cases of misappropriation have occurred at times; but even in the best-regulated banks, where auditors are almost constantly employed, funds are sometimes improperly used. Reference was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to the memorable award by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in the Harvester case, which has been accepted as the basis of the living wage. I suggest that altered conditions have arisen since the time when that judgment was delivered, and that the standard of living should, if possible, be raised. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins was faced with a very difficult task in having to determine what was a living wage; he was practically a legislator in industrial; matters, upon which his book, <inline font-style="italic">A New Province for Law end Order,</inline> contains much valuable information. Let me direct the attention of honorable senators to the following passage from that work: - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The new province is that of the relations  between employers and employees. Is it possible for a civilized community so to regulate these relations as to make the bounds of the industrial chaos narrower, to add new territory to the domain of order and law? The war between the profit-maker and the wage earner is always with us; and, although not so dramatic or catastrophic as the present war in Europe, it probably produces in the long run as much loss and suffering, not only to the actual combatants, but also to the public. </para>

                            <para>- Although the work was done by a contractor, the men were employed under the day-labour system. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would like us to return to the days when jails were built by prison labour, for which no payment was made. He also referred to the State agricultural implement works in Western Australia, which, I have been informed, have resulted in great benefit, particularly to the farming community of that State. The institution pays its way, and has had the effect of keeping the price of agricultural machinery at a fair level. I was sorry to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell's</inline> virulent attack upon the industrial system of this country, and upon the workers generally, because such statements, if broadcast, will do incalculable harm. He said that Australia was the home of strikes; but, as a matter of fact, fewer strikes occur here than the majority of people imagine. In South Australia, for instance, the total loss in wages on account of industrial disturbances in the year 1920 amounted to £140,326; in 1921, to £37,315; in 1922, to £43,222; in 1923, to £20,440; in 1924 to £14,851 ; and in 1925 to £12,240. Since the total loss decreased from £140,326 in 1920 to £12,240 in 1925, I hardly see the justification for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell's</inline> extraordinary allegation. He said that he believed in the Canadian system of settling industrial disputes. There a reference board is appointed, consisting of three members. One is nominated by the employees, and one by the employers, and, if the two sides cannot agree as to the third member, he is appointed by the Minister for Labour. I remind honorable senators, however, that strikes' take place even in Canada. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> suggested that arbitration was the cause of strikes in Australia ; but I intend to show that they occur in countries that have no arbitration system.

                        <para>The strike committee put an end to street car transportation, shut off the telephone communication, interfered with the city's water supply, called out the firemen from their posts, and left the city without tire protection . until the strikers' places had been filled by volunteers. When the members of the police force, renouncing their sworn allegiance, had voted, to join the strikers, the strike committee issued an edict that "ordered" them back to duty. The delivery of milk, bread, and ice was forbidden. Restaurants and eating . places were closed, save those favoured with " permit cards." In the city delivery and transmission of His Majesty's mails were, for a time, completely stopped. The newspapers were suspended, and telegraphic communication with the outside world was forbidden. The special police. force, organized to take the place of the ordinary . police force when its members were finally dismissed for disobedience to their lawful superiors, was mobbed, and driven from the streets, and the city left practically without police protection. One member of the special police, who had- been awarded the Victoria Cross for gallant conduct in the war, was seriously injured and had a narrow escape with his life*. In the rioting that occurred subsequently, there were numerous casualties, and members of the Royal North-west Mounted Police were assailed with missiles of all kinds, shot at from the street and roofs of buildings, and several of them wounded. Workers in the hospitals were called from their tasks, and the management of the Winnipeg General Hospital was forced, in the interests of its sick and dying patients, to obtain . permission from't'-fl strike committee to keep its employees at their posts. A widespread system of espionage, intimidation, and terrorism was organized and executed with relentless vigilance and activity. All these events and many more arc a matter of history and of evidence. </para>

                    <para>Australia is not the only country that has strikes. I have not read of any strike in this country approaching that referred to by the two learned judges I have quoted, and that disturbance, be it remembered, occurred in a country whose industrial legislation <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> advises us to copy. Our industrial legislation is not perfect, and I doubt whether we shall ever devise a perfect arbitration system; but our industrial courts, on the whole, have done, and are doing, good work in the interests of the trade unionists and the people generally of this country. At least. 95 per cent, of the trade unionists are willing to submit their grievances to a court, and to abide by its decision. The strike of shearers a few years ago has been mentioned. Evidence was given in the Arbitration Court,, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers fixed 30s. as the rate for shearing 100 sheep. Further evidence was brought before him, and the following week he altered the rate to 35s. It was contended, by the advocates of the union that on the evidence adduced the rate should have been higher than 35s., but if that rate had been awarded , in the first place, there would probably have been no strike. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers admitted that his calculations were wrong, and the necessity for altering the award caused the shearers to distrust the court. After taking evidence in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> McCawlev said that he could not . award less than. <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per 100, and, as a result, the rate was £2 per 100 in Queensland, while it was 35s. per 100 in the other States. All except two of the pastoralists in South Australia who. had their sheep shorn that year paid £2 per- 100. </para>

                            <para>-I do not think the honorable senator can describe their action as breaking away from their union. What we stand for in Australia is not a maximum but a minimum wage. If the honorable senator had a man working in his garden and the basic wage for gardeners was 14s. 6d. per day, I do not think he would consider that he was black-legging upon any one if he gave his gardener 15s. 6d. or 16s. per day. The increase beyond the basic wage would merely indicate a generous nature. We hear a great deal of talk about the need for bringing capital and labour together, and a little generosity of that kind would be likely to break down many barriers between them. South Australia sets many good examples, and the pastoralists of that State set a good example to pastoralists in other States in doing the right thing on the occasion I have referred to, and' getting their sheep shorn. I may mention the fact that there have been strikes in America. I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Monthly Labour ' Review</inline> of the Department of Labour, United States of ' America, of which James J. Davies is secretary.

                    <para>According to information received by the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics, 274 labour disputes, resulting in strikes or lock-outs, occurred in this country during the first quarter of 1925. Since, in some instances, the reports do not reach the Bureau until some time alter the stoppages occur, the number of strikes occurring during the quarter was perhaps a little larger than the above figure. Complete data relative to many of these strikes have not been received by the Bureau, and it has not been possible to verify all that have been received. The figures in the following tables should therefore be regarded as preliminary, and should not be accepted as final: - </para>

                            <para>- The Federal court has been hampered to a great extent, because there has not been a sufficient number of judges to carry out its work. Trade unions have had at times to wait an inordinate length of time to have their cases heard. That is one of our difficulties, and, in common with other honorable senators, I am anxious that something should be done to overcome that difficulty by making the court more accessible. Very often when trade union organizations have been unable to get their cases heard by the Federal court they have gone to a State court. We have a State arbitration court in South Australia, and before any dispute is taken into the court the judge calls the parties together in conference. The other day I was looking through the figures showing the number of cases that were settled in South Australia without the parties going into court. In that State, if the judge can induce the parties to settle their differences without going into court, he does so. If he finds that they are not in a mood to settle their differences he orders them into court, where he arbitrates, and they are then bound by his award. I do not know of any case in South Australia where an award of the court has been flouted. I think that on all occasions the employees have obeyed the awards of the court. </para>

                            <para>- There are some people who, whenever an industrial disturbance is mentioned, conjure up a picture of employees on strike. They never think that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has reminded us, sometimes employees may be locked out. No sane man likes to see industrial trouble, and we need machinery to deal with industrial disputes. It is an axiom that there are three parties to all industrial disputes - the employer, the employee, and the community. Each party has its rights. One has no more right than another to inflict injury on the others. It should be the function of arbitration authorities to get the parties together, and we should make provision for the awards of an Arbitration Court to be binding on both employer and employee. I believe in arbitration. I consider it the nearest approach to the perfect method of settling industrial disputes. I know of a case that occurred in South Australia where men were working in a certain factory under an award. The manager of the factory hired some nonunion employees, who agreed to do piecework. Piece-work rates were set, and for the first two or three weeks the fast man was earning up to £8 per week, and the slow man about £5 per week. When this had been in operation for a few weeks the piece-work rates were recast so that the fast man could not possibly earn more than £5 per week, and the earnings of the comparatively slow worker were brought down to about £3 per week. There was no arbitrator called in in that case. The men had to work under piece-work rate's set, not by arbitration, but by the firm for whom they worked. It is true that piece-work rates apply in the shearing industry, but those rates are fixed, not by the employers, but by the Arbitration Court, and the men are satisfied with them. In a strong virile community there are always bound to be little disputes, but so long as there is some means of settling them these differences of opinion do no harm to the body politic. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> that Australia has a bad name overseas. Quite recently I had the pleasure of meeting a number of wool-buyers from various countries - Japan, Germany, Prance, and Great Britain - and they all assured me that there was nothing in Australia to which they could take serious exception. They were all keen, observant business men, and they were most complimentary about the progress that Australia's primary and secondary industries were making. In fact, one gentleman, who has two establishments in Yorkshire, giving employment to a large number of hands, who is starting a business in Australia, told me that after he had settled his affairs in the Old Country he would bring his wife and six children to settle in Australia, which he regarded as the best country in the world. Those who declare that Australia has a bad name overseas are not a good advertisement for this young country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> has told us that he replied for a couple of hours to questions put to him at a dinner in London. It is regrettable that when gentlemen holding responsible positions in Australia go overseas they are not accompanied by men 'of different political views. The honorable senator has also told us that money is going in streams to other countries, and that people are not anxious to invest in Australia. If that be so, it is strange that Australia's credit on the London money market is good, and that the British investors will lend us whatever money we require. </para>

Statements like those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> are not calculated to do any good to Australia. We never hear an American decrying his own country. He always says that America is the finest place on the face of the earth. In Australia any man with grit can make good. Thousands of young Australians are making good, and there is room for others to come here and do so. They are welcome to come, so long as provision is made for them beforehand - because we do not want to create an army of unemployed. I believe in a system of scientific immigration.

                    <para class="block">Europeans or semi-coloured people.  Australia  is a country worthy of the attention of those of our own race, and they are worthy of the attractions that Australia offers to them. With others, I urge the Government to postpone the submission of these questions to the people. I think that Ministers are wasting a lot of energy and a good deal of money in holding the referendum at the present juncture. The industrial organizations of the country are solidly against the proposed amendments. Almost every Labour organization is fighting them tooth and nail. Last week we read a manifesto in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Turvey,</inline> the general  president  of the Waterside Workers Federation, vigorously denounced the proposals. In every port of Australia the members of his organization are fighting them. We have also read the declaration of the secretary of the Australian Workers Union against them. Various trades and labour councils have carried resolutions in opposition to them". The Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales is standing by the Premier of the State against them. The great State of New South Wales, with its population of about 2,300,000, will be a big factor in deciding the issue. The Queensland Government has also declared against the proposals. The press of Australia is solidly in opposition to them. We have only a few weeks in which to convert all these people. One man said to me the other day, " I bet you thirteen Stetson hats to one that the referendum will not be carried." If there is any possibility of the proposals being defeated I think it would be better to postpone, the referendum for, say, six months, until an atmosphere more favorable to them can be created. If the Prime Minister thinks that, by a hurried campaign of five or six weeks, he will sweep the people off their feet, he is making a huge mistake. </para>

                            <para>- There is not. With the support of the press, five or six weeks might be sufficient; but without that support the only chance of educating the electors is by pamphlets, speeches, or advertisements in the newspapers - a very costly method. The Government would be wise to withdraw the proposals for the present. I believe they will be carried later on. I believe in giving the Commonwealth Parliament absolute power. The time is overripe for conferring greater power on this Parliament, and I am sorry to- note the -parochial Staterights spirit which still exists. Too many people are without the Australian outlook. They are little State-righters, who cannot see beyond their own State boundaries. The Commonwealth Parliament is the big national Parliament of Australia, and, as a member of that Parliament, I believe in looking at matters from an Australian view-point. I am as interested in doing something to promote the welfare of North Queensland as I am in assisting the development of the southeastern portion of South Australia. It is the duty of a member of this Parliament to do all he can for the benefit of the whole of his country. I hope that the Government will reconsider its decision to hold the referendum at an early date. I think it should be postponed for a time. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. We know that the Waterside Workers Federation has declared against the proposals. If during the next six months delegates in favour of the amendments could get into the union rooms and and convert the vote of that organization from a negative to an affirmative one, it would make a difference of thousands of votes. There are many men in the Labour movement who say that the Government proposals are not understood by the people. A postponement of the referendum would give them an opportunity to explain to the members of the various organizations what the proposals actually mean. I hope that honorable senators when quoting figures relating to industrial matters will not ignore the decreased purchasing power of the sovereign. What could be purchased for 21s. 5d. in 1911 cannot be bought for less than 34s. 9d. to-day; a loss of £1,000,000 worth of wages through strikes in 1911 was more serious than a loss of £1,250,000 in 1925,  becaues  the effective value of the sovereign has been reduced by the increase in the cost of living. </para>

                        <para>.- Since the Commonwealth was established the Australian nation has expanded and advanced in many ways, and most people to-day recognize that the powers . that were sufficient for this Parliament in its infancy are inadequate to-day. When the Constitution was framed few people could foresee that so early in its history the Australian nation would assert its manhood and become a recognized power among civilized' peoples. Inevitably the outlook of the framers of the Constitution was more or less affected by parochial considerations; if the same men were to-day framing an instrument for the government of the Australian nation, they would take a much broader view and endow the National Parliament with greater powers. Nevertheless, we must be grateful to them for having laid the foundation of the Commonwealth so well. The Federal Constitution will always be a monument to the draftsmanship and knowledge of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffiths. I remember in pre-federation days listening to the eloquent addresses of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Deakin and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> in advocacy of Australian union. Many times I saw the Federal flag unfurled, and the people inspired to enthusiasm by the  slogan of " One flag and one destiny." In those days the general impression was that in due course the State Parliaments would be abolished, and the expense of government would be reduced. But the reverse of that has happened; the powers of the State Parliaments have tended to increase, whilst those of the National. Parliament, instead of expanding commensurately with the growth of the nation, have contracted under various judicial interpretations, until to-day it is seriously shackled by the limitations imposed by the Constitution. During the last election, when I was appealing for the support of the electors, I could not help feeling that I was associated with some small parochial body which was more or less powerless to deal with the urgent problems that confront Australia. Many times on the platform, I explained the constitutional limitations of the powers of this Parliament in regard to such vital matters as food supplies and transport, and I believe that many thousands of people learned a valuable lesson from the crisis which precipitated the election. Great changes have occurred, both inside and outside this Parliament ; . the present Government was returned to office with an overwhelming majority because of the experiences of the community during the paralysis of commerce and industry by the British seamen's strike. They now recognize that if the. Commonwealth Parliament continues impotent in time of emergency, the development of Australia will be seriously hampered. This Parliament, does not desire increased power for its own ends; it looks to the future development of the country, and asks that it be given certain authority to exercise in the interests of the nation. There is a lot of popular, but foolish, opinion about the virtue of the referendum. In my youthful days, I believed in the referendum as an instrument of democratic government, but I do not now, and no sane politician in Australia or elsewhere who has had experience of the operation of that principle fails to recognize the folly of asking people to pass judgment upon issues about which they are not fully informed. It is easy to talk of democracy and of "government of the' people by the people for the people." Those are empty phrases. The people are absorbed in their own affairs and the problems of their every-day life, and they have not the time to devote to the study of politics. </para>

                    <para class="block">Country and Nationalist parties subscribe to the same policy. The Nationalist and Labour parties place their policies before the country, and the people choose the programme that suits them and elect representatives to give effect to it. When the people have thus delegated their authority to Parliament, it should be able to make whatever laws are necessary without referring them back to the people. Of course, nobody who has enjoyed power for any time likes to surrender it. But past referendums showed that the people did not understand the questions upon which they were voting. Unfortunately, the Labour party made a fad of the referendum, but I believe that if the people were consulted to-day they would say, "Do the job for which you were elected and leave us alone." The Mother of Parliaments has never operated the referendum, and it is untrammelled by a written Constitution. It has full authority to do what is necessary in the interests of the nation; the people trust it, and no party dare abuse that trust, for fear of the consequences. There is no judiciary to declare what are and what are not the powers of the British Parliament; the English judiciary is limited to its proper function of interpreting and enforcing the laws which Parliament makes. The referendum has been in operation in Switzerland for many years, but the leading statesmen of that country declare that it has been an impediment to development. I trust that when the proposed constitutional session is held, an endeavour will be made to remove the limitations upon the power of this Parliament.I believe in an unfettered legislature. We live in a democratic age, and the only way that a democracy can learn is by the mistakes its representatives in Parliament make. Every three years the people have the power of remedying the mistakes or punishing those who were culpable. I am convinced that if, as a result of the constitutional session, the referendum procedure is abandoned and this Parliament is freed of the shackles imposed by the High Court's powers to interpret the Constitution, Australia will advance very much more rapidly than it is doing at the present time. If the Commonwealth Parliament had enjoyed unlimited powers in the past, many strikes and much litigation and turmoil would have been avoided. A free parliament, elected on the widest franchise possible, should be trusted to do the will of the people. There should be nothing to fear in an educated democracy like that of Australia. I disagree entirely with the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> last week, concerning industrial unrest in Australia. We all admit that mistakes are made on both sides. Necessarily, in its demand for improved standards of living and working conditions, organized labour comes into conflict with employers; but I refuse to believe that Australia is the country pictured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell. Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> in his . speech on Friday, quoted figures to show that the productivity of industry kept pace with the increase in wages in Australia. The honorable senator's thoughtful and timely contribution to this debate was a thorough vindication of the Australian workman. I appeal to him to put his shoulder a little more under the wheel, and to further increase production. Australia will then be even more desirable as a place to live in. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. An increase in production will mean an increase in wages, and a general all-round improvement. We have heard a good deal, during this debate, about strikes in Australia, and the alleged failure of our system of industrial arbitration. Much of our trouble is due to the action of two unions. I have no desire to import bitterness into this debate, by saying anything particularly hard about the Seamen's Union, but during the war that organization made repeated demands upon the ship-owners, who, knowing that they could pass on the demands by increasing freights and fares, always capitulated'. Finally, when the position became almost intolerable, the Government made an attempt to deport Walsh and Johannsen, the two officials responsible for the policy of the Seamen's Union. The extraordinary prices received by wool-growers for their products after the war also led to repeated demands for higher rates on behalf of shearers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh</inline> this afternoon told us that the pastoralists in South Australia agreed to pay the rates fixed by the McCawley award in Queensland. They were practically forced to do that.  If the ship-owners and pastoralists had withstood the demands made on them, there would not have been so much unrest in other industries, and, consequently, our system of arbitration would probably have functioned more satisfactorily. No one can deny that it- has failed to do all that was expected of it ; but the principal trouble has been with the transport unions, which have been spoon-fed to such an extent that the burden of increased rates Has become too heavy for the people to bear. On the whole, arbitration has been of immense benefit to the Commonwealth, though mistakes have been made by both employers and employees. Prior to the introduction of this system, there was no uniformity about the hours of labour, and there was bewildering discrepancy in the wages paid in kindred industries in the various States. With arbitration, we saw an attempt made to even up hours of labour, wages, and working conditions throughout the Commonwealth. Let me quote an extract from the views expressed- by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>  Powers on this subject - </para>

                        <para>The disputes settled at first were few (two in the first year), but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Connor laid down the principle that the wages to be paid must be "fair" wages; but, although he referred to a " living wage " in 1906, he did not state what would constitute, in his opinion, a "living wage." It was in October, 1!)07, in an application under the Excise and Tariff Act, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins fixed 7s. a day as the rate to be paid for an unskilled labourer to enable him to support himself and his "wife and three children. In the judgment then given - known as the Harvester judgment - he said : "I cannot think of any other standard appropriate as a fair wage than the normal needs of the average employee regarded as a human being living in a civilized community. The wages for an unskilled labourer should be sufficient to provide rent, food, and clothing, and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards." Other words have been used from time to time to describe the living wage, but the principle laid down in 1007 has never been departed from by the former  President  or by any member of this Court. </para>

                        <para>It was not till September, 1913, that any application waa made to this Court by any employer or body of employers. In these later days employers, generally speaking, have abandoned the old opposition to the Court and applications for prohibition orders, and it is quite common now to deal with applications by employers as well as applications by unions. There are at present fourteen organizations of employers registered under the Act, with a membership of 7,721 persons, firms, and corporations. In 1906 only two applications were filed in the Court; in 19 1U, eight applications; in 1914 and 1915, 114 applications; in 1920 and 1921, 261 applications; and in 1924 and 1925, 460 applications. </para>

                    <para class="block">Every fair-minded employer believes in the arbitration system, because it places him in a better position to meet his rivals in business. Prior to its introduction, unscrupulous employers, by sweating employees, were able to undercut the decent employers. The figures I have just quoted show that last year there were 460 applications before the Arbitration Court. How many strikes occurred during the same period? Apart from industrial disturbances entirely associated with the transport unions, there was scarcely one strike worth mentioning, so it is idle to say that the Arbitration Court is not performing a useful service. As the awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court were in general favour, many unions federated to enable their members who were engaged in similar industries in different States to approach that tribunal. This was, to a large extent, responsible for the work of the court becoming somewhat congested. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court has done more to strengthen trade unionism in Australia than union organizers or agitators have ever done, and that court is likely to remain an important factor in our industrial system, notwithstanding the suggestions of those die-hards who say that it should be  dispensed with. As there has been a good deal of adverse comment concerning the court and its work, I quote further the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers. He said - </para>

                        <para>I notice that the press - not knowing what the powers of the court really are - are again saying the court has failed. One would think that the losses and inconvenience to everybody caused by two unions adopting <inline font-style="italic">direct</inline><inline font-style="italic">action</inline> lately, instead of arbitration, ought to prove what a great success it has been to prevent loss and inconvenience by those unions and a hundred other unions for the past few years. It is a proof that arbitration is a success, and direct action the failure it always proves to be to the public particularly. </para>
                        <para>Arbitrators do not, as a rule, enforce awards - other courts have to do so - and they are authorized in Australia to enforce them. All this court is empowered to do is to make laws us a legislative body, in settlement of disputes, instead of Parliament doing so, and it is as absurd to say that Parliament is a failure and should be abolished because there are men who break every law it makes as to say the court should be abolished because the laws it makes are not observed by one or two unions for a time, and no effort is made to enforce them in the proper courts. The court is a legislative body, and must rely, as Parliament does, on the courts appointed by Parliament to enforce the laws it makes. The laws are as enforceable as if made by Parliament. If the court is given, in addition, judicial powers, it could only enforce them on applications by the parties, injured by any unlawful act, and the respondents refuse to apply to the courts appointed to enforce the laws made by this court. The court has not failed to carry out the duties imposed upon it by Parliament, and it will. not do so; but it must rely on the parties, and the Government, applying to the courts to enforce the laws it makes if they are not observed. </para>

                        <para>I have been asked why the court does not prevent strikes, as i1 was established principally for that purpose. The answer to that is that it does, by conciliation and by just awards, prevent all strikes where it has jurisdiction to make awards, except strikes and job control by one union out of the 146 registered unions, and that union has been de-registered and deprived of the benefits of any award. This Federal court can only deal with what are called interstate industrial disputes - that is industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of one State nf the Commonwealth. In the last twelve years there have not been six interstate disputes with which this court had jurisdiction to deal which have resulted in a strike (apart from those by the members of the de-registered Seamen's Union) and the disputes referred to have been settled by awards of this court. </para>

                        <para>I have been asked, why are the workers not compelled to keep their awards? The answer to that is that they do keep them, generally speaking, without compulsion, with the exception of one union referred to now deregistered, for not keeping its undertakings to the court and not obeying the orders of the court. </para>
                        <para>There are about 328.500 workers working directly under the court's awards and although the ordinary courts of justice have, and always had, the power to punish for breaches of the act or awards, and to enforce, observance of awards, it appears that there has not been any necessity to use such powers. I do not know of any prosecution of members of any union for any breaches of awards made by the court during the last five years. This court exercised judicial power for some years, but was rarely called upon to exercise it to punish unionists, or to enforce awards. </para>

                    <para class="block">That, 1 contend, is a splendid record for a court which has to settle industrial problems of great consequence to Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stewart,</inline> the Registrar of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, who ' has accomplished a good deal in the settlement of industrial disputes before they have been referred into court, has the confidence of the industrial organizations and also of the employers. Instead of having been a drag upon industry, the court has done a great - deal to assist it. If the proposed alteration of the Constitution is approved by the people, overlapping should be avoided in future. Organized labour a few years ago enthusiastically supported proposals almost identical with these, but now it is found in opposition to them for the reason that the unions realize that greater advantages can be derived from State tribunals. Queensland, on the last occasion, gave a majority vote in the affirmative, but in that State there is now a tribunal composed of partisans, who are willing to concede to the workers more than they can hope to obtain from the Commonwealth court. The unions will not be induced to vote for these alterations until they have been made to realize that their best interests are conserved by the central court. Australia occupies a much better position in regard to industrial matters than that in which some other countries are placed, and the Arbitration Court must be given the principal credit for the harmonious relations which exist. A few unions that for too long a time were spoon-fed, have been causing practically the whole of the trouble in recent years. England is regarded as the home of law and order, yet a general strike there was. precipitated because of the action of the coalminers. The general strike has collapsed, but the coal-miners will probably remain out until starvation brings them te their knees. We have not yet passed the barbarous stage of starving people into submission, despite our boast that we are an educated democracy. A little over twelve months ago the Imperial Parliament voted £20,000.000 to avert a general  strike, but even that vast- expenditure could not preserve industrial peace for more than a few months. Coalmining is a key industry, and if the workers remain out sufficiently long they can strangle any other industry that is dependent upon coal. Twenty years ago, in England, instead of being subsidized, the workers would have been shot down and their leaders put into jail for striking, but to-day those leaders are invited to a conference at Downing-street. England is the home of liberty, and its people are long-suffering and patient. In spite of its weaknesses and faults, arbitration in Australia has been a blessing, not alone to the employers and employees, but  also  to the whole of the people. One of the most important features of the bill is the provision under which the Attorney-General will have the power to intervene on behalf of any organization, whether directly concerned in an industrial dispute or not. In every upheaval hitherto the employers and employees have considered only their own interests, and the public, which has been the chief sufferer, has had no say. </para>

                            <para>- When the electors give the Government the power to amend the Constitution, a judicial body will be appointed to deal with all industrial matters. The Attorney- General will be able to conserve the interests of the general public by intervening in any dispute that may arise. During the war the demands of the seamen were never resisted by the ship-owners. I remember when the men were receiving only £7 a month, yet they considered that they were well paid. Today they are being paid from £16 to £1S a month, but they are more dissatisfied than they were formerly. Business people particularly have suffered because of the higher freights and fares that have been charged. Previously the shipping companies could pass on to the general public any increase that was granted to the men, but they have now reached the stage when that is no longer possible. There ought to have been some means of stopping that practice before the position ' became acute. Although I believe generally in Parliament having supreme power, in this instance I consider that it is wise to delegate power to  a judicial body, because Parliament cannot pass a law making universal a certain wage or a standard number of working hours. Each industry must have its conditions investigated, to ascertain its particular requirements, and that so far the Arbitration Court has endeavoured to do. I am strongly in favour of the proposed alterations to the Constitution, and I shall do my best to convince the people that they are necessary for the future development of Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- So far as the debate has proceeded, every honorable senator has approached this subject with a desire to find a solution of the existing industrial problem. The framers of the Constitution must have had in mind only national industries such as coal-mining and possibly shipping when they decided upon the powers that should be granted to the Commonwealth Parliament. I cannot imagine that anybody contemplated the exploring of every avenue of trade and commerce by die Commonwealth authority. The functions of the Federal and State tribunals ought to have been clearly defined years ago. That opportunity has now disappeared, and we must deal with the position as we find it, admitting that the existing state of affairs is intolerable to every one who is engaged in industry. Industrial organizations federated so that they might approach the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, the obvious reason being that the awards of that court heretofore set a higher standard than that which was set by many State tribunals. I have to consider the position as it is. I find State tribunals set up in every State, and in some States more than one system in vogue for dealing with industrial problems; and I also find the Commonwealth Arbitration Court operating. It is necessary for us to co-ordinate these authorities. We need not, at the moment, discuss the exact nature of our coordinating authority, for the intention of this bill is simply to equip Parliament with the power to set up an authority. </para>

                            <para>- I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman's</inline> views. Industrial conditions in Australia are undoubtedly incomparably better than those that prevail in other parts of the world. We have an ideal climate, and working conditions are governed by factories acts in all the States. In the circumstances, it would be surprising if more industrial dislocation occurs here than in other parts of the world. On that point I should like to say, in passing, that although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> complained in his speech about the sentiments expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> he himself has, at times in this chamber, condemned in the strongest terms the conduct of certain industrialists here. But whatever mav be said about the relations between employers and employees, it will be generally agreed that the present position could be substantially improved. We have frequent interruptions of trade and commerce. I do not for a moment suggest that compulsory arbitration has been an absolute failure, nor do I agree that it is still an experiment, for it ha; long passed that stage. I sn,'1:10 not like to suggest, either, that the whole system should be scrapped, for no matter what may be said of the success of the m el hods adopted in other parts of t he world for the settlement of industrial disputes, our people have accepted compulsory arbitration. In these circumstances, it seems to me that we should do our best to improve and make more effective the system that we have. It has been argued that these proposals have been introduced, and are being pushed forward, with too much haste. I disagree with that. This is not a new subject-. It has been prominently before the people for years. The Prime Minister, in addresses that he delivered in Tasmania during the election campaign - and I have no doubt he expressed the same views in the other States - made it quite  clear  that if the Government were returned it would take action to give the unionists proper control of their organizations, and to provide for the more effective control of industrial affairs generally. He also said that if it were not possible for the Government to give effect to its desires in that direction on account of constitutional limitations, he would not hesitate to ask the people for additional powers. It is highly necessary that additional powers should be given to the Government to deal with industrial matters, not only to settle disputes, but also to prevent their occurring, and to bring about more confidence between employer and employee. I support the bill because I  believe  that it may lead to the achievement of those desirable ends and also to the co-ordination of the various industrial tribunals that are now operating. </para>

If we accept the honorable senator's statement we must admit that he built up a logical case in opposition to industrial legislation. But a very little examination will show that his statement is absolutely incorrect. In justice to Australia that fact should be placed on record. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> and others have effectively answered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell's</inline> statement that arbitration had caused strikes, that there were more strikes in Australia than in other countries.

                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Australia; and he endeavoured to prove his case by stating that sweating had ceased to exist in other countries where the economic conditions were similar to those in Australia. The honorable senator's statements - that arbitration has caused strikes ; that there are more strikes in Australia under arbitration than in other countries which have no arbitration legislation ; that arbitration has not abolished sweating; that wages in other countries where there is no industrial legislation have been raised to high levels and working conditions bettered - constitute a challenge which must be accepted by those who disagree with him. Let us deal, first, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell's</inline> contention that arbitration did not abolish sweating in Australia. Honorable senators know that at one time sweating did exist in Australia, particularly in the clothing industry. The clothing industry is one which in many countries has been associated with sweating. </para>

                            <para>- No one denies that, about  25  years ago, there was sweating in the clothing industry in Australia. From  1896  onwards attempts were made to deal with this evil; in Victoria by the introduction of the wages board system, and in the other States by arbitration and factories legislation. That sweating does not now exist in any industry in Australia, the people believe to be due to those laws. Sweating has been effectively wiped out in Australia; let us see whether it has disappeared in other countries. As the greatest industrial country in the world to-day is the United. States of America, I have taken the trouble to look up the records of that country in relation to sweating.I have here an extract from an article entitled, "American Children in Bondage," by Benjamin P. Chass, a writer on political, social, and economic questions, in the <inline font-style="italic">Current History Magazine.</inline> To show that his figures are not fanciful, he quotes from the United States of America Census Report of  1920 -  the latest available. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chass</inline> said that in  1920  there were  1,060,858  children of from ten to fifteen years gainfully employed in the United States of America, that figure representing  8.5  per cent, of the total  number of children between those ages.. In 1910 the number was 1,990,225. The decrease was due to a large number of the States, as well as the Congress of the United States of America, having legislated against child labour, although some of the legislation passed was afterwards declared by the High Court of the United States of America to be unconstitutional. The report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chass</inline> went on to say that it was obvious that the figures compiled by the Census Bureau of 1920 were incomplete, and insufficient for a study of child labour in general. In June, 1924, the National Child Labour Committee almost doubled the number given by the Census Bureau. During the time that it operated, the Federal law had the effect of driving a number of children out of employment. Further on in his report <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chass</inline> gave instances of the occupations which the children followed, and the wages paid to them.  His  report reads: - </para>

                        <para>Children were found working on these truck farms for the lowest wages imaginable; five, ten, fifteen and twenty cents, an hour were the common wages paid, the older children receiving the higher amounts and those of the younger classes - many who were below eight years of age, and some below five - usually earned five and ten cents an hour. In speaking of these wages, the bureau stated that the earnings, especially of the younger children, seem a meagre return for the hours of labour, the physical strain of constant stooping, the exposure to heat and dampness, and, for many, the loss of time in school that the work entailed. . . . Children as young as six years of age were found at work in the beet fields of Colorado and Michigan. Some 150 cases of mal-nutrition were found among l,022 children studied. The health of these children was found to be very much impaired. Constant stooping resulted in 676 cases of "winged scapulae". </para>

Here, the older boys, from twelve to sixteen years of age, toil in a kind of Dantesque inferno, isolated in a terrible dark world. Here, they often are forced to work in mud and water, sometimes stripped to the waistline because, of the intense heat, and sometimes groping through suffocating gas and smoke. A more intolerable condition could not exist anywhere for the youth of America. Yet here, mother's little tots are forced to slave away their childhood days - the time of play and gladness. </para>

On two occasions Congress has passed laws, which have been declared by the High Court of the United States of America to be unconstitutional, in an endeavour to deal with the evil. I now refer honorable senators to the <inline font-style="italic">Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,</inline> vol. xxv., 1905.

                    <para>The  president  of the American Cotton Manufacturing Association, Mr.R. M. Miller, of Charlotte, North Carolina, in an interview deprecating the raising of the age limit in North Carolina from twelve to fourteen, for girls and for illiterate boys, claimed that 75 per cent, of the spinners of North Carolina were fourteen or under. The average for children under sixteen, employed in Southern mills, as given by the census of 1900, was 25 per cent. On that basis there must be 60,000 children, from six to sixteen, now working in the mills of the Southern States, and my own opinion is that there are 60,000 under fourteen years of ago. And just now the mills are running night and day, and even the rule of 66 hours a week makes the working day of these little ones for five days of the week twelve hours. </para>

For the purposes of this discussion it does not give an adequate picture, for several reasons: (1) Working children under ten years of age were not enumerated. Their numbers, it is to be hoped, are not large; but the serious effects of their employment make even small numbers important. </para>
                        <para>Nevertheless, the census showed more than a million (1,060,858) children between ten and sixteen years of age gainfully employed, and nearly half a million (413,549) employed in. non-agricultural industries. </para>
                        <para>In 1920, it should be remembered, the Federal law was discouraging, by a prohibitive tax, the employment of children under fourteen in mills and factories, and the Federal eight-hour day made it more difficult and less profitable than formerly to employ them in mills which operated on a ten or eleven-hour schedule. The census figures for 1920 show that the textile mills were then employing 54,649 child operatives; iron and steel mills, 12,904; clothing factories and sweatshops, 11,757; lumber mills and furniture factories, 10,585; shoe factories, 7,545; coal mines, 5,850. Child servants and waiters were reported to the number of 41,586. Messengers, bundle wrappers, and office boys and girls numbered 48,028; sales boys and sales girls in stores, 30,370; other child clerks, 22,521. Newsboys numbered 20,706, and there were 147.048 children between ten and sixteen in other miscellaneous occupations. </para>

                        <para>In Mississippi more than one-fourth of all the children ten to fifteen years of age were at work; in Alabama and South Carolina, 24 per cent.; in Georgia, 21 per cent.; and in Arkansas, 19 per cent. Of the New England States, Rhode Island had the largest proportion of children from ten to fifteen years of age, 13 per cent., "employed in gainful occupations." </para>

                    <para>Referring to the. absence of labour laws, the writer continues :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Nine States hove no law prohibiting all children under 14 years from working in both factories and stores. Twenty-three States, with a fourteen-year minimum age limit, have weakened their laws by permitting exemptions under which children not yet fourteen may work. Thirty-five States allow children to go to work without a common-school education. Nineteen States do not make physical fitness for work a condition of employment. Eleven States allow children under sixteen to work from nine to eleven hours a day ; one State does not regulate in any way daily hours of labour of children. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator endeavoured to strengthen his argument against compulsory arbitration by claiming that sweating had been abolished in other countries by reason of their economic conditions. He said that in any event sweating would have been prevented in Australia on account of the strength of the industrial unions; but it is well known that when compulsory arbitration was introduced here the unions were numerically weak. In nearly every industry unionists were in the minority, and were powerless to enforce their will. It is our arbitration law that has enabled the unions to become the powerful bodies they are to-day. The honorable senator also said that arbitration had prevented capital from coming into this country. That is a serious statement, and honorable senators have every right to inquire into the truth of it. One would have thought that before making a statement so damaging to Australia - because it is damaging - the honorable senator would have been sure of his ground. If it is a fact then, in allowing our Federal arbitration legislation to remain on our statute-books, we are risking the progress and development of Australia. If the honorable senator had applied to the Trade and Customs Department he would have ascertained whether his statement was one of fact. </para>

                            <para>- But the honorable senator made an unqualified assertion. He also dealt with the relative wages in the United States of America and Canada, and said that wages in Australia would have been just as good without arbitration, because they had increased to the same extent in the United States of America and Canada. I have facts to show that that is not correct. The daily wage rate in out-door occupations in those countries is higher than in Australia, but it is well known that all outdoor work there practically ceases in the winter months and, taking a year's earnings, the wage rate would have to be much higher than it now is in America and Canada to be equivalent to the Australian rate. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, for the honorable senator's argument, they have. The statements show the number of unemployed, and if the returns for a whole year are studied, it will be seen that there are very few unemployed in summer, but a very large number in winter - when it is almost impossible to carry on building operations - and that this occurs both in the United States of America and Canada. Coming to yet another statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell, Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has quoted figures showing that the Arbitration Court, so far from having been provocative of strikes, has prevented a large number of them, and that Australia is not the economic sinner that she is sometimes represented to be. Those figures  could be elaborated in greater detail. During the last election I had analyses made of the number of men in the unions that had been the chief cause of strikes, and they showed that, although the Seamen's Union had been responsible for 70 per cent, of the wages lost by strikes during a period of years, that union only had 8,000 members out of a total of 700,000 unionists. Therefore, the greatest trouble-makers in our industrial life can be narrowed down to 8,000 men at the most - an insignificant number when compared with the total of 700,000 unionists - who have been responsible in the last few years for enormous losses of wages, time, capital, and goodwill. I wish to say a few words in reply to some of the other criticisms of honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- Only to industries controlled by the States. The Commonwealth, of course, must be master in its own household. The amendment still leaves the States free, if they do not engage in ordinary trading, to look after their own affairs without interference by the central authority. Some of the States have established . brick-yards, timber-yards, fish-shops, and meat-shops; but, on the other hand, there are activities which traditionally the State Governments have engaged in for many years. . Some of the States have made up their minds, from well or ill-considered motives, to enter the industrial arena; and to the extent to which they do that they should be subject to the same regulations, laws, and limitations as private manufacturers and traders in the same field. There is a steadfast conviction in the minds of the people that the States, as well as the Commonwealth, should look after their own affairs. The States are sovereign authorities, just as the Commonwealth is sovereign' within its own domain. They took a prominent part in the creation of the Federation, and they are included in a very specific way in the definitions in the Constitution. The people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania are specially mentioned in the preamble to the Constitution, and, later, the word " States," like the word " Commonwealth," is defined. The States, as such, are an integral portion of our governmental system. It is proposed in the bill that the Commonwealth shall have the right to invade the arena of all State undertakings, large and small. </para>

                            <para>- When the Commonwealth arbitration system was created it was assumed that there were only two classes of interstate employees - shearers and seamen. Since then, however, unions have federalized and manufactured many interstate industries and disputes. There is no warrant for a central authority demanding to know of a State what it is doing in its different activities. Let me remind honorable senators of the extent of the undertakings of the States. The State railway systems are worth about £250,000,000, which is about twenty times more than the value of the Commonwealth railway system. They have embarked upon schemes for the supply of water for drinking and irrigation purposes, and have engaged in many other activities to develop the country; and in those undertakings they should not be subjected to hindrance or interference, or to the prying eyes of a Commonwealth authority. The object of these powers, if they have an object, is to secure industrial equity. They aim at removing social injustice, but such forms of abuse ought not to exist under the aegis of a Government. A Government, State or Federal, is an instrument by which the people secure the well-defined end of "peace, order, and good government," to use a hackneyed phrase. The people are now asked to believe that the States are incapable of doin&lt;-" what the Commonwealth is doing. I am not disposed to go the length proposed in the bill. I am opposed to the concentration of power in the central authority, and that is where this bill is leading. The Prime Minister has declared that the power of fixing wages will be taken at first gradually, and finally entirely, from the Stateauthorities. I ask honorable senators whether they are prepared to accept that as an objective. Within limits, I am. I should limit State authorities to operating within their own sphere; but I would' leave them to carry out their own work to the best of their ability. This would be paying them the only compliment they deserve. The Commonwealth is very jealous of its own prerogatives, and we should not like any one to interfere with Commonwealth instrumentalities. It is; not because the Commonwealth is the superior authority that we should claim the privilege of non-interference with whatever we do; but because of that quality inherent in the agency of government, which is possessed as fully by a State government as by the Commonwealth Government. This matter should!  be given very serious consideration. I am against the proposal to load up the central authority with all these powers. It can only end, as a member of the last Parliament said, in imposing such a strain upon the central organization of government that we shall be compelled later to unload some of its burden and undo very much of what we are proposing to do to-day. It is proposed to federalize the authority to decide wages and conditions in industry, and, in another bill we have to consider, it is proposed that the Commonwealth authority shall have practically complete control in regulating the whole of the commerce of Australia. I submit my amendment with a view to leaving the State authorities free to revolve on their own axes, and to formulate their plans without any prying interference by the government of the Commonwealth. Is it assumed that a State government cannot be trusted to deal out even-handed justice and fair play to its subjects in the carrying on of these activities? Such an assumption must be the basis of this bill. But I would ask any honorable senator, who thinks in that way, to consider the work of the State parliaments. We all know that, if, in connexion with the operations of any State activity to-day, there is  a  single individual who feels injured or aggrieved, his grievance will find an echo in the State parliament, and will be inquired into and rectified. In this respect the control of a State activity differs entirely from the control of any private enterprise. It is true that I supported &amp; somewhat similar proposal in the past; but, in common with others who supported it, I hope I have learned something from experience, and it appears to me now to be an unwarrantable interference with the State authorities. My experience supplies no justification for it. I desire that it should be embedded in the Constitution that, so far as this class of activity is concerned, the right of the State authorities to deal with them should not be subject to any interference by any Commonwealth government. </para>

                        <para>.- I would remind the committee that probably the most difficult task in which a legislature can be engaged is an amendment of the Constitution. The framing of such an amendment is not a task which should be attempted by a layman while standing on his feet addressing this chamber. It should be seriously considered, and any proposal for the purpose should be left to legal minds to decide what its exact effect would be. I am not a lawyer, and I have only just heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment read ; but it seems to me that its effect would be exactly the opposite of what the honorable senator desires.

Under the honorable senator's amendment, the regulation of such activities would not come under the " grasping powers " of which he speaks. I know that that is not what he intends, and that what he desires is that such activities as a fish shop or a butcher's shop shall come within the Federal powers. </para>

He is aware that the Government is asking the Parliament to take very grave action. I assume that all who are supporting the bill really desire that the people shall endorse these measures, and accept the proposals for constitutional alteration. Judging from the debate, it is not going to be an easy task to induce a majority of the people in a majority of the States to accept these proposals. No  one who desires that they should be accepted can consider it desirable that they should include one of the most debatable matters that could be introduced, and that is the question of how far the Federal industrial authority should go in the regulation of State activities. I understand that the High Court has ruled that where a State is engaged in an industrial activity it may under the Constitution as it stands, and without the acceptance of these proposals, be brought under the authority of the Federal Arbitration Court. </para>

Does the honorable senator think it quite fair to the Government and to those who desire that these proposals for the amendment of the Constitution shall be accepted by the majority of the people of Australia, to throw in this apple of discord, and so place honorable senators in a false position,' no matter how they may vote? Many honorable senators who desire that the Government's proposals should be accepted by the people will vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment, when, if it were submitted as a separate matter, they might be found supporting the honorable senator.

                        <para>. - I cannot quite follow what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> proposes.  His  amendment is very much involved, and he has not so far denned what he means by " State activity." In my view, the amendment, if agreed to, would defeat the object of paragraph xl., as set out in the bill. Whilst I admit that the paragraph as it stands does not go so far as honorable members on this side would like, I contend now, as I did when speaking on the second reading, that it does propose an extension of the powers of the Federal Parliament in the regulation of industrial matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment would have the effect of limiting the extension proposed by the bill. The honorable senator's argument that, without an amendment of the Constitution those concerned in State instrumentalities cannot come before the Federal Arbitration Court, is fallacious. It is a considerable time since the High Court gave its decision that the Constitution permitted the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to regulate working conditions in .State instrumentalities. The only part of the paragraph I am concerned about is whether or not this Parliament will have power to give to .the authority to be created a direction in regard to hours of work. </para>

                            <para>- I take it that Parliament will give a direction to the court by means of a bill, and at any time it may amend that measure. That opinion was confirmed by the Attorney-General in another place. It is a matter that is concerning the minds of many people in Australia to-day, particularly members of trade unions, and the Minister's admission, confirmed by the statement of the Attorney-General,, has clarified the position to a great extent. While Parliament will create an authority, and pass an act setting out the powers of the authority, it still reserves to itself the right to amend 'that act. I cannot say how I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment until he gives a more explicit idea of what he means. I am seeking for an extension of the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament over industrial matters, and' I fear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment would contract, rather than extend those powers. </para>

                            <para>- At the present time, as a result of the decision of the High Court, State-owned railways come under the jurisdiction of Federal courts ; but I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> wants to exempt them and confine the jurisdiction of Federal courts in respect of State enterprises to such things as State meat shops, fish shops, and so on. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> wanted to amend an important bill of this sort, which provides for an amendment of the Constitution, he should have consulted the Parliamentary Draftsman so that his amendment would express exactly what he intended. I have always held that State instrumentalities such as railways should be exempt from Federal jurisdiction. When federation was consummated, certain powers were delegated to the Commonwealth Government, all other powers being retained by the States. Thus we have two sets of authorities, the Commonwealth and the various States, each with sovereign rights within its own ambit; but when Federal courts interfere with State instrumentalities there is undoubtedly direct interference with the sovereignty of the States. The States, contrary to the true Federal spirit, cease to be sovereign within their own spheres as regards those particular activities. </para>

                            <para>- The Federal employees come quite naturally within the jurisdiction of tribunals set up by the Federal Parliament; it is no interference with the sovereign rights of the Commonwealth for Federal tribunals to adjudicate upon the wages and working conditions of Federal servants. It is, however, quite a different thing for those tribunals to exercise jurisdiction over the servants of a State.. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has in his mind. A State railway is not an industry which is carried on in competition with a similar industry outside. </para>

If the honorable senator could have the matter postponed, and have an amendment drawn up by the Parliamentary Draftsman, the position would be entirely different; but to place into a bill of this character an amendment haphazardly drafted, might lead us into a false position. Therefore, while I should like to support the. amendment, I cannot agree to it in its present form.

                        <para>.  - On the second reading I said that the proposed new paragraph (xl.) did not appeal to me, and I am taking the first opportunity of giving effect to my statement. Perhaps I should have consulted the Crown Law Officers, and had an amendment properly framed to suit honorable senators, but the case seemed to me so simple that I did not think there was any need for the use of elaborate language. </para>

                            <para>- If the Senate thinks that the Commonwealth, as the paragraph in the bill clearly empowers it to do, should step into the State's spheres of action and inquire into every activity carried on by it, regulating the conditions of labour in connexion with it, I have nothing to say, except, of course, to raise my voice in protest. But if, on the other hand, it is the feeling of the Senate that the Commonwealth is not justified in stepping into the arena of State activities and interfering except to a limited degree, it should at least call for a pause and see where it stands - it should shape an amendment to suit its wishes. </para>

                    <para class="block">I want to draw a line, which can be done under the rules of common sense between one class of activities carried on by the States from the earliest days and another  class brought into existence in recent years. In the past the States have built railways, waterworks, irrigation works, and harbour works wherever they were required, and those works were calculated to advance the general development of the States. But when they have opened timber yards, as has been done in Western Australia, brick yards as has been done in New South Wales, and butcher shops as has been done in Queensland, they have embarked upon a class of activities between which, and the other class I have mentioned, there is a sharp line of distinction. The paragraph in the bill I am seeking to amend aims at taking away from the States every vestige of control in the management of all activities. I am opposed to that, but I would limit my opposition, in that respect. I would leave to the States full control in regard to those activities which they have been carrying on for the general advancement and development of their own areas, but as for the others, I would say " Let them by all means be subject to the same supervision, inquiry and regulation as is applied to any other kind of industry in Australia." I want my amendment to give effect to that desire: I am opposed to the Government's proposal if it means, as I think it does, the depriving of the States of every vestige of authority so far as the regulating of State instrumentalities is concerned. </para>

                        According to the High Court's interpretation of the Constitution, Federal tribunals have jurisdiction over State instrumentalities. The desire of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                        and others is that that jurisdiction shall be withdrawn; if that is to be done, this bill is the proper place in which to propose the necessary amendment of the Constitution. In 1923 this matter was brought before the Premiers' Conference by the Attorneys-General of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The State representatives proposed certain delimitations of Commonwealth and State powers over industry, and sought to protect responsible government in the States by exempting their instrumentalities from the jurisdiction of Federal tribunals. In a memorandum issued by him at that time, the Prime Minister said, "With the objects which the State Governments have in view the Commonwealth Government is in full sympathy." He admitted that the Commonwealth should not interfere with the sovereignty of the States in this regard, and he proceeded to discuss with the representatives of the States the procedure to be adopted. Certain suggestions were made by the State Premiers and Attorneys-General, and the Prime Minister's memorandum said -

They call for either (a) an amendment of the Constitution; or (b) reference of the necessary subject-matter, by all the States concurrently, to the Commonwealth under section 51 (xxxvii.) of the Constitution. The second alternative is the less satisfactory. It is not certain - and cannot be certain until it is decided by the High Court - that such a reference when made is irrevocable. </para>

We were told that proposals to amend the Constitution would be submitted at a later date, and we assumed that this matter would be provided for. The bill does not do that, and apparently the Government is not prepared to do it. If the amendment is carefully re-drafted - and that cannot be done without the expert advice of a draftsman - I shall support it, but I cannot vote for it in its present form. </para>

I admit that the amendment, as he has phrased it, is capable of a very wide interpretation; but if, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says, State instrumentalities, unless specifically excluded by subsequent legislation, will come under the  jurisdiction of Federal authorities, a serious infringement of State rights is proposed. The extent of Commonwealth jurisdiction over State instrumentalities has always been a debatable constitutional point, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> desires to insert in the Constitution a definite provision that such activities shall not come within the ambit of Commonwealth law. Until recently that was understood to be the meaning of the Constitution, and at one time the High Court ruled in that way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said that the State instrumentalities can be excluded when Parliament legislates in exercise of the increased powers that are how sought. I am afraid to leave this matter to the discretion of Parliament. The High Court has ruled that State civil servants come within the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Court. </para>

                        <para>.- I  sympathize with the purpose of the amendment, but it will not accomplish the intention of the mover. Indeed, I doubt whether we have sufficient legal skill in the Commonwealth to draft a provision that would definitely exclude all State instrumentalities from the jurisdiction of Federal tribunals. Admittedly the framers of the Constitution did not intend that Commonwealth jurisdiction should extend to State railways and other instrumentalities of that kind. But the States themselves are largely responsible for the High Court's decision to the contrary. They commenced to dabble in all sorts of enterprises of ordinary trading which should have been left to private individuals, and the High Court finding it impossible to discriminate between State instrumentalities engaging in trading and private enterprises declared them all, therefore, subject to Commonwealth jurisdiction. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Lynch</inline> desires to accomplish cannot be effected by an amendment in general terms such as he has proposed ; he must specifically exclude railways, tramways, and whatever other State instrumentalities he desires to name, from the jurisdiction of Federal courts. That is one objection to the amendment in its present form. There is also the suspicion that it will operate to deprive a great number pf industrialists of rights which they have acquired at considerable expense. The State railway unions will be affected. Naturally they will be supported by other unions from motives of sympathy. If the purpose is to kill the bill- </para>

                        <para>.- Speaking as a layman, it seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch's</inline> amendment, which has enlisted the sympathy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell,</inline> will create a great deal of trouble, because it will vitally affect all employees -in State railway workshops, the engineers, coachbuilders, carpenters, joiners, and other federated industrial, organizations, which are operating under awards made by the Federal Arbitration Court. They will not give up their rights without a struggle. If an attempt is made to insert in the Constitution a provision exempting State instrumentalities, we shall have the organized opposition of all these federated unions. Even if it were possible so to frame the amendment as to express clearly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> intends to convey, I should oppose it, because it will lead to so much trouble. </para>

The probability is that existing State authorities will continue to function, because Federal and State powers will be concurrent, but where there is a clash or variation the Federal power must take precedence over that of the State in order to prevent overlapping and confusion. It is not the intention of this Government to set up a single industrial authority for Australia, or, as has been said, to ereate a Federal industrial oligarchy. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but I suggest that if a government adopted that course it would be looking for trouble, both for itself and the country, and that it would have an extremely short life. It is not intended to interfere with State industrial tribunals that are doing good work. For instance, no government would be foolish enough to set up another authority to do the work of wages boards in Victoria. The desire of the Government is to vest all such State tribunals with Federal jurisdiction if necessary. </para>

As honorable senators are probably aware, the term of office of the  President  and the two  Deputy  Presidents of the Arbitration Court terminates on the 30th June. It is necessary that the bill should be passed before that date, because it empowers the Government to re-appoint the two deputies for such a period as will enable them to complete the hearing of the cases on which they are now engaged.

                    <para>.- At the first blush I felt inclined to oppose the motion for the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders, because I did not think it right to interrupt in this way our consideration of the two very important measures involving amendments of the Constitution, particularly as those bills were disposed of in another place before this measure was dealt with. In view of the explanation of the Minister, however, I realize the urgency. I understand that the Australian Railways Union and the Australian Tramways Employees' Association are now appearing before the Arbitration Court, and that each of them has gone to considerable trouble to prepare its case, and to submit evidence to the court. If this bill is not passed by the 30th June, those organizations will have to start <inline font-style="italic">de novo,</inline> and will thus incur unnecessary delay and expense. As special executive power has to be obtained before the 30th June to enable the deputies 'to temporarily continue, I shall not oppose the motion. </para>

                    <para>This measure does not embody the entire policy of the Government in respect to industrial arbitration. The Government is, of course, delaying the introduction of such a bill until a vote has been taken on the referendum proposals, when further amending legislation will be brought before Parliament. The object of this measure is merely to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, under the powers vested in the Parliament by the Constitution as it stands. The court now consists of the  president  - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers - and two  deputy  presidents - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb.</inline> The  president  is resigning at the end of June, and the terms of the  president  and  deputy  presidents expire on the 30th instant. It is necessary, therefore, to make provision for the continuance of the court. Further, it is desired to take the opportunity to improve the constitution of the court, to extend its jurisdiction, and to strengthen its powers in certain directions. I could supply honorable senators with a list of the cases with which the court has had to deal, but I shall content myself by saying that they are more numerous than the general public is aware. There is, however, one phase of the court's activities that I should like to mention in view of certain statements made in the Senate during the discussion of another measure. There have been 41 compulsory conferences held, and 42 agreements, settling disputes, filed in the court under section 24 of the act. In addition, the court has, on occasions, by special request, settled industrial disputes other than those of an interstate character. Boards of reference appointed under awards of the court have dealt with 277 matters during the year. The employees affected by the awards of the court number. 330,000. In view of these figures the court is freely availed of, and its foundation is firmly established. </para>
                    <para class="block">The necessity for extending the powers of the court has been fully discussed in the. recent debates. The impossibility of separate States dealing effectively with certain disputes has been universally admitted, and if we are to secure industrial peace through the medium of the law, there must be some means of settling certain disputes on a Federal basis. As I have said, the bill does not provide for anything like a complete treatment of the subject. It is really designed to deal only with the period intervening between the 30th June and the time when the proposed constitutional amendments have been voted on by the people. The Government, therefore, does not propose at present to introduce an elaborate and carefully worked out scheme for the settlement of disputes upon the basis of our present limited powers. If the industrial powers to be sought are extended, it will be possible to introduce an improved scheme providing for a common rule, and means of settling industrial disputes other than those provided under the Arbitration Act. The existing Arbitration Court can be continued, its powers extended, and other means of determining industrial differences considered. This measure, therefore, is only to provide for the continuance of the court with some immediate improvement in its jurisdiction and status. </para>
                    <para>The subjects with which the bill deals may be stated generally as follows : - It confers full judicial power not now conferred upon the Arbitration Court. In order to effect this change the bill provides for a life tenure of office, pensions to the judges, means for obtaining general decisions which would apply to any of the awards of the court, and would be followed by the judges on all matters such as those affecting .the basic wage or the standard hours of industry. It also provides for the continuance of 'partheard matters now before the  President  and  Deputy  Presidents. As explained during the discussion on the referendum bills, the absence of judicial power affects the authority of the Arbitration Court  to enforce its awards. Section 71 of the Constitution provides that .the judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the High Court, and in such other Federal courts as it invests with Federal jurisdiction. " Other courts " means State courts, which this Parliament may invest with Federal jurisdiction. Section 72 of the Constitution provides that the justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by Parliament shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council, and shall not be removed except by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the ground of misbehaviour or incapacity. The meaning of section 72 has been considered by the High Court in a case that is generally referred to as <inline font-style="italic">Alexander's case,</inline> which honorable senators will find reported in 25 C.L.R., page 434. In that case it was held that sub-section 2 of section 72 provided that Federal judges must have a life tenure of office. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that the  President  of the Arbitration Court shall have a te.nure of office of seven years, and that the  Deputy  Presidents shall have a tenure fixed by the Governor-General in Council. Although the  President  of the Arbitration Court, in his capacity as a judge of the High Court, is appointed for life, he and the  Deputy  Presidents of the Arbitration  Court are only appointed for a limited period in relation .to arbitration jurisdiction, and they are, therefore, incompetent in that jurisdiction to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. Judicial power includes at least the power to decide whether the law has been broken, and the power to impose penalties for breaches of the law. It was held in <inline font-style="italic">Alexander's case</inline> that the Arbitration Court had no power to impose penalties for any breach of its awards or orders. The court has imposed no fine for several years. Matters involving breaches of awards and contraventions of the act have been dealt with by police magistrates. Indeed, both sides in industry have expressed doubts as to whether it is desirable that a court, relatively unfamiliar with industrial matters, such as a magistrate's court, must necessarily be, should, in practice, have power to impose penalties in respect of breaches of awards. It is generally agreed on both sides that these matters should be dealt with by the Arbitration Court itself. In another case, commonly known as the <inline font-style="italic">Waterside Workers' case,</inline> the reference to which is 34 C.L.R., page 4S2, it was held that the power sought to be conferred upon the Arbitration Court by section 38 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to interpret its own awards was inoperative, in so far as it was a judicial power. A magistrate's court, because of the defect of judicial power, is not bound by the  interpretation  that has been made by the Arbitration Court; it accordingly gives its own interpretation. The interpretation may differ from that of the Arbitration Court. An improvement in this respect is desirable, and this will be corrected by conferring judicial power on the Arbitration Court. It is no longer proposed to appoint High Court judges to the Arbitration Court. The Court of Conciliation and Arbitration will be entirely distinct from the High Court. The provision that the  President  of the Arbitration Court must be a High Court judge will, therefore, be repealed. There are various reasons which render it advisable to have the two jurisdictions entirely distinct from each other. Serious inconvenience of a practical nature now arises from time to time, because it is necessary to enlist the services of the  President  of the Arbitration Court to constitute a full bench of the High Court. Again, the  President  of the Arbitration Court, as a judge of the High Court, has on very many occasions to pronounce upon the validity of a procedure that he has adopted as  President. </para>

                            <para>- In such cases there can be no appeal. In clauses 4 and 5 of ' the bill it  is made clear that Parliament intends the new judges to have all the powers that were sought to be  conferred  oh the court by preceding legislation. The title " President " is to be changed to " Chief Judge," and that of "Deputy President" to " Judge," to emphasize the change that is being made in the character of the court. Clause 6, which repeals sections 12, 13, and 14 of the act relates to tenure, and provides that the judges shall have a life tenure. Under the Constitution, as interpreted by judicial decision, judicial power cannot be conferred upon any judge whose appointment is for a limited period. The salary proposed for the chief judge is £3,000 per annum, and that for a judge £2,500 per annum. These are considered moderate salaries, having regard to the important nature of the work that will have to be performed. It is proposed that the judges shall be entitled, after fifteen years' service, to retire upon a  pension. The same proposal is made also in relation to the High Court judges in the Judiciary Bill. The object of the pension scheme which is embodied in this proposal, and which follows precisely the existing provisions with relation to the Supreme Court judges of New South Wales, is, in the first place, to attract good men, and, when they are appointed, to save them from financial anxiety. It is not proposed to apply the provisions of the Public Service Superannuation Act to gentlemen who have reached the age at which men are usually appointed to the bench. The contributions would vary very greatly, and it would be quite impossible to work out a scheme upon an actuarial basis. Clause 7 furnishes a means for obtaining a determination from the full bench of the Arbitration Court upon the questions of standard hours and basic wage. There is a section in the Arbitration _ Act which provides that certain -questions relating to hours must be dealt with by the full bench of the Arbitration Court. But it must be remembered that that court can deal only with particular disputes. In order to make it possible to obtain a considered judgment from the whole court, it is proposed to insert in the act a new provision that .the Attorney-General may, in the public interest, intervene in the hearing of any dispute that involves the question of standard hours or basic wage. The court will publish a notification in .the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> that the Attorney-General has intervened, and that any person or organization, 'whether registered or not, having an interest in the matter, may apply to the court for liberty to be heard on it. That answers the question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> raised earlier in the day. Such an application may be made by a single union or a body of unions, a particular employees' association,, or an employers' federation. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say that it will. It must have the right to decide' the matter, because frivolous applications may be lodged. If the court is of opinion that the applicant is interested in the question, it may allow him to examine and cross-examine witnesses, and to address the court. No unlimited right to be heard is extended to an unlimited number of persons ; the whole matter will be under the control of the court. If the court is of opinion that an applicant is interested, it may, in its discretion, allow him to be heard. That is to say, the Attorney-General will have nothing to do with the matter, other than to send the notice to the court, which will itself determine whether a particular applicant is sufficiently interested to be heard. These are big questions involving general principles that ought not to be determined unless both sides have the fullest opportunity of being represented. The only object of this provision is to allow both sides in industry to have the fullest opportunity to be represented. If that opportunity were not afforded, a determination might be reached in favour of one side or the other, and a binding rule might be laid down by the Full Arbitration Court to operate for an uncertain period, although the case had not been sufficiently stated on either side in view of the extent of the interests affected. The next proposal is designed to relieve the judges of the court to some extent of the burden of work which they have at present, by making provision for the Governor-General to appoint conciliation commissioners to facilitate the conciliation jurisdiction of the court. This is a means of increasing the exercise of the powers of the court in the direction of conciliation. The power of conciliation is one of the most important powers of the court, and the Government is of the opinion that it should be developed and extended. The powers of the commissioners will be found in sections 16 and 16a of the act. </para>

                            <para>- It might be applied in that way, or to a tribunal such as a Whitley council. Anything in the nature of conciliation can be operated under those sections. The last clause of the bill provides that the present  deputy  presidents may continue to exercise in relation to part-heard matters all the powers which exist under the present act. It would be a great mistake to cut off everything on the 30th June. The Railways case, for example, is being heard before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick. It is a very complicated inquiry, and the  deputy president  has heard the case in relation to about 75 out of 300 or 400 grades. </para>

At the present moment there are no fewer than 105 matters before the court, so provision must be made for the completion of part-heard matters in order to save the time and money of the parties, and to secure the services in these cases of the  deputy  presidents before whom they have been conducted. Honorable senators will see that the bill by no means completely covers the field that will have to be covered if extended industrial powers are granted by the people to the Commonwealth. This is an interim measure, but it proposes to give to the court many powers that it has not possessed in the past, and which are very necessary for a full exercise of effective arbitration jurisdiction. </para>

                <para class="block">At the hearing of the Ballarat by-election petition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs laid it down that the presiding officer should inform the elector of the particular provisions under which he should claim the right to vote. That is an impossible position in which to place the officer. It is now proposed to lay upon an elector whose name does not appear upon the certified list of voters used at the poll the onus of placing before the presiding officer the full facts upon which his claim to vote is based, and to formally claim the right to vote under the particular provisions that are applicable to him. Those facts are, and they should be, known to the elector, yet they may not be, and probably are not, known to the presiding officer. Although those officers should assist electors so far as they possibly can, the legal obligation should not be placed upon them when they cannot effectively discharge it, particularly as any action which they may take might place the validity of a referendum in jeopardy. This provision is similar to that which is embodied in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. </para>

                <para>Clause 3 of the bill, as passed by the Senate on 11th February last, provided that a pamphlet containing arguments relating to a proposed law might be issued if approval to that action were given by a resolution of both Houses within one week after the passage of the proposed law through those Houses. The amendment proposes that such a pamphlet shall not be issued in respect to the forthcoming referendums relating to industry and commerce and essential services. The reason is that a big majority of the members of both parties in another place are in favour of the proposals, and only a small number are opposed to them, and the minority has no desire to issue a pamphlet. </para>

                        <para>- These proposals may have far-reaching results, and in my opinion it is desirable that the parties for and against should state their case in an official pamphlet. This is the more necessary, seeing that men occupying high positions in the legal profession differ seriously in their views as to the possible effect of an affirmative vote by the people. Pamphlets have been issued in connexion with every previous referendum. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to say that many electors would receive them only a day or two before they were called upon to vote. To be of real' value, such information should reach the average elector at least two or three weeks before the vote is taken. In the absence of an official pamphlet I can see that this will be mainly a newspaper referendum. </para>

                        <para>- They may to a certain extent, but we have had instances of the speakers on one side being fully reported and those on the other being practically ignored. I regret that nothing very much will be done by the Government to inform the minds of the electors on these all-important proposals. As the great majority of the newspapers will more or less vigorously oppose them there is very little possibility of them being accepted by the people. </para>
