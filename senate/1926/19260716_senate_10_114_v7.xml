For instance, the Government has formulated a scheme for the purchase of the Melbourne homes of officers who will be transferred to Canberra in 1927, and the Public Service Board has been requested to take into consideration the question of a cost of living allowance for &#39;those officers. </para>
                        <para>Regarding the question of the prices at which homes will be available at Canberra for rent or purchase, the Public Service Board, to whom the matter was referred by the Government, has appointed a committee which is at present inquiring as to the differences, if any, which exist between the costs of construction of houses in Melbourne and Canberra respectively. Upon receipt of the committee&#39;s report the matter will be considered by the Public Service Board. </para>

                <para class="block">As honorable senators are aware, when the Estimates are presented in another place, the practice is immediately &#39; to introduce a bill to authorize the expenditure of. &#39;money out of revenue on new public works and buildings, bo that no time may be lost and no break occur in the continuity of construction policy. The purposes of the bill are to grant and apply the sum of &#163;296,734 out of the ConsolidatedRevenue Fund for the services of the year ended the 30th June, 1927, for the purposes of additions, new works, buildings, &#38;c., and to appropriate such sum. The total amount which Parliament is asked to provide is &#163;20,207 less than the expenditure of. last financial year, and &#163;26,552 less than the amount voted for 1925-26. . The. amounts required for the various services are relatively small, and provision is made in the bill under three parts, as follows: - Part I., departments and services, other  than  business undertakings and territories of the Commonwealth; Part II., business undertakings; and Part III., territories of the Commonwealth. The principal  items  for which provision has been made are :  - Reserve o  f  naval stores, including ammunition, ordnance, torpedo stores, and coal and oil fuel, &#163;118,000; . machinery and  plant for manufacture of munitions not now produced in Australia, &#163;12,789 ; new buildings, alterations, and additions, and construction of launches and vessels for the Department of Health, &#163;41,385; construction of buildings and roads, engineering services, and water boring, &#38;c, in the Northern Territory, &#163;66,500. It will be seen that relatively few new works have been provided for in this bill. It does not cover the works which are to be provided for from loan funds. A separate bill for works from loan will be submitted later. Ministers will be glad to furnish honorable senators with information concerning details of the works referred to when the bill reaches the committee stage. In view of the necessity to carry on the works programme without delay, I ask the Senate to proceed with the consideration of the bill forthwith. </para>

                        <para>series of regrettable accidents have occurred at Point Cook. Valuable lives have been lost. Whilst we all admit that, in the development of our air forces, there is always the risk of fatalities, I am wondering if all the precautions that should have been taken have been taken to prevent them. I trust that the Defence Department will look into this matter with a view to preventing further fatalities. Bearing in mind the number of men engaged in our Air Forces, the proportion of accidents of late has been too great. I am not blaming any one. All I wish to emphasize is that the position should be carefully considered. Can the Minister offer any explanation for the numerous fatal accidents that have happened of late? Is it because the aeroplanes used at Point Cook are obsolete? If they are, why should men be compelled to use them? I should also like the Minister to say if our air equipment is up to date, and if the instructors in the Air Force are the best obtainable ? I am not casting any reflection whatever upon our officers, but there is a feeling of anxiety concerning the exact position at Point Cook, which is the centre of our aerial activities. Speaking as a layman I am under the impression that the equipment necessary for such an important arm of our Defence Forces is not of the most modern type, and notwithstanding all this Government has said concerning its defence policy, it has achieved very little considering the money it has spent. In discussing this measure I cannot, of course, deal at length with the defence policy of the Commonwealth, or refer in detail to the expenditure incurred during the last ten years. The people of Australia have been led to believe that our Air Force is efficient, but we have never been told what equipment is necessary in order to have an up-to-date air service for defence purposes. Lieut. -General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash, a very eminent authority on the subject of defence, referred to our Air Force as a sham. Such a statement from one so experienced in the arts of war should not be disregarded. Although the Government has expended considerable sums of money for defence purposes, it has actually wasted a good deal, and has done very little in the direction of adequately equipping the Air Force. I remind the Minister representing the Minister for Defence in this Chamber that one of the world&#39;s greatest naval experts, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Percy</inline> Scott, once said that if Australia and New Zealand were properly defended by aeroplanes, submarines, and destroyers, they- would have nothing to fear. The members of the Labour party have always stressed the importance of these forms of defence, and in doing so we are supported by the eminent authority I have just quoted. We also favour the establishment of aerial depots and services throughout Australia by extending civil aviation, and thus providing a means whereby men may be suitably trained so that their services will be available for defence purposes. An ex-Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> of the 12th August, 1924, said : &#34;At present there is only one unit of the Air Force in Australia, and that is at Point Cook.&#34; That admission was made five years after the Great War had terminated, and when every one realized the important part played by the air service in the Great War. </para>

                    went on to &#39;say that a tremendous quantity of gift equipment had been obtained from Great Britain, but a good deal of it was still stored  away in the packages in which it came to Australia. That statement may have an important bearing upon the fatalities which have occurred at Point Cook to which I have referred, and in which the lives of some of our brilliant young aviators were sacrificed. The Minister said that some of the gift aeroplanes, were not even unpacked, and possibly some are still lying untouched. The Government and its supporters have endeavoured to ridicule the &#39;defence policy of the Labour party enunciated from every platform in Australia,, but notwithstanding all its. boasts concerning its defence policy, the Government cannot prove that it has a modern air service, although years have  elasped  since the importance of such a service was clearly demonstrated.  The following statement appeared in the Melbourne
                    <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>
                    on the 6th January, 1926: - &#34; The weakness of the Air Force in machines, equipment, and trained airmen presents the accumulated result of neglect and starvation which is causing serious concern.&#34;

                        <para>- Yes. A few days ago honorable senators representing Western Australia, and Western Australian members of the House of Representatives, asked the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse)</inline> if the Government would grant financial assistance to the Western Australian Civil Aviation  Service. Although the Minister gave the deputation a sympathetic hear-  ing he did not give us much encouragement. The Western Australian Air Service, which is doing excellent work in carrying passengers and mails, is also of great benefit to those resident in the more remote parts of that State. If a few thousand pounds were granted, as was suggested, to extend the service, the expenditure would be more than justified. Apart from the Western Australian service so ably conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Brearley</inline> for many years, there are other civil aviation services. </para>

                    <para>&#91;11.36&#93;.  -  In connexion with the regrettable accident at Point Cook, I should like to inform the Senate that the machines used for training purposes there are similar to those used abroad for the same purpose. They are Avro machines, which are regarded as the most suitable for (he training of young pilots. The aircraft in use are not obsolete; they are certainly a gift from the Imperial Government, but they have all been thoroughly overhauled and re-conditioned, and in all cases have been certified to by technical experts as being thoroughly airworthy. The instructors are very capable pilots. Honorable senators must be aware that during the war the Australian Air Force comprised a splendid body of men who were able to hold their own, not only with the members of the allied air forces, but also against the enemy air forces. Most of the accidents which have occurred in Australia have occurred during landing practice. The young pilots are first of all taught to fly at a high altitude, and when they become expert at that they are, at a lower altitude, taught landing practice. Most of the accidents occur at this, which is the most difficult portion of their training. The last accident is the subject of an inquiry. I can assure honorable senators that every possible care is taken, not only with the machines, but also with the training of pilots. Any honorable senator who has the time to spare should pay a visit to Point Cook, where he will see not only the precautions taken in training, but also the care which is exercised in re-conditioning the machines. They are constantly being examined, and very often are taken into the workshop <inline font-style="italic">tot</inline> have necessary repairs effected. I have been to the depot on a couple of occasions, and noted the thoroughness of the training and the work done in the workshop. Many honorable senators appear to think that an air force is capable of independent action against an enemy. That is quite wrong. An air force is subsidiary to both the Army and the Navy, and could not exist at the front without the infantry to protect it. To a certain extent cavalry have been replaced by aircraft as the eyes of a military force. It is used as a scouting as well as a fighting force, and is frequently employed to bomb areas at the enemy&#39;s rear. The Australian Air Force should be capable of dealing with any air force any enemy can send here. The moral effect of a well-equipped air force upon infantry during warlike operations is extraordinary. During the recent war it was very noticeable that when the allied airmen had the supremacy of the air it had a marked moral effect on the infantry. The supremacy of the air fluctuated very much; on some occasions the enemy had the upper hand, and on other occasions the allies were supreme in the air. In regard to what has been done by the Defence Department in extending the air force, the following shows the organization and establishment for the current year: - </para>

If honorable senators would take the trouble to visit Point Cook, they would see the material in the workshops and stores, properly tabulated, and also a great proportion of it in use daily.
                </para>
                <para>Honorable senators are probably aware that regular air services are maintained between Perth and Derby, once a week in each direction, the total distance flown annually being 149,968 miles. Between Charleville and Camooweal there is a service once a week in each direction, the annual mileage being 85,800. Between Adelaide and Cootamundra also there is a weekly service in each direction covering a distance of 60,112 miles per annum. A service is also maintained between Broken Hill and Mildura, twice weekly in each direction, the total flying distance being 39,312 miles a year. Between Melbourne and Hay also there is a service twice weekly in each direction, the distance flown each year being 48,464 miles. There has been considerable expansion of the service during repent years, and it is possible that there will be further extensions in the near future. Honorable senators will agree that those services are very efficient. So far there have been no accidents, with the exception of one in Western Australia, in the early stages of the service there. That there have not been more accidents speaks volumes for the organization and management of the services and the efficiency of the pilots. I have a personal knowledge of the Queensland service, and know that not only is great care taken in the selection of pilots, but also that the pilots, when selected, are very careful in carrying out their duties. </para>

                        <para>- It was stated recently at a public meeting in Sydney, that of the persons alive in Australia today 750,000 would die of cancer, and that since the termination of the Great War, cancer had claimed more than 70,000 victims in Australia. The mortality from that disease in this country is greater than that caused by the war. Yet the Government, in this bill, proposes to set aside only the nominal sum of &#163;8,018 for the Department of Health. The mortality caused by cancer, and the ravages of that disease are such as to arrest the attention of every thinking person in the community. That about 10 percent. of the persons now living in the Commonwealth are destined to die of cancer is appalling. In view of the immense revenue collected by the Commonwealth, more might be done to prevent the spread of that disease. In New South Wales an effort is being made to collect &#163;100,000 for the purpose of . establishing an up-to-date research laboratory. Having regard to the enormous number of deaths that have resulted from this disease, the number of people who are suffering from it, and the certainty on the latest figures that 750,000 Australians who are at present alive will succumb to it, the Government is not doing its duty when it provides a merely nominal sum for research work in connexion with it. Any financial assistance that the Government might give to those who in Sydney are endeavouring to collect &#163;100,000 for the establishment of an up-to-date laboratory would be warranted. It might go even further and, if it thought it desirable, establish laboratories in every captal city in the Commonwealth. It may be that Australia has done all that can be done at present, and that the expenditure has been undertaken judiciously. In Great Britain, the United </para>

                        <para>- I stand corrected. The fact that more than five times as much as was expended last year is placed upon the Estimates this year is an indication that the Government appreciates the importance of the matter. But even that provision is not sufficient. It is proposed under this measure to expend upon the defence of Australia a sum of &#163;168,469, and various other items will raise the total expenditure to &#163;296,734. No subject is more worthy than this of the attention of the Government, and in no direction could public money be more advantageously expended. An enormous number of returned men, and other members of the Australian community, are suffering acutely from tuberculosis. The Government would render a very great service, not only to the Commonwealth, but probably to the whole world, if it directed its attention to the location of the cause and the cure of the disease along lines that are recommended by experts. The matter is of such importance, not only to the present, but also to future generations, that we should not allow a day to pass without making the most strenuous efforts to grapple with the problem. If fa foreign enemy came to our shores and -murdered a few thousand Australians every year., no stone would be left unturned to adopt remedial measures; but because this insidious disease does its work quietly and attacks persons individually, no public outcry is raised. When a member of our community is foully murdered, the whole community is immediately advised through the press and by other means. We seem to have become callous to the insidious ravages of this disease, and regard with comparative equanimity the fact that it sweeps away thousands every year. It does not matter where money is expended, so long as a remedy is discovered. It is wrong of us to permit the present state of affairs to continue year after year. A Department of Health has been established for the benefit of the natives in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, and excellent results have accrued. I admit that we have gone a long way towards discovering a cure for this disease, but I claim that we are not doing sufficient, and are not proceeding at a rapid enough pace. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is the second occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> upon which I have had the privilege of addressing you. I have to apologize for the fact that on the previous occasion I did not avail myself of the opportunity to compliment you upon your elevation to your present high office. Naturally, .being human - and preferring to be human rather than inhuman - I should like to be the&#39; congratulated instead of the congratulator. That, however, is by the way. I feel that in my attempted flight to the exalted pinnacle upon which you rest I was stricken down and made to feel a piercing humiliation. From my lowly position I now express the hope &#39;that you will have a long and prosperous career in the Chair. Using words as a vehicle for conveying my thoughts towards you, I assure you that I better showed my appreciation of your qualities by supporting you to the fullest extent of my powers in your effort to obtain your present position. I did so, not only personally, &#39;but also by giving advice to those who sought it from me regarding your fitness for the position. I now leave the matter by wishing you all good luck. </para>

                        <para>- Under this measure it is proposed to spend &#163;296,734 on new works and buildings, and we are afforded the opportunity of showing where in the past public money has not been expended to the best advantage. I refer particularly to the cost of the erection of houses in the Federal Capital Territory. I hope that you, sir, will not rule that I am out of order in referring to that matter. If you have any doubts I call your attention to the fact that the schedule to the bill contains numerous items that are applicable to the erection throughout the Commonwealth of new works and buildings that may have been the subject of inquiry by the Public Works Committee. It is regrettable that a greater amount of wisdom and common sense has not been displayed in providing houses- for our public servants at Canberra. It was reported that a contract for 300 houses involving an expenditure of over &#163;500,000 had been let by the Federal Capital Commission. That report, I may add, was, within certain limits, contradicted officially. We were given to understand that the ministerial interpretation of the position was not that a complete contract had been let, but that contracts in groups of six cottages, and costing from &#163;1,600 to &#163;2,000 each, had been entered into for the erection of homes for public servants. It is clear, however, that the interests of the public servants - that body from which I have always demanded 20s. worth of work for every 20s. received - have not been conserved in this transaction. </para>

I hope that the Government will not again depart from the established practice of referring all public works of any magnitude to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report. Failure to do that in this instance will involve public servants in substantial loss, because they will have to pay more for the rent or purchase of their houses at Canberra than otherwise they would have to do. </para>

                <para>I turn now to the subject of rifle ranges. There is provision in this bill for the same vote as last year. It should be substantially increased, so that those men who devote so much of their, time to perfecting themselves in the use of those weapons so useful in time of war, may be encouraged to a reasonable extent. I should like to see an increase of 50 per cent, in the vote for rifle clubs. I know that I am not allowed to refer to the debate on the measure that was before the Senate last night, but I should like to say that I deprecate the expenditure of so much money on a Migration Commission whilst such &#39; useful institutions as our rifle clubs are clamouring for further assistance. I hope that the Supplementary Estimates will provide an increased vote for these clubs. A voluntary man, as - we know, is worth ten pressed men. A citizen who voluntarily sacrifices so much of his time in this useful occupation should be encouraged. In my State, where sturdy men have to work six days a week in the battle for a crust, they cannot afford to indulge in rifle practice on Saturday afternoons as is the custom in these &#34;festering&#34; cities like Melbourne </para>

                        <para>- I am only quoting Thomas Jefferson, the man who wrote the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America, and who declared that the sores of our civilization are the festering cities that abound. I am surprised that an admirer of the classics like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> one of the notables of the Labour party, should register dissent. I think I have said all I intended to say when I rose. Let me, in closing, repeat that I hope there will in the future be a thorough investigation into all public works involving the expenditure of a considerable sum of money. The Public Works Committee, which was created by this Parliament, is one of our most valuable institutions. All shades of politics and all States have representation upon it. Every proposal is looked at from every angle, and as a result, in very many cases unnecessary expenditure is avoided. I believe that the Government has shown some contrition in the matter. I am led to believe that, what I am suggesting will be done. I am glad to think that Ministers, who are not all hard-hearted, have relented to some extent, and that we may confidently anticipate that hereafter there will be no departure from the well-established practice of referring such proposals as house construction at Canberra to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report. </para>

                    <para>. - I had not intended to speak on this bill but for the fact that there is provision in it for expenditure on certain works in the Northern Territory. Some months have elapsed since Parliament passed a bill for the development of that portion of the Commonwealth. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> when he was Minister for Home and Territories, visited many parts of the Northern Territory. During that visit he obtained first-hand information, and on his return, in introducing a bill relating to the development of the Territory, he became quite enthusiastic. He then appeared to be earnestly desirous of advancing the interests of the Territory, which, of course, would mean advancing the interests of the whole Commonwealth. But since the introduction of that bill the right honorable senator has adopted a go-slow policy. He has done little or nothing to encourage the development of that vast area. We passed a bill with very great haste, and we were informed that no time would elapse before the North Australia Commission would be appointed. Some months have elapsed, and the Government has not yet made any appointments to that commission. The peopling and development of the Northern Territory should be the first duty, of any Common- . wealth Government, and the appointment of the North Australia Commission should precede the appointment of the Development and Migration Commission. But this Government does not work in that way. Interested persons are extremely anxious that a greater number of migrants should be induced to come to Australia and are, apparently, more concerned about the unemployed in Great Britain than they are in making land available to and finding employment for the Australian people. The Government should appoint the North Australia Commission before the Development and Migration Bill is assented to. This Australian-born Minister led myself and others to believe that he was in earnest in regard to the development of the Northern Territory. He was associated with the Department of Home and Territories for months after the bill was passed by Parliament, but he has fallen down on his job. The department is now in charge of another Minister, and although we were told that the North Australia Commission would supersede the Land Board then and now in existence in. the Northern Territory, that commission has not yet been appointed, and the Land Board is still in existence. I am reliably informed that for months the Land Board has been handicapped because no regulations have been framed under the act which brought it into existence. </para>

                        <para>- The total expenditure in connexion with construction of buildings and roads, engineering services and water boring, is estimated at &#163;106,000, so if the Government proceeded with work in its usual go-slow manner it will take five years to spend &#163;106,000. There is another item, &#34; Construction and filling of petrol tank, &#163;3,000. Although it is the usual practice to obtain detailed information when the bill is in committee, perhaps it would not be out of place to ask the Minister at this stage in what manner and for what purpose this money is to be expended. The vote last year was &#163;17,300 for the construction and filling of petrol tank - there must be only one - and the expenditure was only &#163;14,141. This year&#39;s vote is &#163;3,000. Why the disparity? </para>

                        <para>- I thought that the Minister who moved the second reading of the Bill would reply generally to points raised during the debate. However, I rose mainly to direct public attention again to the fact that little or no work is being done in the Northern Territory by the administration, and to stir the Government to greater activity. I am sincerely desirous of helping in every possible direction all efforts to people and develop the Territory, and I am pained and grieved that hitherto no Government has brought forward a bold, progressive and comprehensive developmental policy for the Territory. I have time and again risen in the Senate, not to embarrass Ministers, but to stimulate them in that effort that, irrespective of party, ought to be made by every administration. I regret that the Minister in whom I had faith and confidence in respect to this matter has proved a disappointment. I thought that, having taken on the task of propounding a progressive policy for the development of the Northern Territory, he would have seen it through, and would do what no other Minister has yet attempted to do. If he- had come forward with such a policy, I am satisfied that no honorable senator in the Labour party would have taken strong exception to it so long as it spelt progress for the Territory. </para>

                    <para>. -  I wish to say a few words in reply to the personal attack which has been made on myself by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> based on rumour and gossip by some person whose name the honorable senator had not the courage to mention, so that &#60;ro might form some judgment as to the value of his testimony. I have already demonstrated that this unnamed slanderer has conveyed an untruth to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> in the allegation repeated by the honorable senator that although the Northern Territory Crown Lands Ordinance was passed some time ago, and a land board appointed, there were no regulations yet in existence, and consequently no leases or licences could be granted, and settlement in the Territory was held up. As I  wa3  the responsible Minister, that was an attack on my ability, not only to hold office but also to carry out a promise I had made to Parliament. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said that he intended it as such. He said that he had had confidence in me, but- that because of these allegations that confidence had been misplaced. Although I have already shown that these regulations have been in existence for six months, and that, therefore, the allegation of the slanderer quoted by the honorable senator is untrue, <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Findley</inline> proceeded to criticize me on further information apparently given to him by this slanderer whose name he will not reveal. It was unworthy of the honorable senator to retail here, without giving the source of his information, the gossip of some one who apparently wishes to damage me. That sort of conduct does not raise the tone of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I also rise to a point of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made the definite statement that some one had said that the Government had made the appointment. He is now qualifying that statement by saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> declared that he had been so informed. There is a great difference between the statement now made by the Minister and his previous statement. </para>

By interjection I said what I repeat now, that the bill was assented to on the4th June, 1926, only a month ago. Of course. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> could pick these commissioners in a few minutes, but Ministers are not so gifted, and require time to make a careful choice. </para>

The people there have no information of the approach of these storms ; they only know that they are the result of air currents. At one time a suggestion was made that the Meteorological Department should exchange meteorological information -with the Dutch authorities in Timor or Java with a view to obtaining advice of approaching storms in order that whatever preparation was possible might be made. On the Queensland coast similar conditions prevail, excepting that there are no neighbouring stations from which advice of approaching storms could be obtained.

                    <para>. - The stock route had a sufficient number of bores at a distance of 20 miles apart, but the complaint was that they were not kept in order. A more efficient system of patrol now exists, and they will not be allowed to get out of order in the future. Complaint was also made in regard to the dips. I understand that one dip was too narrow to take wide-horned cattle, but that it has now been widened. The ether dip has been repaired; and a stock inspector has reported that both are now in good order. </para>

Is the contract system adopted, wherever possible? When works are carried out by day labour abuses  are  apt to creep in. In Western Australia particularly the Government is not  getting  value for the money that it is expending on road construction. In this distant Territory every effort should be made to see that a pound&#39;s worth of work is given for each pound that is expended. </para>

                    <para>. - Very little roadmaking, in the sense in which we understand it in the southern part of Australia, is undertaken in the Northern Territory. The expenditure is almost entirely confined to  the  crossings of rivers and creeks, or sandy patches. In the majority of instances  it  is carried out by the Works and Railways Department in co-operation with the pastoralists whom the roads will  serve.  In some cases the pastoralists themselves engage the labour and carry out the work, and they undoubtedly see that it is done economically. In the central portion of Australia the work is carried out mostly by the police, with native labour. It  has  been found that spinifex makes an excellent crossing, which stands well, whereas a metal crossing would probably be swept away by the first flood. There is no day labour in the true sense of the term in either the north or the centre of the Northern Territory. </para>

As there are very few Government officials in that part of Australia, they are erected at or near a head station, and the pastoralist on whose run they are placed undertakes to keep them in order. They may be used by any travelling stock. All stock that travels along those roads has to be dipped before passing into other States. These are Government dips. </para>

                    <para class="block">The other provision in the bill is for the payment of pensions to the justices of the High Court, present and future, upon the basis set forth in the bill. The basis proposed is the same as that which has already been put before the Senate in connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, except that in this bill there is a provision relating to the pension position after &#34; a judge has attained the age of 70 years. The bill proposes that a pension shall be payable only to a judge who has served for fifteen years, or retires on permanent disability or infirmity after five years&#39; service. The pensions provided for are on the same scale as in the case of justices of the Supreme Court of New South Wales&#39;. In Victoria pensions are provided for Supreme Court judges and County Court judges. In Western Australia and Tasmania, also, there are pensions, but they are not provided for judges in Queensland or South Australia. Judges  in England, Canada, and New Zealand enjoy pensions, and in several cases upon a more generous scale than is provided in the bill. The justices of the High Court are the only public servants of the Commonwealth for whom pensions are not provided. The salaries of the justices were fixed in 1903, and have not since been increased. It has been calculated that these salaries are now worth about &#163;1,700 per annum as compared with the ante-war living conditions. No one would have dreamed before the war of asking a member of the legal profession to accept a position on the High Court Bench at a salary of &#163;1,700 per annum. The present proposal does not deal with the salaries of the justices of the High Court. It is difficult to justify the absence of pensions for Federal justices, in view of. the general principle that pensions are payable to highly placed judges, and the fact that most of the State judges have pension rights. In some respects, the positions of the State judges are more comfortable; they can live more at home, while the Federal judges have to travel very considerably. This bill is, of course, founded upon general considerations of a public character. The present members of the High Court accepted their positions subject to well-understood terms. They cannot claim anything more from the Commonwealth than the terms of their contract give, and have not claimed any more. Accordingly, it is not on any contractual grounds, or on grounds affecting the individual right of members of the High Court, that the bill is brought forward. Under the Constitution, the judges of the High Court, as I pointed out in dealing with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, hold office for life. The decision of the High Court, given in 1918, that High Court justices must be so appointed, did not affect the present members of the bench, who were appointed for life. Accepting the decision that justices of the High Court under the Constitution are necessarily appointed for life, Parliament must face the position that the efficiency of the court may require that it should be possible for judges to retire from their positions with dignity and a relative amount of ease. That&#39; the provision of pensions is &#39; desirable from this point of view is obvious. At present, judges are more ready to accept positions under a State Government than under the Commonwealth Government, for the reason that the State positions carry pensions, and the Commonwealth positions do not. The High Court judgeships should not be in any sense less attractive than any other judgeships in Australia. In this way only can the best men be secured. The bill has been introduced, not for the purpose of honouring any supposed moral or legal obligation to the present members of the High Court, but in order that the High Court shall attract men of the highest ability and standing, and shall enjoy the absolute confidence of the whole of the people of Australia in the discharge of its high and important functions. </para>

                        <para>The object of the bill is to amend the Petroleum Prospecting Act 1926, to enable the expenses incidental to the administration of that act to be charged against the moneys appropriated by the act. Under the act, as it stands, administrative expenses cannot be so charged. The regulations provide for the recipients of a subsidy in aid of boring to enter into an agreement with the Government, which requires them to carry out boring operations in a manner satisfactory to the Minister, to make satisfactory provision for the shutting off of water from the bore, where necessary, and to do other things which the Minister may consider necessary to safeguard the public interest. To enable effective supervision to be exercised over boring operations and a proper check made of claims for reimbursement of expenditure, it is proposed to appoint an inspector, with practical experience of oil fields in other parts of the world, who will be required periodically to visit the various sites at which subsidized boring is being carried out, look into the methods being employed, examine the well logs and other local records, and report thereon to the Minister. The appointment will, of course, be of a temporary character only, and will terminate when subsidized boring operations come to an end. As the act  stands at present, the cost of the inspector&#39;s salary, and other similar administrative expenses, cannot be charged against the petroleum prospecting trust fund. It is considered that such expenses are a fair charge against the fund., and the amending bill will make it possible to charge them to that fund. </para>

This provision regarding lapsing relates only to the appropriations of loan moneys. It does not relate to the authority given by existing Loan Acts for the borrowing of money. The effect of this is that authority still exists for certain moneys to he borrowed under the Loan Act of last year, but moneys so borrowed can bo spent only for the purposes set out in this bill. Towards the programme of loan works for 1926-27, there is a considerable amount of loan money in hand or in sight. These moneys consist of the present loan fund balances and the amounts payable, up to September next, as instalments of the recent London loan of &#163;6,000,000. It will suffice, therefore, if Parliament now gives authority for the Treasurer to borrow &#163;3,500,000 for the purposes of the loan programme for 1926- 27. It is not possible to state now the terms and conditions under which further moneys will be raised for works. I may say, however, that it has been definitely decided to borrow in Australia the amounts required for the Federal Capital, but the time for the raising of this money has not yet been decided. The bill does not provide for conversion or redemption operations in respect of war loans. Authority for dealing with these conversion operations is contained in existing laws, and it is not necessary to include such redemption operations in the annual Loan Bill. The loan requirements under the Migration Agreements are not dealt with in this bill, but are provided for in the bill relating to development and migration, which has passed the Senate. </para>

                <para>Those are the statements of which the right honorable gentleman complained. There is no qualification whatever in the rest of my speech. If there is, I cannot see it. I now wish &#39; to direct the attention of the Senate to the statement of the Minister in replying to the debate on the second reading of the bill. He. said that the Government had entered into no legal obligations in connexion with the matter, leaving the dear inference, by a process of exclusion, that some obligation had been entered into. He went further, and said that, in embarking upon a project of this kind, it was necessary that the Government should have in mind some suitable persons for the positions. I do not say that they are the Minister&#39;s exact words, but they contain the substance of what he conveyed to the Senate. </para>

That is borne I out by the honorable senator&#39;s quoted i statement that he had been in- 3 formed. I referred to his&#39; statement because the Government had been - criticized, on the one hand, for delaying i the appointment of the members of the &#91; North Australia Commission, and, on  the other, was also being criticized because it had practically entered into an obligation to make a certain appointment under the Development and Migration Bill before it had been passed. That was the sense in which 1 referred to the honorable senator&#39;s statement. I did not make any complaint. </para>
