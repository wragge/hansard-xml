                    <para>. -  I cannot accept the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline> because it would seriously affect the production of pig iron in Australia. During recent years large quantities of scrap iron have entered the Commonwealth, the quantity last year being approximately  25,000  tons. It consisted chiefly of old railway chairs, most of which came from Belgium. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> advocates this reduction of duty in the interests of the copper mining industry; but he has given the committee no information, regarding the quantity of scrap iron used in winning the copper obtained in Australia. We must not lose sight of the fact that another branch of the Australian mining industry is affected. A large number of men are employed in winning the necessary iron ore, coal, and the various fluxes needed in the process of smelting. If this request be agreed to, it will not only reduce the quantity of iron and steel produced in Australia, but will also throw a large number of men out of employment. Imported scrap iron comes here chiefly as ships&#39; ballast, on which no freight is paid. I submit that the duty proposed in the schedule is reasonable. In making the duty the same on both pig iron and scrap iron, the Government is following the example of the United States of America, Canada, and France. To lower the duty, as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline> would not be fair to the Australian iron and steel industry. I therefore ask honorable senators to vote against the request. </para>

                    <para>. - I am supporting the request made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline> in the belief that the importation of this commodity will not result, as the Minister would have us believe, in a curtailment of employment or interference with the Australian iron industry. For the information of honorable senators who look to the Tariff Board to guide them in these matters, I point out that, some time ago, the board recommended that scrap iron be permitted to enter free. Those who are objecting to this duty, which by the way is imposed for the first time, point out that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company in support of its application to the Tariff Board submitted figures designed to suit its own ends. That company took 1918 as its starting point. Importations in that year totalled 374 tons. We all know that shortly after the outbreak of war shipping services were so dislocated that it was impossible to import pig iron, the available shipping space being required for more important purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I believe the Minister&#39;s statement is correct, and as it is imported as ballast we are told it interferes with the sale of local scrap iron in the Commonwealth. The answer to that is that, during the war, the whole of the Commonwealth was ransacked for anything in the shape of scrap iron, so that there is hardly any left in Australia. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company advised the Tariff Board that importations of scrap iron were in an ascending scale from 1918, when they totalled 374 tons, until 1924-25, -when they were 17,000 tons. But that company, as I have stated, selected the most favorable period for its basis of comparison. I wish now to present the other side of the case, and to give figures dealing with importations over a much longer period. My information is that in 1906 our importations of this very necessary raw materia&#93; totalled 16.097 tons - practically the same as last year. In 1907 they were 14,533 tons; in 1908, 14,781 tons; and so on, until the year before the war, when they were 22,554 tons. Then they fell away to 1,220 tons in 1916-17, to 146 tons in 1917-18, and rose again to 374 tons in 1918-19. The Tariff Board, being busy with various matters, I presume, did not have time to examine the figures dealing with the imports over a longer period than that selected by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and, therefore, the case for the duty on scrap iron was determined on an entirely false basis. </para>

                        <para>- In the interests of economy, yes; because, as I have stated, if they cannot get and command an adequate supply they will be obliged to smelt iron twice to get a raw material of the proper texture. As for the argument that the proposed duty will shut out importations, I have only to remind honorable senators that before the war the price of scrap iron was from &#163;3 to  &#163;3 10s. a tori. It then rose to &#163;14 and &#163;15 a ton, with the result that manufacturers ransacked the Commonwealth for any kind of scrap iron that could be obtained. It was even good business to purchase old machinery plants and break them up for scrap iron. This should be conclusive proof that the proposed duty will not prevent importations. Its only effect will be to increase the price of the locally-manufactured articles to the user. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The users will have this commodity irrespective of the duties imposed. Those honorable senators who have already proclaimed their willingness to tone down the tariff and to agree to reasonable adjustments between the two sections should now act up to their professions. In this instance I expect to have the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> and several other honorable senators who have so freely expressed the opinion that many of the duties in the schedule are excessive. When will these honorable senators cease throwing sticks at the Government, toe the mark and square opinion and precept? It is about time they made a start. This industry is being handicapped without any reason whatever. I believe that scrap iron comes to Australia as ballast, as the Minister suggests,_ or, if not, at a nominal charge; but if it does, the ships bringing it out pick up return cargoes at lower rates, and thus primary producers are indirectly assisted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I believe we did. I am opposing this item because I think it is about time we started to assert our strength, and show that wc possess independent judgment. The time has arrived when the Senate should no longer be a body which merely revises the work of another place, but should be one in which independent opinions are expressed in the interests of the whole of the people. We should not accept everything that comes from another place as a preordained message that cannot be improved upon or departed from in any way. We should exercise our own judgment in the interests of the people who send us here. I am supporting the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline> and hope that an effective step will now be taken to place the schedule on a commonsense basis. </para>

                    <para>. - If there is in Australia one industry more than another which must be regarded as a key industry, it is that of the production of iron and steel. This is one direction in which protection is given to the Australian iron and steel industry which must live if the Commonwealth is to prosper. Every blow, however small, struck at this industry endangers our national existence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has apparently gone to some trouble to obtain the figures relating to the importations of scrap iron and steel prior to 1914, but I submit that such figures have no bearing whatever upon the present position, as at that time the iron and steel industry in Australia was established in a comparatively small way. The works of Hoskins Limited at Lithgow were in existence, but they were not such a large concern as they are to-day, and the magnificent works of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company at Newcastle were not then established. These two great concerns are  now able to supply the whole of Australia with her requirements of iron and steel. </para>

                <para>Iron ore used in the manufacture of pig iron is obtained from Iron Knob, in South Australia, and Tasmania also benefits, because certain commodities used in the manufacture of that product are brought from that State. Other States also benefit in consequence of the establishment of the iron and steel industries at Newcastle and Lithgow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> said that, in order to enable the copper-mining industry to continue, scrap iron and steel should be permitted to come into the Commonwealth duty free. For the year 1924-5 Victoria, where there is no copper-mining industry at all, used 11,534 tons, or 53 per cent, of the total importations; and New South Wales, where there is a large copper-refining industry, imported only 3,154 tons, or 151 per cent, of the total. The copper industry in New South Wales was therefore able to carry on effectively without the importation of scrap iron from overseas. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, it will be seen that it is unnecessary to import scrap iron and steel in order to assist the copper-mining industry. In Queensland, tie State to which I presume <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> was particularly referring, and where a good deal of work is done in producing raw copper, only 3,084 tons, or 14&#163; per cent, of the total imports, were used. It does not appear, therefore, that Queensland found it impossible to carry on the copper-mining industry in the absence of an unlimited supply of scrap iron. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. South Australia used 2,095 tons, or 9&#163; per cent. ; Western Australia, 1,356- tons, or 6&#163; per cent. ; and Tasmania, 246 tons, or 1 per cent., of the total imports. These figures show that the Government is justified in opposing the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson.</inline> The industry in New South Wales, where copper-refining is extensively undertaken, has. not applied for the free admission of scrap iron and steel. I understand that Western Australia has raised some objection, but the quantity used in that State is only small, and consequently there is scarcely any room for complaint. South Australia has exported scrap iron in fairly large quantities, and consequently there can be no shortage in that State. The dismantling of many of the plants on Western Australian mines has resulted in a good deal of the machinery being broken up, and I am informed that there is more scrap iron available in that State than is required to meet local needs. In these circumstances, I do not think Western Australia is likely to suffer by the imposition of a duty such as the Government propose. As Tasmania uses very little scrap iron, it is not very much concerned in the proposed duty. All the facts are in favour of the proposals of the Government, and, seeing that we desire to maintain our great key industry on a sound basis and proper footing, I hope that all the duties in the schedule affecting the manufacture of iron and steel will be maintained, because they are absolutely essential if that industry is to become what we hope it will be. </para>

                    <para>. - The admission of scrap iron free would not make the slightest difference to the great iron and steel industry, nor would it build up the copper-mining industry. I can pay a tribute to the iron and steel industry. To my own knowledge, Broken Hill structural steel has been sold in Queensland at &#163;5 5s. a .ton. less than the landed cost of similar steel from overseas. This fact proves that a duty of &#163;1 a ton on scrap iron will not make the slightest difference to the operations of the Broken Hill Proprietary&#39;s iron and steel works. On the other hand, the admission of scrap iron free of duty would be of some slight assistance to the copper-mining industry. Unfortunately, at die present time, most of the copper mines  in Australia are closed down, but there are still some of them working, and they use a large quantity of scrap iron in leaching their copper. It is with a view to getting some slight assistance for them that I ask for this small reduction of duty. I do not think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> was correct in stating that pig iron is brought to Australia freight free. Scrap iron may occasionally be brought here freight free, and I have my doubts on that point, but I have had to pay freight on pig iron. </para>

We have the assurance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that scrap iron is essentia&#93; in the production of the highest class steel. There is no evidence in  the  Tariff Board&#39;s report to that effect, but I should like to know from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> if the Broken Hill and Lithgow works use scrap iron in the production of their steel, because, if so, one could understand a desire on their part to crush the smaller foundries, which are practically using nothing else but scrap iron. In the absence of that information, I feel inclined to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson&#39;s</inline> request. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will see that the greatest cut in price is made in respect of-inch tubing, which represents about 90 per cent, of our total requirements. The tubing manufactured in Australia into conduit pipes for electric light and telephone services is imported in sheets. Acceptance of my request will not increase the cost of British tubing, but it will place a heavier duty on German tubing. As the price of Australian tubing is regulated by the price paid for &#39; the raw material imported from Great Britain, from which it is manufactured, honorable senators will . see that the Australian and the British industries are interdependent; that any loss in trade is felt by both countries. The quality of Australian-made tubing is recognized as at least equal to that of imported tubing. Moreover, existing Australian factories are capable of producing tubing sufficient to meet double <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> present requirements. The sum of &#163;100,000 has been invested in plant for the manufacture of this tubing in Australia. If this trade is lost, that plant will be useless for any other purpose. </para>

                <para class="block">In the previous tariff cream separators were free British, 5 per cent, intermediate, 10 per cent, general. This  schedule removes the British preference, though in tariff matters our policy is to give Britain, if possible, a preference of 12&#189; per cent. When the schedule was framed, the only cream separators on the Australian market were of Swedish manufacture. Since then two British concerns have come on to the Australian market. One machine, known as the Lister cream separator, is a particularly good article, low in price, and well suited to Australian requirements. </para>

                        <para>- No. Britain is endeavouring to re-establish herself in the Australian market, and, wherever possible, we have consistently given British manufacturers a preference over foreign competitors. I understand that already orders for 200 of these British cream separators have been placed in Western Australia, and that several hundred have been ordered in the other States also. Since our policy is to give Britain a preference of 12&#189; per cent., we should, in this item, assist British manufacturers by restoring to them that measure of protection which they enjoyed prior to the introduction of this schedule. </para>

                        <para>- It is impossible for the Minister to argue in that way, just as it is impossible for him to assume that future requirements can be estimated on the figures for the past two years. During the war British manufacturers had to go out of the Australian market altogether. They have now come on to the market again, and we are justified in believing that there will not, in the future, be the old frenzied desire to purchase Swedish cream separators as against the British machines. It is not fair to expect Britain to compete in the Australian market against Swedish manufacturers, who have practically had a monopoly of the business during the war. We can give this small preference to Britain without in any way prejudicing the interests of the local consumer. I do not think that the imposition of the general tariff will lead to an increase in the price of the machines. On the contrary, it is probable that, as British manufacturers will be in a better position to meet Swedish competition, they may be able to cut their prices. Possibly Swedish manufacturers will follow, and the Australian dairy farmers may get a cheaper machine. </para>

                    <para>. -  We are getting enlightenment in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> has informed us that two British manufacturers of cream separators have placed their products on the Australian markets, and that they will be content with a preference of 10 per cent. Last week we were considering tariff protection for some British manufactures up to the dizzy limit. I am wondering now why the manufacturers of these cream separators are to be left out in the cold, so to speak, whilst their fellow manufacturers are being treated so favorably. Another interesting feature is that, as far as I am aware, these British manufacturers have not approached any other honorable senator with a request for this preference. </para>

                        <para>- We now learn that two honorable senators have been approached. I have some of these machines on my place, and I am thoroughly satisfied with them, but I have no knowledge of having been asked at any time to vote for tariff protection against foreign competitors. From this it would almost appear to be an inspiration on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> to ask tariff favours for people who have not gone to the trouble of approaching other members of the Senate. My experience is that, if a manufacturer wishes to get any tariff protection, about the first thing he does is to write to some one in authority. Obviously, the British manufacturers of cream separators must be satisfied with their prospects on the Australian market, or we should have heard from them. The Minister has told us that he cannot accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan&#39;s</inline> proposal, and that the Government intends to expose the British manufacturers of these necessary machines to the fierce blast of foreign competition. This is not the Government&#39;s attitude in respect of other items, which give British manufacturers a preference of from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent. In the circumstances, I should like to know why the manufacturers of cream separators in Britain can hold their own. By all the rules of the game, judging by our experience in other items, they should be in need of preferential treatment. And yet they have approached no one in this chamber except <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> ! It is refreshing to know that some British manufacturers, at all events, cau hold their own, and that they regard a preferential tariff of 10 per cent, as adequate. We are about to consider the tariff on mining machinery, in which, I should like honorable senators to note, the British manufacturers are given preferences reaching to 40 per cent. Apparently the dairying industry is to go scot free, whilst the mining industry, which is of equal if not greater importance to the Commonwealth, is to be penalized. It is about time  we  held the scales fairly between the different interests, and if the dairymen are to be allowed to import the implements they use free of duty, the tools of trade used in mining should also be admitted free. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. We cannot now enter into an intricate economic argument as to the effect of duties upon prices. One set of economists contends that lower duties result in reduced prices, and another that they have the opposite effect. I am inclined to support the latter contention. A preferential duty of 10 per cent., we are told, is sufficient. </para>

We have, however, to consider our own people. I am opposing the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> and for once arn supporting the Minister in his laudable endeavour to give this form of primary industry a chance, in the hope that he will adopt a similar statesmanlike attitude when the tools of trade required in the mining industry are under consideration. </para>

                    <para>.- Until recently the British manufacturers have been unable to place cream separators on I he Australian market at a price that enabled them to successfully compete with the Swedish machines; but during the last two years the Lister cream-separator has been successfully marketed in Australia, and is, I understand, giving entire satisfaction. Under the 1921 tariff British manufacturers received considerable preference, when the Government of the day contended that it was the duty of Parliament to recognize the fairness  of  giving Great Britain greater benefits over other countries. I am, therefore, surprised  to  find that the small degree  of  preference then afforded is to be eliminated. The introduction of the British separator has been beneficial to the Australian dairymen, and as the British product is  of  excellent quality it appears to me that if we remove the small degree of preference, competition will &#39;be destroyed and prices raised. As Sweden does not purchase any of our butter, and Great Britain is one of our best customers, it is unfair to continue to handicap Great Britain by imposing heavy duties against her manufactures, and at the same time expect her to purchase our produce at the highest possible prices. Surely it is reasonable to grant this degree of protection with the object of helping Great Britain to recover the trade she  lost  during the war when she gave up everything in order to assist the weaker nations. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am rather surprised at the lack  of  consideration which certain honorable senators are showing those engaged in the dairying industry. The position would  be  entirely different  if  the preference would  be  of arty substantial advantage to British manufacturers.  In  1919-20 the value  of  British cream separators imported was &#163;12,654, and  of  other machines &#163;90,862. Last year the value  of  British importations was &#163;8,669, out  of  importations valued at &#163;177,870. From these figures <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> will  be  seen that the British  manufacturers of  cream separators  are  not holding their own, notwithstanding a preference of 10 per cent. given under a previous tariff. To impose an additional charge of &#163;17,000 upon dairymen for the benefit of British manufacturers is unreasonable. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot give any such assurance. As there does not appear to be any possibility of cream separators being manufactured in Australia for some years, this is an effort on the part of the Government to assist primary producers by removing the preferential duty and making the item free. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> are asking the committee to impose upon dairymen a penalty which is altogether disproportionate to the benefit which British manufacturers would receive. </para>

                    <para>. - In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott&#39;s</inline> inquiry concerning the cost, I should like to say that all manufacturers add the duty to the cost of their machines, and when duties are decreased or removed prices are reduced accordingly. If the 10 per cent, preferential duty is removed as is suggested, the dairymen will benefit. In the past, Swedish manufacturers have produced a machine that is pre-eminently satisfactory, and naturally Australian dairymen are likely to continue using machines which have always given satisfaction. I yield to no one in my desire to assist British manufacturers, but we have also to consider the interests of Australian dairvmen. I believe that the Minister is correct in saying that the dairymen will benefit under this proposal, and in this instance I intend to support the Government. </para>

                <para class="block">The alteration proposed by the Minister does not altogether meet my wishes. The Britishpreferential duty of 35 per cenv.. would still remain the same. It would handicap not only Western Australia, but also Queensland and South Australia, whose road development is not as advanced as that of Victoria and New South Wales. In another place the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten),</inline> who is the mouthpiece of the Government in tariff matters, and the member of the Cabinet most in touch with the Tariff Board, determined, apparently, after learning the view of that board, that the British duty should be 30 per cent., although next day he reverted to the higher rate. I think we ought to realize the effect this heavy duty is likely to have on the development of the States I have named. The Commonwealth proposes to advance &#163;20,000,000 to the States to enable them to proceed with a policy of road development. It is a policy upon which the Western Australian Government embarked many years ago. It was inaugurated by the Mitchell Government, and is being ; ccontinued by the Collier Government, which is eager to take advantage of the assistance that will be afforded by the expenditure of the money, advanced by the Commonwealth. In carrying , out its policy it will need adequate roadmaking machinery. A protective duty of 27&#163; per cent, is, I think, quite sufficient for the local manufacturers of this class of machinery. I said on the second reading that I was not in favour of protection run mad, and I am sure that those who are protectionists at heart, and believe in the encouragement of Australian industries, must realize that it is a reasonable request to reduce the Brtish  preferential duty on stone-crushing and road-making machines which are so essential to the road development policies of the States. </para>

                    amendment would be to reduce the duty, so far as British imports are concerned, hy 7&#163; per cent., a mere trifle that is not worthy of mention. The Government has an overwhelming majority of supporters, and even the bulk of honorable senators on the Opposition side support it in its high tariff revenue policy. It seems, therefore, that it would be a waste of time to labour the subject. I am glad, however, to see a lifelong protectionist like
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline>
                    receiving some of his own medicine. When this tariff is applied to Western Australia, he naturally squeals. But let him squeal as loudly as he likes. I am informed by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures &#39; of Australia that for the year ended the 30th June, 1924, there were 1,343 foundries and engineering works in Australia employing 33,052 hands, and paying iu wages &#163;6,949,295. The value of the plant and buildings was &#163;10,918,919, and the value of output &#163;24,151,439. With reference to roadmaking machinery and plant, we are told that there are over twenty manufacturers specializing in this work and over 1,000 hands are employed; whilst from inquiries made it is found that prices have been reduced, and not increased, by the new duties. It is a matter of indifference to me whether the duty is 27^ per cent., 30 per cent., or 35 per cent. I do not know that I am prepared to adopt the view expressed by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures that a reduction in duty will lead to a reduction in prices. That may or may not be the case; it is evident that quantities of this machinery will still be imported into the Commonwealth. The Minister in charge of the bill assures us occasionally that the object of the measure is to assist local manufactures where it is commercially possible to produce particular articles in Australia, by penalizing by means of an import duty any goods that may arrive from abroad. It is useless to discuss the matter further, in view of the opinions held by honorable senators. We find that the Government can win on an important matter such as the increased tax on imported whisky, and even an ardent freetrader such as
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>
                    supports them! I am pleased to hear the protest by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline>
                    who assists in representing Western Australia, where it is alleged that many thousands of miles of road construction are required. The imposition of the increased duty will, no doubt, lead to an increase in the cost of production, and as soon as the workmen can reach the Arbitration Court they will certainly ask for an increase in wages. Next year, probably, the Minister will invite honorable senators to grant a duty of 50 per cent, or more on this machinery. The idea behind these duties is not to exclude foreign goods, but to produce revenue. Australia, however, cannot be made prosperous by the taxing of imported goods. Some time ago we saw the disgraceful exhibition of the various State Premiers quarrelling over the distribution of the Customs revenue. Next year, under this tariff, there will probably be &#163;42,000,000 to divide between the Commonwealth and the States. We may as well support the schedule, and let the Minister have the bill.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline>
                    has been converted, and now recognizes the folly of unduly increasing the tariff. I agree with him that some protection is needed for an industry which, according to the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, has twenty factories specializing in the work and over 1,000 persons employed. But surely 27^ per cent, is sufficient. Any greater duty w.ould merely hamper production and retard the development of the resources of the country generally. It is universally recognized that the provision of good roads is of paramount importance to Australia. As
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline>
                    remarked, the Commonwealth is setting aside &#163;20,000,000 for that purpose. We know that the State Governments will be voting large sums in addition, but the money will not go very far because of the heavy, and I may say unduly heavy, cost of road making in Australia. We shall simply make that charge heavier still by increasing the duties on road-making machinery. Here is surely a case where proper discrimination should be shown by the Government. Apart from that phase of the subject, however, I should think that the industry could carry on with the protection it already has. If not, it points to either inefficiency or the suggestion that those carrying on the industry are anxious to make undue profits. In any case, surely the provision of good roads in Australia is of infinitely greater importance than the establishment and maintenance by artificial means of the industry of manufacturing road-making machinery. The Government, nevertheless, declares that these manufacturers must be bolstered up. For many years, firms in South Australia have been able to compete successfully with outside manufacturers with a duty very much less than that now in operation, and they should certainly be able to continue to do so. I suppose that every member of the committee has received protests from local governing bodies throughout Australia, and I do not wonder that they have complained, considering the heavy cost of road making and the fact that the proposed increase of duty will tend to make it more expensive  than ever. These protests indicate that public opinion is becoming more enlightened on this subject. In the present case, I think that the Government ought to accept the amendment. We have a circular from the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, which simply sets out the number of employers and employees engaged in the industry. But there is no proof that further protection is necessary to maintain it. I very much doubt whether further protection is required, and in any case I claim that the provision of good roads is of infinitely greater importance than the maintenance of this industry.

                    <para>. - I did not address the committee when this item was called on, because the general arguments that I used in my second-reading speech apply to practically the whole of the proposed increases. While wages&#39; have been falling in many other countries during the past two or three years, they have been rising in Australia. I am not one of those who think that high wages are an evil in any country. </para>

                        <para>- In Great Britain and elsewhere they have dropped considerably during the last two or three years, and that fact has given the manufacturers of machinery and other goods in Great Britain and other countries an advantage over the Australian manufacturer. This item includes, not only road-making machinery, but also machinery employed in the production of cement. They are included under the one heading, because the same machine that will break metal into the size required for road making is used in the manufacture of cement. A reduction in duty of 7&#163; per cent, would not have a substantial effect in reducing thu cost of road making.. It is not the price of machinery, but the rate of wages, that materially affects the cost of road making. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> has told us that twenty firms in Australia are engaged in manufacturing the machinery covered by thu item. My information is that the number of firms is about 30. </para>

                    <para>. - If ever there was a philosopher among the members of the human family, it was the poet who wrote &#34;Hope springs eternal in the human breast.&#34; What has been our experience hitherto ? Every effort to make this tariff schedule something like a reasonable and scientific instrument has been opposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> ; but on this occasion the honorable senator asks the committee to revert to the duty under the 1921 tariff. I do not suggest that he is actuated by any desire to please those bodies which have circulated their views among honorable senators. Unfortunately, I am too responsive to public opinion, and therefore I frequently find myself in an awkward position. I have received so many letters from local governing bodies regarding the duty on this class of machinery that I have been tempted to ask for additional pigeon-hole accommodation. These local bodies have besought me to urge a reduction of duty in respect of road-making machinery ; and being responsive to public opinion, with a high sense of public duty, I am found on this occasion supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> request, although by all the rules of the game he does not deserve my support. Hitherto, when I have tried to shape the tariff in the direction which he now suggests, he has given me no support. Now I am heaping coals of fire on his head. When necessary articles of wearing apparel - the caps, socks, and stockings worn by the poorer classes, when they can afford them - were under consideration I endeavoured to reduce the duty: but I received not even a look or a sneeze of sympathy from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> Yet he now asks me to support him in his request. </para>

                        <para>- Realizing that sooner or later I must answer to the local authorities to which I have referred, I cannot turn a deaf ear to their request that I urge a reduction in the duty on this item. But, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is different ! It is a mere coincidence that he has taken the lead in this matter ! On this occasion also we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> agreeing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> I am glad to find that honorable senator squaring his actions with his public utterances. I shall endeavour to see that both honorable senators continue to follow the precedent which they have established in this instance. If a duty of 27&#189; per cent, is sufficient to protect the manufacturers of the machinery required for making our roads, it should be sufficient in other instances. I welcome Senators Needham and Barwell into the fold. I do so the more heartily because I realize that their action on this occasion has nothing whatever to do with the public clamour for reduced duties on road-making machinery ! I am the only one who might be expected to acquiesce in the demand made by an influential section of the community ! Because these honorable senators at the eleventh hour and 59th minute have seen the light, I rejoice. I should now like them to go further, and wipe out entirely the existing preference to Great Britain. That preference is not in favour of Great Britain; it is in the interests of the Commonwealth Treasury. That fact is evident when we realize that for the year 1923-24 our total importations of road-making machinery - and that heading covers a big list of machines - were valued at only &#163;19,000. Nearly all that machinery came from the United States of America; that which came from Britain was valued at &#163;47 only. During 1924-25 our importations of this class of machinery were valued at &#163;7,000, British machines representing &#163;18 only. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> having, in response to the call of duty, taken the first step, should go further, and remove entirely the preferential tariff. I shall support the Minister in any attempt to raise the duty on luxuries; but on essential articles of clothing, and for the machinery necessary to give Australia good roads, I shall not support higher duties merely for the sake of obtaining additional revenue. Most of the road-making machinery which comes here is made in the United States of America, where they have specialized in making good roads in new country. Britain, with her existing good roads, was not confronted with the same necessity for inventing this class of machinery. I ask the Senate to support the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline></para>

                    <para>. -  Any honorable senator engaged, as I for some time have been, in an endeavour to discover some system in this protective tariff, would find sufficient in this item alone to discourage him. We have here one of the greatest anomalies in connexion with the tariff. First, we have the Federal Government expressing its intention to spend, during the next nineteen years, a large sum of money on road construction in Australia; and then we have the Tariff Board, or whoever is responsible, placing this obstacle in the way. To me it is utterly incomprehensible. Yet the Minister has given us no explanation. No evidence has been adduced to show that the people who are engaged in the manufacture of road-making machinery in Australia cannot carry on profitably with a duty of  27&#189;  per cent. Nor has there been any evidence in support of a differentiation between this and other classes of machinery justifying an additional  7&#189;  per cent, being added in this case. I have repeatedly endeavoured to ascertain the true meaning of the term &#34;commercially manufactured in Australia,&#34; but invariably those whom I have questioned have evaded a direct reply. It has not been shown that roadmaking machinery cannot be commercially manufactured in Australia. Personally, I believe that it can be made here on a commercial basis. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to refer to the honorary statistician to this Senate, a gentleman whose figures are always based upon the latest available records. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who carries out his duties as statistician in a thorough and systematic manner, necessitating the burning of much midnight oil. He has pointed out that in one industry the wages paid in Great Britain are better than those paid in the same industry in Australia. They are better because the workers there put their heart into their work. If the policy now advocated is persisted in, we shall be told year after year that, for this industry to survive, increased duties will be necessary; and merely on the strength of a general statement the duties will, no doubt, be increased. This tariff is being put through on general statements. There has been no information relating specifically to the items under discussion. That is not good enough for me. I do not believe that road-making machinery cannot be commercially made in Australia under existing conditions. I believe that the action taken by the Tariff Board, or the Minister for Trade and Customs, is a contravention of the principle underlying the Government&#39;s proposal to make money available for the construction of good roads, which it considers are essential to the proper development of Australia. Are the interests of the people who are employed in this industry to be compared with the interests of the hundreds of thousands of settlers on the land, who are really the backbone of the country, and on whom our future prosperity and advancement depend ? What are the interests of the few compared with the interests of the many for whom cheap road-making machinery is essential? There is not the slightest justification for differentiation between cement-making and roadmaking machinery. Judging from&#39; the experience of the United States of America, which of all countries has adopted the most scientific, method of road-making, the tendency is towards cement roads. Anything that will relieve the present position should be done. Furthermore, I do not believe for a moment, that this item, if carried in the present form, will benefit any people except employees in this particular industry. I do not want to make any suggestion as to why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has moved his amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying that they are exclusively engaged in that work. But they are engaged in the manufacture of this class of machinery, and I think that most honorable senators will agree that 27&#189; per cent. British tariff is heavy enough. I have taken the trouble to inquire as to the freight charges on this class of machinery, and I find that it very closely approximates the amount of duty; in other words, that a tariff protection of 27&#189; per cent. British plus the natural protection in the shape of sea freights is equivalent to a protection of over 50 per cent. The freight charges on many commodities may be estimated from 10 per cent, to 12&#189; per cent.; but roadmaking machinery is in a different category. Very often the freight charges exceed the amount of duty. These machines are absolutely essential for the proper development of Australia. I happen to live in a State where, owing to the broken nature of the country, the cost of development is, I suppose, infinitely higher than elsewhere in the Commonwealth. I can remember the time when it was possible to make a decent macadamized road for &#163;700 a mile. To-day the cost is double that sum. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know; but I do know that because of the heavier traffic now passing over Australian roads it is absolutely essential that every local governing authority, and every State Government that is responsible for road construction, should be able to purchase as cheaply as possible all road-making machinery. Any attempt to increase the cost of these machines, by means of the tariff, should be resented by the people of Australia. If I thought that Australian manufacturers of this class of machinery could not carry on under the 1921 tariff, I should hesitate to object to the proposed increase; but I am satisfied that they are well able to continue the industry. I cannot estimate what the proposed increases will amount to in the aggregate. All I know is that the increased duties will add to the cost of these machines. For this reason, I intend to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - I find myself troubled with the grouping of the various machines included in this sub-item, so I shall confine my remarks to cement-making, road-making, and stone-crushing machines. In my opinion, hand-operated travelling and portable cranes, coal conveyors, and ash -handling plant are in a different category. The question of the efficacy of this class of machinery made in Australia has been raised in this debate. It seems to me that we are in the transition stage from rail traction to road traction, and that every support should be given in the various State Parliaments, and also by this Parliament, to those charged with the responsibility of road-construction. If we are to judge the success of roadmaking machines manufactured in Australia by the condition of the roads, we find in my own State, and also in portions of New South Wales that I have visited, we can only come to the conclusion that we know very little, if anything, about the business. I have been in touch lately with some people from the United States of America, who take an intelligent and scientific interest <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> road-construction. They advise me that Australian methods are little short of lamentable ; that our roads will never stand up to the traffic that has to pass over them. Unfortunately, in outlying portions of the country, at all events, there appears to be an entire absence of the application of scientific principles to road construction. We are about to develop a new province in the Northern Territory. I do not know who is going to pay the duty on road-making machines that will be required for developmental work there - I notice that one illustrious member of another place has suggested that instead of building railways, the whole of the traction should be on roads to be constructed - but in view of all the facts, we should strongly oppose the imposition of any duties that may lead to an increase in their cost to Australian users. For this reason, I am supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline></para>

Something must be done for the development of our country areas, and road-making seems to me to be the most important. In much of our Mallee country, it is utterly impossible at certain times of the year, except under great difficulties, to do any carting, and very little stone is obtainable for road-making. We should approach the consideration of this item with an earnest desire to do our best for the development of our vast outlying areas. Road-making seems to be the best way to ensure it3 satisfactory development. In the circumstances, I feel that the 1921 tariff of 27&#189; per cent. British is the one which we should support. As far as I can learn, the industry seems to have made substantial headway. It has kept its head well above water. Whether the item is of such importance as to justify the circulation of a vast wealth of literature, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> words, from municipal and other local governing bodies protesting against the increased duties, is another matter, but surely some attention should be paid to their needs. </para>

We who represent the more benighted, and certainly the more neglected, portions of the Commonwealth, view these proposed increases differently. Surely those who purchase and use road-making and cement-making machines ought to know whether the proposed duties will be instrumental in increasing the cost. We should turn a deaf ear to those who say that higher duties will lead to reduced prices. As a protectionist, I cannot accept such a statement. </para>

                        <para>- It may be the policy of some manufacturers to reduce their prices temporarily; but municipal bodies who have control of the roads in most of the States believe that the cost of road-making machinery will be increased by these duties. Why should we who are developing the cement-making industry in this country, and using the most suitable stone for cement-making to be found anywhere, simply rest on our oars and decline to encourage the introduction of machinery that will assist in the production of cement at an advantageous price, and provide us with better roads, cheaper traction, and more satisfactory development. I regret to find that, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> a great deal of the road-making machinery now coming into Australia is imported from America. That may be so. I know of no finer roads than those of old England. </para>

                        <para>- Those I have in mind were made, not by the Romans, but by Britons. They are bituminous roads scientifically constructed principally of Trinidad asphalt, which is a British product. Machinery is playing a more important part in the development of roads in the Old World than the Minister would have us believe, but it may be that American machinery is more adaptable to the roads being constructed there. Our development is more likely to be in the direction of cement roads than is the case in America, although there are some in that country constructed entirely of cement. The development of Australian roads has not been altogether satisfactory, and, apart from Tasmania, I know of no State in which we can say we have even what are classified in England as B or second-grade roads. I do not intend to support reducing the preference to Britain, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> but will support the request moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham).</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Australia. Until a few years ago railways were chiefly used for the transport of goods and for handling a great deal of the passenger traffic, but to-day other rapid means of transport are provided, and consequently roads are becoming a greater necessity. I intend to support a reduction in the proposed duties, because the present roads should be con-. 8tructed as efficiently and cheaply as possible. Some honorable senators who have questioned the methods of roadmaking at present adopted have blamed our engineers for faulty road construction; but with that I do not agree, as we have in Australia road engineers quite as capable as those in any other part of the world. It is a question of money; the more funds available, the better the road. The difficulties experienced in Australia have been due to the length of the roads, that it has been necessary to construct, the inferior quality of the material sometimes used, and the prohibitive cost of modern plant. In Tasmania, 400 or 500 road contracts are let every year; much of the work is necessarily undertaken by small municipalities with limited means, or by small gangs. In these circumstances, the use of modern appliances is impossible. Several municipalities in Tasmania - which are similar to the shire councils in Victoria - have endeavoured to obtain modern road-making machinery, but have found the cost prohibitive. I visited one factory in Victoria where road-making plant is manufactured, and although I could find no fault with the machinery manufactured or the methods employed, I could easily understand that the price at which it was sold was far too high for many of those who desired to purchase it. Thousands of miles of roads in Australia have never been rolled at all. In thousands of places 12 inches of mud has been thrown aside, 9 inches of metal thrown in, and a small quantity of Windings placed over it, no attempt whatever being made to consolidate it, simply because the cost of road-rollers is too high. Australian industries should be protected, but, in my opinion, a duty of 27V per cent. should be sufficient, in this case, particularly when there is a heavy natural protection, which in the case of a road roller or tractor would be considerable. 1 believe in duties on items such as this being reduced to the lowest possible level, in order to assist road construction, which is so essential to Australian development. Visiting different parts of Australia, I have been  brought  into close contact with the difficulties experienced by settlers in the out-back country, who are put to considerable expense and inconvenience in transporting their produce over inferior roads. Good roads are a veritable godsend, and our primary producers, who are usually referred to as the backbone of the country, should be assisted by allowing local governing bodies to obtain modern road-making machinery at the lowest possible price. </para>

                    <para>.- Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> said that it would be useless for the Queensland local governing bodies to approach the Minister with a request for reduced duties on road-making machinery, it is rather significant that I, as a representative of that State, which has just embarked on an extensive roads programme, have not received such a request. As a Protectionist, I realize that it is necessary to manufacture roadmaking and cement-making machinery in the Commonwealth, and at the same time to do everything possible to improve our Australian roads. After having travelled over many miles of Australian roads, I believe those in Queensland are worse than those in any. other part of the Commonwealth. A great deal has been said concerning the machinery employed in road-making ; but let us consider the facts. Many of the local governing bodies do not possess road rollers, which are most important in construction work. Since the higher protective duties have been in force the local manufacturers have reduced their prices. Imported road-making machinery can now be landed in Australia at <inline font-style="italic">1^</inline> per cent, above the price f.o.b. London. A good deal of the road-making plant in use in Queensland and Victoria is controlled by a Roads Board, or similar body, and as it can be moved from place to place it is employed throughout the year. According to the Chamber of Manufactures, there are 20 factories in Australia manufacturing road-making machinery in which over 1,000 men are employed, and the locally-made machinery is equal to any that is imported. From information in my possession it appears that the cost of road-rollers has been reduced by 7 per cent., and that of a small oil engine used in connexion with road-rollers by 10 to 15 per cent. One firm has designed a special machine which will reduce the working time of a certain operation bv 50 per cent. Prior to the introduction of the present tariff schedule the plant of this firm was working up to only 75 per cent, or its capacity, but is now working a night  shift  in order to complete its orders. Additions are also being made to the plant in order to cope with the business that is offering. Those conversant with the engineering trade in Great Britain know that owing to the shipbuilding slump engineers have been compelled to seek foi employment in other directions. The engineering trade in Great Britain is stagnant, but in Australia, owing to the protection &#34;iven to our industries, it is flourishing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> in his customary inquiring manner wished to know what was meant by &#34;a class or kind not commercially manufactured in Australia.&#34; The Tariff Board has been appointed to inquire into the capacity of Australian firms to commercially manufacture any article. It is quite an impersonal body, it has no interest in one firm or another, and its sole duty is to afford reasonable protection to Australian manufacturers. As part of its duties it is required to ascertain if those manufacturers can produce an article at a fair value to the people of Australia. I take that to be an answer to the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill.</inline> The fact that, after making due inquiries,  and after sifting the evidence placed before it, the board has recommended an increased duty ou roadmaking machines is sufficient for me. In another place an effort was made to have the duty reduced, but, after a long discussion, a proposal to reduce it was defeated by 30 votes to 20. This should not influence the decision of the Senate in any way, but do honorable senators imagine that we could persuade another place to go back on its previous decision in this respect ? In another place the question was discussed from a parochial stand-point, just as honorable senators have been discussing it. </para>

                        <para>- No. I am commenting on the parochial stand-point taken up by some protectionists. Because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has been overwhelmed by correspondence from Western Australia to do a&#39; certain thing, he has set out to do it. That is approaching the consideration of the tariff from a parochial stand-point. I know that the local governing bodies in the States, like every one else who is pinched by the tariff, are quite keen in their effort to have the duty on roadmaking machines reduced. When considering Customs duties one cannot be logical or consistent. One must use common sense, and go ahead despite the consequence. In Queensland I am quite willing to stand the consequence if the proposed duty leads to an increase in the price of road-making machinery. But I do not think it will retard road-making. If I thought it would, I should vote to admit road-making machinery free, because one can hardly realize how great a part road-making plays in the development of Australia; but I cannot see how an extra 7&#189; per cent, duty will retard it. The principal cost is in the construction material used, metal and cement, and the labour employed. The machinery used lasts for years. An extra 7$ per cent, on a machine that will last for twenty years is not worth worrying about in calculating the cost of making a road. No State is so far behind in road development as Queensland, but I can support the Minister with a clear conscience. I shall vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> amendment because I do not think that even if the duty were reduced as he suggests it would make any difference to the development of the Commonwealth by road construction. I regret that gentle pressure has been brought to bear on the protectionist Leader of the Labour party in the Senate to induce him to ask for a reduction of the duties as recommended by the Tariff Board, after hearing all the evidence. Road-making machinery is being made in Australia, and is steadily being improved. With the competition of the twenty firms already in existence the price is likely to be reduced. I see no reason why we should not allow the inventive genius of Australians to be applied to the manufacture of improved machinery which will lead, not only to the speedier development of the Commonwealth, but also to a reduction in price. </para>

                    <para>. - It is bad enough to have to listen to a lecture by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> but it is worse to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> saying that I am actuated by parochial motives in submitting my amendment to the Minister&#39;s request. When I first submitted my amendment, I mentioned the necessities of Queensland and South Australia, as well as those of my own State Western Australia. But I put aside for the moment the honorable senator&#39;s reference to parochial stand-points to say that I have not heard any argument from the Minister in favour of the retention of the duty as set out in the schedule, or from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> against a reduction of the British preferential duty. I doubt if the honorable senator is correct in saying that the rates in the schedule are the considered opinion of the Tariff Board. If they are, why did the Minister for Trade and Customs, who must have been in possession of all the information supplied by the Tariff Board, move, in another place, to reduce the British preferential rate to 30 per cent? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid&#39;s</inline> statement that we ought to be fearful because another place agreed to the item in the schedule by a certain majority, is no argument. In matters like this, we are entitled to submit arguments for or against certain duties. As a matter of fact, it is our duty to do so, and it is not right for any honorable senator to suggest that we should go in fear of what is likely to be done in another place. I have heard no argument from the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford),</inline> or from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> to indicate that a reduction of the British preferential rate by 7&#189; per cent, would affect the road-making machinery industry.

                        <para>- Yes; the indications are that it has made fair progress. It has been insinuated that although I am a protectionist, I am suggesting a reduction of duty in this sub-item. But surely there is a limit to the protection we are to be expected to afford to our own industries ? In submitting my amendment, I am not actuated by any appeal submitted to me from my own State - I put that suggestion on one side - I am doing so because, on the facts as they present themselves, I consider that a rate of 27&#163; per cent, is quite sufficient protection for the manufacturers of these machines. I have no intention of accepting the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> endorsed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> that I should move a corresponding reduction in the intermediate and general rates. If I did so, it would not be consistent with my general attitude. I am asking for a reduction of the British preferential rate because the reduction I propose is quite consistent with my ideals as a protectionist. I think that at the present time a British preferential duty of 27| per cent is quite sufficient protection for the industry concerned. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am surprised that this amendment should be submitted by the  Deputy  Leader of the Labour party in the Senate, and I am even more surprised when the &#39; honorable senator suggests that we should entirely separate the wages question from any consideration of duties. Earlier this afternoon I said that an increased duty was needed, because since the 1921 tariff wages have decreased in Great Britain and increased in Australia. To bear this out, I shall now quote figures given in evidence before the Tariff Board. In June, 1921, the average weekly wage paid to skilled men in the United Kingdom was &#163;&#38; 8s., as against &#163;6 in Australia. In June, 1921, the average weekly wage paid to unskilled labour in the United Kingdom was &#163;2&#34; 3s., as against &#163;4s. 4s. in Australia. In December, 1924, the average weekly wage paid to skilled men in the United Kingdom was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 16s. 6d., as against &#163;5 8s. 6d. in Australia, and the average weekly wage paid to unskilled men in the United Kingdom was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> Os. 2d., as against &#163;4 5s. 3d. in Australia. Whereas in 1921 the average weekly wage for skilled labour was only 36.3 per cent, higher in Australia than in the United Kingdom, in 1924 it was 92 per cent higher. In 1921 the average weekly wage for unskilled labour was 95.35 per cent, higher in Australia than in the United Kingdom, but in 1924 the Australian rate was 112.2 higher than in the United Kingdom. The honorable senator must see that we cannot dissociate the wages question from , the consideration of the tariff. The position in Australia is now very different from what it was five years ago. As a matter of fact, when the present schedule became operative about twelve months ago, the road-making machinery industry was languishing. A great many men who had been employed in it had been dismissed, owing to the  large  importations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has quoted some figures in regard  to  the importation of road-making machinery; but his figures included channel-making graders, road scoops and scrapers, scoops, stump extractors, horse road-rollers and machines, not one  of  which is included in the  item  we  are  now discussing. </para>

                        <para>- They are entirely different machines. Of course, scoops- are manufactured here; but I do not know that some of the others are made in Australia to any extent. Local firms, however, can make at a reasonable price a road-making machine that is in. every way suitable for Australian conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> referred to the big responsibilities that the Commonwealth has regarding the Northern Territory, and he spoke as though the time were at hand when we should be building a considerable mileage of macadamized roads . in that part of Australia. My opinion is that before Australia is in a position to fully discharge her responsibilities in regard to the more remote parts of this country, she will have to increase her population and build up her industries. I fail to see how that can be done except under a policy of protection. The . figures that I have quoted from the report of the Tariff Board, I think most honorable senators will agree, show that the difference between the rates of wages in Australia and Great Britain is far greater to-day, compared with 1921, than is represented by the proposed increase in duty of 7$ per cent. Therefore I trust that the committee will support the Government in its proposal to afford effective protection to the manufacturers of the machinery mentioned in the item. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with surprise to some of the remarks that have been made during this debate. It seems strange to me that certain honorable senators should ask how a reduction of 7$ per cent, in the duty on road-making machinery could affect the cost of a road. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> spoke of the class of roads made in the United States of America, and he and honorable senators generally have referred to the urgent necessity of constructing roads capable of withstanding the stresses imposed on them under modern traffic conditions. The &#34; roadmaking machinery &#34; used in Australia today comes largely within the category of the shovel, the fork, and the rake, with occasionally a roller. Practically no progress has been made in methods of construction. </para>

                        <para>- It is a most unfortunate body that has to travel over Queensland roads. Vast strides are being made in the science of road-making. The road-making methods of a few years ago are practically valueless to-day, and in the near &#39;future will; be of even less value. Any municipality or roadmaking contractor who depends on the old type of machinery will be completely behind the times. In the United States of America road-making machinery is constantly being replaced because of the invention of more up-to-date plants. As soon as an improvement is discovered the plant in use is scrapped, and the new scheme is put into operation. Australia will have to adopt similar methods. The latest machinery to-day may be obsolete a few months hence. It seems to me that Australia will demand better roads. This result can be achieved by improved plant and improved methods, but principally by improved machinery. Therefore, it is obvious that, with the constant change necessitated by continued improvements in machinery, the added duty might easily become a heavy burden. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> in his amendment. Something must be done to aid the local governing authorities and the roadmaking contractors to provide what modern means of transport demand. If this duty be imposed, contractors will naturally, as a matter of business, pass on the increased cost of construction that it will involve. The Minister, when asked why the tariff was being increased, said that it was largely because of the increase in wages. He explained that tariffs were ruled by wages; and of the truth of that statement we have had a fair illustration throughout the consideration of this schedule. Wherever it appears that wages have increased, extra duties are demanded. It seems to me, however, that the peg must he put in somewhere. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it is. But it is the last straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back. The tariff has unquestionably helped to strangle our one-time magnificent mining industry. Something must be done to stabilize it, and the desired result cannot bo achieved by increasing the cost of production. We are told that some twenty factories are concerned in the manufacture of roadmaking and certain other machinery covered by this item, and that 1,000 men are employed in the industry. But many thousands of men have been affected by the throttling of the mining industry. Should not honorable senators consider how much it has meant to Australia? In many parts of this fair land we see the effects of mining activities having been abandoned, yet the representatives of such States as Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania are asked to assist industries at the cost of strangling the mining industry. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the proposed duty.I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> moved his amendment from any selfish standpoint ; but as a &#34; whole-hogger &#34; protectionist I believe in building up Australian industries. I have supported every item in the schedule, and in one or two instances I should have supported even higher duties than those proposed. The letters from local governing bodies should not influence honorable senators in their attitude towards the schedule. I probably have received letters from those who have asked for a reduction of 7&#189; per cent., but I do not think that such a reduction would materially affect either the cost of road work or the cost of the machinery. When manufacturers feel secure from foreign competition, they will bring their workshops up to date, and introduce more efficient methods, which mean cheaper work and better results. We all believe that good roads are necessary, but it will be a long time before we shall have good roads throughout this great continent, from north to south, and from east to west. The figures given by the Minister, showing that the wages paid in Australia are 92 per cent, higher than those paid in some other countries from which road-making machinery might be imported, are sufficient to convince us of the necessity for granting adequate protection to this and other industries. </para>

I prefer that the machinery which we require should be made by Australians, working under decent Australian conditions, than that it be imported from countries where the employees live in a semi-starved condition. Bather than send work to men in other countries I would have them come here and enjoy the conditions which obtain in Australian industries. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, it is. That is because our secondary industries are. limited. But let them be built up into vast industries, and there will be an improved home market. If some honorable senators had their way, there would be no secondary industries in Australia. I do uot know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is an importer, but no barrister commanding a high fee could have presented a better case for the importers than he did. I have always been a protectionist, and, I claim, a consistent one. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who also was at one time a protectionist, has forsaken the policy of protection; but I believe that he will see the error of his ways, and again advocate it. I hope that the item will be agreed to. The higher duties will not interfere with the cost of roadmaking. When, by their aid, our workshops have been established on a sound footing, road-making machinery will be made here at less cost than that at which it can be imported, and roadmaking in Australia will become cheaper. </para>

                    <para>.- The item before us is of great importance to Australia. In a new country, where a large proportion of the population is composed of primary producers, facilities must be provided to enable their produce to reach the markets. Those who oppose this item appear to have <inline font-style="italic">forgotten</inline> that, while it is necessary to provide roads along which our primary produce may be conveyed to market, it is equally essential that the country should be able to make the machinery to construct those roads. That road-making machinery is usually built for long service, and that local bodies do not require to renew it at frequent intervals appears to have been overlooked. The additional7&#189; per cent, dutv spread over the life of a machine would hardly be noticed. Is it not better to agree to this slightly increased duty, and thus enable the machines to be made here, providing employment for our own people, than that they should be conveyed thousands of miles by sea from Great Britain or the United States of America while our workmen roam the streets unemployed? Many of our shire councillors are tories whose only desire appears to bo to reduce wages. Rather  than provide their own countrymen with employment at an additional 4d. a day they prefer to purchase their requirements from abroad, giving employment to the workers of other countries. They overlook the fact that lack of employment for Australian workmen is likely to adversely affect themselves. Australia certainly needs good roads; but it is just as important that* the machinery necessary to make those roads should be produced in this country, giving employment to our own people. </para>

                        <para>- Like other honorable senators, I have received a considerable amount of correspondence on this subject, but I have not been impressed by it, because I believe that those responsible for it misunderstand the position which honorable senators should occupy on such an issue as this. It has been said during the debate that higher duties mean higher wages, and that a manufacturer who secures a high tariff immediately increases wages by twice the amount warranted, in the full knowledge that he can pass on the extra cost to his customers. I have not heard of any such increase of wages. There is a remedy for the exploitation of the public, but I tell honorable senators frankly  that  it cannot be applied  by this legislature, because those who are against the Government on this item supported it when Labour appealed to the people for authority to be given to this Parliament to prevent any exploitation of the public. Therefore, our only alternative now is to do what may he possible to improve the position by a strong expression of public opinion. It is claimed that manufacturers of these road-making machines in other countries produce a better article than the Australian product. In most instances they enjoy an advantage in the form of cheaper labour, and certainly they have had much more experience in the organization of manufacturing enterprises. But if these considerations are to outweigh all others; if Australian manufacturers are to receive no encouragement; then we shall never have an opportunity to develop our secondary industries to their  fullest extent. The truth of this is so patent to me that I marvel that any honorable senator can hold the contrary view. Suppose it does cost us <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> little more to manufacture these machines in Australia. Are we not providing increased employment for our own people and at the same time attracting population from overseas? Honorable senators supporting the Government aTe everlastingly trying to persuade the people that their great anxiety is to attract immigrants to Australia. What is the use of talking in that way if, by tariff reductions on certain items affecting secondary industries, they limit opportunities for employment in this country ? 1 have here two samples of shovels. Whilst they might not be in the same category as road-making machinery, they at all events serve a useful purpose in all road-making work. One is an imported article and the other an Australian-made shovel. The imported article is supposed to be hammered out, but it is not. The Australian shovel is hammered out, and although it might cost a little more it is well worth the difference. I am told by the experts who make them, that the Australian shovel will last twice -as long as the imported article. Both have the maker&#39;s name on them. When I was a. navvy, the maker&#39;s name, instead of being <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the blade of the shovel, was  nearly  half way up the handle, and we were told always to fill them Tip to the maker&#39;s name. If I am permitted to make any  comment  at all about these articles, i should say that there should be some restriction upon the size of the implement, but if I were buying one for some one else to use I would certainly buy the Australian shovel, because the manufacturer is doing something to provide employment for  Australians  and at the same time supplying a very necessary tool for the maintenance of our roads. All Australians should be patriotic enough to insist upon being supplied with articles made in Australia by our own work people. Only by doing this can we hope to populate this country with a desirable race of people. Honorable senators supporting the Government are never tired of declaiming on the hustings that no man wanting employment in Australia need be without it To that I reply that thousands of Britishers are ready to come to Australia ; . but they know, from the experience of others, that the best inducement offered to them on arrival will fee about &#163;1 a week. It is this kind of treatment that prevents more Britishers from coming to Australia. High wages are not a deterrent, because, as a general rule, British immigrants do not enjoy high wages until they have been here long enough to wake up to the situation. I hope that the committee will not agree to the proposed reduction of the duties. I intend wholeheartedly to support the Government in the imposition of the highest duties possible to ensure the development of Australian industries. I am satisfied that members of the Tariff Board made the recommendation with a full knowledge pf all the facts. </para>

                    <para>. - I had not intended to speak upon this item; but I feel it necessary to say a word or two to explain my stand in connexion with the schedule as a whole. I gather from the Minister&#39;s remarks that the reduction proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> will not materially affect the cost of road-making machinery, such as scarifiers, road rollers, scoops, and cement mixers. Western Australia is as much in need of good roads as any other State, and in my opinion concrete roads should, where possible, be laid down. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> referred to mining as a primary industry, and to the duties on mining machinery. He added that the proposed tariff was not calculated to assist that industry. I may state, for the honorable senator&#39;s edification, that the Government which he supports, by its action in placing an embargo upon gold export during the war period, is responsible for the present position of the mining industry in Western Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">This sub-item deals solely with mining machinery. That industry, as honorable senators are aware, has been severely handicapped in recent years. Western Australia is the leading gold-producing State of the Commonwealth. A royal commission was appointed by this Government in 1925 to inquire into the financial position of Western Australia, as affected by. federation. Two of the three commissioners expressed the view that, whatever benefit federation might have conferred upon other States, it had not benefited Western Australia. As the Western Australian gold-mining industry is at present declining, additional imposts such as are now proposed will handicap it still further. The value of mining in Western Australia in 1901 was &#163;7,458,000, in 1910 &#163;6,522,000, in 1920 &#163;4,110,000, and in 1923 &#163;2,747,000. The value of the gold produced in 1901 was &#163;7,235,000, in 1910 &#163;6,246,000, in 1920 &#163;3,475,000, and in 1923 &#163;2,232,000. </para>

                        <para>- I have not the figures before me. The number of employees engaged in the gold-mining industry in Western Australia in 1910 was 17,711, in 1919, 8,346, and in 1923, 6,497. These figures clearly indicate the extent to which gold mining in Western Australia has declined during recent years. The decline is to some extent due to the fact- that the mines are now working on ore of a lower grade, which has increased the cost of production. The Western Australian Government is now conferring with the mining companies in that State in an endeavour to revive the industry, but up to the present I do not think the companies have expressed any opinion as to the feasibility of the scheme. It is reasonable, however, to assume that the  imposition of higher Customs duties must further hamper the industry. Years ago, when the gold yield was greater and the industry generally more prosperous, duties such as are now proposed on mining machinery could have been paid without detrimentally affecting production. 1 quote the following from the annual report of the Tariff Board on the incidence of the tariff on Western Australia - </para>

                    <para>The significance of this can be appreciated when it is learned that in the eastern States approximately50 per cent, of local primary products is consumed locally, whereas in Western Australia only 20 per ceut, at best, of some of their local primary products is consumed locally, and that in a number of cases this percentage falls to 10 per cent, and even lower. It is necessary to recollect in this connexion that the principal expansion in Western Australian industry is along the line of primary production, and that the cost of material and plant and tools has been greatly enhanced during the last decade, which adds considerably to their capital outlay in placing their settlers upon the land. </para>

                    <para>. -  To a certain extent I am in agreement with the opinions expressed  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> I intend to ask the Government to go a little further than the honorable senator proposed, and to revert to the duties in force prior to the introduction of this schedule. The burden of my song will be to encourage the copper mining as well  as  the gold-mining industry, and, in fact, other metalliferous  mines which are in need of assistance. It seems to me that&#39; the proposals of the Government are not designed to, in any way, assist the mining industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> quoted figures showing the extent to which gold mining in Western Australia has declined, and I too could quote interesting statistics showing the extent to which gold and copper production in Queensland has fallen off. Although large quantities of payable ore have been mined in Queensland, a much greater quantity would still be won if the conditions were more favorable. The cost of production has increased considerably during recent years, and if higher Customs duties are imposed on mining machinery, development will be further retarded. There was a time when 3,500 men were employed at the Mount Morgan mine - during that period a good deal of new construction was being undertaken - but, to-day, there are only 350. The future development of that mme largely depends upon the possibility of securing the necessary mining machinery at a reasonable price. A scheme is at present being tried out on a small scale, and if it can be shown that by means of it the ore can be commercially dealt with, a much larger project will be launched and fairly heavy expenditure on plant incurred. It is not now known whether the machinery it is proposed to purchase will be obtained in the United States of America, but, possibly, a good deal of it will come from that country. </para>

There seems to be no good reason why the latter should carry a higher duty than ore-dressing machinery, rock-boring machinery, &#38;c, 27&#189; per cent., or agricultural machines, n.e.i., 20 per cent, and no justification whatever for an increase from 27&#189; per cent, to 40 per cent.

We all regret that mining is not as flourishing as it was some years ago ; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has admitted, the principal reason for this is the lower grade of ores available at the present time. I was very interested in a little pamphlet I received from a mining organization in Western Australia, advocating the payment of a bonus on the production of gold. It contained some most interesting information, and among other things showed that the ore raised in Western Australia last year averaged a fraction over 10 dwt. a ton. The position is the same in other States. Not only is the grade of the ore mined lower ; but it has to be raised from a greater depth. Last year the dividends paid in Western Australia were comparatively small. In fact, it cost as much to raise the gold as it was worth. Therefore, gold-mining is not a profitable business at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- If the industry were assisted, it would last for a limited period only. No matter how rich a mine is, or how large the body of ore it has, it closes down sooner or later. Other industries, such as those protected by this item, if carried on under reasonable conditions, will last for all time, and be of increasing value to the country. No figures have been quoted, or facts advanced, to justify the claim that the reduction of duty proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> would afford any relief to the mining industry. Honorable senators have complained that sufficient information has not always been available to support proposed increases of duties, but it can also be fairly claimed that practically no information is given in support of proposals to reduce duties. Statements are made as to the probable effect of a reduction, but .no figures are quoted in support of those statements. </para>

                        <para>- The Government has every sympathy with mining, and considers that it is equitably treated under the tariff. I am pleased to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> in the chamber. He asked earlier in the day what was meant by &#34; commercially manufactured.&#34; It is impracticable to lay down a rigid definition of the term, but generally speaking, &#34; commercial manufacture &#34; in Australia means the manufacture of articles in reasonable quantities at costs which, having regard to the difference in costs of material and labour, reasonably compare with the costs of similar goods manufactured abroad. There are, in addition to the difference in costs of labour and materials, other factors to be taken into account, such as output and large home markets. Australian manufacturers have not the extensive markets enjoyed by the United Kingdom and other overseas manufacturing countries. These factors must be considered in determining whether an Australian manufacturer is producing commercially. For instance, wages and material costs in Australia are twice as high as they are in Great Britain or Germany. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister might to .better purpose have given details of the articles used in mining and not included in the list, because there are quite a number of other articles that are required to carry on mining operations. A considerable number of mining propositions, which have not been regarded as payable up to the present time, could be worked successfully if machinery were available at a reasonable cost, but any duty that will increase the cost of mining to any extent whatever may be the determining factor in preventing the development of certain properties on a commercial basis. The Minister said that mining was a vanishing industry, whereas the industries that the Government desired to protect would remain for all time. I point out, however, that it is highly desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth that the mining industry should be revived and maintained. Instead of the Minister&#39;s argument being in favour of the imposition of a heavier duty on mining machinery, it was quite in opposition to it.. Obviously, if we can lower the cost of production we are more likely to permit of the development of many of the low-grade mining propositions. Every extra cost, however, will place an additional handicap on mining. Certain industrial conditions are complied with by  mineowners; but if they ,are compelled to use locally-manufactured plants, and pay high prices for them, it will probably lead to the closing down of the fields. Some time ago the committee passed an item which increased the British rate from 27&#189; per cent, to 35 per cent., and here we are asked to agree to a duty of 40 per cent, on mining machinery, and 45 per cent, on machines and machinery n.e.i. In order to be consistent, I willingly support a reduction in the duty. I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> that we should go back to the rate fixed in the 1921 tariff. The mining industry is in such a parlous condition that any blow, no matter how slight, would have a serious effect upon it. </para>

                    <para>. - There are several peculiar features about the proposed increase. I was not present when the Honorary Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> gave an explanation - if he did &#39; give one, which I doubt - as to why this increased duty is necessary. The arguments he used in support of the expediency of this duty appear to me, as to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> to be the strongest he could possibly have used against it. Here is an industry that is languishing. Apparently the wish of those responsible for the tariff is to knock the mining industry on the head at once by imposing additional duties. Surely if an industry is languishing, it is time for the authorities to come to its assistance as far as possible; but we find that this languishing industry is to be put out of its misery at once. Now there is one section of the mining industry in Australia, which deserves some reparation from the Commonwealth Government for the circumstances that obtained during the war. I refer to gold mining. Through a set of circumstances which became known in Western Australia as the &#34; gold steal &#34; - and I am not going to say that I recognize the appropriate nature of that cognomen - Western &#39; Australia, more particularly because she was, as she is still, the biggest producer of gold in the Commonwealth, was deprived during the war period of the natural premium that gold was bearing in all other parts of the world. This was due to the fact that the patriotism of Australia led it to give whatever profits might have been made to the coffers of the Empire. For my own part I do not grumble at it, but any industry that has suffered in the cause of imperial unity should be the last to receive such a blow as is proposed under the present tariff. Other branches of mining did not suffer proportionately, and while this amount was cut off from the profit end of the mining industry, it has to be remembered that the disabilities caused by the war were borne without any attempt at relief on the part of the Government, or anybody else. That is why I say that the gold-mining industry, especially, should receive every consideration at the hands of this or any other Ministry. The Government owes a debt to that industry which it should show some little anxiety to repay. The pamphlet to which the Minister alluded related to an attempt to bring the Government to that frame of mind by proposing a bonus on gold production. Of course, that matter is not under debate, but as the Minister mentioned it by way of illustration, I also have referred to it. Although the industry is languishing iu Western Australia,there are hopes that north of Coolgardie there will yet be found and worked another Kalgoorlie, but a Kalgoorlie that will not start off under the conditions that obtained during the development of the &#34; Golden Mile &#34;. At that time the tariff on mining machinery was much more favorable to mining propositions than it is to-day. The field to which I refer will require a large capital expenditure and a tremendous quantity of modern machinery, if it is to be developed. It is grossly unjust to a State like Western Australia, that has done so much to develop the mining industry of Australia, that these heavy imposts should be made upon mining machinery. I hope that the committee&#39;s sense of fairness will come to the rescue of the gold-mining industry, not only in Western Australia, but throughout the Commonwealth. For my own part I do not think that the Australian manufacturers require the proposed increase of duty, and no attempt has been made to prove that they do. For what purpose is it needed? With the wonderful advantages that they start with in the way of locality and costs of transport, I do not think that the additional tariff is justified. At any rate, I shall certainly vote against it. </para>

                        <para>- There will be a division this time. Now, I pass on to a more congenial, because more amusing subject. I listened with interest to the Minister&#39;s definition of &#34; commercially manufactured.&#34; It seems to me that wherever the framers of the tariff have a chance to insert an adjective they use the word &#34; reasonable &#34;, which, of course, is one of the hardest words legally to define. From what I can remember of that definition it appears to be adaptable to any set of circumstances. I cannot imagine any manufacture that could not be brought within the four corners of such a definition - that is, if it could have corners. I think that it is circular in form. There is no point which one may grasp. One slips over the smooth surface and is shot into space before getting hold of anything. So far as I could gather from the statement read by the Minister, no principle is laid down. It may be that, because of its extreme length, I was unable to grasp its import. I shall, therefore, study it at home to see if I can find anything in it. I , desire to appeal to honorable senators&#39; sense of fairness in their treatment of the gold-mining industry, particularly so far as Western Australia is concerned. This industry already has made great sacrifices for the sake of the Empire. While it may languish in one place, it is possible that it may be resuscitated in another; but under these unnecessary imposts - unnecessary for the manufacturing of mining machinery in Australia - the Government is striking a blow at the gold mining industry of Australia from which it will be difficult to recover. Instead of treating the mining industry as a tender shrub, the Government, by asking the committee to agree to these high duties, is ringbarking it. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> amendment to the previous request was not pressed to a division. Had a division been called for, I believe that the inherent justice of honorable senators would have risen to the surface, and that it would have been agreed to. I feel sure that that will be the result in this instance. </para>

                    <para>. - Any adjustment of the tariff presents almost insuperable difficulties. Some honorable senators have informed us that all their lives they have been protectionists; yet, even at- this late hour, they are unable to agree regarding what may be fairly termed a protectionist as against n revenue tariff. We have had a tariff in operation sufficiently long for honorable senators to have made up their minds. Of what use is it for honorable senators to say that this is a protective tariff when we know that every year the revenue from the Customs House is increasing? This year it will probably amount to &#163;42,000,000. Some honorable senators still proclaim that they are protectionists, ignoring the fact that a protectionist tariff does not exclude foreign-made goods. It would appear that some among us have a suspicion that the tariff does, in fact, increase the price of the commodities that are taxed. A genuine protectionist does not admit that; but in the minds of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> and others, the imposition of import duties not only increases the cost of the imported mining machinery, but may even have the effect of dealing a death-blow to an already harassed industry. Honorable senators who have been so consistent in their support of the Government have been afraid to call! for a division. </para>

He is entitled to do that; I shall not object so long as I am allowed the same freedom. Some time ago Parliament, after having considered the imposition of additional Customs duties, appointed a Tariff Board to weigh the evidence for and against the imposition of import duties, and to make recommendations. In this case, the Tariff Board recommended that the duty be increased to 40 per cent. I am delighted to find Senators Lynch, Kingsmill, Payne, and Thompson, all ardent supporters of the Government, getting what they deserve. They are being forced to swallow what the Government gives them. </para>

                        <para>- I am supporting the Government&#39;s proposal in preference to that advocated by some of its own supporters. Night after night Senators Kingsmill, Lynch, Payne, and Thompson have supported the Government in connexion with this tariff schedule. Now that they are being given some of their own medicine, they do not like it; they squeak and squirm and squeal in a disgraceful manner. If I were a supporter of a government which advocated a policy of this kind, I should tell it to go ahead; but I would not squeak in the way some honorable senators are doing. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to say anything offensive ; but I was unable in other language to convey my opinion of certain honorable senators. I should have liked the Minister to tell us the value of the machinery imported during the past few years for mining purposes, and the amount of revenue derived from that source.  He might also have informed us what amount of additional revenue he expects to receive from the increased duty of 124 per cent. It is of no use for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who has been an ardent protectionist all his life, to think that he can get protection in respect of certain articles and freetrade in respect of others, and not expect other honorable senators to claim the same privilege. He must know that people engaged in the engineering industry who are industrially well organized can make their voices heard more effectively than can those engaged in the gold-mining industry. Every Government will listen to the voice of those engaged in secondary industries. That is why this tariff has been introduced. The Minister referred to higher wages necessitating higher duties, and, later, an appeal to the Arbitration Court, resulting in still higher wages and a demand for further duties. At present the turn of affairs is in the direction of additional duties. Those honorable senators&#39; who now are having a taste of their own medicine must tamely submit to it. When a division is taken they can find an excuse to retire; and the Government will win every time. I shall not forget that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> voted in favour of increased duties on whisky. In that case the duty represented 700 per cent. Now he opposes the imposition of a duty of 12&#163; per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Speakers who have preceded me in this debate have given certain figures dealing with mining. I intend also to present some figures relating to the gold-mining section of the industry, and will then leave- the matter in the hands of the committee. Let us see what has been happening within the last few years. In 1901 the gold-mining industry produced new wealth to the amount of &#163;14,000,000; but in 1921 the production was down to &#163;4,000,000. In 1901 it gave employment to 70,000 persona; in 1921 less than 11,000 were engaged in it. These figures indicate that the industry is sorely in need of some relief. I admit, of course, that a reduction of 5 per cent, in the British duty which I am now asking for will not mean the salvation of the industry - far from it. Other factors are responsible for the depressed state of gold mining, which once was a flourishing industry, especially in Western Australia. What I want to know is, why should gold-mining be singled out and penalized in this way ? It has done more than any other industry for this country-; but, unfortunately, its services to. the community were forgotten by some honorable senators in the vote that has just been taken. Prior to the war there was a good market for all the gold produced in this country; but when war broke out there was an insistent demand for the preservation of the gold reserve, with a result that the producers of this precious metal were obliged to sell their output here at the rate ruling on the first day of the war. Other primary industries were not treated in that way. Wool, for example, was sold at a flat rate of 15&#189;d. a lb., and wheat was disposed of at rates that gave a very fair return to primary producers in that field of endeavour. Other base metals received favorable treatment. Lead soared to a very high figure, and gave a handsome return to the companies producing it. Our gold producers, by the action of the Government in placing an embargo on exports, lost approximately &#163;3,000,000, because, as I have stated, they were obliged to confine themselves to the Australian market, gold being sorely needed for the husbanding of our financial resources for war purposes. Besides losing approximately &#163;3,000,000 through this restriction in the marketing of their product, our gold producers had to meet excess costs in production, and not one penny piece has come their way from that day to this. Now they are asked to bear an import duty of 40 per cent. British on mining machinery. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has occupied much valuable time of the Senate lately whilst he talked with his tongue in his cheek about these tariff items. He knows very well that he dare not vote against a single item, because if he did so he would be listed at the Trades Hall, Sydney, and thereafter be a marked man. And this from a disciple of Henry George ! Henry George would turn in his grave if he could realize that he had such a counterfeit exponent of his doctrine in this chamber. The gold-mining industry, I repeat, has been penalized as no other industry has, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill</inline> remarked just now, this tariff increase is its reward. I wish it to be placed on the same footing as other industries. Therefore I am  moving  to have the British tariff reduced from 40 to 35 per cent. What objection can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow</inline> or other honorable senators have to this proposal ? Why should they single out the gold-mining industry for special persecution ? The facts are before us. The committee has just agreed to a duty of 35 per cent.  British  on cylindrical cement driers and coolers, and similar cylindrical containers. It has also agreed to a duty of 35 per cent. British on certain classes of road-making machinery. Why, then, should the gold-mining industry be called up to bear a heavier burden ? Why did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham</inline> troop across the chamber just now and vote for an exorbitant duty on this industry which is visibly vanishing ? Mining machinery comes from all parts of the world. Why should the tariff start at 40 per cent. British, and rise to 55 per cent, in the case of importations from foreign countries ? One honorable senator asked a while ago if I could state to what extent the gold-mining industry had been handicapped by these high protective duties. I cannot do that. The same question was asked by members of the Tariff Board of representatives of the Chamber of Mines in Kalgoorlie. They could not say either, but they pointed out that there was an increase of &#163;12,000,000 in receipts from Customs over a period of seven years, and they left it to the average intelligence of the board to say how much of that additional revenue had been subscribed by the gold-mining industry. That was as far as they could go. With the duty increased to 40 per cent., the last chapter concerning the industry has been written, unless, of course, further rich discoveries are made which will enable it to stand up against such heavy imposts. It cannot be thought for a moment that the auriferous deposits of this country are exhausted. In Western Australia, which, up to the present, has produced 75 per cent, of Australia&#39;s output of gold, there are hundreds of millions of pounds&#39; worth of gold which can still be mined, if the opportunity is only afforded. For the simple purpose of placing this industry on the same level, no higher and no lower, as dozens of other industries, I ask honorable senators in all seriousness, to give the gold mining industry a final chance to hold its own. </para>

                    <para>. -  The same objection which I raised in connexion with the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> applies in this instance. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> who says that the gold-mining industry has been specially singled out for the imposition of very heavy duties, will peruse the rates set out against other items in the schedule, he will see that under that following the one we are now considering, a duty 5 per cent, higher than that imposed on mining machinery is provided. It is very doubtful . whether the duties imposed on mining machinery are responsible in any degree for the present unfortunate position in the gold-mining industry; nearly all of the mines are fully equipped with modern machinery, which was paid for at a time when the companies were prosperous, and when big dividends were paid. As I stated when speaking on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> request, it cannot be claimed that the cost of mining machinery is responsible. In these circumstances, I cannot accept the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline></para>

                    <para>. -  There may be some truth in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> statement that during the war the Government disposed of the gold produced from the Western Australian mines at an upset price, but I am not prepared to admit that its action in that respect involved the mining companies in a loss of &#163;3,000,000. During the war, the Government found it necessary to definitely fix the price of many commodities, including galvanized iron, which was extensively used throughout the Commonwealth. The Government also fixed  the price of wool at a flat rate of ls. 5d. a lb., and annexed the whole of the newsprint in stock in the Commonwealth and appointed a special board to distribute it. In scores of other ways the Government fixed prices of commodities in the public interest, and arranged distribution. The gold-mining industry was not singled out for special treatment, but its decline is attributable to the fact that when once the metal is removed, mining becomes an unpayable proposition. Gold mining in Australia is costly, for obvious reasons, but other mineral deposits may be discovered. The proposed reduction of 5 per cent, in the duty is not worth speaking of. The action of the Government in this respect is merely a part of the great national policy of protection which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has advocated for a lifetime. If the speeches delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> since he has been a member of this chamber were studied, it would be found that he has always supported those who advocate excessive duties. He is now confronted with a position which he has assisted in establishing. . If the honorable senator desires to protect one industry, he must also be willing to assist others. If he thinks that the gold-mining industry should escape these duties, why does he not advocate the entire removal of duties on all mining machinery, or adopt the logical attitude which I sometimes adopt, and advocate a straight-out land tax ? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and those supporting him, wish mining machinery to be imported absolutely free of duty, they should support land value taxation instead of suffering dose after dose of high protection which is really too good for them. </para>

                        <para>- I mentioned earlier in the debate on this item that there was a strong possibility of a  very  large new plant being laid down at the Mount Morgan mine, and consequently lower duties would be very beneficial. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> saw the report of the South African expert who reported on the &#34;Western Australian mines, and who said that a good deal of the inefficiency in Western Australian mines was due to the use of obsolete machinery. That indicates that if the mining industry is to improve, a good deal of new machinery will have to be installed. The same could be said of most of the mines in Australia. </para>

Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> request were adopted it would not affect the position one way or the other, whereas if my proposal had received the support of the majority of honorable senators,- the mining industry would have received substantial benefit.

                        <para>- It is a general practice to blame the tariff, but my observations on the mining fields throughout the Commonwealth lead me to the conclusion that the decline in mining is due, not to the protection afforded to the manufacturers of mining machinery, but to the fact that as the mining fields are becoming worked out working costs are higher. The tariff was not responsible for the decline of Coolgardie. </para>

Valuable mineral deposits exist in various parts of Queensland, but it cannot be said that the high duties imposed on mining machinery are preventing their development. The cost of production is certainly high, but the real trouble is that we have not yet discovered a cheaper means of extracting gold from the ore. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> has spoken about the report of a South African expert on the method of mining employed on the Western Australian gold-fields, but even if the companies did introduce the up-to-date machinery he recommended, the question is whether there would be sufficient gold in the mines to pay for it. We know that gold is a vanishing quantity. We have seen gold-mining towns spring up and pass away within twelve months. That is part of the history of gold mining in Australia. Our gold mining period has passed by. No doubt it made this continent, but to-day it is . being supplanted by other industries which, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator CraAvford)has</inline> pointed out, should last as long as Australia lases. Those manufacturers Avhb were making mining machinery are now adapting themselves to the newer conditions. They are supplying the requirements of other industries, and are not making much mining machinery now. I should not object to the free importation of mining machinery that could not be made in Australia, so long as it would help those who are engaged in an endeavour to develop our mineral resources, but I have not yet heard one honorable senator give evidence that the tariff as it now exists is hindering mining development. The machinery requirements of the existing mines are replacements only. Those who are managing the mines admit that all they are doing is to get the best out of the plants they now have. </para>

And if it bore onerously on the industry on that State, it must likewise have borne onerously on the industry in Queensland. I shall quote briefly from the evidence given before the Tariff Board in Kalgoorlie. No names are mentioned. The mines are indicated by numbers, and the suppliers of the mines requirements by letters. In reference to mine No. 1, the following evidence was given: - </para>

                <para class="block">In the case of mine No. 4, its experience in regard to manganese steel ball mill spares was that the imported plates had a 35.7 per cent, longer life than the Australian articles. This evidence bears out my contention that even the moderate duty that has hitherto prevailed imposed an extra charge on the mining industry. The following was also given in evidence before the Tariff Board: - </para>

                    <para>Last year it became necessary for one of the mines to obtain spare runners and blading for its turbines. lt was found that these could not be manufactured in Australia. One of the largest electrical engineering firms of England was then approached with a view of having the parts made there. The firm replied that it could not make the spares except at a prohibitive cost, and stated that it could procure them from Germany. On the facts being placed before the Comptroller of Customs, a permit to import the spares was obtained; but when the turbine parts were landed, the fact that they could not be manufactured in Australia was overlooked, and the mine had to pay duty to the extent of &#163;349. However, this case has been brought before the notice of the department, and it is possible the duty may be refunded. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I do not know the result of the application for a refund, but it is sufficient for us to know that the mine had to pay &#163;349 duty on spare parts. There are thousands of instances in which the mines have been obliged to use spare parts that are not to be compared in quality with the imported article. I should like to be able to tell the reverse story, but I am quoting the sworn evidence given by the sponsors for the industry in Kalgoorlie. There is another instance of the effect of even a moderate tariff on the gold-mining industry. A comparison of haunch-plates, Australian and imported, is given in evidence as follows: - </para>
                <para class="block">English - </para>

                    - These plates have an assured life of eleven months with regular monthly inspections. We have previously tried Australian spares, with equally unsatisfactory results.

                </para>
                <para>From the above, it will be noted that the life of the imported haunch plates is about eleven months, and that of the Australian made three and a half months. </para>
                <para class="block">I could go on further. There is plenty of evidence to show that men who are &#34; all Australian,&#34; and desirous of encouraging Australia&#39;s secondary industries, have tried the output of those industries, and been unsuccessful in the use of them. Yet when we ask for the slightest measure of consideration for the gold-mining industry, we are met with a solid vote against us. It is not fair play. It is not playing the game decently with an industry that has done so much for this country. It will be driven rapidly to its doom unless we give it special consideration, not only by remodelling these duties completely, but also in other directions. If we allow this industry that has done so much for us to die, the responsibility will be on us. I propose to press my request to a division. My object is to place this pioneering industry of ours on the level of scores of other industries on which a tariff of 35 per cent, is deemed sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- Because, as I previously explained, the lower import duty on mining machinery was a special concession to the mining industry. A further reason is that mining machinery being of a simpler character than much of the machinery included under sub-item  f,  the ratio of labour in the former is not so great as in the latter. </para>

                    <para>. -  Since the Government shows its readiness to increase duties in consonance with the increase in wages, will the Minister inform us whether that increase will ever stop? This is a very serious matter in connexion with this and other items. Is the Minister not of the opinion that if we continue, not in this vicious circle, but in this vicious spiral, we shall eventually cut Australia off from the rest of the commercial world to an even greater extent than she is cut off to-day? I ask the question seriously, and I hope to have a serious reply. Does the Minister think that there is going to be any end to this process, and, if so, when will it be reached? </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> in common with every other honorable senator, knows that I always approach political subjects in a serious frame of mind, and I have applied myself with all earnestness to every question that has arisen in connexion with this measure. But I think that one would be more than bold - in fact, one would be extremely rash - to say emphatically what was likely to be the industrial position of the world, or even of one&#39;s own country, a few years hence. However, I am not amongst those who appear to be greatly alarmed at the increase in the costs of production that has taken place, not only in Australia, but also in many other countries, during recent years. Whilst those costs have increased, there has been a very great improvement in the standard of living. The people have more comforts and pleasures, are living in better houses, and have better furnished homes than obtained some years ago when wages were much lower than they are at the present time. People today are better dressed&#34; and much happier than they formerly were. Therefore, I, for one, cannot see any ground at all for complaining that the costs of production have increased. Concurrently with the increase in those costs, life has become very much more worth living than it was under previous conditions. We have to deal with circumstances as we find them to-day. We learn, from the reports of the Tariff Board, and from other sources of information available, that many of our industries are languishing, and that a great many persons who previously found employment in connexion with them are now unemployed. We have reason to believe that an increase in the degree of protection afforded to those industries would have the effect of placing them on a better footing, and enabling them to give increased employment. I think that we shall be failing in our duty if we are not prepared to apply a remedy that has proved efficacious in the past in order to meet the very unsatisfactory set of conditions that now exist. I have said repeatedly that this tariff has been in  operation for nearly twelve months, and it has already had a very beneficial effect upon a number of Australian industries. We are keeping in the country money that was previously sent abroad. Apparently, there are some honorable senators who think that our guiding principle should be to buy always in the cheapest market. If we were to carry that policy to its logical conclusion, we should at last reach the stage at which we should produce nothing ourselves, and should get all we required from countries where the worst industrial conditions prevailed. We should soon find ourselves without the wherewithal to buy, and our last position would be very much worse than the first. I do not wish to labour the subject. It seems to me that we are discussing the general principles of protection instead of the item under discussion. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to thank the Honorary Minister for his courteous reply to my question as to why it was necessary to increase the duty from 27&#189; per cent, to 45 per cent. I have found no evidence of failure on the part of those engaged in the manufacture of machinery in Australia to carry on reasonably well under the 1921 tariff. The Minister has suggested that the higher we make the protective Avail, the better it will be for the people; but that is a fallacious argument. I contend that the advantage that would be gained by the workers would be very small, having  regard  to the additional burden that would be placed on the general community. I  realize  that  it  is useless for me to say more than that I protest against the imposition. </para>

                <para class="block">I shall deal first with the British preferential tariff. Under the 1921 schedule, local manufacturers received the advantage of a duty of 27&#189; per cent, ad valorem. To that had to be added the cost of freight and other charges, which, in the case of heavy road-rollers, were considerable. It is estimated that freight and other charges of transportation on a road-roller imported from Great Britain would be approximately the same as the duty imposed under the 1921 tariff. The total protection afforded to Australian manufacturers of road-rollers under the 1921 tariff Was thus from 50 to 60 per cent. </para>

A heavy and bulky machine like a road-roller  Would  bear much heavier freight charges than goods -which could be packed in a small space. The duty on a road-roller costing &#163;700 in Great Britain was, under the 1921 tariff, &#163;212; under the Government&#39;s proposals the duty on a similar roller will be &#163;308, an increase of &#163;96. </para>

Our manufacturers have to pay higher wages and higher prices for material. They have not the advantage in freight, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> suggested, except in respect of markets strictly local. The cost of freight, say, from Melbourne to Sydney or Hobart is probably as great as it would be from Europe to Sydney or Hobart. What has been termed &#39;&#34; natural protection &#34; disappears as far as the interstate market is concerned. </para>

I asked whether the Tariff Board had considered that aspect of the case in making its report, and, if so, would the Minister be good enough to let the committee know whether the output per man in Australia was comparable with the output per man in other parts of the world. The question of the payment of higher wages does not affect the issue except to lead one to expect a higher degree of efficiency in return for higher wages. I think that my request for information respecting the Tariff Board and its investigations should be complied with.

                        <para>- The honorable senator will see from the statistical returns relating to our own industries that it is quite impossible to ascertain the output per man respecting any particular machine or number of machines. Wages in Australia are 100 per cent, higher than those in Great Britain, and must, therefore, be a great deal higher than those in Belgium, Germany, or other European countries. What is asked for is a 40 per cent, ad valorem duty, which is not equal to the difference between the cost of wages and material here and abroad. </para>

                <para class="block">This paragraph as it at present stands applies to locomotives required by State Governments. A very striking illustration of the way in which it would operate is furnished by developments that have recently taken place in South Australia. The Railways Commissioner there, a progressive officer, determined upon an improvement of the railway system, and, to that end, with the- sanction of the government of the day, embarked on a developmental policy that will cost that State something like &#163;5,000,000. Of that amount, &#163;3,500,000 will be spent in Australia, and the balance in buying various equipment, some of which is not available here and some of which is available, but at prices far in advance of what is thought to be reasonable. </para>
