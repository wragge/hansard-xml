          <para>- This is one of the weakest clauses, in the bill. It reveals the defects of the&#39; past and purposes to perpetuate them. It provides that if the commission is of opinion that the construction of any railway in Northern Australia is desirable, it shall so report to the Minister, and the Minister will then refer the matter to the Railways Commissioner, who, after much circumlocution, will proceed with the survey. Why not vest the commission with authority to do whatever may be necessary to ensure the development of the Northern Territory? If the commission believes that a railway should be built, why should it have to report to the Minister? </para>

            <para>- Certainly. We may presume that one of the commissioners will have knowledge of railway construction. If not, the commission will act on the advice of experts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that the Government did not intend to allow the commission to create a big staff of officials . It matters little what the intentions of the Government may be. Our experience has been that, as soon as a commission is appointed, it proceeds to gather around itself a big staff, and I have no doubt that the Northern Australia Commission will do the same. Under the proposed arrangement, there will be interminable delay in the carrying out of any important public works such as railway construction, and this is what we should seek to avoid. We should not repeat the mistakes that have occurred during the whole period of the Northern Territory administration. </para>

Parliament, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> should have no voice in the matter at all. Neither House would allow a subsidiary body created by Parliament to load the Government with financial obligations. </para>

          <para>- Parliament would never agree to do as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> suggests. The honorable senator&#39;s other point is that under the proposed arrangement there will be some delay in carrying out public works in the&#39; Northern Territory. I do not agree with him. The commission, if it thinks that a railway is necessary, will submit its scheme to the Minister, and if it is approved, plans and estimates must be prepared before the Ministry can get parliamentary approval. It may get the necessary information through the commission. That body would have to organize the staff of engineers, draftsmen, and other officials who might be wanted for only portion of the year. Obviously <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> wiser course is to utilize the existing staff in the office of the Railway Commissioner. I cannot see that there will be any delay as  suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline></para>

          <para>.- When the bill was first drafted for presentation to the last Parliament, we communicated with the Governments  of Western Australia and Queensland. (We intimated the general lines upon which the bill would be framed, and asked whether, they would consent to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth as contemplated in this clause. Both Governments said that they would prefer to defer their decision until the bill had actually been passed, and until they knew the conditions under which portions of their States might be dealt with by the commission. The Prime Minister and I have discussed this matter with Western Australian Ministers, and the understanding is that it is premature at this juncture to negotiate. I understand that both  Governments are willing to take up the matter when the bill becomes law, and to deal with the conditions, if any, under which the commission considers that, portions of those States should be administered by it. A glance at the map will show that any .developmental policy undertaken in Northern Australia should have some relation to the contiguous territories of Western Australia and Queensland. It might be advantageous if certain developmental works were carried out jointly on behalf of the respective Governments. The interests of the Victoria River country are identical with those of the East .Kimberly country, and the Victoria River country has also an interest in the ports on the Western Australian coast. On the other hand, the Barkly Tablelands country on the eastern portion of the Territory has interests in common with those in the western district of Queensland, and both have an interest in possible ports on the Gulf of Carpentaria. Therefore, in any schemes of development, either by way of roads, stock routes, railway communication or telegraph lines, we have to contemplate that a joint work would assist the development of the land in not only the Northern Territory, but also portions of Western Australia and Queensland. There are many other questions to be considered, including to what extent such territories would be placed under the commission, the representation of the&#39; States on the commission, the financial liability to be incurred, and on whose behalf and on what terms and conditions. This clause is drafted to allow these matters to be the subject of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of Western Australia and Queensland if the Governments concerned are agreeable. I therefore suggest that it would be wise,  at this juncture, not to go further and prejudice negotiations by expressing an opinion as to the conditions. It is obvious that the States have certain rights in regard &#39; to their territory, and &#34;we cannot presume to say what those rights are. I am sure both State Governments will be quite willing to negotiate, although it may happen that we may not be able to come to an agreement. It would be in the interests of the Commonwealth and both the States to regard the problem as one. </para>

We prefer to wait until the bill is law, and then make the matter a subject of negotiation at a conference. I think a .joint policy desirable. The whole problem should be tackled as one, without regard to geographical lines, which are not divisions of interests, but merely arbitrary divisions. </para>

          <para>.- I should like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to explain why the control, of the Territory is to be divided in the manner provided in this clause. I was under the impression that the commission would have the same powers of control over Central Australia that it has over Northern Australia, but it now appears that the activities of the commission are to be confined to the northern portion of the Territory. Clause  17  distinctly restricts the powers of the commission to the country north of the twentieth parallel of south latitude. Will not the commission have any controlling influence over the development of the southern portion of the Territory when a division is made? </para>

          <para>. -  I thought I explained that point fully when introducing the bill. I said then that it was felt that the developmental policy of what we term in this bill &#34; Central Australia &#34; could be more conveniently and more expeditiously carried out from the present administrative centre at Melbourne or, later, from Canberra. There is, for instance, a railway to Oodnadatta, and the policy of the Government is to extend the existing railway. The country in the vicinity of Oodnadatta is not cut off from the administrative centre of the Commonwealth, as is the northern portion. The Territory comprises approximately  500,000  square miles, and one-half; of that - the northern portion, which is practically isolated - is quite large enough for the commission to handle. It is obvious, however, that in the matter of land administration there can be no such arbitrary division as nature makes in regard to development, since both the land in the south and in the north of the Territory is suitable for pastoral purposes. The Government has decided that it would be wise to have uniform land administration throughout the Territory, as the one portion is linked up with the other. Land&#34; administration in both North and Central Australia, is being placed under the control of the commission. </para>

The commission will not be entrusted with the responsibility of preparing a scheme of railway development for Central Australia, but in patting forward a scheme for the north, it must pay due regard to any railway running through Central Australia. </para>

          <para>. -  I should like to ask if the Government has had in the operations of the existing advisory council in the Northern Territory sufficient warrant for perpetuating this system? The people of the Territory will still have their representative in the Commonwealth Parliament, who will be able to voice their grievances; yet superimposed will be an advisory council, such as no other territory of the Commonwealth has. Broadly, I think the appointment of these advisory councils is a farce. Their powers will be very limited; they will not be able to touch any of the work of the commission, and will be nothing but the fifth wheel of the coach. We shall have in each division of the Territory a government resident to advise the Government, and to represent it in all matters outside the ambit of the authority of the commission, so that the advisory council will be reduced almost to a nullity. What will the council advise on ? In the Territory we shall have two government residents, one in North Australia and one in Central Australia. There will also be a representative in the Commonwealth </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Parliament, representing a handful of population. Yet, on top of all this, it is proposed to have advisory councils at each seat of government in the Territory. Unless the existing system of having an advisory council in the Territory has been of some real public benefit I see no reason for its adoption in this bill. I think we have carried this kind of thing to a ridiculous excess in our community. The trouble is that the people who have to find the money for the development of the Northern Territory are standing off in the distance. They have no advantageous means of furthering their interests at any time. Their job is to find the money and be quiet. On the other hand, the people in whose territory the expenditure takes place, and who have the advantage of electing advisory councils are not finding any of the money in proportion to their numbers. It is a farcical position. I think the Territory would be very well looked after by bringing the authority of the Government right in front of the people, in the first place by the appointment of a commission, in the second place by the splitting of the authority into two administrations, and in the third place by the shifting of the seats of administration. On top of that, of course, is their representation in the Commonwealth Parliament. In view of the fact that the bulk of the work - at any rate all that matters - will be in the hands of the commission, with which the advisory councils dare not interfere, to my mind the proposal to appoint these councils is foolish, and will only lead to the establishment of a bureaucratic system that is not warranted. It will be carrying representative government to a ridiculous extreme. We can really go too far in this direction. The bill proposes to look after the Territory jealously enough without overloading it with a bureaucracy in both centres for a population of about 3,000 people. My advice to the Government is to give the delegated power provided for in the bill a chance without overloading it in this complicated fashion. I feel inclined to vote against the clause unless the Minister can advise us that the existing advisory council in the Territory is serving some useful purpose. If, for instance, the administrator has advised the Government that in the past he has found the advice of these men useful and in the public interests, I shall withdraw my objection, but if, on the contrary, he has not advised the Government to that effect,  I  see no reason for darting out into the realm of speculation by making these fanciful and unnecessary additions to the devolution of governmental power as elsewhere proposed by the bill. The people in the Territory will do very well without being saddled with this excrescence on the system proposed to be adopted. </para>

          <para>. - I  can best explain the position by mentioning some of the subjects that are left out of the control of the commission, and upon which the advisory councils will have the right to give advice. They are aborigines, education, police, health, mines, and fishing. There are also such matters as stock, brands, and dingoes, which are dealt with by ordinances, and which are of real importance to pastoralists. The idea is to have two_ members of each advisory council elected.&#34; In North Australia the probability is that the two persons elected to the advisory council will be chosen by the people of Darwin, which is overwhelmingly the biggest centre of population. Therefore, the two elected will represent the industrial section in - North Australia. In those circumstances, the two who will be nominated will represent the pastoral industry, or, perhaps, one may represent pastoral interests and the other the mining industry. The people are very much interested in the subjects upon which these councils will be invited to give advice to the Government Residents. The aborigines question, for instance, is a live matter in the Northern Territory, where there are large numbers of aborigines. Questions often arise between the Government and the residents as to the protective care exercised over the natives employed by them, and as to the conditions in which natives may be employed. The half-caste problem is also important, because it is from the halfcastes that the supply of domestic labour is obtained. </para>

He will have all these things under his control, and as administrative officer in the Territory he will be responsible for all of them. The advisory council will be a small body called together, say, a couple of times a year to give its opinion on the ordinances under which the people of the Territory are carrying on their work. These ordinances will affect the education of their children, their health, and matters relating to dingoes, stock and brands, all being questions of vital importance to them. The council will be able to pass resolutions giving advice to the Government Residents, which can be passed on to the Commission.

            <para>- Not necessarily.. The other two members of the council will be nominated. On the other hand, in Central Australia where the pastoralists are in the majority the two elected men will probably be pastoralists, and the others may be nominated to represent the mining industry, which has great possibilities in the Macdonnell Ranges. I do not say that these advisory councils will be of great practical use at the outset, but we are endeavouring to blend into this bill the germ of future local self-government. Our Australian systems of local self-government all commenced in a small way and on the same lines. First of all, the local body was wholly nominee; later on it was partly nominee and partly elective. The partly-nominated and partly-elected councils had very limited powers in the early days of the colonies. There were quite a number of subjects over which the Colonial Office in London had complete control, and on which the local  councils were not able even to give advice. Nevertheless, these local bodies were the germ of local self -government in Australia, a germ which has grown until to-day we have full power of self-government in all the States and in the Federation. The people in the Northern Territory are British, and whether we agree or disagree with their views, they surely have a right to express them on the conditions under which they are living. We are anxious to give them some opportunity to make their voices heard, and give advice which may or may not be acted on. It is desirable in all communities to train men in the art of government, which is not easily acquired, and is mainly achieved through, a long course of training. It brings some sense of responsibility to men if they are placed in positions where they have a voice in the making of laws, and if there is a bolshevik element in Darwin, as an honorable senator has suggested, the best way to cure it is to ring home to it some sense of responsibility. Let us give the people there the opportunity to say what they think about things. It will not do any harm. Under the British Constitution it has always been found that the best safety valve is to let people talk and &#34; blow off steam,&#34; provided they keep within reason. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HENRY</inline>BAR WELL (South Australia) &#91;11.47&#93;. - I entirely disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> regarding the advisory councils, and I go very much further than the Minister himself. The Minister said that he did not think these councils would be of much practical use, but I think they will be of great practical use. Both the Minister and I have been in the Territory, and have travelled extensively in it on several occasions, and neither he nor I would say that we know very much about its real problems. I assume that every member of the advisory councils, whether appointed by the Government or elected by the residents, will have had long experience in the Territory, and will have a good grasp of the problems affecting it. A big pioneering work is being undertaken. To the Government and people in the south the Territory is almost an unknown country. The practical problems that will have to be dealt with are problems about which the Administration here knows very little. The first-hand knowledge and information that, will come to the commission and the Government as a result of the appointment of the advisory councils will be of great value. These councils will be very different from those in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> Those to which he referred deal with matters that are common knowledge. In the Northern Territory, on the other hand, we have to deal with unknown quantities. I regard this clause as one of the wisest provisions in the bill. </para>

Two will be appointed by the Government, two will be elected by the people, and the government resident will preside. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who knows something about , the Territory, will, on reflection, agree that it is important that there should , be advisory councils. It is doubtful whether the men who will be appointed to the commission will have had much actual experience of the north of Australia, and it will take them a long time to get an insight into the matters with which they will have to deal. </para>

I believe at all times in trusting the people. The people of the Territory surely know the type of men that should represent them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> eats and drinks bolshevism, and dreams of it when he sleeps. Perhaps he does not sleep, for the bogy seems to be always chasing him. Whenever he comes here his mind is disturbed, and he works himself into a fury at the very mention of anything democratic.

            <para>- Darwin is part of Australia, and people there are entitled to the same rights as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> We have heard a lot from him about the disabilities under which the people there labour. They do not live in mansions, like gentlemen of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> calibre. They do not, to the same extent, enjoy the pleasures . of life and the comforts which a big fortune brings. And yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> would take away from them the right to elect representatives to an advisory council, and his reason is that &#39; &#39; the men elected are sure to be bolsheviks.&#34; There are no bolsheviks in this country. If there are any persons in Australia connected with the bolshevik, communist, or Independent Workers of the World organizations, they will be very game to remain here after the passing of the iniquitous bill introduced in another place yesterday. They cannot remain if the Government carries out the provisions of that bill. I always stand for the people having the right to elect the members of councils of this kind. The bill provides for a majority of government representatives, which is undemocratic. The Government would be well advised to alter the clause, and give the people the right to four representatives with the Government Resident as  chairman. </para>

        <para>SenatorFOLL(Queensland) &#91;11.55&#93;. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh&#39;s</inline> remarks are most extraordinary. I remind honorable senators that this bill is one of the most generous proposals ever brought forward by any Government for the administration of any territory. He should remember that in the election of Federal and State Parliaments and municipal councils those who exercise the vote also find the money. We in this chamber represent those who will find the money for the development of the Northern Territory. Each State has to find its proportion of the money. Practically none of the expenditure in the Territory, either on administration or developmental work, will be found by the people who live there. The proposal to give the people some representation on the advisory council is good, for it will provide a safety valve for them to blow off steam. As representatives of the taxpayers of Australia, honorable senators should retain for the people of Australia proper representation on these councils. </para>

I do not agree with the. view that because the people of Australia find the money for the development of the Territory, the residents of the Territory itself should not have any representation. These councils will be a distinct help to the commission, and residents of the Territory are best qualified to be members of them. </para>

            <para>- That an election stirs up interest in the Territory was proved when the first election took place there about three years ago to select a representative to sit in the House of Representatives. A number of candidates contested the election. It was a distinct departure from the settled habit of the people in the Northern Territory to take an interest in Federal election matters, but on this occasion they certainly did. At the recent election also considerable interest was displayed. The people decided that the gentleman whom they appointed in the &#39; first place to be their representative was worthy of their confidence, and they re-elected him. </para>

When I speak I have something definite to contribute to the debate. I do not speak on a matter unless I am keenly interested in it. I trust that even at this late hour the Government will agree to an alteration in the method of appointing the advisory council.

We must not forget that, although the Northern Territory is so far away, it is part of Australia. The people who live there are Australians, and they are permitted to send a representative . to this Parliament in an advisory capacity. I hope that the Government will allow them to elect the four members of the advisory council. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> view is that if the elective principle were applied, only people living in Darwin would be appointed to the advisory council. It is a pity to depart from the democratic principle of majority rule. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh</inline> has suggested that the Minister&#39;s objection could be overcome by a. division of the country into electoral districts, so that people following pastoral pursuits would secure representation on the advisory council. Apparently the Government wishes to appoint persons not resident in Darwin. In all probability the people there know as much of the needs of the interior as do those who follow the pastoral industry. </para>

          <para>. -  I am rather pleased that I introduced this subject and opened up a field for discussion. Certain honorable senators have expounded strange views. They stand, so they say, for the Moscow model of election. I believe that for this country the British model is superior- to the Moscow system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh,</inline> a few minutes ago, thought fit to taunt me with alleged inattention to my legislative duties. . Well, my position in this chamber compares, favorably with his. He prides himself upon the regularity of his attendance. I remind him that the waste paper basket is here every day, and that it, at least, serves some useful purpose. Even if what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh</inline> said was correct - and that I deny - quite recently the electors of Western Australia had an opportunity to express their opinion, with the result that I am in my present position to-day. As far as this bill is concerned, I think the advisory council might very well be eliminated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell,</inline> a . strong advocate of consistency, accepts this proposal for a partly elective advisory council, but does not approve the principle being applied to the appointment of the commission. Admirable though the elective system may be, it has not always succeeded in ministering to the end in view. If we want a job well done we must, in appointing men to important posts, have some regard for their fitness for the work before them. I rose to point out that as the commission will have the sole responsibility for the development of Northern Australia, its position will be quite different from that of an advisory council, which will be engaged in the minor details of administration. This proposal by honorable senators opposite to apply the elective system to the appointment of the advisory council is not followed in its entirety even under the Soviet plan of government. Whilst it may be good enough for the provinces of Russia, the tyrants who rule that unfortunate country take very good care that they themselves do not face it. They know that if they sought election under it they would never be heard of again. The British system, which applies the principle in moderation, is an admirable one. It is proposed to adopt it in part for the appointment of the advisory councils, which, in my opinion, will be a source of friction in the governmental activities. We shall have associated with the administration four men drawn from the various walks of life, who will on occasions be indulging in a policy of pinpricks. If the advice to be tendered be good advice, by all means let us have elective advisory councils. I am afraid, however, that we are rather unnecessarily overloading the bill. The people in the Northern Territory will be called upon to devote so much of their time to elections that they will have little time to work. There will be the triennial election for a representative in this Parliament, also an election every three years for the advisory councils, and an election yearly for the Port Darwin council. The handful of people there will spend more time in electing representatives to various public bodies than do people in any other part of the Commonwealth. Let us have the scheme launched first and see how it will work. For the present, there is no need to require a population of less than 4,000 people, scattered over such a vast area, to engage in elections almost every year. </para>

          <para>.- I fail to see why the elective principle should not be applied in its entirety under this clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> remark suggests that it will not be long before he is entirely opposed to it. We have this system in our municipal and parliamentary government. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh</inline> intends to test the feeling of the committee on this matter. The clause calls for criticism from another point of view. It specifies no particular duty for the Government Resident. The duties of the Government Resident are largely of a social character. </para>

        <para class="block">In objecting to the clause in its present form, I have no desire to delay the passage of the bill, but I think that much  better work could be accomplished by an advisory council constituted in the way I suggest. We do not wish the people of the Territory to have the impression that, because the Government has a majority on the advisory council it will not take any notice of those whom the people nominate. I was glad to hear the Minister say that the Government had considered the question of subdividing the Territory into electoral districts, and, possibly, having later a purely elective council. I trust the Minister will agree to the proposed new sub-clause. </para>

The work of the commissioners is fairly clearly set out in the bill. We know that* under it, as with all measures, regulations will be drafted under which, provided they do not in any way contravene the main provisions of the bill, work other than that already specified can be undertaken by the commission. It may be that regulations will be framed giving the three commissioners almost complete power to deal with any matter affecting the Northern Territory.

            <para>- There are some matters that could not well be dealt with by the advisory council. We do not know what regulations will be drafted by the Government when the bill comes into operation. What guarantee have we that those matters to which the Minister has apparently referred will be left absolutely in the hands of the advisory council? Under regulations a good deal of work could be taken from the council. I rose to support the amendment, and not with any desire to delay the passage of this important bill. We are as anxious as is the Government to see this measure passed as speedily as possible. If any delay has occurred in placing it on the statute-book, the blame rests, not upon honorable senators on this side of the chamber, but upon the Government. This measure could have been on the statute-book before now. It passed through nearly all its stages in this chamber a few months ago, but the Government, in its eagerness to get to the barrier in the political race, and to obtain more power, held it up. </para>

That is to say, all disputes in the Northern Territory will come before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court to disputes that are interstate in character, but a dispute in the Northern Territory will be heard before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court just as a dispute confined to Western Australia is heard before the State Arbitration Court. </para>

            <para>. - This bill is a familiar friend, which was considered by the last Parliament. Although it looks innocent, it contains provisions which are of vital importance to honorable senators on this side. It seeks to abolish the leasehold system of land tenure in . the Northern Territory. In the first place it amends the definition of &#34; Minister &#34; in section 2 of the principal act. That is merely a machinery alteration, but clause 3 says, &#34; Section 11 of the principal act is repealed.&#34; Therein lies the sting, for section 11 refers to the disposal of Crown lands - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>No Crown lands in the Territory shall be held or disposed of for any estate of freehold except in pursuance of some contract entered into before the&#39; commencement of this act. </para>
          <para class="block">I cannot understand why the Government seeks to abolish the leasehold system in the Territory. In the course of his second-reading speech, the right honorable the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that freehold titles would be granted only for town lands and agricultural lands, but not for pastoral lands. If the leasehold system is right for one- class of land, it is right for all classes. I wonder why it is considered necessary to depart from the existing system. I remember when the Leader of the Senate was himself a strong and staunch advocate of the principle he now seeks to abolish. </para>

The leasehold system is just as good to-day as it was when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> as a member of the Labour party, advocated it. The Minister has said that freehold titles will not be granted for pastoral lands, but we have no guarantee that when this bill is passed they will not be granted for pastoral lands. The Minister has not advanced a legitimate reason why the leasehold system should be departed from. He certainly said that private banks would not advance money on leasehold properties, and he exclaimed - </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It may be that &#39;private banks are disinclined&#39; to advance money to lessees, but in such a- matter we should not depend on them. We have a Commonwealth Government Bank that used to be regarded as the, people&#39;s bank, but, as the result of recent legislation, it is no longer- a people&#39;s bank. If that bank was functioning as it was intended to do by those who created it, it would advance money on leaseholds. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> also asked what chance a man would have of providing himself with a home in a Northern Territory town if only a leasehold title to the land was possible. Very shortly the seat of the Commonwealth Government will be at Canberra. It will be necessary when that time arrives for many civil servants and artisans and other people who are not under the control of the Government to reside there. But the Government does not propose to give a freehold title to any land there. If it will be difficult, in the opinion of the Minister, for a man to establish a home on a leasehold allotment in a Northern Territory town, why will not the same difficulty apply to Canberra ? Why should the Government differentiate between the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital Territory ? The only reason that the Minister gave  was that, as it was proposed to spend millions of pounds in the FederalCapital Territory, it was desirable that the unearned increment in the value of the land should belong to the public, and not to a few investors. But we have just agreed to a measure which must result in the spending of millions of pounds in the Northern Territory. Why is the Government prepared to allow the unearned increment in the value- of Northern Territory lands, in consequence of the spending of this Government money, to go to a few individuals instead of the general public, when it is not prepared to do so in the case of the Federal Capital Territory? I know of no argument iu favour of the leasehold system for the Federal Capital Territory that does not apply with equal force to the Northern Territory. The Minister argued that it would not matter very much if a leasehold title were given to certain land in the Northern Territory for the reason that the Government had power to impose a land tax. The inference from this is that the freehold system is really equivalent to the leasehold system. I entirely disagree. Once the Government grants a freehold title for this land, it has lost it for ever, unless it is willing to pay a very high price to resume it. The Crown has power to tax leasehold,  as well as freehold, land, and has exercised it. That the Government recognizes the possibility of having to pay dearly for any Northern Territory land that it may need to resume at any time is indicated by a provision in the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs Railway Bill, which explicitly provides that no compensation shall be paid for any leasehold land that may be required for the railway purposes. It is absurd to suggest that a country cannot be developed as well by the leasehold system as by the freehold system. Instances occur time and again that indicate that development occurs under the leasehold system. Some little time ago a newspaper report stated that there were 1,205 applicants, for a lease of 3,810 acres of land in the  Gilgil  parish -in New South Wales. Those people were not all foolish, nor were they afraid of leasehold land. That happening illustrates the land hunger of Australia. I could enumerate other instances of a similar nature. Not so very long ago there were between 3,000 and 4,000 applicants for some leasehold land that was made available by ballot. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> admits that people will take leasehold land without hesitation. In these circumstances there should be no difficulty in securing applicants for leasehold land in the Northern Territory if the conditions are liberal. It is unfair to the public to permit the increased value given to land in consequence of the construction of railways, roads, and water schemes, to go to a few investors. The value of privately-owned State lands has been greatly enhanced on many occasions by the building of railways. If the Federal Government builds a railway into the Northern Territory, the value of the land through which it passes will also be greatly enhanced. I submit that the enhanced value should benefit the public generally. We frequently see in our suburban areas splendid building blocks lying vacant because the owners will not sell until they can obtain an exorbitant price, that is made possible by the developmental activities of the local governing bodies. </para>

              <para>- The only effective way that I know of overcoming it is to tax the land on its unimproved value. Last year I debated at some length in the Senate a similar bill to this. I will therefore content myself on this occasion with briefly indicating my . opposition to the abolition of the leasehold system. I wish to see it retained, for I am confident that development in the Northern Territory will be just as rapid under it as under the freehold system. </para>

            <para>. - This measure is the outcome of an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia, and honours the compact made many years ago when the Commonwealth took over the Northern Territory. The proposal to construct a north-south railway has been before the Senate for the past fifteen years, so there has been ample time to finalize it. Whilst I commend the Government for having brought the negotiations up to this stage, credit also is clue to the South Australian Labour Government for its sincerity in the matter. </para>

              <para>- This matter, as I have said, has been before the public for the last fifteen years, and I cannot help thinking that it would have been much better had the line been built ten or twelve years ago, because then it would not have cost so much. The controversy as to the route was not a legitimate excuse for delay. The estimated cost of the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs railway, on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, is &#163;1,700,000, and the estimated cost of the alternate proposal, a line from Kingoonya to Alice Springs, on the 4-ft. 8&#163;-in. gauge is &#163;4,500,000. I gather from the Minister&#39;s speech that a railway from Oodnadatta will serve a better class of country. I am not so much concerned about the route - I leave this matter to departmental experts - but I am concerned about the gauge. We have heard a great deal in recent years about the necessity for a uniform gauge in Australia, and as a result of many conferences of experts and Premiers of the various States, we fixed upon the 4.-ft. 8&#163;-in. gauge as the standard. The Prime Minister in his policy speech said that the Government proposed to hold another conference with the States at an early date with a view to arriving at some scheme to enable further progress to be made in connexion with the provision of a uniform gauge. In my opinion such conferences are futile. The State Premiers are not experts in the matter of railway construction or gauges. A commission was appointed to consider the whole question, and it recommended a 4-ft. 8&#163;-in. gauge. In order to honour a longstanding promise, the Government is now proposing to construct a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, but it is still adhering to the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. Although I strongly object to the adoption of such a gauge in this instance, I shall support, the bill. It is to be hoped that finality will soon be reached, and that when other lines are to be constructed by the Commonwealth in any part of the Commonwealth, the fact that a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge has been recommended as the standard gauge for Australia will not be overlooked. With that reservation I support the second reading of the bill. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>. - I regret that my speech will, .to many honorable senators, be somewhat unpopular, as there seems to be a consensus of opinion in this Chamber that it is advisable to construct a railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. At the outset I desire to pay a tribute to South Australian governments for the very important work they have performed in settling the Northern Territory, and particularly to those which were associated with its early development. It has frequently been said that South Australian governments have neglected their duty in that regard, but the work they have performed has been of great value, particularly when one considers the limited resources at their disposal. The only settlement that has really been effective in the Northern Territory has been under the guidance of South Australian governments, who realized that the only way in which to populate and develop that vast area of country of varying quality was to grant leases at low rentals over long periods. In many instances leases were granted for 42 years at rentals of ls. to ls. 6d. per square mile, and in some cases, the tenure was  undisturbable,  as there was no resumption power. In those days <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crosthwaite</inline> and my father took up land on the Barkly Tablelands and elsewhere, on which large sums of money were spent, and these and other pioneers encountered numerous obstacles in an endeavour to develop it. In opposing the construction of a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs I trust that I shall not be accused of deprecating my own country. Some hard things have been said about me by my opponents, who have insinuated that I am a wealthy man, a beef baron, a land monopolist, and so forth: all of which is untrue. I am an Australian, and proud of it. I love my country, and when I criticize the capabilities of the outback country to be served by the proposed line, I trust hon.orable senators will realize that I am doing so only because I regard it as a duty to the people of Australia. I hope I shall never be foolish enough to say that any country is useless, because the practical experience I have had in the Mallee country of Victoria shows that such an assertion would be absurd. It is only a little over 30 .years ago that a royal commission appointed by the Victorian Government reported that the Victorian Mallee was useless, and that it would be a waste of money to build a railway into it. I have here to-day photographs of the Victorian Mallee when it was a vast wilderness. As a boy I had the unfortunate experience of seeing my father almost ruined on a station which he then held at Brim. In consequence of the advances which have since been made as a result of the application of science to industry, the property on which we were nearly ruined, which is not far north of Warracknabeal, is now worth from &#163;8 to &#163;10 per acre. Thirty years ago nearly every one in authority pronounced the far north-west portion of Victoria to be useless, and practically every one who took up land in that part was ruined. Later, the system of rolling down the Mallee scrub and burning it was introduced, and, owing to the inventive genius of an Australian, the stump-jump plough, which permits ploughing to be undertaken although there may be thousands of stumps in the ground, was used. Superphosphates were then introduced, and with effective ploughing and fallowing of the soil, the land is now most productive, and is regarded as one of Victoria&#39;s most valuable provinces. In good seasons it is a veritable waving wheat field. Even in a season such as the present, which has been dry, Mallee land is returning in some instances up to 20 bushels per acre, and is selling up to &#163;15 per acre. Having these facts in mind, it would be foolish to express the opinion that any land in Australia is valueless. Nevertheless, my contention regarding the proposed line is that the agreement with South Australia can be honoured by adopting a different route. The proposal is to con&#34; struct a line from Oodnadatta through comparatively poor country to Alice Springs. </para>

              <para>- I arn guided very largely by the opinions expressed by explorers, pastoralists, and drovers, who have given very disappointing reports concerning the nature of- the country which the proposed line will serve&#39;. Since 1882 I have kept a book of newspaper extracts and other records in which the opinions of explorers and pastoralists are carefully recorded. All of these show that the country is very dry, and most of it extremely light carrying,. In order to ascertain if the proposed extension is likely to induce settlement, we have only to consider what has occurred since the line was extended from Marree to Oodnadatta. Since that line has been open for traffic, settlement has actually decreased. </para>

              <para>- I cannot agree with, the honorable senator, because the Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> in introducing the bill in another place, stated that the Commonwealth&#39;s legal advisers had distinctly stated that our compact with South Australia could still be honoured if a line were constructed in the direction I have indicated. It is easy to listen to the opinions of theorists concerning the settlement of our out-back country, but all the pioneers who endeavoured to settle in the Macdonnell Ranges became insolvent. I admit there is a pocket of comparatively good looking country in that locality, but no one has ever made money there. If the land the proposed line is to serve is of good quality, why has it not been taken up before? I have had prepared by the South Australian authorities a map of the country occupied in the Northern Territory up to the date of its preparation. It shows that a few new leases have been taken up since the new land ordinance was brought in. This map will show honorable senators that a comparatively small area of land has been taken up in the southern end of the Territory around Alice Springs. </para>

              <para>- I would not take it if I were given it for fifty years for nothing. I do not want to lay stress on the poorness of this land, because the remarks one makes about the poorness of certain portions of Australia get into the press and are, perhaps, cabled abroad, giving people a wrong impression of this wonderful country of ours, of which I am so proud. Nevertheless, I must speak of it as a man who has had practical experience. Land settlement is part of my work. I do not wish to introduce family matters into this discussion, but my people were practically the only successful pioneers in the Northern Territory. We have sold out now, but I am still interested in land close by which this railway will pass. </para>

              <para>- That is the route I should like to see adopted for many reasons, which I shall explain. I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> to indicate that if a line were built to Alice Springs, it would open up country. A glance at the map will show that the country he refers to has been available for fifty years, and we cannot get it taken up. Why build this railway with the idea that the land will be taken up and that there will be a revenue from it ? </para>

One of our greatest dangers is that people are induced to go out into country reported on in enthusiastic terms by theorists, newspaper writers, and persons who have visited it in motor cars.

              <para>- The committee passed through three properties held by companies, of which I am the liquidator. They reported upon it as being lovely country, well worthy of a railway, and fit to grow anything. During the year of their visit, we had 19 inches of rain there. We have not had half that quantity in the subsequent five years. The rainfall in the following year was 1.20 inches. It has not reached 5 inches in any year since that abnormal year, when 19 inches fell. I have photographs with me showing a homestead and the nature of the country surrounding it under normal conditions, and also as it was when the inspection was made by the Public Works Committee. There is no demand for land in that district, as I can show. There is no land hunger there, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> would have us believe there is. People must not be led away by seeing country in an abnormally good season, when the grass and herbage is knee high, and when there is surface water which may not be seen again in a lifetime. We must bear in mind that there is always considerable growth in such parts of Australia after heavy rain, because the country is unstocked.  I do not wish to weary honorable senators in speaking on this matter, but I have. been brought up in a pioneer atmosphere. I am the son of a pioneer who has pioneered many parts of Australia since 1849. One of his most successful ventures was in the Northern Territory, although it was a frightful struggle for 30 years. I have for the last 30 years taken a keen interest in land settlement problems, particularly in the outback, where one can get cheap country, and I have been connected with ventures, some of which have been successful in the long run, but some of which have been the reverse. As liquidator of a company, I have just effected the sale of three properties 33 miles from the railway at Marree - a most disappointing venture. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I was interested in a property in the Territory. It covered an area of 2,000 square miles, and we spent about &#163;112,000 in developmental work before getting any return. We shall get nothing back from the properties which I have just sold near Marree. They cover an area of 1,025 square miles; there are three bores, and a tank of 12,000 cubic yards. In wet seasons there are plenty of lakes and swamps. In one bore there is a flow of 500,000 gallons a day. The property has a tenure of 42 years. There were over 1,000 head of cattle on it, 808 horses, and incidentally some goats. I have just sold the lot, leases, stock, and improvements, for &#163;5,000. </para>

              <para>- I do not know whether the honorable senator was ever interested in it, but I warn him not to invest too much of his capital in the country where the line is to be built. The property which I have just sold is neither the best nor the worst, but it was taken up by some pretty clever men who had a lot of experience. It covers the  Peachawarrina, Tankamerna,  and  Dulkaninna  leases. We bought one of the leases from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sydney</inline> Kidman, who is no fool. Experience affords practical proof of the value of that country to-day. You advertise, advertise, and advertise,, and try hard for fully twelve months to sell, and you cannot get more than the actual value of the stock on the property when you finally dispose of it. </para>

              <para>- Some have said so. It is said that the line will open up a lot of country, and that there will be a revenue from it. Where that revenue is to be obtained I do- not know. The Northern Territory Acceptance Act of 1910 gave it clearly to be understood that a line was to be built, but no time limit was fixed for the building of it. Therefore there is no need to rush this project. I can quite understand the enthusiasm of South Australian senators in pushing this line for all they are worth; I am a Victorian senator, but I speak as an Australian. I may he wrong in the view I take of this matter, but I am saying what I believe to be right, whether <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> remarks are popular or not. I shall always say in this Senate what I think is right. That is why I say now that I think it will be a flagrant waste of public money to build this line to a dead end at Alice Springs. It is not necessary at the present juncture. The Commonwealth is bound to build a North-South line penetrating the northern boundary of South Australia, but the act does not say where that northern boundary of South Australia is to be penetrated. It does not say which route the line is to take beyond the northern boundary of South Australia. </para>

I do not mind how much money we spend in Australia on developmental or reproductive works, but I maintain that the line provided for in the bill, which will cost &#163;3,000,000, will not produce any revenue worth considering. A line through Western Australia, where there is a large area of good undeveloped sheep and other country, or through the Barkly Tablelands, to connect with the Great Western railway system of Queensland, and perhaps with an extension, of the Bourke line in New South Wales, would tap country that can be profitably settled.

I should be the last person to suggest the breaking of the contract unless evidence can be produced that will convince - the people of South Australia,&#39; with whom the contract was made, that the breaking of it would be in the interests of Australia. The Commonwealth law authorities have advised that the line can follow a deviation to link up with the Queensland system. The line from Darwin to Daly Waters is 360 miles long. If the proposed (railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, is built, there will, then be 778 miles of 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line in that part of Australia. On that point I wish to  cross  swords with the Acting Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham),</inline> who criticized the Government for building more lines to a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. Those members of Parliament &#39;.who had the privilege of visiting South Africa during the latter part of 1924 travelled 8,000 odd miles over 3-ft. 6-in. gauge railways. The South African railway system is one of the most efficient I have seen, and is particularly good for an extensive and sparsely settled country, with so many outback problems to solve. The South African railways haul goods at cheaper rates than are charged by the Australian railways. I ask leave to continue my remarks on the resumption of the debate. </para>
