          <para>.- Before the motion is carried I trust the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will make a more definite statement regarding the powers with which the commission and the advisory council - referred to in clauses 17 and 44 of the bill - are to be clothed. The measure, which consists of 61 clauses, is of great importance to the Commonwealth and to the people of Australia, but if the two clauses I have mentioned were eliminated it would be a mere skeleton. In these circumstances any further consideration devoted to these two provisions would &#39; be time well spent, particularly if wo could get a more definite pronouncement from the Minister than we have been able to obtain up to the present.

            <para>- I intend to deal with only two. Under regulations all matters other than those specifically mentioned in clause 17 may be dealt with by the commission. The Minister in introducing the bill said that other matters such as education and the treatment and  care of aborigines, which are very important, would not be dealt with by the commission. I wish to be assured that the advisory council will be clothed with sufficient powers to deal with questions such as those to which the Minister referred, but there is nothing in the bill to that effect. I know of no question of greater importance to the people than that of health. It is more important than wealth. In tropical Australia conditions are not what they are in the more temperate zones. To whom is the question of health to be referred, and by whom is it to be considered ? Will it be handled by the commissioner or by the advisory council ? Sub-clause 1  of clause 44 reads: - </para>

        <para class="block">Apparently the advisory council will have the opportunity to advise the Government resident upon any question. Is the council to be a body to advise and recommend, but without power to do any. thing ? The questions to be dealt with by the commission and the advisory council should be clearly specified in the bill. Perhaps I imagine something that is not likely to happen, but if all matters including those that come under the jurisdiction of the commission itself, can be considered by the advisory council there may be a division of opinion and possibly conflict between the two bodies. </para>

The advisory council may be seriously considering a question of - great importance to the Northern Territory when it discovers that under regulations just passed the matter cannot be further dealt with by it. Before the bill is finally disposed of I trust the Minister will consider the suggestion I have made - that matters to be dealt with by the commission and by the advisory council should be clearly specified in the bill. The right honorable gentleman has given us an idea of the matters that may be dealt with by the advisory council. </para>

          <para>. - I thought the position was clear iy defined. There can be no conflict between the commission and the advisory councils. The powers of the commission, which are specifically stated in clause 17, may be added to by regulation. Some question of development may arise which should be referred to the commission. To do that, in the absence of the general provision that I have mentioned it would be necessary to introduce into Parliament an amending bill. That is avoided by this provision. At the same time, Parliament will have full control, and the Minister will not have an altogether free hand, for all such regulations must, in the ordinary course, be laid upon the table of the Senate. If any honorable senator so desired he could move then that they be disallowed. As motions for the disallowance of regulations take precedence over all other business, honorable senators would have ample opportunity to take steps to counteract any extraordinary action that a Minister might take. </para>

            <para>- That is so. The position of the advisory council is also quite clearly defined. At present matters relating to health, mines, justice, police, fisheries, aborigines, and so on are administered directly by the Minister through the Administrator. The only change that it is proposed to make is to provide that, instead of an Administrator for the whole of the Northern Territory, a Government Resident shall be appointed in North Australia and in Central Australia, who will administer these matters under the authority of the Minister. Associated with the Government Residents, in an advisory capacity only, will be advisory councils. The advisory councils will have power to advise the Government Resident in respect of all matters affected by new ordinances, and also in respect to matters affected by existing ordinances. This power will apply only to matters that are not- controlled by the commission. The advisory councils will have no executive powers whatsoever, and will be authorized only to advise the Government Resident. The Government Resident may, if he deems it wise, accept the recommendations of the advisory council, or he may refer them to the Minister for consideration. </para>

            <para>- None whatever. The Government Residents are not obliged to accept the advice that is offered. The object of the councils is to give the people of the Northern Territory a voice, through their elected representatives, in all matters affected by the ordinances. The advisory councils may suggest alterations, but they will have no power themselves to effect any alteration. The difference between the authority of the commission and that of the advisory councils is that the former will be concerned only with matters of development, while the latter, and, of course, the Government Residents, will be concerned only with purely administrative matters. The administration of the ordinances in regard to health, for instance, vitally affects the people, and they, through the advisory councils, will be able to express their views upon the matter. The functions of government in all the States of the Commonwealth were carried on in the first place by means of advisory councils. After development occurred, these advisory councils were given legislative authority. The Government hopes that, at no distant date, the advisory councils in the Northern Territory will also be given legislative functions. That, however, will depend upon the development that occurs. </para>

If this bill be rejected, which I think is not likely, nothing can be done towards building the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs railway. I sincerely trust that we shall complete our discussion of this measure before the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs Railway Bill is further proceeded with. This measure has been introduced to ratify an agreement that was made between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> and the Premier of South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gunn),</inline> partly to carry out an agreement made many years ago by the Commonwealth Government, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was Prime Minister, and the Government of South Australia, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> was Premier of that State. That agreement is a comprehensive document which provides, among other things, that &#34; the Commonwealth shall construct or cause to be constructed, as part of the transcontinental railway, a railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway, to connect with the other part of the transcontinental railway at a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper.&#34; Fifteen years have elapsed since that agreement was entered into. </para>

If the line had been constructed when the agreement was first entered into, the cost would have been much less than it is to-day. The necessity for . this railway is obvious. It is essential not only for the development of the country that is contiguous . to the proposed route, but also because of the value that it possesses from the point of view of defence. Railways . are always essential to both the development and the defence of a nation. One of the most important features of the agreement is in clause 4, which provides - </para>

            <para>- The agreement also provides that while the railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill is being constructed the Commonwealth shall lay a&#187; third rail from Red Hill to Adelaide, which will widen . that line to the 4-ft. 8&#189;in. gauge. But if it is found impracticable or dangerous to adopt the thirdrail principle, the State may construct at the expense, of the Commonwealth, a 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. line from Red Hill to Adelaide, over a route to be determined by agreement between the Railways Commissioners of the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia. Let me at this point quote this very important clause of the agreement - 6. (c) If in the opinion of the Railways Commissioners of the Commonwealth and of the State it would be impracticable or dangerous on any portion of the said railway from Red Hill to Adelaide to use a railway with a third rail, then in lieu of laying a third rail on such portion a new railway on a 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge shall be constructed by the State at. the expense of the Commonwealth over a route to be determined by agreement between the said Commissioners to take the place of the said portion of railway, but so always that there will be a continuous railway on a 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge from Port Augusta to the Central Railway Station in Adelaide. </para>

I marvel at the readiness of the &#39; Commonwealth to even consider the adoption of the third rail. I am not a railway expert, but I have in my hand the report of a commission which was appointed by the Common-  wealth Government to inquire into . this very matter. The commission reported that the third rail proposal was both impracticable and dangerous. Every member of it was a railway expert, and it unanimously condemned the proposition. When the Government  decided to construct the Brisbane-Kyogle line on the 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge, ministers told us that that was to be the beginning of the unification of the railway gauges throughout. Australia - that the advice of the commission hadbeen accepted. But why, in the present bill, has the commission&#39;s recommendation been discarded and the third rail device introduced ? </para>

        <para>This commission has examined a number of devices which were not presented to the board of experts in 1918, and in each instance has decided adversely to the device.

        <para>In very few cases had the inventor, or designer, any extended knowledge of railway conditions; none had looked at the problem in its broadest aspect, and very few had more than a most hazy idea of what the ultimate cost in time and money might be if his particular device were to be used. </para>

Such installations are approved. They are very simple affairs compared, with the use of third-rail construction over a material mileage of railway. </para>

We confirmed this decision in the agreement for the construction of the Kyogle-South Brisbane railway, and we should incorporate a similar provision in this measure. i anticipate that before, work is commenced on the Red Hill to Port Augusta line, we shall have the report of the Public Works Committee before us. Possibly it will help us. i understand that the construction of that line will shorten the journey between Adelaide and Port Augusta by 70 miles, and reduce the travelling time by about four hours. Travelling on the railway between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, if we except the climatic conditions during certain months of the year, is, on the whole, comfortable. The same cannot be said of the section between Port Augusta and Terowie. i am not opposed to the ratification of the agreement, but i object to the third rail proposal, and i hope that the Public Works Committee will emphasize the necessity for adopting the 4-ft. 8&#167;-in. gauge as another step in the direction of the complete unification of railway gauges in Australia </para>

          <para>. - In supporting the second reading of the bill, I should like to say that I am keenly interested in the unification of railway gauges in Australia. I have referred to this problem on more than one occasion in this chamber. i understand that under this agreement South Australia is prepared to allow the Commonwealth to link up Port Augusta with Adelaide by means of a third rail between Port Pirie and Adelaide. If the Public Works Committee rejects the proposal for a third rail, the Commonwealth will be obliged to build a 4-ft. 8^-in railway. Experts, who have inquired into the third rail principle, have rejected it, but I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb,</inline> the South Australian Railways Commissioner, favours its adoption on the line to Port Augusta. </para>

For the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> I may explain that the railway between Adelaide and Red Hill is on the 5 -ft. 3-in. gauge, and that the South Australian Government desires, if there is to be an extension to Port Augusta from Red Hill, on the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge, to have a third rail as far as Port Pirie. There will then be a uniform gauge right from Kalgoorlie to Adelaide. </para>

What would be the position between the contracting parties if the Commonwealth Government declined to proceed with the last two mentioned undertakings? Would it be considered a breach of agreement, or of honour on the part of the Commonwealth Government? I do not know whether the agreement can be adopted in part or whether we have to accept it <inline font-style="italic">in globo.</inline> That is a question to which I suppose the Government has given consideration. If, by passing this bill, we shall commit ourselves to the three proposals, it will place Parliament in an awkward position, and bind us in a way of which I cannot approve until, at least, I am further enlightened. If one portion of the work under this agreement can be proceeded with independently, and the others dealt with later, as I think they should be, Parliament will be in a much better position. If only one undertaking were proceeded with, would it be said that a breach, of the agreement had been committed ? </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline>HENRY BARWELL  (South Australia)  &#91;4.16&#93;.-  The legal position, as I see it, is that, first of all, an agreement has been entered into between the Prime Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Premier of South Australia on behalf of the South Australian Government. That agreement, which is embodied in the schedule to this bill, is a variation of the original agreement entered into in  1907,  and ratified by the Commonwealth in  1910.  It is subject to ratification by the Commonwealth Parliament and the South Australian Parliament. That is why it is before us. If it is ratified by this Parliament, a special session of the South Australian Parliament will immediately be held to ratify or reject, the agreement; but, once the agreement is ratified by the Commonwealth Parliament and the South Australian Parliament, there is under it a distinct obligation upon the Commonwealth and upon the State of South Australia which will be binding , in every way. </para>

            <para>- Clause  2  provides that the agreement entered into shall be subject to ratification by the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia, and when that is done the agreement is binding upon the Commonwealth. I do not know whether I understood the Minister aright, but I believe he inferred that, even if this measure is passed, there will be no binding legal obligation upon the Commonwealth. If that is the Minister&#39;s contention, I do not agree with him. Once the agreement is ratified by both Parliaments, it is complete and binding in every way. </para>

            <para>- That is quite clear. In view of that, the last thing that we ought to do at this stage is to pass this bill.  We  ought first to answer the three questions that I have stated. I am strongly in favour of one proposal in the agreement, and strongly opposed to another. - We should be in a position to discuss each proposal entirely on its merits. I well remember reading a press report to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell,</inline> when Premier of South Australia, stated that he would not permit the Commonwealth Government to do anything in- the way of unifying the railway gauges in South Australia unless it connected Port Augusta with Adelaide by the 4-ft. 8&#189;in. gauge line. It would be manifestly unfair to ask the Senate to agree to this measure before it had had an opportunity to consider fully all the implications in the agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> has stated, the case quite clearly. If the bill is agreed to the Commonwealth Government will be definitely committed to build the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs railway. I prefer to consider the three bills which the Minister has said will follow this one, before I vote for the ratification of this agreement. &#39; If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has said, the passing of this bill will mean nothing at all, I can &#39; see no objection to submitting the other bills first. </para>

        <para class="block">The line may be of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, or of the 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge, but the Commonwealth is committed to the Alice Springs route. It is also committed to build, at its own expense, a railway of the 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge from Port Augusta to Red Hill. That becomes an obligation immediately the agreement is ratified. The Commonwealth is also obliged to lay a third rail fromRed Hill  to Adelaide. If, however, in the opinion of the Railways Commissioners of the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia it would be impracticable or dangerous to use the third rail, that need not be done. My point is that the agreement undoubtedly places definite obligations upon the Commonwealth. Unless these are complied with, the Commonwealth Government will be guilty of a breach of contract. </para>

If the third rail is not practicable, Port Augusta must be connected with Adelaide by a 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge line. If the committee agrees to this provision, it will tie its hands, and the bill that is to be submitted subsequently will have to be treated merely as a. formal measure.

            <para>. - When the debate was adjourned on Friday, I was referring to the efficiency of the South African railway system. Nobody is more favorable than I am to the unification of the railway gauges of Australia. I am, therefore, unable to account for the indecent haste that has been displayed in the endeavour to make honorable senators swallow, holus bolus, an agreement providing for the construction of a long line of railway through comparatively desert country, from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. The Commonwealth&#39;s obligation would not cease with the construction of that line ; it would have to continue the line on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge from Alice Springs to Daly Waters, and thence on to Darwin. The problem of the unification of the railway gauges would thus be made more acute. I believe that any new line of railway should be built to the standard gauge. This is not a party matter, and I shall endeavour to state my views quite impartially. I am not, either directly or indirectly, interested in land that is along or is likely to ba served by any of the suggested routes. I. am, therefore, merely performing what I conceive to be my public duty. Honorable senators, and other persons outside this chamber, have said a great deal regarding the necessity for opening up this country and developing it for the raising of sheep. I am afraid that they have had very little practical experience of the class of country through which the proposed line will be constructed, or the lack of water and the scarcity of feed. Even more important than those, however, is the tremendous cost of developing outback country so as to make it suitable to carry sheep.&#39; </para>

              <para>- I am; but not because I do not want to see money spent on railway development in Australia. I hope to see enormous sums spent in that direction, and I am fully aware that a north-south railway must be built; but what I am opposed to is having a particular route forced upon us. Taking Australia as a whole the average price that is being realized for wool at the present time is very little greater than the actual cost of production, even though the returns now are 50 to 60 per cent, higher than they were prior to the war. </para>

              <para>- I give it as my calm and deliberate opinion - and I am supposed to be an expert in the matter - that the present day price of wool is very little higher than the present day cost of production. Australia is the greatest wool-producing country in the world, and this year&#39;s clip of 2,250,000 bales is the greatest that she has ever produced. </para>

I have already endeavored to explain to honorable senators that I am not opposed to the construction of a north-south railway, but  that I .am opposed to the bill, because it definitely lays down the route that the railway shall traverse and the gauge upon which it shall be built. Some honorable senators doubtless think that, as I have not been over the country which this line will traverse-^ - </para>

              <para>- I have had to assist to find the cash to develop country, and I have handled many accounts that have been sent in by practical pioneers. I have noted the sad experience of a great many of the men who went into the back country and lost all they possessed. They were good practical men who struggled on for years. I desire to see an increase in population in the northern portion of Australia, and money spent on railway development, but I want, it done in the right way, and without any undue haste or heat. It seems that honorable senators from South Australia are obsessed with a craze, almost, to construct a railway through the worst part of Australia, without any consideration as to what is best in the interests of not only their own State, but the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>

              <para>-Eventually it was a great success. The station was located on the famous  Barkly  Tablelands, which I think should be developed by a railway. It may be thought from my criticism of the country in the neighbourhood of Marree and Oodnadatta, and the district proposed to de served by the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs, that I have exaggerated its unsuitability for stock, but I hope that honorable senators will not accuse me of making deprecatory remarks concerning Australia. &#39; </para>

Honorable senators from South Australia may assume, if they choose, that I know nothing about the country in question, the cost of developing it, or the best route to be followed: but I propose to give the first-hand opinions of practical men who have been over the route, not once or twice, as some honorable senators have, in a comfortable motor-car, travelling at 30 or 40 miles an hour, but scores of times - men who have walked and ridden over it, and traded in stock, or, rather tried to keep stock alive there. Their opinion is surely of greater value to the taxpayers of Australia than that of any honorable senator. </para>

              <para>-Good crops were produced in the Mallee districts of Victoria last season on a 4-inch rainfall, but we know that success depends entirely upon the period of the year in which the rain falls. There might be 20 or 30 inches of rain in a year, as in Africa, on land that looks suitable for wheat-growing, but in that country, not half the local requirements of wheat can be produced, because the rain, as in the northern part of Australia, falls at the wrong time of the year for cereal crops. Speaking of Alice Springs, which will probably be the terminus, in our lifetime, of the proposed line, the Minister for Works and Rail ways went on to explain that &#34; There is occasionally a period of two or three years during which no rain falls.&#34; That, surely, condemns the country at Alice Springs, which the most enthusiastic advocates of the railway contend is the best portion to be served by the line. </para>

            <para>It is obvious that if the country is to be developed to carry &#39; sheep, it will be necessary to not only sink wells at frequent intervals, but also to divide the holdings into small  vermin-proof  paddocks.

          <para class="block">I have discussed this problem during the last week with practical men&#39; who know the country well, and have had experience both in Central Australia and South-Western Queensland, and they inform me that nothing less than 1,000 square miles for each lessee would be of any use. I feel sure that the country could not be profitably developed to carry sheep, unless they were the super-sheep to which the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> has referred. There must have been some joke about the animals that the honorable member said he saw at Ryan&#39;s Well. There must have been more than water at that place, because the honorable member stated that he saw, rearing lambs there a flock of merino ewes, that, in the previous year, had returned 8 lb. of scoured wool a head. If they did that, they are worth hundreds of pounds each, because they would be about the best stud ewes in Australia. Evidently Ryan&#39;s Well and King George whisky must be a good combination. The visitors on that occasion,, when  they saw these supersheep - these world-beaters - must have had a remarkably good time. I do not know who were in the party, or what they did. The honorable member for Grey, at any rate, either- had a good time, or had his &#34; leg pulled.&#34; </para>

              <para>-Then the honorable senator is a super-man, just as the sheep at Ryan&#39;s Well are apparently super-sheep. Honorable senators may be interested to learn that the average weight of- scoured wool for Australia .is a little less than 4 IB. a head. The fleeces from sheep at Ryan&#39;s Well would lose at least 60 per cent, in scouring, and the owners would be lucky to secure 3 lb. a head. </para>

I merely mention these figures because some exaggerated statements have been made as to the excellence of the country to be served, and the wonderful stock that is raised there. T now desire to read from notes of an interview that i had yesterday at my office with a gentleman who happened to arrive on that day from Central Aus tralia. These notes were taken down for me. I knew him well by repute as a man who had tackled large and difficult problems in country similar to that under consideration - a man who had owned over 1,000 square miles of land, and had spent years there. He had sunk thousands of pounds in boring and fencing.  His  holding was situated almost equidistant from Brisbane, Sydney, and Adelaide. </para>

              <para>- This gentleman states that he has had life-long experience in developing country in outback Australia. He describes, as practically useless, the country from Lyndhurst, which is about 50 miles south of Marree, to Oodnadatta, and on as far as Frances Well, in the Northern Territory, along the proposed route of this railway, to 220 miles north of Oodnadatta. There are, however, isolated habitable patches, though they have only a 5-in. rainfall. The few stations that do cany stock carry only cattle. A few of them tried sheep, but the best were able to carry only 20 sheep to the mile. The average country from Lyndhurst to Alice Springs, he says, is impossible for sheep. </para>

              <para>- The gentleman who has given me this information knows far more about the country to be served by this railway than any member of this Chamber. This is no joking matter. It is a proposal to spend several millions of public money in the belief that it will lead to the development of a large area of country which, as I have shown, will not carry more than twenty sheep to the square mile. Have honorable senators any idea of the cost of developing country like that for sheep ? Do they know what it costs to erect rabbit and dog proof fences, to put down bores, and properly equip a place ? The cost for that class of country is prohibitive. </para>

              <para>- If a property out there is intended for sheep, it is necessary to put down bores at a distance of not more than 6 miles apart, and, as the average depth of bores is from 1,200 feet, to 1,800 feet, the cost of developing a sheep station on such country outback in Australia on 500 square miles of country that can carry only twenty sheep to the square mile will be &#163;150,000 for 10,000 sheep. Even those enthusiasts from South Australia who are supporting this proposal admit that the best sheep country in the Northern Territory is to be found in the Barkly Tablelands, of which I have had a life-long experience. My father, who successfully pioneered the country in 1882, was one of its pioneers. He was the first man to take sheep to the Northern Territory. After 30 years experience, and after spending &#163;112,000 on developmental work, the directors of the company with which he was associated came to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the shareholders to abandon sheep. The same thing happened at Carrandotta Station, another good property on the Queensland border of the Barkly Tablelands. </para>

              <para>- The Minister is quite right. I was about to mention that. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cumming</inline> had charge of that station many years ago, it was carrying sheep. He gave up sheep, but in recent years sheep have again been put on the run. I am sorry to speak in this way, because I hope that some day .sheep growing will be a profitable industry on the Barkly Tablelands. Practical men tried sheep and abandoned them, though Carrandotta is again carrying sheep. I have advised the present owners of Avon Downs to do likewise, but&#39; not to try to breed sheep there. The best policy appears to . be to stock up with young merino wethers from Queensland, and after growing wool for three or four years to get rid of them. It is not pleasant for me to decry the value of any. part of the Northern Territory, and I can assure honorable senators that I have no ulterior motive in saying all this. Up to the present it has been impossible to breed sheep in the Territory. I do not wish to condemn the Barkly Tablelands. I know the country is wonderful, and I believe it should be served by a railway. </para>

              <para>- That is not so. There is very good country to the west, but the Barkly Tablelands is the pick of the Northern Territory, and I hope one day to see it carrying 10,000,000 sheep. I feel sure eventually the difficulties encountered by the pioneers will be overcome, and that by providing artificial shade and water at short distances it will be possible to get profitable  lambings.  When the company to which I refer decided to abandon sheep we sold 5,000 head off that leasehold property. Let me give honorable senators some details of the expenditure necessary to develop outback country for sheep. A vermin-proof fence, according to specifications insisted on by the. South Australian Government, on country within 150 miles of Port Augusta, costs from &#163;120 to &#163;130 a mile. In the outback country, such as that which will be served by this proposed railway, the cost will be from &#163;170 to &#163;180 a mile, or a total of &#163;16,200, merely to ring-fence 500 square miles capable of carrying 10,000 sheep, on the basis of 20 sheep to the square mile. It is necessary to subdivide a property for sheep, and a station of that size should be divided into at least twelve paddocks. This subdivision fencing will cost &#163;11,100, bringing the total for fencing alone up to &#163;27,300. In addition there must be a wool-shed, drafting yards, and sheep-dipping equipment, to say nothing of bores, which must be put down at distances of not more than 6 miles. In the Northern Territory, an equipped bore will cost from &#163;2 10s. to &#163;3 a foot, so that every artesian bore, of a depth of 1,800 feet, will cost about &#163;5,400. Practical men who have gone into the details estimate that it will cost &#163;150,000 to develop and stock 500 square miles to carry 10,000 sheep. This works out at &#163;15 a sheep on leasehold country. If, for the sake of argument, we agree that this estimate is grossly exaggerated and that the cost works out at only &#163;7 10s. a head, what sort of .a fool would a man be to invest that amount of capital to develop a sheep station in Central Australia, where transport costs must necessarily be heavy, when he could buy a freehold property carrying a sheep to the acre in the heart of the Western District of Victoria, with magnificent improvements and a splendid homestead, for &#163;8 to &#163;9 an acre. Country in the western district of Victoria, which produces the best wool in the world can be obtained at &#163;8 per acre, and fully developed sheep station properties in South Australia and New South Wales cau be purchased at much below that figure. As there are also large areas of undeveloped country in Western Australia suitable for sheepraising purposes which can be obtained at a reasonable figure, it is ridiculous to speak of profitably developing sheep country iu that part of the Northern Territory to be served by the proposed line. What inducement would there be, particularly in view of the ruling Australian Workers&#39; Union rates? They are - shearing flock sheep 38s - in Queensland it is 45s. - rams 76s., stud ewes and their lambs 47s 6d. per hundred, and special studs higher. </para>

              <para>- It is 3Ss. per hundred. I do not object to the Queensland rate of 45s.. because I believe in good wages. I. am giving this information to the Senate because many persons without practical experience think that all one has to do in order to make money as a sheep breeder is to select a good piece of country, fence it, stock it with sheep, and then come down to the Melbourne Cup once a year and spend some of the profits. They overlook the fact that a large amount of capital has to be employed, a lot of hard work done, and considerable risk incurred. In addition to the shearing costs as set out in the log, the following wages are paid: - Crutching 9s. 6d., and wigging or ringing 4s.  5&#189;d.  a hundred. The rate for pressing is 2s.  6&#189;d.  per bale  undumped,  and for dumped bales 3s. 0&#163;d. If the total sum which  pressers  receive does not amount to 117s. per week, the employer must, under the award, pay the difference to the employee. Cooks&#39; wages are 7s.&#39; 7d. per man or a minimum of 88s. per week and keep. Station hands are paid 78s. without keep, or 52s. per week when found. I do not object to the high wages paid in the industry as awarded by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but what a hopeless proposition it would be to develop the country for sheepcarrying purposes if the rates now being claimed by the Australian Workers&#39; Union were to be paid. They are: - shearing, 60s. a hundred for flock sheep, &#163;9 a hundred for rams and ram stags, &#163;3 10s. a hundred for stud ewes and lambs, and &#163;1 6s. 8d. a day for special studs, with cook rations and shearing requisites found. If these rates amount to less than &#163;9 10s. per week the employer has to make up the deficiency. Under the proposed log, crutching is to be paid for at 15s. a hundred, and wigging 7s. a hundred, and if these rates return less than &#163;8 per week the employer is to make up the deficiency. Shed hands are asking from &#163;6 a week,  penners  up &#163;7 per week, wool  pressers  &#163;8 per week and keep, arid cooks &#163;8 per week as a minimum. As to wool classers, I have never thought their wages sufficient. </para>

              <para>-They are being claimed. I have taken the trouble to obtain the opinion of experienced practical men on this question, men who know more about it than I do., and all of them are of the opinion that the country in any circumstances cannot be profitably developed for sheep raising. Under existing conditions it is difficult enough to make wool-growing pay, even on good established inside freehold stations, but it would be hopeless on back country unless a much greater number of sheep than that estimated could be carried to the square mile. As it is necessary to open up fresh country, attention should be given to the development of some of the good sheep country in Western Australia. A fine stretch of country north-east of Kalgoorlie, which was once considered unsuitable owing to the absence of water, is now being opened up by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hawker,</inline> who, I am informed, has spent &#163;60,000 on it. That country is capable of carrying 100 sheep to the square mile - not 20, as is estimated in connexion with the country to be served by this line - and sub-artesian water can be obtained at a depth of from 25 to 30 feet, and there is good edible scrub. It has been argued that a certain amount of revenue will be derived from the railway, but, in my opinion, there will not be sufficient to pay for even axle grease. The railway which at present terminates at Oodnadatta has never returned any revenue worth mentioning. As honorable senators are aware, the country in the north-west of the Northern Territory held by Vestey Brothers and the Bovril Company of Australia is good cattle country. The stock go to .Darwin, but the handling costs are prohibitive. The freezing works of  Vestey Brothers, on which &#163;1,000,000 has been spent, have been closed for three years, and it is significant to note that the cost of shipping every live beast from Darwin to Singapore is five times greater than is the cost of shipping from Wyndham owing to the misbehaviour of the &#34; wharfies &#34; at Darwin, who, apparently, never work seriously. Every one who has had any dealings in the Northern Territory knows that cattle, which do not goi to Darwin, go east across the Barkly Tablelands into Queensland at Lake Nash, where, under the Government regulations, they have to be dipped three times. They then proceed down the Georgina and Diamantina, aud many of them are eventually trucked at Marree for the Adelaide market. Even if the proposed line were constructed it . would not be used by those who dispatch cattle from the country I have mentioned. The cattle from the Barkly Tablelands go to Gladstone, Townsville, or the Brisbane meatworks, or down to Adelaide via Brisbane. They do not traverse the route of the proposed railway, and those in the north would not be trucked even if a line were constructed to Alice Springs, as there is too large a gap between the good country in the northern part of the Territory and Alice Springs. They could possibly be rushed over the intervening poor country, but in doing so they would lose a good deal of their condition. As a result of reading a number of valuable reports, I have come to the conclusion that in order to honour the agreement a north-south railway should be built through the northern boundary of South Australia, but it should go in an easterly direction to serve the Barkly Tablelands and connect with the Queensland, and, eventually, the New South Wales railway systems. A glance at the map shows that there are railways in Queensland; running in a westerly direction which could link up with a line such as I suggest. That line should be built, not on a 3- ft. 6-in. gauge as proposed, but on the 4- ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge, and should eventually connect with the line from Darwin to Daly Waters. The Minister for Works and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> estimated the cost of a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line of light rails, unballasted and unfenced, at &#163;1,700,000. We know what estimates are. We can safely put down the cost at &#163;3,000,000. He also said that the estimated cost of the rolling-stock was &#163;250,000, and that the working expenses and interest had been set down at &#163;173,499 per annum. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The estimated revenue is shown as &#163;94,125. Whence is the revenue coming? There is at present very little railway traffic offering on the existing line, and there, are fewer . people at Oodnadatta than there were before the railway was built. The proposed line will not to any extentserve sheep or cattle country. The Minister also stated that the trucks would each carry eighteen beasts. As I have, on behalf of owners, trucked thousands of cattle in different parts of Australia, I was surprised to learn thatsuch a large number could be carried in one truck. Believing that a mistake had been made, I sent an urgent wire to the Adelaide stock agents, asking the number of bullocks carried in each truck on the Oodnadatta line. I received a reply by urgent wire that nine was the average number. The Minister has doubled that number, not intentionally, I know. </para>

              <para>-I am quoting his figures. As I have stated, the meat works at Darwin have been closed for three years, and although Vestey&#39;s have 150,000 head of cattle at Wave Hill and other stations, this establishment cannot be carried on because the employees will not work. In consequence of its closing down the workmen are losing &#163;150,000 a year in wages, and the plant is now used only for boiling down bullocks and cows for which there is no other outlet. The Bovril Company of Australia, which owns the Victoria River Downs, had 70,000 head of cattle on that property, which were being used for the manuf acture of bovril, but owing to the closing down of the Darwin works, it has now little opportunity of disposing of the stock. The prospect of doing anything at Darwin seems apparently hopeless, but I trust that some day the people there will have sufficient common. sense to allow such undertakings to be profitably carried on. Industry at Darwin is not a payable proposition, owing to the behaviour of the men there, who will not work. We hope, some day, they will realize that an empty north is a danger to the Commonwealth. There are vast areas of splendid country in the Northern Territory, but not in the vicinity of the proposed line, that could be developed by the construction of a railway, and which, we hope, will be settled eventually. There will be no revenue at all from this supposed line. From a defence point of -view it will be more of a menace than anything else. The reports of Earl Kitchener, and of another high military authority who was in charge of the Australian forces, indicate that the only useful line would be one that would deviate to the western boundary of Queensland, and then go up through the Northern Territory. It stands to reason that if Australia had to move troops, horses, or any military equipment to meet a possible attack upon Darwin, she would require railway connexion with Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, where all her military requirements are centred. It would be a far better proposition to build a line from Bourke to connect with the railway systemor Queensland, and then to take it into the Northern Territory than to build this proposed line. </para>

            <para>. - I am delighted to know that there is no binding agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia to build a railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. Honorable senators from South Australia have urged in this Chamber for years that there was such a document. It has been positively uncomfortable at times to sit here and listen to their whining and crying. Having discovered that no agreement had been ratified, they endeavoured this afternoon to sneak in the agreement contained in the Railways (South Australia) Agreement Bill. It was wicked to attempt to do such a thing. It was even more shameful to try to bind this Parliament in that way to the building of a line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. The 3-ft. 6-in. gauge railway that now runs to Oodnadatta is useless. Nothing can be carried over it, for there is practically no rolling-stock. Yet honorable senators from South Australia have been crying continually that we should extend it. </para>

Any one with common sense must realize that from the defence point of view it would be wise to construct this railway in such a way as to connect it with the railway systems of the eastern states. The bulk of Australia&#39;s population is in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland. What is the use of building a railway that will tap nothing but half-starved country that can grow only crows and rabbits ? </para>

            <para>- BROCKMAN.There are conflicting views as to the meaning of the agreement. Some persons think that the Commonwealth is under an obligation to build a railway from Port Darwin to Port Augusta straight down through the Northern Territory and South Australia only. That opinion is not altogether fortified by the debates that took place in the South Australian and Commonwealth Parliaments when the agreement was made. There is, however, a clear and definite undertaking by the Commonwealth Government and Parliament to build a railway from Port Darwin to a point on the northern border of South Australia, and ultimately down to Port Augusta. I admit that the Commonwealth made a very bad bargain with South Australia when it agreed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> take over the Northern Territory; but it entered into that contract, and it must now carry it Out. I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> would be the last person  to repudiate a solemn contract, whether the Commonwealth made a good or a bad bargain. </para>

              <para>- My opinion, as a lawyer, is that the agreement would be carried out if a railway were started at Port Darwin, took four circles round Australia, finally hit the northern boundary of South Australia,  and ultimately was carried to the southern point mentioned in the agreement. Contrary views are held by very distinguished lawyers in South Australia and Victoria, but there are other equally distinguished lawyers whose view coincides with mine. There is no means of ascertaining the exact meaning of the agreement by a reference to the High Court, or any other tribunal. The Commonwealth Government has rightly decided that it shall lean to the view to which the South Australian people incline, and honour the spirit of the agreement as the people of that State interpret it. </para>

            <para>The question of the extension of the railway to Alice Springs has been the subjectmatter of negotiations between the Commonwealth and the Government of the State of South Australia. The construction of this line is an obligation of the Commonwealth under the- Northern Territory Surrender Act, which was passed in 1910, the carrying out of which has been too long delayed. Agreement has now, however, been arrived at between the two Governments, and subject to the concurrence of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and of South Australia this work will be proceeded with in accordance with the agreement. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DRAKEBROCKMAN.What</inline>I have read is an extract from the policy speech upon which the honorable senator was re-elected to this Senate. If he, or any other honorable senator, who stood for election and was returned, did not definitely repudiate that statement from their own platforms they are now morally bound to stand by the Government, and support the bill. Before I was elected to this Chamber I expressed my view of the route which the proposed railway should take. Not having committed myself at the recent elections, I am per&#62;fectly free to continue to hold the same view. But I do say that there is an obligation on this Parliament to carry out the agreement, which has been too long delayed. Honorable senators must try to find out the meaning of the agreement. If they are unable to do so they should accept the interpretation of the Government. In spite of the wrangling that has taken place over this matter, I feel sure that a majority of honorable senators will support the motion for the second reading of the bill. </para>

              <para>- As a responsible Parliament we have to interpret both the spirit and the letter of the agreement. When we discuss constitutional matters we are invariably told that we must endeavour to ascertain what was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution. I do not deny that there is an agreement, and that it lays down certain conditions regarding the construction of a railway. But, judging by the debates that took place in the South Australian Parliament at the time that the contract was entered into, it is perfectly clear that that Parliament never intended that the line should be built wholly within the Northern Territory and South Australia. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell&#39;s</inline> intervention on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> reminds me of the biblical story of Balaam. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> is well able to interpret his own remarks. Having read the speeches that were made in the South Australian Parliament, and the various legal interpretations that have been placed upon the agreement. I have come to the conclusion that the Commonwealth Government is under no obligation to build the north-south railway in a straight line from north to south. I shall not at present refer in detail to the line from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. After an inspection of the country, I and my colleagues on the Public Works Committee recommended the construction of that line. There is no doubt that its terminus at the present time would be in the middle of a veritable wilderness. There is some excellent country in the MacdonnellRanges, but I do not think that it is sufficiently high-class to make a railway pay. There were two alternatives; either the line from Marree to Oodnadatta had to be pulled up, or it had to be extended to the Macdonnell Ranges. If there is any provision in the Railways (South Australia) Agreement Bill, that will bind the Commonwealth to continue the construction of theline from Alice Springs in a direct northerly route, I shall vote against it. Eminent legal gentlemen, including ex-Senator <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, have been quoted as. having said that the line must be built directly north and south. When the ratification of the agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the South Australian Government was under discussion in this chamber, ex-Senator <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon moved, on the 22nd September, 1910, &#34; That after the word &#39; constructed &#39; in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> the words &#39; in the Northern Territory&#39; be inserted.&#34; This showed that he was not satisfied that the agreement provided that the line should be built wholly in the Territory. There were four votes in favour of that amendment and 23 against it. It was a deliberate attempt by ex-Senator Symon to have a provision inserted in the Northern Territory Acceptance Act to safeguard the interests of South Australia. </para>

              <para>- That was the advice that Parliament acted upon. I propose to give a brief history of the negotiations. In April, 1901, the Government of South Australia first approached the Commonwealth Government with an offer of the Northern Territory, including its railway and all other assets. The one stipulation then made was that the Federal Government should assume the liabilities of the Territory. In December, 1902, this offer was temporarily withdrawn by the South Australian Government. This withdrawal was actuated by the belief that private enterprise would be prepared to construct the railway from Oodnadatta to the then terminus, Pine Creek, for a grant of 75,000 acres of land for each mile of railway constructed, and other considerations, fully set forth in South Australia&#39;s Transcontinental Railway Act, No. 803 of 1902. Although this act was extensively advertised throughout the world for four years, no entirely satisfactory offers were received. On the 3rd February, 1906, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> then Premier of South Australia, wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, forwarding a copy of a resolution passed by the House of Assembly of South Australia on the 7th December, 1905, again offering the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth Government on the original basis, plus an obligation on the part of the Commonwealth Government to build the transcontinental railway linking Oodnadatta with Pine Creek, and restricting its route to within 100 miles east or west of the overland telegraph line. .This letter, it will be seen, permitted a further deviation easterly or westerly than was permitted by the Transcontinental . Railway Act, South. Australia, No. 803 of 1902, thus displaying some uncertainty as to the merits of the western route as originally delineated. In acknowledging the receipt of this letter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> on the 23rd February, 1906, stated, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia -</inline></para>

            <para>Judging by the experience of your State, the development of this immense area will involve a very large investment of public money which will not soon become remunerative. The obligation to utilize the resources of this portion of Australia is not confined to your State, but the expenditure which it will involve is so large, and the problems which it raises are so serious, that the project merits the most thorough examination on the part of any Government responsible for it. Any transactions in relation to it ought not to be entered upon in a narrow spirit of barter, but with due regard to the interests of the whole of our people. </para>

            <para>The length of the proposed line from Port Darwin to Port Augusta would be 1,686 miles. The length of the other proposed line from Port Darwin, via the Queensland border and Birdsville, down to Port Augusta, would be  1,726 miles. No doubt the Commonwealth would keep the line in their own territory, if possible. There was very little difference between these routes so far as distance was concerned, and he ventured to say, from information carefully gathered, that the &#39; line via the Queensland borderand west of Birdsville would be the best line for South Australia, and probably the best for the Commonwealth to construct, because the land was much more fertile and had a better rainfall. ..... The Commonwealth undertook to relieveSouth Australia of their responsibility for the Oodnadatta line for all time, which was the best proof that could possibly  be given that they are earnest in their desire to connect Port Darwin with Port Augusta with a line of railway. They would take the present line from Oodnadatta to Port Augusta over, and guarantee to run it as it was run at the present time, and to shoulder the loss on it instead of South Australia. That was a big concession, but one that was properly made, and a guarantee was given because the Government did not insist on a given time for the railway to be constructed. It must be evident to every one that one of the two proposed lines to which he had referred must be built, because the country could not be properly developed without it...... <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Loughlin</inline> stated what was a fact - that he and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> came over to Melbourne determined to press for a given route and a given date; and the factor that altered their calculations, and induced them to takeback an entirely different agreement, was the proposal that the Commonwealth Government should give a guarantee to take over the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta line, thus making it the interest of the Commonwealth, as well as its obligation under the agreement, to make that line payable, which could only be done by its extension. When I first declined to give a time guarantee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Loughlin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> refused to consider it. I had anticipated . that attitude, and before they came over was prepared with this counter proposal, which was to them the novel element . in the transaction. It was because we gave them this practical guarantee by taking over the line that they willingly consented, as they told the South Australian Parliament, to leave this Parliament to determine both the time of completing and the route of the transcontinental railway.  . . . At page 614 of the same volume of the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> from which I have already quoted, there are passages which go to show&#39; what South Australian members themselves understood the agreement to mean. </para>

            <para>It has been asserted by some people that if the line running close to the Queensland border were constructed, it would tend to develop the Queensland ports instead of those of South Australia.

I also quoted the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gregor</inline> McGregor, who, in introducing the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, clearly stated that&#39; there was no obligation upon the Commonwealth Parliament concerning the route of the railway; it was left to the Commonwealth Government, as the authority controlling the Territory, to construct a line in such a direction as it thought fit, subject, of course, to the proviso I have mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin,</inline> in continuing his speech, said - but what I am trying to bring before honorable members is his perfect candour and frankness as to the alternative railway routes. </para>

            <para>There was better land in the direction of the Queensland border, and trade would naturally gravitate to the nearest port. It would be no concern of South Australia&#39;s if that route proved to be towards Queensland ports. When South Australia extended the line from Her.gott to Oodnadatta, the Government of the day deliberately ignored all the reliable information that was at hand as to the best route. At that time there was a strong feeling outside Parliament that the line should go in the direction of Birdsville, but Parliament decided that it should follow the telegraph line. He took part in the discussion on the question outside Parliament, and favoured the Birdsville route, but the advocates of that scheme were only roundly abused for their trouble. </para>

          <para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that in the minds of the delegates representing both parties the opinion prevailed that the Commonwealth Government would have a free hand to construct the line over a route which it considered best in the interests of the Commonwealth. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was quite clear on that point. Afterwards he said that his legal opinion differed from what his belief was when he as one of the representatives of the Commonwealth Government assisted in drawing up the agreement between the parties. The representatives of South Australia in the Senate have taken up the attitude that the legal interpretation of the agreement must be carried out to the letter, and that the opinions of those who negotiated the contract are of no consequence. I do not wish to unduly take up the time of the Senate, but desire to place on record the opinions expressed by the representatives of the contracting parties, so that we may know what was in their minds when the agreement was under discussion. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Loughlin</inline> preferred the eastern route. A number of exhaustive examinations of the country have been made to determine the best route for this transcontinental railway, and the overwhelming opinion is that a line which traversed the west of Queensland would undoubtedly pay the Commonwealth better than a line direct from Oodnadatta to Darwin. </para>

These railways, in its opinion, would be sufficient to provide for the needs of the Northern Territory for many years. As the present 3-ft. 6-in. line finished nowhere, so to speak, the committee considered that it ought to be taken into country which would be developed by it. Undoubtedly the Macdonnell ranges country is a far better proposition than that around Oodnadatta. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but not as a portion of the grand trunk line. It treated this proposition more in the nature of a branch&#34; line. When I spoke of a light line I had in mind railways similar to those that were constructed in the early days to develop Queensland. Many of these lines penetrated far into the interior. The rails, in many cases, were laid on the beds of the creeks to avoid building costly culverts and bridges. The Queensland Government felt that it was better to build lines of that nature than to wait until heavier lines like our main trunk lines could be built. </para>

              <para>- At any rate, his proposal was that the railway should tap some of the good country in the Kimberly district. That line also was part of the comprehensive scheme proposed by Earl Kitchener. If I were asked to choose between a railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs and one from Marree to Birdsville, having no further extensions in mind, I should not be enamoured of either. The chances are that, as the Birdsville route would tap some of the south-western areas of Queensland, it might be slightly the better proposition. I do not wish honorable senators to think that I ani comparing one route with the other. I favour the Marree to Birdsville proposition in preference to the other one, for the reason that it would be a section in the grand trunk line suggested by Earl Kitchener as advisable for defence purposes.

            <para>To understand how the agreement came to be drafted as it was, honorable members must recollect that it was made in February, 1907, shortly before I left for the Imperial Conference in London. The negotiations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> were conducted at high pressure, while making arrangements for a necessary absence&#39; of four or five months. Consequently, it was not until my return that I discovered that the terms of the agreement had been so drawn as to confine the line strictly within the boundaries of the Northern Territory. I communicated with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Loughlin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> and both  agreed  with  me that it did not fulfil the terms of the agreement we arrived at, which gave a choice of route.

This was that, instead of passing through the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, as&#39; it would in the ordinary course have done in order to be put in proper form, so great was the haste and pressure that the agreement went immediately into the Crown Solicitor&#39;s office, and was there dealt with, being returned for immediate signature without undergoing the scrutiny of either the AttorneyGeneral or the officers of his department. But for that, the one clause which was introduced into a later part of the agreement - which, in my opinion, puts the interpretation beyond question - would never have been included, and the plain meaning would have been clearly set out on its face. I called the attention of both the State : Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Loughlin,</inline> the Minister for the Northern Territory, to the mistake in the agreement before it was submitted to the State Parliament. </para>

Under the agreement, we had no guarantee that these lines would be connected within any reasonable time. The Federal Parliament was controlled overwhelmingly by the representatives of the bigger States, who would use all their inlluence to force the trade into Queensland and New South . Wales, and Port Augusta would get none of it. (The Commissioner for Crown Lands. - &#34; You know the trade cannot gc there if they build the railway right throughto Port Augusta.&#39;-&#39;) </para>
          <para>There was nothing in the agreement to showthat. We were doing rightly in not binding the Federal authorities as to route. We would get more benefit by the railway going via Birdsville than by the completion of it right through in the first place. It would pay us better if we agreed to meet the Federal Government at Birdsville, so that we might secure the extension from this end. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Vaughan. - &#34;It would he better if South Australia was made to include the MacdonnellRanges.&#34; &#34;&#39; He feared the Federal Government would not agree to that.</inline></para>

He agreed with the general principles of the agreement entered into by the Premier with the Commonwealth, They could not expect that in an agreement affecting all the States of the Commonwealth, South Australia should have her own way entirely..... It was quite natural that members should prefer the line to be taken from Oodnadatta, as already about 400 miles of the line had ibeen built in that direction. But it would be a great mistake if the Federal Government did this, as they should have a much shorter distance to reach good country in the Birdsville area. He had been over the country where the proposed line was to go, and he examined it carefully with a view to the construction of a railway. It would be the shortest and cheapest route, while it would promote the settlement of the country and find work for the railway all the way, as well as securing large traffic from west Queensland into this State. </para>

A glance at the map would show any one that the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek would he a tolerably straight route, the gap to be bridged being about 1,100 miles. The official description of that country showed it to be not very good. It consisted &#34;of &#34; patches of good country for pastoral purposes, chiefly along creeks or river frontages, with patches of spinifex scrub and sand-hills, uncertain rainfall, parts metal-bearing area.&#34; On the other hand, the land along the suggested circuitous route, from Hergott <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> way of Birdsville and Camooweal to Pine Creek, would pass through what had been described as some of the finest pastoral land in the Commonwealth, and would open up that country, and bring the Northern Territory into direct communication with Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and even Victoria.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HENRY</inline>BARWELL <inline font-style="italic">(</inline> South Australia) &#91;8.50&#93;. - I hasten to enter this debate because I am particularly anxious that no other honorable senators should commit themselves in regard to the bill without having a full knowledge of the facts of the case. I desire to say at the outset that Senators Guthrie and Cox made statements this afternoon that were not only misleading, but entirely contrary to fact, although I do not suggest for a moment that they deliberately tried to mislead honorable senators. No evidence was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> except that some man, whose name he would not divulge, but who had been connected with some company, the name of which he preferred not . to mention, had told him that the country between Oodnadatta and Alice Springs was useless,&#39; a mere desert, and totally devoid of water and feed. I shall show that that is entirely contrary to fact, and I refuse to think that there will be any serious opposition to the bill when the exact position is known. There are many reasons why honorable senators should vote in favour of this bill, and why the line should be constructed. First of all, the measure represents a step by the Commonwealth in fulfilment&#39; of a very definite obligation which rests upon it, by reason of the agreement of 1907&#39;, which was ratified by the Northern Territory Acceptance Act of 1910. Under that agreement South Australia undertook to transfer the Territory to the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth agreed, amongst other things, to build a line connecting Darwin with &#39;some point on the Port Augusta-Ocdnadatta  railway. The agreement appears in a schedule to the act of 1910, and it will be seen to- be entirely unambiguous. Paragraph 1 provides that the Commonwealth shall &#34; construct, or cause to be constructed, a railway line from Port Darwin southwards to a point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper (which  railway  with the railway from a point on the Port Augusta railway to connect &#39; therewith is hereinafter referred to as the transcontinental railway).&#34; That language is simple and explicit.

          <para class="block">Can there be any doubt with regard to the true meaning of those words ? A lawyer is not required to interpret such an agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> said that exSenator Symon moved to have the words &#34;in the Northern Territory&#34; placed  in the act of 1910. But there was no need for that. The bill was one to ratify the agreement, and those words are in the agreement itself. To see what the obligations upon the Commonwealth Government are one must read the agreement, which is the schedule to the bill. It states definitely that a line shall be constructed within the Northern Territory from Darwin to the northern border of South Australia, and the other portion shall be constructed northwards from a point on the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta line to connect with it. I do not know how the doubt arose. It is perfectly true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> said, that there was a doubt in the minds of quite a number of South Australian politicians, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> and Messrs. O&#39;Loughlin and Butler, members of the South Australian Parliament at that time: Because of that doubt, steps were taken by the South Australian Government to obtain the best legal opinion available in Australia as to the proper interpretation of the agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> tried to lead honorable senators to believe that South Australians were prepared to concede that the line might go eastward. It is true that they had a fear that because of the wording of the agreement there was a loophole, and possibly the Commonwealth might deviate the line eastward out of South Australia and into New South Wales or Queensland. I propose to quote from the opinions of no less than six K&#39;s.C. upon this subject. Take first of all the view expressed by the South Australian Crown Solicitor at that time. It is not a political opinion. Had there been a doubt at all he would certainly have pointed it out to the South Australian Government. The tendency on his part would have been &#34;to find out if a. doubt really existed . What did he say ? It is a lengthy opinion, but I shall mention the conclusion at which he arrived. </para>

            <para>In my opinion, the reference in the provision  . . makes it clear that what was covenanted&#39; for by the earlier provision is a line to be built wholly within the Northern Territory. Moreover, the agreement is made between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of South Australia, and it cannot, it appears to me, have been the intention of the parties that the railway should go outside of the Northern Territory and. traverse land belonging to another State/ If the possibility of such a course had been contemplated, one would expect some reference to arrangements to be made with the other State or States through whose territory the line was to run. I am of opinion, therefore, that the transcontinental railway from Port Darwin southwards to <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> point on the Port Augusta railway must, under the agreement and the Surrender Act, be constructed entirety through the Northern Territory and South Australia proper. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let us take one most significant point mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dashwood.</inline> If it were intended that the line should traverse other territory, if, for example, it were proposed to take it into Queensland or New South Wales, would not the Governments of those States have been parties to the agreement? The Commonwealth has no right to construct a mile of railway line within the territory of a State without the consent of the State Government, and therefore it could never have been the intention to construct any portion of the north-south line in New South Wales or Queensland territory, because the Governments of those States were not- parties to the agreement. </para>

          <para>Since giving the above opinion I have had the advantage of a conference. . . . On the whole, however, and with great deference, I adhere to the view, as expressed in my opinion, that the true construction of the act and the agreement is that the transcontinental railway line is to bc constructed wholly in South Australia and the Northern Territory, and, as above stated, I do not think that the bill before the Commonwealth Parliament conflicts with this construction. </para>

            <para>In my opinion upon the true construction of the agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of South Australia, the transcontinental railway cannot be diverted out of the Northern Territory so as to be built partly in a State other than South Australia. There can be no reason why this agreement should not be construed according to the ordinary canons of interpretation, and, taking the natural meaning of the words used and reading the agreement as a whole, and having regard to the subject-matter with which it is dealing, I feel no doubt that the intention of the contracting parties was that the northern part of the railway should be made wholly within the Northern Territory to some point on the northern boundary of South Australia proper, arid the southern part should be made from some point on the Port Augusta railway to the same point on such northern railway. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is clear from the several legal opinions quoted that the line must be constructed wholly within the Northern Territory and South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham,</inline> K.C., the present AttorneyGeneral of the Commonwealth, stated in the session before the last that he was against the construction of the line on the merits and the facts disclosed, but, having gone very carefully into the agreement, he found that there was a definite legal obligation upon the Commonwealth to construct the line. Therefore, he was bound to support the proposal. As regards the interpretation of the agreement, his view entirely coincided with the opinion of the King&#39;s&#39; Counsel to whom I have referred. From all that I have said it would appear that there is a very definite obligation on the Commonwealth to construct the line in a north-south direction, wholly within the Northern Territory and South Australia, and that it must be . carried out &#39;within a reasonable time. The agreement of 1907 gave right of priority to South Australia as regards construction ; that is to say, the line was to be constructed before any other big railway undertaking by the Commonwealth. But South Australia conceded to the Commonwealth Government the right to build the east-west line. It certainly would not have given up its right of priority as regards the transcontinental railway if it had thought there would be any attempt to evade the obligation imposed upon the Commonwealth by the 1907&#39; agreement.  South Australia has always looked upon the construction of this line as a legally binding contract, and the honouring of it as a national obligation. If honorable senators will study the agreement they will find that its terms are clear and very definite. Let honorable senators regard the matter as though it were an agreement made between individuals instead of between Governments. If it were an agreement between individuals it would be a matter of personal honour to fulfil it without undue delay. Why should we set up a lower standard in morals for the Commonwealth and State Parliaments than are observed as between individuals ? Surely it is not too much to expect Governments to observe the code of honour that is recognized amongst gentle men in the ordinary everyday concerns of life. I submit, then, that the first reason why honorable senators should vote for the bill is that the 1907 agreement, ratified by the Act of 1910, imposes a legal obligation upon the Commonwealth to construct the line wholly within the State of South Australia and the Northern Territory. The proposal is justified also because of the very valuable . country which will be opened up. I intend, before I resume my seat, to dispose absolutely of the unsupported statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who said that the country to be served by this railway was. a desert entirely devoid of water and feed . </para>

              <para>- He put the position very clearly when he said in evidence before the Public Works Committee that a north-south route would provide a backbone to Australia, and lines to the east and west would form the ribs. That is exactly the position. I am not suggesting for a moment that there is not good- country on the Barkly Tablelands, or that it  should  not, at some &#34;time, be directly provided with railway communication: but looking at this matter in a national way we ought to have a dividing line through the centre, and then serve the country to the east and to the west by branch lines. That will undoubtedly come in time. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The question of water supplies does not appear to present any insuperable difficulties, as from the evidence of existing wells and bores, together with natural indications, and information elicited, there would appear to be excellent prospects of obtaining very good supplies of potable water, in sufficient quantities to supply all pastoral requirements, at depths of from 30 feet to 200 feet. A few bores have been&#39; continued to 400 feet, in order to tap larger supplies for heavy stocking with cattle. </para>
            <para>There does not appear to be any really per,manent surface water in the area &#39; inspected, although quite a number of waterholes last for several months after rain. It may be remarked, in passing, that the absence of surface waters and flowing  bores  is rather a blessing, helping as it does, to keep rabbits and other vermin in check. </para>
            <para>The country generally is not suited for the holding of water in tanks, although water could be conserved in certain areas, but, without proper protection, evaporation, which amounts to approximately 8 feet per annum, would pay heavy toll upon the supply. </para>
            <para>Attention is drawn to the fact that where large supplies of water have been obtained, a lamentable and amazing lack of foresight has been displayed by those responsible for stocking the waters, regardless of what the country will carry, and the ultimate result. In many places^ stock .have been crowded on to the waters, and the country so severely overstocked that it will take years to recover. </para>

            <para>About 18 miles north-west of Stuart&#39;s Range opal field, the country becomes heavily impregnated with gypsum, and, with the exception of small patches of saltbush on the tops of the ridges, is devoid of any permanent type of vegetation. After the rains, a fine growth of herbage appears, which lasts for several months, giving this country, if used in conjunction with the adjoining areas, a carrying capacity of about 25 sheep per square mile. The belt, which is probably of no very great extent, crosses the  Algebullcullia,  and reaches to within about 7 miles of the Lorna River, after which the saltbush reappears in association with Mitchell grass, and raises the capacity of the country to 40 sheep to. the square mile. </para>

            <para>East of Horseshoe Bend, a belt of sandhills is entered, which extends northwards for about 40 miles. Throughout their extent, they are intersected with numerous flats and valleys, on which grows a better type of vegetation, thus lending variety to and increasing their feeding value. After the rains, a fine growth of herbage appears, which lasts for several months, and during which period it will carry quite a large number of stock. </para>
            <para>This belt is of no very great extent, and is bounded on the east and west by good saltbush country. </para>

            <para>It is obviously impossible, &#39;with the space available in a report of this nature, to more than but very briefly mention the class of country in the various districts.

          <para>I have seen this country, and I freely admit that it is poor. The country around Marree is the worst in the whole of Australia.

            <para>It should also be emphasized that, as far as the observations and inquiries of  the  committee went,  the  presence of extensive sandydeserts  in the centre of the Northern Territory, as shown in some of the early maps, is a myth. In fact, what is usually termed &#34; desert &#34; by the people living in -the locality comprises, country which, at certain seasons of  the  year, provides the best stock country on the stations. Practically the only sandy country encountered was the somewhat extensive area of the Depot Sand Hills, and the wide shallow beds of creeks, and even in the former case that country carries certain herbage and top feed valuable for cattle. </para>
            <para>Generally speaking, from the South Australian border to the Macdonnell . Ranges, the soil is of a reddish sandy loam, fairly well grassed in good seasons, with some &#39; cotton bush, salt bush, and mulga. Generally, there is very little timber on this country, excepting along river and creek channels, but in the vicinity of Deep Well there is an amount of desert oak,, which would probably be good for sleepers if sufficient quantity could be obtained within a reasonable distance of the proposed  route. </para>

          <para>The description of the Macdonnell Ranges country is as follows :  - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The lower portions of the hills in the Macdonnell Ranges are, in good&#39; seasons, fairly well grassed, principally with star grass, red grass, rye grass, and white grass, also a good, deal of spinifex. In many places the large creeks in the ranges break abruptly through the hills, forming great clear-cut gaps, many of them only a few hundred yards wide at the bottom, with rocky walls rising nearly perpendicular on each side for hundreds of feet.  Immense storages of water could, no doubt, be made at many of these gaps, as the rainfall of this area over a period- of 28 years averages about 11 inches per annum. </para>
            <para>The committee found that in the vicinity of the Macdonnells, grapes, figs, oranges, and lemons grow well, and that the soil in portions of the valleys between the hills is good and suitable for cultivation. </para>

I have been ail through, this country, and have visited every station along the proposed line and all those within reasonable distance of it. Generally speaking, the settlers are men who had not much capital. They have spent their money in sinking a few wells and bores, but to properly stock their holdings they practically all need to augment their water supplies.

              <para>- The honorable senator knows the portions of the report which I propose to quote, but he need not apologize beforehand for his attitude. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> called particular attention to the poorness of the country between Marree and Oodnadatta. What did the committee say about it? Its report will prove interesting to honorable senators, because that country comprises a big&#39; portion of the route which the honorable senator said the railway should traverse. </para>

            <para>However, most of the witnesses examined agreed that the Northern Territory was  a  country of immense and practically unknown possibilities, and there was very little chance of ever developing its resources without  a   railway of some description. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that the construction of  a  railway for developmental purposes, even if it involves  a  loss on the actual railway proposition, has the effect, of increasing the capital value of the country which it serves;&#39; permits of heavier stocking- of the pastoral areas through which it passes; and is an insurance against losses in drought times by enabling stock to be removed to better localities. Furthermore, railway communication  would encourage settlement in more remote parts,  and  tend to the development of the Northern Territory, without which it will always be a source of anxiety  and  a serious drain on the resources of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para class="block">In regard to the southern section, cognizance  was  taken of the fact that the existing line from Quorn to Oodnadatta is now laid with light rails -on a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge, and that between Marree and Oodnadatta the regular service is a fortnightly one, and is not likely to be anything more for at least some years. The Oodnadatta railway at present involves the Commonwealth in an annual loss of between &#163;60,000 and &#163;70,000, but the terminus at Oodnadatta is in the midst of some of the poorest country in Australia, and it is possible that with the extension to the better country in the region of the Macdonnell ranees, the loss on the existing line may be somewhat diminished. All witnesses examined on the subject agreed that the Macdonnell range country offered many possibilities for development, both pastoral and agricultural; that the mineral potentialities of the district had been only partially exploited, and had not been by any means exhausted, and would be benefited by n railway, and that the climate was quite equal to anything in Australia. </para>
