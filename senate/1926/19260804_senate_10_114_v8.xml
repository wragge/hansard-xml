        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline>HENRY BARWELL  (South Australia) [3.23]. - Having given much thought and consideration to the budget for 1926-27, I regret to say that I am quite unable to congratulate the Government upon it. I am genuinely sorry to have to make such a statement. It is much, more pleasant for me to uphold than to condemn the actions of the Government; but -in this case I find myself in the predicament of having either to remain silent or to say that which is unpleasant. To say nothing at all upon such an important matter, when one feels as strongly as I do, would amount to a shirking of one's responsibility as a member of this Parliament, and that I have no intention of doing. My disagreement with the budget has been applauded by one or two of my friends opposite. I trust that they do not think that I wish to infer that the position would have been any better had Labour been in power. I am satisfied that it would have been infinitely worse. </para>

          <para>- That is not so. It has reduced taxation considerably in the past. My contention, however, is that a further reduction ought to have been made this year. The drawbacks upon industry are quite sufficient at present without compelling it to shoulder unduly high taxation; and I am afraid that it is unduly high just now. The financial year 1925-26 closed with a surplus of £2,786,944. True, the Treasurer announced a surplus of only £286,944. He arrived at the lower figure by deducting from the true surplus the amount of £2,500,000 which was paid to trust funds in anticipation of a surplus occurring in the accounts of the year. </para>

It is a fact that this Parliament authorized those appropriations before the close of the financial year - a matter of five or six weeks ago. The purposes, it will be remembered, were, naval construction, £1,000,000; air services, £250,000; industrial and scientific research, £250,000; and a special payment for debt redemption of £1,000,000. These allocations were not provided for in the budget of 1925-26; therefore, on the year's operations, there was a surplus of £2,786,944. That is a huge surplus, and it ought not to have been made,. </para>

          <para>- That is so. I shall deal, in a moment, with the underestimate in the case of Customs receipts, and the excuse that has been offered by the Government with regard to it. The point I am now endeavouring to make is that there is something radically wrong with the budgeting methods of the Government when, year after year, surpluses amounting to millions of pounds are obtained.  That practice ought not to continue. It is wrong from whatever aspect it is viewed. </para>

          <para>- We are well acquainted with the policy of the Labour party, and we know in what directions the money that, -under this Government, goes to the making of a surplus, would be absorbed by it. I am satisfied that taxation would be higher under a Labour administration than it is at the present time. I am now contending, however, that it is wrong from every point of view to continually wind up the accounts of the year with a huge surplus. My reasons for making that statement arc, first, that the taxpayers have a right to demand that the Government shall not extract from them more, than is sufficient for the proper and economical administration of the affairs of Australia; secondly, that there is being placed upon industry a heavy and undue burden which it ought not to be called upon to bear; and, thirdly, that large surpluses do not make for economical administration. They create a temptation to extravagance which it is difficult for any Government to resist. Last year the expenditure was considerably in excess of the Estimates; but that fact is largely lost sight of by the taxpayers, simply because there was an excess of revenue amounting to approximately £3,500,000. Dealing with the point mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> a moment ago as to where the surplus comes from, I remind honorable senators that there was an under-estimate of Customs and excise revenue of approximately £2,000,000, and an under-estimate of direct taxation of over £1,000,000. The excuse put forward by the Treasurer for this huge surplus in Customs revenue was that in estimating the receipts from Customs and excise, when the budget was ;prepared twelve months ago, the contemplated reductions in duties were taken into account; but when that budget was drawn up, the Government knew well that it would be some time before those reductions could take effect. It was aware that it could only be for a small portion of the year, if at all, and, as a matter of fact, they did not take effect during the financial year. The Government knew, too, that those reductions would amount only to a sum in the neighbourhood of £750,000, and that they must, to a certain extent, be counterbalanced by inevitable increases in Customs duties in other directions. That is the Treasurer's only justification for the huge under-estimate. of £2,000,000 in Customs and excise revenue. There was, as I have already indicated, a surplus on the year's transactions of over £2,750,000, and no reduction in taxation has been made. All that we are told regarding the alleged surplus is that it is intended to- set aside £100,000 to assist prospectors for oil and precious metals, and the balance of £186,944 for invalid and old-age pensions and national insurance. It seems to me rather extraordinary that in looking about for some purpose to which it could allocate portion of the surplus, the Government hit upon national insurance. A royal commission has been appointed to inquire into and » report upon that matter, and it is still prosecuting its inquiries. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HENRY</inline>BARWELL.Yes; and heavens knows when it will present its report. It will be at least twelve months, at any rate, before a scheme can be approved . by Parliament in connexion with that subject, and, on the other hand, no scheme may ever materialize. ITo wonder comment is heard outside regarding the overflowing coffers of the Treasury. It was certainly contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, and it was provided in the Constitution itself, that surplus revenue should be paid by the Commonwealth to the States. During the last few years the accumulated surpluses would amount to close upon £15,000,000, not a penny of which has been returned to the States. I know, of course,, the legal position as determined by the High Court; the Government has power to pay the money into trust funds. I am merely directing attention to the way in which the position has been strained. In order to absorb a portion of the surplus revenue the Government has resorted to a payment to a trust fund for a scheme such as national insurance, which, as I have said, may never materialize. At last it has given up the cry that the Customs and excise duties are bound to fall off; we are now told that the estimated revenue for the current financial year from that source is £40,500,000. That is a staggering sum. The population of this country is only 6,500,000 - men, women and children. It is an appalling figure, considering the extent to which we are dependent on primary industries, the comparative smallness of our secondary industries, and the fact that the possible expansion of those industries is limited to all intents and purposes to the requirements of Australia, since we are unable to export our surplus manufactures, the position is serious. </para>
      <para>The first of the other subjects upon which I wish to touch is that of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. The proposals of the Government for the re-adjustment of those relations is causing great concern to the States, and the matter should be scrutinized carefully by this Parliament. The purpose of the proposed readjustment, we are informed, is the severance of the Commonwealth and State finances. Theoretically that object is sound; but I think that in this case it is neither wise nor safe to proceed upon pure theory. I admit candidly that I was strongly inclined at first blush to support the proposals of the Government, provided that due notice was given to the States so that they would have sufficient time to bring about a proper re-adjustment of their finances. During the last week or two, however, I have taken the trouble to make a careful study of the origin and history of those financial relations. I have read every word upon the subject in the debates at the conventions of 1897 and 1898, and I have also read everything said in the debates that took place when the Surplus Revenue Bill was under consideration by Parliament in 1910. In 1897 and 1898 it was stated emphatically by the representatives of the smaller States - South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania - that those States would never- accept federation without a provision for repayment to the States of a proportion of the Customs and excise revenue. Their intention was that there should be a permanent provision for such repayments. The members of the convention as a whole realized that that provision would of necessity have to be made - that federation could never be brought about unless it was provided in the Constitution that a certain proportion of that revenue, which the Treasurer calls "easy money," should be returned to the States. The Constitution, as adopted finally by the convention held in Melbourne in 1S9S, embodied the Braddon clause. That clause - not the Braddon clause as now embodied in the Constitution, but the Braddon clause as it appeared in the final draft of the Constitution as it left the convention on the 10th March, 1898. - provided - </para>

      </quote>
      <para class="block">I want, honor able senators to notice that that provision was of a permanent nature. There was no limitation as to time. It was to operate for all time, subject, of course, to the right of the people to amend the Constitution as provided by the Constitution itself. It was the Constitution with the Braddon clause in that form that was first submitted to the people a* the time of the first referendum. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HENRY</inline>BARWELL.No. That referendum was submitted only to the electors of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, the electors .of Queensland and Western Australia not voting. In Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania the proposal was carried. In New South Wales it was approved by a majority of 70,000 of the electors who voted ; but between the time of the finalizing of the draft Constitution by the convention and the. submission of that Constitution to the people at the first referendum, the New South Wales Parliament passed legislation providing that the majority necessary to approve of the Constitution should be 80,000, whereas previously it was 60,000. The majority being only 70,000, the result was that, technically, the Constitution was not agreed to. Subsequently, the Constitution was reviewed at a conference of Premiers held in January and February, 1899, when the Braddon clause was altered. When the draft Constitution, as altered by that Premiers' Conference was5submitted to the people on the occasion' of the second referendum, it was agreed' to. The only difference between the Braddon clause, as it appeared in the final draft of the 1898 convention, and the Braddon clause as finally agreed to at the Premiers' Conference in 1899, was that it was prefaced with the words " During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides." That limitation was placed upon it by the Premiers' Conference of 1899. The position then was that, although a large majority of the people of Australia voted for the adoption of </para>

I need not relate the circumstances, except to say that at that time there was another referendum. </para>

In opposition to my first ideas, I have been forced to tha conclusion that the contention of the States, that they have a moral claim to a share of the Customs and excise revenue, is right. Undoubtedly, one of the factors which induced the smaller States to agree to federation was the provision for a refund of a portion of the revenue derived from Customs and excise duties. </para>

They were prepared to trust Parliament to give the smaller States a fair deal.

        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir HENRY</inline>BARWELL.Yes, and the Labour government that was then in power, realizing that something had to be done, introduced and passed the Surplus Revenue Act of that year. The debate on that measure clearly indicated that it was never contemplated that the Federal Government should deprive the States of all share in the Customs and excise revenue. Although it was not specially mentioned, it was taken for granted that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of 25s. per head was to come out of the Customs and excise revenue. The smaller States were assured of a return of some portion of that revenue. It was not anticipated that they would be deprived of it at the expiration of the ten-year period ; and though it was contemplated that there might be some further revision of the provision, they were prepared to trust the Parliament. It was, however, suggested that in the event of war breaking out, involving the Commonwealth in huge expenditure, the Commonwealth might resort to direct taxation without interfering with the proportion of revenue that was being returned to the States. The more I have studied the subject, the more convinced am I that this sharing of Customs and excise revenue by the Commonwealth and the States was one of the fundamental principles of the federation. Another consideration which influences me is the wording of the Braddon clause and the wording of section 4 of the  Surplus  Revenue .Act of 1910, I refer to the alternative provision in both of them for the application of the money to be refunded by the Commonwealth to the </para>
      <para class="block">States. Section 4 of that act provides that all surplus moneys shall be paid over to the States or applied towards the payment of interest on debts taken over by the Commonwealth from the States. It was clearly intended that the debts of the States should be taken over! Until that was done, the proportion of Customs and excise revenue repayable to each State could be applied to the payment of interest on those debts. Section 105 of the Constitution puts the position very clearly. It reads - </para>
      <quote>
        <para>The Parliament may take over from the States their public debts as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or a proportion thereof according to  the respective numbers of their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, and may convert, renew, or consolidate such debts, or any part thereof; and the States shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted and retained from the portions of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth payable to the several States, of if such surplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency or the whole amount shall be paid by the several States. </para>

          <para>- That is a different provision. The Braddon section states that as regards the apportionment of the Customs and excise revenue one-fourth shall go to the Commonwealth and that the other three-fourths shall be paid over to the States. That provision was to last for ten years, and thereafter, until Parliament otherwise provided. It is 'not inconsistent with section 105, which deals with the taking over of the State debts by the Commonwealth. This section was amended by the Constitution Alteration (State Debts) Act by the elimination of the words " as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth." Consequently, the Commonwealth now has full power to take over State debts, whether or not they were incurred before federation. There can be no doubt that it was intended by the convention, and by the people when they approved the Constitution, that the State debts would be taken over, and I am perfectly sure that the people expected they would be taken over long before this. Had that been done, repayments under the Braddon clause would have been applied towards the payment of interest on the State debts taken over. Therefore, I say that if the Government wishes to bring about a readjustment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States it should make provision to take over the State debts. The whole of the trouble which has arisen is due to the fact that the Government contemplates readjusting the financial relationships in a most haphazard way. This matter should be left over until the special constitutional session is held at Canberra early next year, or until it can be dealt with at a special convention. I favour the latter course. I 'believe that this important subject should 'be handled by a convention on the lines of the convention that drew up the Constitution. </para>

      <para>The Government's present proposals are ill-advised. I cannot help saying that its action savours of sledgehammer tactics, which are inexcusable in the circumstances, since they are likely to create a feeling of hostility between the Governments of the States on the one hand, and the Government of the Commonwealth on the other. Since the people who constitute the population of the Commonwealth are the same people that constitute the population of the States, it should be possible for the Federal and State governing authorities to work together in harmony. Various recent actions of the Government, including this one, have created the utmost bitterness between the Governments of the States and the Government, of the Commonwealth, and I tell the Government that the people of Australia will be far more likely to stand by the Governments of the States than by the Government of the Commonwealth. Any one who has been in State politics knows how much closer are the relations of the people with their State Governments than are their relations with the Commonwealth Government. Therefore, I think that the Government would be wise to proceed about this business in a different way. The readjustment of the financial relationships  of the Commonwealth and the States is not urgent. Certainly it should not be bludgeoned through this Parliament. There is no necessity to bring it forward at the present time. As things Are going it looks as if it will be possible for the Commonwealth Government, within a few years, to evacuate the field of direct taxation, without interfering with the States' share of the Customs and excise revenue, assuming, of course, that theper <inline font-style="italic">capita</inline> payments are regarded as portion of Customs and excise revenue, and undoubtedly that was the original intention. Year after year the Commonwealth has had large surplus revenues, whilst the States are experiencing the utmost difficulty in balancing their ledgers. </para>

      <para>We are asked to accept the financial proposals of the Commonwealth because of the " sound principle " that a Government should be responsible for raising the money which it spends, and the States should be made as independent of the Commonwealth as possible. But nothing has been said concerning this " sound principle " in connexion with the Commonwealth's roads construction policy, because that policy is in direct conflict with that principle. The . Government's proposal in this instance is that the Commonwealth should raise the money to be expended by the States, which is a direct negation of the " sound principles" we axe asked to adopt in regard to the proposed financial adjustments between the Commonwealth and the States. There are many persons throughout Australia, including a large number of supporters of the Government, who view with grave concern the encroachments of the Commonwealth upon State rights. The Government proposals in connexion with road construction, housing, health, wire netting, and prospecting for minerals, plus those for an adjustment of the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, are tending towards unification. If adopted, they will make unification inevitable. </para>

          <para>- In my opinion the action of the Government is unconstitutional. I notice that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> stated that the Government has the power under section 96 of the Constitution, to act in the direction proposed. But that section does not give the Government any such power; it is not assisting the States in the manner contemplated by section 96, or any other sections of the Constitution. A majority of the people of Australia voted for federation because they believed in the principle; but largely owing to the fact that the Commonwealth Government has too much money at its disposal, we are now departing from the principle which the people then accepted. The States know far better than the Commonwealth their requirements in the matter of road construction, and the money required for such purposes. The States also know better than the Commonwealth how the money can be raised, having regard to the other State impost placed upon the people, and how it can be expended to the best advantage. In South Australia the Government which held office prior to the present administration decided to embark upon a progressive roads policy, which was necessitated by the present method of transport. In pursuance of its policy, it sent its engineer for roads and bridges abroad for twelve months, and when he returned, the Government, with his assistance and advice, evolved a policy of general road construction, to cover a term of years, in which the construction of concrete and bituminous roads played a very prominent part. The South Australian Government also provided for the imposition of a petrol tax, which, in the opinion of the Commonwealth, is unconstitutional. Leading King's. Counsel, however, advise that it is not, as it is a tax not upon importations, but upon consumption. </para>

As Leader of the Opposition in the South Australian Parliament at the time, I went fully into the matter, andlater,when the position was pointed out, the Government realized that, as it really was an excise duty, it was unconstitutional. It then considered whether it was possible to. impose a constitutional petrol tax, and that now imposed by the South Australian Government - I think a similar tax is in force in Western Australia- is being collected on the consumption of petrol, which counsel advises is legal. The tax is upon road users only; petrol consumers who do not use the roads are allowed a draw-back. The users of all brands of petrol, including the Commonwealth Oil Refineries' petrol, have to bear the impost. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HENRY</inline>BARWELL.I am not going into the question of single tax at this juncture. The roads policy of the South Australian Government is on a scientific basis. Good roads are a national asset, and the whole population benefits by cheap, efficient and rapid transport. Although it was decided that a large portion of the cost of road construction and maintenance should be borne by the general taxpayer, it was also recognized that the road-users should pay a special tax over and above that which the general taxpayers had to bear. A tax was also imposed upon the users of steam, electrically-propelled, and horse drawn vehicles, which is just and equitable. As such a tax differs largely from the proposals of the Commonwealth Government - which are slip-shod, loose and unscientific - it is only to be expected that there should be dissatisfaction. I say emphatically that a proposal of this nature will not have my support. Why should this tax be imposed upon motorists who are now contributing £3,500,000 through the Customs, in addition to which they have to pay a special registration fee upon motors, according to their weight and horse-power, which yields over £2,000,000? As a result of these imposts, motor-owners pay on an average. £18 a vehicle. Although motor transport is so essential to Australian development,, the Government is submitting proposals which, if adopted, will tend to stifle rather than encourage it. Many business firms in South Australia and in other States are already reverting to horse drawn vehicles, because of the high cost' of motor transport. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir HENRY</inline>BARWELL:That may be so in certain cases. Efficiency has to be considered, and a firm would not revert to horse-drawn vehicles regardless of efficiency. This proposal is. ill-considered and unfair. A tax will be imposed on millions of gallons of petrol not used in road transport. For instance, petrol is used by pastoralists on stations . where there are practically no roads, and by farmers in traction and stationary engines, in chaff-cutting and milking machines. It is used for lighting apparatus, aeroplanes, motor boats, for solvent purposes in rubber manufactures, for dry cleaning, for extraction purposes in the manufacture of linseed oil, and also in the manufacture of paints and varnishes. The tax, however, will not be paid by the users of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries' spirit, which is surely the height of absurdity. Why should the users of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries' petrol escape the payment of a petrol tax which is to be raised for providing revenue for road construction? </para>

        <para>I am sorry that I am unable to join in the general chorus in praise of this bill. Of course, everybody agrees as to the necessity and desirability of making good roads in Australia. We want more roads and better roads. The question is, Who should make them? Should it be the Commonwealth Government or the State Governments? In proposing, year by year, legislation of this character the Commonwealth Parliament is placing itself in a difficult position. It is merely granting financial subventions instead of devoting its revenue to the work which should properly concern it. Although the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to legislate for main roads as such, we are discussing a bill the object of which, as we all know perfectly well, is to make possible the construction of main roads, without considering at all whether this admittedly desirable object is one of the objects with which the Commonwealth legislature ought to concern itself. I venture to assert, although I know it will be unpopular to do so, that in passing legislation of this description we are not acting constitutionally. This Parliament has no power to legislate for main roads. It has power, of course, to grant financial assistance to States which need it.  The Commonwealth Government has no power to raise a finger to construct main roads; but it seeks by this method to assist the States to do so..... There is no certainty that these subventions will continue. It is only because the Federal Government has more money than it knows how to spend that these grants have been made. </para>

If two or more States approach the Commonwealth, the case of each has to be considered on its particular merits. Surely the Con- . stitution does not contemplate the Commonwealth handing over surplus revenue to a State for State purposes, if it is not so requested, or even against the will of the State! South Australia says, "We did not ask for it, and we do not want it. This is our function. You attend to your business, and we will attend to ours." </para>

You say to us ' Here is money which you can advance for the purchase of wire netting on terms and conditions that we lay down.'

The State refused to accept that grant, and has maintained that attitude up to the present time, yet it is placed in the iniquitous position of having to contribute towards the money that is advanced to other States. The same principle applies in relation to roads. The South Australian Government says: "We do not want your money.

      <para class="block">Counsel in South Australia has given an opinion that is on all-fours with that which' was given by the present Attorney-General last year, when he said that the application of surplus revenue to purposes of this kind was unconstitutional. In essence, there is no difference . between these proposals and those of last year. South Australia,therefore, says: "We do not want your money. We have our own methods of raising funds, and we want to expend those funds according to what we know to be the requirements of the State,notaccording to the requirements y.ou lay down as applicable to all of the States, but which may, not apply tous." Therefore, I say that the Commonwealth Government has no right to intrude in this way upon the prerogatives, of the States. This proposal is not only unconstitutional and illegal; it is also unwarranted and unnecessary. It is not based upon sound principles, because it lays down conditions that are to be applicable to all the States, whereas they may be at variance with the requirements of one or more of those States. A State may not get the full benefit of the money that is raised within its own borders. The Commonwealth Government surely must see the difficulties into which it is landing itself. Why can it not confine itself to its own sphere of activities, as laid down by the. Constitution?. If it does not, it will meet with trouble all along the line. It is doing so now. In addition, it is causing ill will and friction between itself and the Governments of the States. That is inexcusable in any Government. Both institutions are agencies of and represent the same people. A similar objection can be taken to the housing proposals of the Government. That being a State matter, why should the Commonwealth introduce duplication? The only result will bc an increase in cost. South Australia is carrying out a housing scheme far better than it could be carried out by the Commonwealth Government. References have been made in the Senate to the difference in the cost of houses in South Australia and at Canberra. South Australia does not want Commonwealth money for housing purposes any more than for roads. It says to the Commonwealth Government, "Do not raise more money than you require for your own legitimate purposes. Leave to us the opportunity of raising what is necessary and desirable for our particular purposes. Although we do not participate in these grants, we have to submit to the iniquitous policy of contributing towards the cost of advances that are made to the other States. </para>

          <para>. - Generally speaking, I: agree with a great deal of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> has said. The majority of the people of Australia anticipated that the budget would announce substantial reductions in 'their income tax. One form it might have taken, was. a return to the taxpayers of the surplus piled up in the fiscal year ended the 30th June, 1926. The people had frequently read in the newspapers statements to the effect that the Customs and excise revenue was largely exceeding' the expectations of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> ; and when the budget was presented they were sorely disappointed by the discovery that notwithstanding' these bounding revenues, no proposal was made to reduce the income tax. There was an accumulated surplus at the 30th June, 1925, of £3,108,529., and the surplus at .the 30th June,' 1926, is shown as amounting to £286,-944'.- The majority of the taxpayers feel that something should be done in the direction of reducing taxation. They naturally inquire whether the cost of government has increased to&gt; such a material extent as to reduce the accumulated surplus from the previous year, which was over £3,000,000, to the comparatively small sum of £286,944 at the end of June, 1926. They ask where the money has gone. After perusing the budget carefully it is found that nearly £5,000,000 was transferred ' to trust funds from the actual surplus of 1924- 25, and from the anticipated surplus for 1925-26. The amounts transferred from the surplus for 1924- 25 were: - For naval construction, £1,500,000; main roads development, £750,000; scientific and industrial research, £100,000; and prospecting £100,000, making a total of £2,450,000. It appears that the Treasurer, seeing that there was a. prospect of an overflowing Treasury, determined that further sums should be allocated to trusts funds in anticipation of a surplus for the year 1925- 26. The following further .sums' were therefore transferred: - For naval construction, £1,000,000; scientific and industrial research, £250,000; air services, £250,000; and for debt redemption, £1,000,000, making a total of £2,500,000. The grand total of the sums transferred to trust funds in 1924-25 and 1925-2&amp;, is £4,950,000. Turning to the expenditure, as set out in the budget, we find that it includes £52,384,247 for the ordinary operations and routine services of the Government; £8,704,252 for payments to States; £387,096 to. cover deficits from the operation of business activities; and £343,251 for deficits on Commonwealth Territories, making a total expenditure of £61,818,846. The revenue account is £58,996,261, leaving a deficit as shown by .the Treasury, of £2,822,585. But it will be noticed that no credit has been given for any of -the transfers to trust funds. The actual, surplus for the year, allowing for the amounts credited to trust funds, is found to be £2,127,415, and the accumulated surplus brought forward is £659,529, making a total of £2,786,944. . If we deduct from . that total the amount of £2,500,000 which ' was transferred, to trust funds from the surplus for the year 1925-26 we arrive at the Treasurer's balance of £286,944. . </para>

        <para>It is interesting to make a comparison of the Federal taxation raised, in the last two years with that proposed to be levied in the current year. The figures are as follow : - </para>
        <para class="block">At first sight there appears to be a big reduction in estate duties and land tax but on closely examining the position, one finds that only a change of taxing masters is proposed. No reduction in 'taxation has taken place. When the people of Australia hear of .the, overflowing coffers of the Federal Treasury, and  realize that year after year no proposal for a reduction of taxation is made, they naturally ask themselves whether the huge Federal surpluses are due to excessive economy or to over-taxation. They do not' imagine for a moment that it is due to an excess of economy. The firmly rooted belief in their minds is that the Federal surplus represents the product of excessive taxation, from which they should be given some relief. The enormous revenues of the Commonwealth are due entirely to the exertions and business acumen of the people, and they observe that this gross political spending is brought about only by that real development which taxpayers create, despite the heavy drain for taxation purposes. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> I think, described the budget as a deliberate attempt to exaggerate expenditure and under-estimate revenue for the purpose of creating a feeling that the Customs revenue was not sufficient to cover the Commonwealth expenditure. </para>

            <para>- I do not say that I do; but I shall deal with that point later. I realize that the Commonwealth Treasury officials have many difficulties to overcome in preparing their estimates. There are a number of Commonwealth public works to be carried on, such, for instance, as the Murray River waters scheme, in respect of which the estimated cost is often exceeded. The estimated cost of that work has been doubled Then we have the Grafton to South Brisbane railway. Before that work had proceeded far, the estimated cost was increased by £500,000. We also have the works at Canberra, which may be likened to a capacious maw into which the. Commonwealth can empty many millions of pounds without satisfying the necessities of that enterprise. </para>

            <para>- No. I come now to the subject of the proposed withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> dealt with the matter largely from the point of view of the early history of the Federal movement, and the events that preceded its consummation. I am totally opposed to. the withdrawal of the payments. We should realize that while the Commonwealth has a domain in which it has to incur considerable expenditure, the States also have large financial commitments, and if the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments are withheld, the State Treasurers will be seriously embarrassed. . I am speaking particularly from the point of view of the Treasurer of Tasmania. The States have to raise by way of taxation the revenue required to carry on their respective systems of organized government. They have to provide the police force required to maintain the public peace. They have to deal with public health and education. An ever increasing sum is required for educational purposes. They have further to provide for a State judiciary, and all the institutions that are vital to modern civilization. In short, they have to supply nearly all our public utilities with the exception of the Postal Department. These services cannot be carried on without substantial revenues. I have heard it said that no moral obligation rests upon the Commonwealth to pay the surplus revenue to the States, but I contend that there is a very material obligation upon it to do so. Prior to federation Tasmania derived 74 per cent. of her total revenue from the Customs House. When she entered the Federation she necessarily vacated the field of Customs taxation; but she, in common with the other States, certainly anticipated that she would have returned to her by the Commonwealth a substantial proportion of the Customs and excise revenue. </para>

            <para>- It was so described at the time; but no one could suggest a substitute for it. What is the position that now confronts Tasmania? It is contended by some that there is no moral obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to return to the States any part of its Customs. Lean only say that had there not been an understanding on the part of Tasmania that she would be refunded a portion of the revenue received from Customs and excise duties, she would not have joined the Federation. An express provision for the return to the States of a portion of the Customs and excise revenue for all time was not inserted in the Constitution, for the reason that while several of the States imposed protective duties, New South Wales was a freetrade State. I appreciate the difficulties which confronted the framers of the Constitution in forecasting the probable position in subsequent years. To have made the Constitution rigid, in this respect might have presented great difficulties. But I remind the Senate that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was dealing with the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments in 1909 he felt, as did others, that the spirit underlying the financial bargain made in establishing the Federation was that a considerable amount of the Customs and excise revenue should be returned to the States.

            <para>- That is so, and that is the reason why nearly every honorable senator who has spoken has stated that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments were to be made from revenue derived from Customs and  excise  duties. At that time there was no Federal income taxation, and only a small amount was received from land taxation. Were the proposal of the Commonwealth Government to vacate the field of direct taxation altogether, the position would certainly be improved; but it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall vacate that field to the extent of only 40 per cent. Forty per cent, of the income tax payable by individuals resident in Tasmania would, according to the Treasurer's figures, be £80,629. A number of Tasmanian members of Parliament, being seriously concerned about the position, approached the commissioner of taxation for Tasmania, who informed them that that amount could not be obtained from a 40 per cent, tax on the incomes of persons resident in Tasmania. It would be insufficient to make a bald statement of that nature without figures to substantiate it. I have the figures.

Honorable senators will, therefore, see that if the Treasurer of Tasmania accepted the figures of the Commonwealth Treasurer, he would be in a serious position at the end of the year.

It has been said that Tasmania would be very much better off under the Treasurer's proposals than she would be if the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments were continued. Let us, in this connexion, consider the decline in Tasmania's production since 1901. The following table shows the amount of production per head of population in each State and in the Commonwealth, as a whole, for the years 1901, 1914, and 1923-24:- </para>

        <para class="block">The trouble with Tasmania to-day is that her production, per head, is not being maintained. It is only 73 per cent, of the production, per head, of the Commonwealth as a whole. As estimates of taxation are usually based on production, honorable senators will see from the figures I have submitted from the Treasurer, the reduction that has taken place in the assessments since 1920-21, and, therefore, how serious is the position of that State. In 1901, the gold produced in Australia was valued at £21,816,772 or nearly 20 per cent, of the total primary production of the Commonwealth. By 1923-24, that production had decreased to £3,143,824. or less than 1 per cent, of the total. Tasmania has been seriously affected bv that reduction. </para>

        <para class="block">That is true. History furnishes many examples of men who have impressed the world by their soundness of heart and moral worth - men who have improved the conditions of their fellows - who admitted that their influence for good was due to their early home training. The problem of dealing with slums and with the housing of the poorer sections of the community has always been a difficult one in Qld World countries. Between 1851 and 1914, many measures dealing with the housing of the people of Great Britain, were introduced into the British </para>
        <para class="block">House of Commons. Then came the great, war. A report issued by the International Labour section of the Geneva Convention shows that the housing problem has been acute throughout Europe since the war. It has been acute, too, in Australia, although, to some extent, the position has been alleviated by the work of the Repatriation Commission. The reason for the acuteness of the housing problem is that great numbers of persons who were on the land were attracted to the cities, which promised many inducements and high wages. Overcrowding iu cities was thus greatly intensified. Private enterprise could not meet the demand, and building costs to-day are practically double what they were in pre-war days. That means that rents are greatly increased. Honorable senators will readily understand that unless real wages also increased materially, the cost of housing was bound to become a serious problem in the lives of the people. The difficulty can be overcome only by means of a subsidy. The Government, like Dickens - that master painter of pen pictures, who was able to show how slum conditions affected the moral fibre of the people - feels that reform should first take place in the homes of the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> late Minister for Education in Great Britain, said that bad housing and bad morals went together.

The Treasurer proposes to obtain from the Commonwealth Bank money for the housing scheme. I think I can point to a better source. The Commonwealth Government is committed to a scheme of national insurance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> said just now that no report had yet been received from the National Insurance Commission.

        <para>I wish now to refer to the subject of Commonwealth standards, in connexion with which an association has been established by the Commonwealth Government for the purpose of bringing about economy in methods of manufacture. Great economic advantage can be obtained by standardization. Already about 20 different national standard associations have been established throughout the civilized world, and these associations have done extraordinarily good work in bringing about reductions in the cost of manufacture. They can do even more than that. Employment can be stabilized, as the manufacturer in . periods of temporary trade depression can manufacture to stock', knowing that future orders will be for a standard product. The Standards Association of Great Britain was established in 1901, and has been in active operation ever since. In 1918 the Commonwealth Institute of. Science and Industry, under the old regime, endeavoured to introduce a system of standards for Australia. It called a meeting of engineers, manufacturers, and producers, at which it was unanimously decided that something should be done. Nothing, however, was accomplished until 1922, when the Institute of Engineers was invited to take the matter up. This it did in February, 1922, and in October of the same year the Engineering Standards Association was gazetted.I propose to give a <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of the functions of the association. </para>
        <para>The Australian Commonwealth Engineering Standards Association was founded as I have said; in October, 1922, when the appointment of members of the main committee of the association was gazetted. The main committee is constituted of three representatives of the Commonwealth Government, one representative of each of the State Governments, six representatives of the Institute of Engineers, Australia, three representatives of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, three representatives of the Australian Chemical "Institute. Subsequently the Associated -Chambers of Manufactures of Australia and the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the Commonwealth of Australia were each invited to nominate a representative. The objects of the association include <inline font-style="italic">inter alia: -</inline> (a)To prepare and promote the general adoption of standards in connexion with engineering structures, materials, matters and things and from time to time to revise, alter and amend the same. (b) To co-ordinate the efforts of producers and users for the improvement of engineering materials, processes and methods. </para>
        <para>The functions of the main committee, in which the control of the association is vested, are as follows : - </para>

        <para>The association does not undertake the preparation of standard specifications on its own initiative. When a recommendation is received from an interested party for the preparation of a specification for any particular product, material, or process, the project is referred to the association's State committees by which an exhaustive investigation is made as to the need of the proposed specification. The reports of these investigations are considered by the main committee, and if such consideration is favorable, a sectional committee is established to undertake the particular work involved. Every possible care is exercised to ensure that all interests concerned in the work of such a sectional committee are adequately represented in the personnel of the committee as finally constituted. Provision is made, however, to ensure that consuming interests shall predominate. Sectional committees may appoint sub and panel committees to. consider . special, phases of the work under review, and in these instances the conservation of interests must be also provided for. </para>
        <para>The reports of sectional committees in due. course are submitted to the main committee and if approved, are published as tentative standards. The main committee does not concern itself with the technical details of a standard, but considers the procedure followed in the. formulation thereof, the adequacy of the representation of interests concerned, and the action by which the standard was adopted by the sectional committee. Standards are published in " tentative" form for a period of twelve months, to enable recommendations for their amendment resulting from their use during this period to be submitted for consideration when reviewing the specification with a view to its publication as an Australian standard. </para>
        <para>These Australian standards have been very largely adopted by employers and employees, manufacturers, and producers, and are to-day being extensively embodied in various college text-books. The University authorities have also appreciated the work done by the standards committees, and have decided to include its standards in their text-books. Summarizing the position, it may be claimed that benefits accruing under standardization include the following : - From the point of view of the manufacturer, less capital is tied up in raw material, stock, jigs, and templates, storage space, repair parts, &amp;c. More economical manufacture is assured through increased production, less idle equipment, reduced overhead charges, elimination of waste in experimentation and design, greater ease in securing raw materials, and so on; more efficient labour and better service to the trade in supplying better quality of product with more prompt delivery; more efficient sales force; increased rate of turnover; easier financing; and fewer stoppages of work. The retailer benefits by the increased rate of turnover, decreased capital investment in stock and storage space, reduced stock depreciation, decreased overhead charges, and better service at lower prices, with quicker and more reliable deliveries. The consumer gains in the opportunity to obtain a product of improved and guaranteed quality at a lower price, with better service in the way of prompt deliveries. </para>
        <para>One of the most important functions that standardization can perform to-day is the building up, on a national inter-industrial basis, of a consensus of expert opinion in regard to the inter-relations of industry and the relations of industry to the public. Standardization thus leads to the realization of economy in a very large measure. It constitutes an important economic factor for both producer and consumer, and, if it should result in increased efficiency in trade and industry, it is indeed a matter of moment to public economy. </para>

            <para>- No. Honorable senators are aware that there are in Australia, in connexion with electrical systems, a great many voltages, frequencies, and different types of machines all performing similar classes of work. If manufacturers have to keep the templates, patterns, and other paraphernalia necessary to the manufacture of machines of a variety of designs, the cost must necessarily be greater. But if the engineer, manufacturer, and user confer in the preparation of the specification of a machine that will meet all requirements, there can be no loss of efficiency. The Australian Standards Association does not say to a manufacturer, " Here is our specification ; you must either accept it or reject it." Under the procedure adopted by it, a specification which has been considered and prepared by experts in the particular branch concerned, remains for twelve months as a tentative specification, and if, at the end of that period, no objections have been raised, it becomes the Australian standard specification. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> For the information of the Senate, I submit the following table showing the number of sectional committees of the Engineering Standards Association that have been formed and the number of specifications published by them and approved for issue: - </para>

        <para>I desire now to make a few observations upon the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. I am exceedingly pleased that the Government took steps to reorganize the Institute. Very eminent gentlemen have been appointed to the Council, and a considerable amount of excellent work can be anticipated. The Estimates make provision for certain expenditure under separate headings, of which an example is " Stock diseases and pests - investigation, including cattle tick, buffalo fly, £5,400." The total estimated expenditure is £35,300. I should like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> at a later stage to supply details indicating the manner in which those figures have been made up. I sincerely trust that it is not the intention of the Council to publish bulletins written in a manner that does not appeal to the average farmer. I desire the Council to follow the example which has been set by a big experimental station in England, by indicating practically what can be produced, the extent of the production, and its probable cost. Applying a simile that has been employed by an economist in the United States of America, "The national table is wobbling."  His  illustration consisted of a table, on one end of which were secondary industries, and on the other end primary industries. The former were well stabilized by Customs duties, arbitration courts, and other aids to industrial stability, but there were no legs at the other end of the table bolster ing up the primary industries. This Council, however, can bolster them up. I know that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> is very anxious that action should be taken to assist Tasmania, and I sincerely trust that the Government will take steps to that end. In the earlier portion of my speech I referred to Tasmania's production, amounting to only 73 per cent. of the production per head of the Commonwealth as a whole. That position can be rectified by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. It is, in my opinion, necessary to establish experimental plots in Tasmania to educate the farmers, agriculturists, and pastoralists as to what it is possible to produce. I am perfectly well aware that the Council has not the equipment necessary to undertake the work which falls within some of the items that appear in the Estimates. I trust that the figures are included, not merely as an eye-wash, but as an indication that the Government is extremely anxious to aid primary and secondary industries. It is within its power to do so, particularly in the State that I have the honour to represent. </para>

          <para>. - This motion gives honorable senators an opportunity of dealing with a number of matters that do not arise in the ordinary business of the Senate. The loan indebtedness of the Commonwealth and the States must cause the various Treasurers a great deal of concern. Amongst other matters, the budget-papers refer to the proposed separation of the finances of the Commonwealth and the States. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> who said that in theory that might be all right. I go further than that, and say that, so far as it is practicable to do so, such a policy ought to be adopted. It must be remembered, however, that the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States have been interwoven ever since the establishment of federation. That could not be avoided. Prior to federation the States had large commitments, the principal of which was interest upon loans. One can readily understand the anxiety, even apprehension, of the States at that time, as to what their position would be under federation. It must be admitted that, in a measure, they were taking a leap in the dark. I am sure that every honorable senator will give to those who were in the forefront of the movement to establish federation, and were responsible for the framing of the Constitution, the credit which is undoubtedly their due. They performed their work faithfully and well without anything to guide them as to what was likely to follow. The sources of revenue of the States, following Federation, were of necessity somewhat limited. Prior to that time, many of them derived the bulk of their revenue from Customs and excise duties. I regret that, at present, there is between the States and the Commonwealth a feeling that should not exist. </para>

            <para>- I do not view the matter in that light. Those of us who move about amongst our constituents know that such a feeling does exist. I am not arguing that there is justification for it; but it must be obvious to the Government that the best results can be achieved only by the closest co-operation between and co-ordination of the work of, the Commonwealth and the States. This is the one subject that comes directly within the province of every honorable senator, because the Senate is a States House, and we should jealously safeguard the interests of the States when interference with their rights is threatened, and it is considered that any suggested action by the Commonwealth Government might affect prejudicially the government of their people. Recently certain financial proposals were placed before the Treasurers of the various States, but did not prove acceptable to them. I do not say that those representatives exhibited a reasonable spirit. I understand that they declined to discuss the proposals in detail. It is most unfortunate that they and the Treasurer of the Commonwealth did not reach a closer understanding. The budget speech outlines an entirely new financial arrangement, and one which the Treasurers of the States have never had an opportunity to discuss. They had refused to advance counter proposals at the conference, and the Commonwealth Government, perhaps, thought that it was justified in submitting to this Parliament fresh proposals without affording those who were directly affected by them an opportunity to discuss and pronounce upon them. </para>

I remind the honorable senator that, about 1923, or earlier, when the State Treasurers first discussed the Commonwealth proposals, it was clearly show that the Federal figures were wrong. At any rate, those submitted on behalf of the Commonwealth have never been reconciled with those put forward by the States. </para>

            <para>- The revenue will be collected on the same basis this year as in 1925-26. The Commonwealth Treasurer proposes to levy income tax having a certain incidence, and yielding to the Commonwealth a certain revenue, which he outlined in the memorandum submitted with the proposals. But I cannot see how the State Treasurers can levy taxation having the same incidence, and providing the same amount of revenue as that now received by the Commonwealth Treasurer. Take the matter of the aggregation of incomes. The State has not the machinery for the aggregation of incomes. </para>

            <para>- Apart from the aggregation of incomes, I do not think that the States will "be able to realize the amount of tax that the Commonwealth Treasurer now receives, without considerably increasing the rate of the income tax. Before the war, practically the only revenue available to the Commonwealth was that derived from Customs and excise duties, and from the land tax; all the other fields of taxation were available to the States, I think that every State realized, during the war period, that it should not encroach more than was absolutely necessary to balance its ledger upon any avenues of taxation that could be left to the Commonwealth to enable it to prosecute the war. The Commonwealth was compelled at that time to enter fields of taxation into which it would not otherwise have gone. Nobody imagined for a moment that its revenues, other than from direct taxation, would have increased in the substantial manner that has been indicated by the Treasurer's surpluses from time to time. The States have been looking to the Commonwealth to vacate the field of direct taxation, and make it available to the States as it was prior to 1914. I am not favorable to the proposals outlined by the Commonwealth Treasurer. </para>

            <para>- I do not know. During the first ten years of federation they were encouraged to budget in that way, and they were further induced to do  so by the passage of the Surplus Revenue Act, -which provided for the capitation payments. It is regrettable that the Commonwealth's proposals are now being forced upon the States. We, in this Parliament, represent exactly the same people as those for whom the State Parliaments legislate, and since Commonwealth and State taxpayers are identical, why should there be such an urgent desire to separate Commonwealth and State finances? It seems to me that the best results are to be obtained by the closest co-operation between the State and Federal authorities. The State Governments have borne the heat and burden of the day. Although Australia has made great progress under federation, the Commonwealth as a whole is indebted to the States for the spade work that they have done. They have their commitments to meet, and rather than do anything to cause hostility between them and the Commonwealth, we should endeavour in every way to work harmoniously with them. Proposals such as the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments under the present bill certainly create friction. </para>

            <para>- That shows that, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Government itself, the best authority to undertake this work is the State Government. If schemes of this kind are to be undertaken by governments, it is preferable that the States, and not the Commonwealth, should carry them out. The Commonwealth should deal with questions of a purely national character. Important as housing may be, it is, nevertheless, not the function of the Commonwealth Government. Rather than embark on this undertaking, the Commonwealth should make cheap money available to the States to enable them to supplement the schemes already in existence. </para>

            <para>- I recognize that; but the Commonwealth proposes to make the money available only under certain conditions. The works to be undertaken must first be approved by the Commonwealth. Moreover, the States are  required to contribute 15s. for every £1 advanced by the Commonwealth; the original proposal was on a <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per £l basis. In the case of Tasmania, £75,000 will have to be provided by the State. The Commonwealth proposes to raise the money which will be expended in roadmaking by means of a tax on petrol. I shall not refer to that other than to say that, in my opinion, no more equitable way of raising the money could be found than by the imposition of a tax on petrol. Nevertheless, as the tax will be paid by the motor users in the several States, it would be better if the Government were to make the money available to the States, imposing no conditions other than that it should be expended in road construction. Why should the Commonwealth require the States to contribute 15s. for every £1 advanced to them? It would be sufficient if the States were required to submit annual returns showing how the money had been expended. That some of the States object to the Government's proposals is not to be wondered at. They are not so much concerned with the source from which the money is obtained as with the conditions under which it may be expended. </para>

The making of roads is distinctly the function of the States. In this connexion they have done good work in the past. That they did not do more was due entirely to their restricted revenues. Until about five years ago Tasmania spent from loan as much money in making roads and bridges as did all the other States combined. Successive governments in Tasmania, realizing that in broken country with a wet climate good roads were necessary for the development of the State, constructed many excellent roads. </para>

Hitherto they have not been successfully exploited because suitable retorts have not been employed; and I believe that I am correct in saying that no official in the employ of the Government has had any experience in retorting. It is of the utmost importance that this business should be developed on sound lines, because there are millions of tons of shale in both New South Wales and Tasmania rich in oil content, which, I am sure, will one day prove of great value. </para><interjection>

          <para>. - I congratulate the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> upon the early presentation of the budget, which constitutes a record, and establishes a precedent by which Governments should be guided in the future. I also express my appreciation of the service rendered by the officers of the Department of the Treasury who. in assisting in the preparation of the budget, have accomplished a creditable task. It is interesting to  note that in 1910 the budget was presented on 1st August; in 1911, on 7th September; in 1912, on 26th October; in 1914, on 3rd December; while that for 1915 was not brought down until the following year. During the debate on this motion an attempt has been made by some honorable senators to criticize the Country party. In the first place, I wish to refer to some of the remarks uttered by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham),</inline> who evidently considered the Country party of such importance that he devoted a good portion of his time to a criticism of its activities. Amongst other things he said that " This is evidently a one-man government, as the work of the country could not proceed during the Prime Minister's absence in Great Britain." On the other hand we are told that the Treasurer is controlling the Government. Surely those statements are contradictory. He also said that the Country party was diminishing in strength, and, in effect, that it was dying. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator will find it difficult to prove his statements, particularly when the representation of the Country party in this chamber has increased to four, whilst that of the party to which he belongs has decreased. He also said that " The Country party, which once had individuality, has now lost it, and has become entirely absorbed by the Nationalists." The Country party is represented with the Nationalists in the composite Government, but it has not been absorbed by the Nationalist party, and has not in any way lost its identity. The members of both parties went before the electors with a joint policy, and their action met with the general approval of the people. </para>

            <para>- The electors approved of a composite government, and returned its supporters with an overwhelming majority. I can understand the Leader of the Opposition criticizing the policies of the Nationalist and Country parties, but I do not know why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> should have referred to certain statements of the present Treasurer before the composite Government was formed. At the time to which the honorable senator referred the Country party had no representation in the Cabinet, and was justified in criticizing the actions of the Government then in power. On the hustings many bitter statements were made by the members of both parties, and it is absurd for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> to suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page should withdraw certain statements he made as leader of a party which was then in opposition. Would the honorable senator ask the right honorable gentleman who was then Leader of the Government to withdraw some of the things he said ? </para>

        <para>The Leader of the Opposition further said that the expenditure incurred by this Government during recent years has been of no practical advantage to Australia. The amounts of expenditure from revenue he quoted were - </para>

          <graphic href="114332192608045_28_11.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para class="block">Those amounts are exclusive of part IV. of the budget, which relates to payments to or for the States. During the four years mentioned our expenditure, according to these figures, increased by £9, 200,000, and the Leader of the Opposition urged that although the Treasurer had supported a policy of economy when in opposition, he, as Treasurer, was now going with a rapid stream of extravagance and making no effort to stem it. If we refer to page 8 of the budget-papers, we  find that the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> included the expenditure on business undertakings, which was £11,552,000, and that in relation to territories of the' Commonwealth amounting to £385,000. The details of the £11,552,000 incurred on business undertakings are on page 293, and include the Post and Telegraph Department and Commonwealth railways. The actual revenue from these sources in 1925-26 was £11,164,906. On page 4 of the budget papers the actual expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department is given as £10,654,000, and the receipts as £10,815,251, so that the receipts and expenditure practically balance. Since the present Treasurer has been in office the ordinary postage rate has been reduced from. 2d. to1½d., and telephone charges owing to the zoning system, have been decreased by about £100,000 per annum. It cannot, therefore, be said that these departments have been extravagant. To ascertain the true position the figures in relation to the business undertakings should be excluded. As the Postal Department has been operating on reduced revenue, economy must have been exercised to enable it to show a profit. If we exclude the Postal and Telegraph Department and the Commonwealth railways, we find that the total expenditure for 1922-23 was £55,128,685, that of business undertakings amounting to £9,370,615, and war and statutory departmental expenditure £45,758,069. For the year. 1925-26 the total expenditure was £64,321,473, that of business undertakings amounting to £11,937,226, and war and statutory departmental expenditure £52,384,247. Deducting the expenditure on business undertakings, we find that the increase has been from £45,758,069 to £52,384,247 - £6,626,17S, not £9,200,000 as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> The difference of nearly £3,000,000 is accounted for by increased expenditure upon the post office, from which a corresponding revenue has been received. Let us examine this increase of £6,626,178. Old-age pensions account for £2,828,366, science and industry £350,000, prospecting for oils and precious metals £100,000, wine bounty £217,109, and iron and steel bounty £195,733. The defence expenditure in 1922-23 amounted to £3,409,167, whilst in 1925-26 it was £7,353,828, an increase of £3,944,661. Debt redemption was responsible for £1,000,000. The total of those increases is £8,635,869. I ask honorable senators whether they do not consider them to be absolutely necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has asked what we have received in return for our expenditure. Would ho agree to cut down the votes for old-age pensions, science' and industry, prospecting and the wine bounty? As a South Australian representative,, I hope that the wine bounty will not be reduced, because it has been the means of keeping the grape-growers on their holdings, and has saved the industry from ruin. It must be remembered that a great deal of Government money is invested in the vineyards. On the remaining items of expenditure there has been a reduction of no less a sum than £2,000,000. </para>

        <para class="block">There has been a reduction of £158,334, although the population has increased by 600,000. That is a very fine performance, and I doubt whether any other Government in the world could show a similar result. In 1921-22 the cost of the Commonwealth departments per head of population was 10s. 9d. The estimate for 1926-27 is 9s. 2d. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> also touched upon the net debt of the Commonwealth. He showed that in 1922-23 it amounted to £335,000,000, and in 1925-26 to £338,000,000, an increase of £3,000,000. This Ministry came into office in February, 1923, and in order to make a just comparison we must take the figures as at the preceding June. The net debt on the 30th June, 1922, was £339,002,105, whilst at the 30th June, 1926, it was £338,841,476. During that period it decreased by £160,629.

            <para>- The conclusions that I draw are different from those of some honorable senators who spoke this afternoon. I am in agreement with the proposals, because I regard the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments as inequitable. The States that have large populations derive the greatest benefits in addition to other advantages which the federation confers upon them. The States are resisting the proposals of the Commonwealth upon moral, not upon constitutional grounds. Section 87 of the Constitution reads: - </para>

        <para class="block">The first portion of that section, as was pointed out this afternoon, did not appear in the Constitution as originally drafted; it was inserted at a later period. It can be seen that the matter was to be left in the hands of the Federal Parliament after the lapse of tcn years. It was evidently intended that Commonwealth charges should be met first out of Customs and excise. That field of taxation was handed over to the Commonwealth exclusively. The framers of the Constitution were fearful lest it should be invaded. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> stated that he had fully read the debates that took place at the conventions which were held prior to the establishment of federation. I have not had that opportunity, but I have perused some of the speeches which were delivered on this phase of the matter particularly. At the Federal Convention, which was held in Melbourne in 189S, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. (afterwards Sir George)</inline> Reid said - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I point out that this will make a peculiarity in the position of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, which needs only to be stated to be seen at once. The Treasurer of the Commonwealth, when re is constructing  his fabric  of ways and means, will have the strongest possible temptation to look on Customs and' excise as an unsatisfactory method of raising revenue, because he only gets 5s. out of every ?1 raised in that way, whereas, from other forms of taxation, he gets the full pound raised. Now, I must say, it is scarcely a scientific piece of legislation to put that temptation in the way of the Treasurer to make him discriminate as to methods of taxation. </para>

No; I should go to a source which gave me the whole pound. I only put this view as one objection to this proposal, because it makes the position of the Commonwealth in a peculiar 6tate_. inasmuch as one form of taxation . will give the Treasurer 100 per cent, of the 'taxes raised, and the other only 25 per cent.

            <para>- The circumstances would have to be most exceptional. Interest on war loans, the cost of providing war pensions and old-age pensions, and defence expenditure, now amount to £43,000,000, several millions more than the Customs returns. Surely the first charge for that expenditure should be against the field of taxation handed over exclusively to the Commonwealth. From the debates at the Federal Convention it will be seen that the desire expressed by the representatives of the States was to restrict the Commonwealth to Customs taxation. The State Premiers also have agreed to the cessation of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments on certain conditions. The report of the Premiers' Conference in 1923 shows that. </para>

Great misconception exists in the public mind on that matter. Many people have told me that it is monstrous for the Commonwealth to withhold those payments and give nothing to the States in return. But, of course, honorable senators know that the Federal Government proposes to relinquish the land tax, the entertainments tax, the estate duty, and 40 per cent. of the income tax. I point out that the taxes to be relinquished will greatly exceed the amount at present paid to the States by way of capitation grants; the Commonwealth Government guarantees that after collecting those taxes for one year every State will be £50,000 better off than previously. </para>

          <para>The Commonwealth Government claimed that the income tax figures were based on the actual assessments for 1924-25, but mention was not made of the fact that during the year under review many assessments had been made which were not rightly attributable to the previous year. That position arose through the delay consequent upon the amalgamation of the Taxation Departments. Figures available in the Taxation Department of this State showed that tax totalling between £300,000 and £400,000, added to the tax for the year 1924-25, rightly belonged to the previous year, and represented a carry-over of tax assessed but not collected, and tax on assessments not made until after the close of the financial year to which they belonged, namely, 1923-24. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PAYNE</inline>(Tasmania) 18.46].- A perusal of the Treasurer's budget speech shows that it' refers to many matters of great importance to the Commonwealth, in addition to those concerning finance. With one or two of them I propose to deal before touching on the financial proposals of  the Government as set out in the budget. </para>
        <para>Special reference is made to the continuance of the Government's road policy. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> that the assistance offered by the Commonwealth is in the nature of an intrusion in the domain of the States. Irrespective of whether the States agree with the Government's proposals, they are not justified in regarding the offer in that light. I am pleased that the Government has seen its way clear to propose a more-extensive and comprehensive roads policy than that which has existed in the past in connexion with the roads grant schedule, and that during the next ten years the sum of £20,000,000 will be made available for road construction and maintenance. </para>

          <para>- Yes; and so it should be. While agreeing with the Government's policy, 1 feel compelled to protest against the method which is to be adopted to obtain the money to be devoted to road-making. I am entirely opposed to the Government's proposal to impose a Customs duty of 2d. per gallon on petrol. The Government and its supporters have on many occasions stated that the construction of roads is of national concern, and that its roads policy is in the interests of the people as a whole and not of any one section only. Every one will admit that for the proper development of Australia an effective transport system is essential. If the scheme is a national one, the financial responsibility should be borne by the whole of the people, and not by only one section. For that reason I am opposed to the proposed petrol tax. No one would suggest that the owners of motor vehicles, whether such vehicles are used for commercial purposes or otherwise, should be unduly penalized. Motors have come "to stay. Nothing is more calculated to assist in the development of this country than the petrol-driven machine. Old methods of transport are obsolete, and in order to keep up to date Australia must have petrol-driven vehicles. Already the several States have imposed taxes on motor users with the object of obtaining revenue for the construction and maintenance of roads. It is not fair that, in addition to those taxes the Commonwealth Government should call upon them to pay a tax on petrol. It is proposed to spend the sum of £20,000,000 on roads in Australia during the next ten years. That represents £2,000,000 per annum. During each of the last two years the Commonwealth Government  has expended £150,000 or £160,000 on road construction and maintenance. We must remember that the roads  which will be constructed with this money will be available, not only during our life-time, but also during the life-time of future generations. </para>

If the Commonwealth Government were to issue each year, bonds to the value of £2,000,000, that amount would be available for road construction each year. Under a continuous policy, bonds to the value of £2,000,000 would also be issued each succeeding year. At the end of ten years the first £2,000,000 would be redeemed. </para>

        <para>The Treasurer's budget, speech makes special reference to the appointment of a commission to carry out the development and migration proposals of the Government. We all hope that very good results will be the outcome of the Government's scheme. I wish to impress upon the Senate the urgent need for the introduction of a larger population at the earliest possible date to provide a larger home market for our primary producers. It has been suggested that the introduction of migrants in considerable numbers will seriously affect the Australian labour market, and accentuate our unemployed problem. I take the view that our object should be to place migrants on our undeveloped country areas rather than to add to the congested populations of our cities and larger towns. I have no desire to see adult Australians displaced in employment by migrants. I believe that, with- out interfering with our present labour conditions, employment can be found for all who may come to Australia. For the information of the Senate I should like to read a short extract from an article written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtis</inline> Lampson,  and published in a recent issue , of <inline font-style="italic">John</inline><inline font-style="italic">Bull</inline> on the growing need- in England for agrarian reform. The writer- states - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Certainly drastic steps ought to be taken, for we have approximately 11,000,000 acres of arable- land lying idle, and at the same time we import a great deal of agricultural produce and food which we ought to produce in this country. Last year Great Britain imported nearly £400,000,000 worth of meat, bacon, cheese, and butter. Certainly 90 per cent, of these imports could have been produced in this country. In the matter of enabling a small man to- own the plot of ground that he cultivates, we are much behind many other European nations. ... The future, therefore, of agriculture in this country lies in live stock and dairy produce, the production of which can be organized on a thriving basis by subdividing the appropriated land into small holdings. The welfare of the nation and its people must be made the primary object in the governing of the country. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It is evident that there is a growing feeling amongst thinkers in the Mother Country along the lines indicated by the writer of that article. This kind of feeling has some significance for Australia, because Great Britain is our best customer. We have to rely to a great extent upon British markets for the <inline font-style="italic">absorp-</inline> tion of our surplus primary products.. The fact that there is a growing agitation in England for the fuller utilization of idle lands there indicates how necessary it is that we should do something quickly to secure a larger population in Australia for the consumption of our primary products. </para>
        <para>For many years we have, been wasting our valuable timber resources. Unless we take steps to stop the drift, we shall be in serious difficulties. We have magnificent forest reserves, but unfortunately vast areas have been denuded for commercial purposes without steps being taken to replace the used timber. Afforestation in Australia is in its infancy, but it is reassuring to know that, a scheme has been outlined in Tasmania to repair some of the damage that has been done in the past. The proposal emanates from the head of the Afforestation Department in Tasmania. Briefly, the suggestion is that the Imperial Government should finance a scheme under which many thousands of British boys, who have to be cared for in State institutions and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Barnardo's</inline> Homes, would be transferred to Australia, and provided with useful employment in colonies under the direction of the Afforestation Department. The lads would receive a useful training in afforestation and in the growing of primary products. The money would be advanced by Great Britain for a term of 40 to 45 years. At the expiration of that term the forest plantations would be profit-earning, and then the whole of the liability would be liquidated in eleven years. It is suggested that the boys should be grouped in four colonies, each containing about 50 boys. They would be living under ideal conditions, and would receive very useful training. At the age of about eighteen years they would be able to leave the colonies and obtain work as farm assistants. It is expected that they would then have from £80 to £100 each. This scheme would not in any way interfere with the Australian labour market. It would ensure a steady inflow of very desirable immigrants, and at the same time it would be instrumental in building up the timber resources of the Commonwealth. I know that afforestation schemes are in operation in all of the States, but no scheme that I know of has underlying it the principle of migration. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator has totally misunderstood the proposal. This scheme is to relieve Great Britain of some portion of her unemployed. Under whatever migration policy we adopt, every effort should be made to prevent increased unemployment in Australia, and the introduction of healthy boys will be of great advantage to Australia, because it will not be long before they become productive units. </para>

        <para>I wish now to deal with the question of the adjustment of Commonwealth and State finances, concerning which a good deal has been said by honorable senators who have preceded me. I have endeavoured to analyse the position, and to determine whether the financial proposals of the Government will or will not be of advantage to the State which I represent. The Tasmanian Government has, I know, expressed strong opposition to the scheme, but that does not influence me in the least, as I have to exercise my own intelligence. If I believe the proposals of the Government will benefit Tasmania, although they may be somewhat distasteful to the State Government, I shall support them. After studying the figures available, I have come to the conclusion that Tasmania would benefit if the proposed scheme were adopted. I have, however, been informed by capable financial authorities that the figures submitted in the budget-papers cannot be realized by the States. </para>

            <para>- It is provided that an adjustment can be made so that the States will not suffer, and that the Commonwealth will collect the revenue for the current year. If the Government will extend the term for five years, I shall support' the proposals. That is a fair proposition, because most of the financial arrangements made with the States have extended over a term of years. The Braddon ' ' blot " was in operation for ten years, and the next arrangement was for a period of ten years; but we are now asked to adopt a new system which is to remain in force for only one year. As the scheme will affect the whole financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States, the Commonwealth Government should be willing to carry on for at least five years the arrangement it proposes for only one year. </para>

Out of a total war expenditure of £500,000,000 approximately £200,000,000 has been provided from revenue, thus leaving our war debt at, approximately, £300,000,000. It is a wonderful record, and one which I dc? not think can be equalled by any country, including Great Britain. </para>

          <para>. - There are so many subjects mentioned in the budget that, in the limited time at my disposal, it would be impossible for me to discuss more than a few. I should, however, be lacking in my duty if, after all the statements we have heard concerning the best methods of raising revenue, I failed to place on record what I regard as the modern canons of taxation. It is positively humiliating and absurd to hear honorable senators expound their theories concerning the method of raising our national revenue. </para>

The honorable senator, I believe, understands the theory which I intend to elaborate, but for reasons best known to himself he carefully refrains from expressing his opinions on it. Some honorable senators recently elected to this Chamber should be supplied with the information I have to give, and if I place it at their disposal they will perhaps be. spared the necessity of giving utterance to the erroneous views expressed by many of those with whom they are now associated. </para>

            <para>- That is an erroneous idea. In Queensland local taxation is imposed and collected in strict accordance with the principles I have just enunciated, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> cannot deny that the system has worked satisfactorily. . No objection has been taken to that method of taxation in the local government of Queensland during the last 40 years. Instead of having been exploded, it is firmly entrenched in Queensland, and is working exceedingly well. The progress of Brisbane to-day is almost as great as that of Sydney, mainly on account of its system of taxation. </para>

            <para>- Unquestionably. Such a system was not heard of before 1879, when Henry George first published his book, <inline font-style="italic">Progress and Poverty.</inline> It has been in operation in the shires and municipalities of New South Wales since the beginning of this century. Even conservative Sydney has not taxed improvements for many years. If you care to build a home for yourself in Hobart, the council in that city - which is an obsolete body - immediately pounces upon and penalizes you in proportion to the amount of capital you invest and the labour you employ. That is a reason for the constant wail by Tasmanians that their State" is poverty-stricken. They have not the sense to remove taxation from people who are prepared to invest money and make the State progress. I have in mind the case of a man who built in Macquarie street, Sydney, 64 residential flats. He is not taxed according to the amount he invested or the labour he employed. He pays no more than the man who possesses next door an ordinary three-story building. That system of taxation accounts for the fact that the citizens of New South Wales do not adopt the cadging attitude which is typical of the Tasmanians. They pay their way. Taxation is removed from industry, and people who invest their money are not penalized. I cannot understand any man saying that this idea is dead and buried. </para>

            <para>- It is regarded as the most scientific method of taxation in the Commonwealth. I do not agree with it. The most scientific and up to date, and the fairest system of taxation is the local rating system, which is to-day enjoyed by the citizens of Sydney. A ratepayer has no difficulty in computing the amount that he has to' pay. There is no corruption, and no evasion. Payment is made in proportion to the value of the land which you own, whether you are a widow, a returned soldier, or any other type of individual. That system could be adopted with immense advantage by the Commonwealth. We merely tax foreign-made goods. </para>

Holman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Watson, and others, who for one reason or another are not now associated with the Labour party. In the language of Shakespeare, " The evil that men do lives after them." The evil which was done at that conference continues to live after those whose names I have mentioned have ceased to belong to the Labour party. Doubtless some fine day an alteration will be made. There is not a £5,000 exemption under the system which is adopted by Queensland and the Sydney municipalities. </para>

        <para class="block">We were told this evening that 11,000,000 acres of vacant land in England is suitable for cultivation, and yet the extraordinary statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> that the British Government, which is now paying about £60,000,000 per annum in unemployment doles, should be asked to finance a number of English boys to grow trees in Tasmania. I hope that the British authorities will not be beguiled by proposals of that nature. What is wrong with England that she does not settle her boys in their own country? Great Britain, for its size, is probably as wealthy as any part of the world. </para>

            <para>- Great Britain never was and never will be a freetrade country. A revenue tariff is collected on tea, sugar, tobacco, and practically everything that is good to eat or drink. I have endeavoured to ascertain from various sources how much rent is paid per annum by the people of Great Britain to the blue blooded landlords for the right to live in the country which they call their own. Some time ago I addressed a letter upon this subject to a gentleman residing in London, who is adjudged to be well informed on the matter, and I received the following reply -  43 Barton Court, </para>

        <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline></para>
        <para>Thank you for your letter of the 21st May, which has been sent on to rae. Unfortunately, however, there are no available statistics as to the rents paid in Great Britain in respect of capital land value, as distinguished from improvements. So far as I am aware, the latest information bearing on the subject is that collected and set out in Note Q, " Probable Land Value of Great Britain," in my book " Land Value Policy" (1924), of which note I have pleasure in enclosing a copy. I am also sending for your acceptance, under another cover, a copy of a new book of mine just published, " Our Land and How to Make it So." </para>
        <para>I am, yours faithfully, (Sgd.)J.  Dundas Whits. </para>
        <para class="block">It would appear, from the book referred to that the total unimproved value of the land in Great Britain is approximately £3,000,000,000, but the owners of that wealth contributed to the national revenue last year only about £2,000,000, as against £900,000,000 collected from the people by means of Customs taxation, income tax, and other taxes on industry. Yet honorable senators like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> coll England a freetrade country! We are frequently assured that Australia has adopted a protectionist policy; but I again remind honorable senators that the real object of our fiscal system is to produce revenue. According to the Estimates for next year the Treasurer expects to raise by means of our so-called protectionist policy the sum of £40,500,000. Does not that convince every honest protectionist that, so long as that enormous revenue is received, the hated foreign goods manufactured in low-wage countries will still 'be allowed to enter Australia ? The Government expects to derive from the land tax £200,000; from the income tax, £6,450,000; from estate duties, £50,000; and from the entertainments tax, £50,000; a total, with the Customs revenue, of £47,250,000. A number of other items of revenue bring the grand total to £51,382,000. Nobody would resent a protective tariff that would exclude foreign goods more than the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten).</inline></para>
        <para>I have taken a keen interest in the establishment of the Seat of Government at Canberra, and for a number of years I have seized every opportunity to encourage those who desire to make their homes or engage in business there. The Government did not make building allotments available at Canberra until  public  opinion in favour of the adoption of that course could no longer be resisted. Then a few allotments were offered to the public on the leasehold system to the highest bidder, with re-appraisements at the end of the first 20 years, and every 10 years thereafter. That system leads to speculation in land, which was never contemplated in . connexion with Canberra. I have it, on unimpeachable authority, that land which, in 1924, was obtained for a few pounds by persons who had no intention of building on it, has since been disposed of at a premium of £1,100. In some cases, I understand that a premium of £1,500 has been asked to secure blocks. The demand for land at Canberra is so keen that persons who desire to build there are willing to pay enormous sums to obtain it. It is my intention to move  for  the appointment of a select committee to inquire  into,  and report on, this matter. The regulations ought to be altered to allow for more frequent re-appraisements. So long as the present regulations remain in operation, speculation in land at Canberra will continue. In fairness to the progress of Canberra, the existing state of things should not longer be allowed. The commissioners, no doubt acting under instructions from the Government, refuse to to make other blocks available, so that persons who desire to build at Canberra are compelled to pay large sums if they wish to secure land there. The commissioners and all concerned, should be placed beyond' suspicion. The commissioners should be instructed to make land available wherever required, provided that the lessees pay at auction the annual upset rental. By adhering to its policy of having re-appraisements made every 20 years, the Government has made land speculation at Canberra possible. The only way to prevent further land speculation there, is by having more frequent re-appraisements. The profits would then go to the commission. Wo are told that Canberra is now a sink into which millions of money has been, and will still be, poured. That could be stopped if land were made available for persons who desire to build there. </para>
        <para>I desire to refer to the infamous proposal of the Government to impose a tax on petrol. In this connexion, I am at a loss to find language in which to express myself adequately. It is characteristic of this Government that on every possible occasion it penalizes industry. If a man earns a fair income, the Government pounces upon it in the form of an income tax; if he dies and leaves a widow, his estate is taxed. This petrol tax is a new abomination. At one time in New South Wales, drivers of vehicles had to pay a toll for the privilege of travelling along the roads. </para>

            <para>- Unfortunately, that is so. The result is that the land-owners at Manly have had the value of their property increased by £1 a foot. The toll imposed on motorists who cross the bridge at the Spit is an unfair tax upon them. I am glad that the same system is not to be adopted in connexion with the Sydney Harbour bridge. I cannot imagine how any Government can have the effrontery to impose a tax upon petrol. Already the motorists of Australia are being penalized in many ways. It would appear that everything possible is being done to prevent the use of motor vehicles in this country. I have no objection to a. nominal licence-fee being charged to ensure that drivers of motor vehicles shall be competent, or to a small registration fee being imposed on motor cars; but I do object to motorists being called upon to pay a tax in proportion to the number of miles travelled. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>
