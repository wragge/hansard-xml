            <para>- The Government has considered this proposal, but, as it pointed out in a letter which was sent to both the employers&#39; and the employees&#39; organizations, it desires to have a wellbalanced delegation representative as far as possible of the main groups of industry, and unless there is a co-ordination of nomination by some central authority, that object probably could not, or would not, be attained. For instance, if six, or even four, different authorities made selections, they might, in the case of the employers&#39; representatives, confine the selection to the iron trade, for example, disregarding the textile industry, the timber industry, or any other industry. Similarly with the trade union delegates, one industry might supply all the representatives. The object which the Government has in view, I repeat, is to obtain a balanced delegation representative as widely as possible of Australian industry. </para>

The whole of the joinery work - with the exception of some doors to press rooms, and several sashes on the lower floor of the kitchen block - and all the flooring, except for a small quantity of Baltic pine used in the press rooms, have been executed in Australian timbers. Oregon has been used in the floor joists of the main floor, upper floor, and flat room, and in the construction of main trusses over the chambers.

If so, does he concur in that arrangement? If he does not, will he take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the use of the roofing material which is manufactured at Canberra? </para>

          <para class="block">In  reply  to yourpersonal letter dated the  6th  instant regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott,</inline> his business block, and his  tiles,  it is a fact that the  Commission  has specified  Roman  tiles for the two  Civic  Centre blocks.  The  reason for this  is that the  style  of architecture  is  what  is  commonly  known  in  architectural circles as  Florentine, and  we  should be committing a distinct  architectural offence if we  specified Marseilles  tiles. </para>

          <para>It is  a  matter  of  absolute certainty  that  had we insisted upon Marseilles tiles for this type of architecture, we should have been the laughing-stock  of  the architectural &#34; world &#34; of Australia. .... </para>

It is  also  interesting  to  note  that we are  at  this  moment  making  inquiries  into the  question  of importing our  tiles  from  Melbourne  instead of from,  Sydney, until  such time as we take up the running ourselves again.  The cost  of tiles  in Sydney is roughly. &#163;10  per  1,000  more than in  Melbourne,  owing to the operations of the officially  non-existent  tile ring.I give  below  figures which show the relative cost of Roman and  Marseilles  tiles, and the effect which  it  has on the cost. </para>

The publicity in respect of dried and canned fruits began in July last, and propaganda on behalf of Australian dairy produce will commence in October next.

            <para>. -  It appears to me that the Senate has been unfairly treated in this matter. Copies of the agenda paper were submitted to honorable senators only last evening, and we have not had sufficient time to consider the subjects to be dis cussed at the Imperial Conference. It is unreasonable to expect the Senate to discuss, at almost a moment&#39;s notice, the important issues to be dealt with at the conference. </para>

            <para>. - I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> whether it is his intention to endeavour to dispose of the Appropriation Bill to-night, and also to pass certain other measures which, I understand, are still to come from another place. I think this is about the fifth occasion on which we have assembled to-day in anticipation of the receipt from another place of the Appropriation Bill. I do not think it right that this branch of the legislature should be asked to make such an unseemly rush as is evidently proposed, and be expected to dispose of the bill between now and perhaps 3 o&#39;clock to-morrow morning, without having the opportunity to give it proper consideration. It is unreasonable to ask the Senate to pass the bill to-night. If we made reasonable progress, we could adjourn at about the usual hour, and thus allow honorable senators to reach their homes. It was at first expected that the present sittings would terminate some time to-day, and that members of both Houses would be able to leave for their respective States this afternoon. As that is now impossible, perhaps the right honorable gentleman will display a little reason, and arrange for the Senate to meet at 10 o&#39;clock to-morrow morning. All the business could then be disposed of in time to allow members to catch their trams. Honorable senators on this side of the Chamber will assist the Government to transact all the business that it has to bring before Parliament during the present sittings. With all due respect to honorable members of another place, I think they are prone to forget that there is a Senate. Once they have disposed of certain measures they believe that that is the end, and that we are their slavish followers. </para>

          <para>Last year Parliament passed a measure providing for the payment of &#163;450,000 for the year ended the 30th June, 1926, on the recommendation of the Western Australian Disabilities Commission; but I understand no provision has been made for a further payment. I ask the Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to make any further provision in that regard. The Minister will remember that when opening the electioneering campaign in Western Australia, last year, he said that the grant would be for the current year, and that the matter would then be referred to a conference of State Treasurers. I do not think the Government has mentioned the convening of such a conference to determine whether the grant shall be continued. I need not stress the point, because the commission, in its report, mentioned the many disabilities which. Western Australia is experiencing. Today I have received the following telegram from the Premier of Western Australia : - </para>

            <para>. - I may point out for the information of the Leader of the Opposition {Senator Needham), and other honorable senators, that in order to give this chamber an equal opportunity with another place to discuss the budget proposals, it has been the practice for many years, to submit a motion - &#34; That the Estimates and budget-papers be printed,&#34; and honorable senators have been specially invited to discuss the whole of the budget proposals on that motion. It is the invariable practice in this legislature, as in all Parliaments, not to dispose of the Appropriation Bill until the end of the session is approaching. The procedure we have adopted, however, gives this Chamber a full opportunity to discuss the budget proposals,.&#39; and, on this occasion, that opportunity has been availed of to a greater extent, I believe, than by another place. There has been a full and exhaustive discussion of the budget proposals in the Senate. I am glad there has been, and I trust honorable senators will always avail themselves of the opportunity thus afforded them. &#34; The main principles of the budget, having been debated, honorable senators now have an opportunity to discuss the departmental Estimates in detail, which cannot be done at any other time. The Leader of the . Opposition knows, as I do, that practically all members resident in distant States have made arrangements to leave Melbourne tomorrow. </para>

              <para>- Serious inconvenience would result if the business were so long delayed that they would have to cancel their arrangements. That would be of little consequence to members resident in Victoria, but those living in other States would be seriously inconvenienced. In justice to these members the business in this Chamber must be so arranged that honorable senators will have a full opportunity - and after all it is in their interests^ - to discuss the bill in detail. That can only be done by proceeding with the measure to-night.

          <para class="block">Honorable senators, particularly those from Queensland, who are interested in the payment of a cotton bounty, and other honorable senators who are interested in the bounty on cotton yarn, must be afforded an opportunity to express their views on those proposals. I sympathize with the Leader oi  the  Opposition, because I do not wish to be here all night. I loathe all-night sittings, and nothing will persuade me&#39; to take them as a form of recreation. Later we shall be able to see what progress has been made. It may be possible to adjourn at a reasonable hour and meet again tomorrow, but it would not be wise to adopt such a course before the Appropriation Bill had been disposed of. Whilst I should like  to  meet the wishes of honorable senators, and also meet my own convenience, it would not be safe to delay the discussion of this measure until tomorrow. </para>
          <para>Coming now to the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> as to special grants to Western Australia and Tasmania, may I say in reply first of all to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> that provision will be made for those grants in another bill. As a matter of fact they are contained in a special appropriation bill, which has come before another place and is now on its business-paper. They are not contained in this measure, because they are not appropriated by it. The Government has already announced that it has no desire to proceed with the proposals contained in the States Grants Bill at this stage of the session,, but that will be the first business to be taken when Parliament reassembles early in the coming year. Honorable senators are aware that the general discussion on the budget has not disclosed any opposition to these special grants. </para>

              <para>- I think that they will. It appears to me that these grants are likely to meet with general acceptance. No inconvenience will be caused to the States. Last year, this Government budgeted for a special appropriation for the State of Western Australia. I think it amounted to &#163;450,000, including approximately &#163;80,000 of the existing grant. That money was made available to Western Australia before the close of the  financial year, which ended on the 30th June last. Not only has it not been spent, but the Government of &#34;Western Australia has not yet announced the directions in which it proposes that it shall Be spent. </para>

              <para>- I have not made the slightest suggestion of that sort. What I say is that when this Parliament reassembles in the early part of next year, and deals with these special grants, there will be ample time for the Treasurers of Western Australia and Tasmania to make their arrangements. In support of that, I mentioned the fact that last year&#39;s special grant to Western Australia had been in the hands of that Government for some months, and had not yet been allocated. The  Treasurers of both the States and the Commonwealth frame their financial proposals in the early part of every financial year, but a great deal of the money is not spent until the end of the year. The Parliament is committed to the expenditure in the expectation that the estimated revenue will be received. I do not doubt that the Treasurers of Tasmania and Western Australia have framed their budgets in the expectation that they will receive these amounts. They are justified in doing to. It may be that they will not receive them until after the first half of the financial year has expired, but that is the experience with a great deal of their revenue. Although a Treasurer budgets for a whole year&#39;s receipts from income tax and makes preparations for expenditure on that basis, those moneys are not received until towards the close of the financial year. Tasmania and Western Australia, therefore, will not be in any worse position in regard to these grants than they are in regard to income tax and other revenue. I can merely refer honorable senators to the speech of the Treasurer when he introduced his budget. He then committed the Government to these payments, and made it clear that Parliament would be asked to authorize them. He also stated later on, in announcing that it had been decided to defer consideration of the proposals contained in the States Grants Bill, that they would be proceeded with when Parliament reassembled in the early part of the next calendar year. </para>

            <para>. - Last year I referred to the salaries that are being paid to officers of both branches of the legislature. I then ventured the opinion, as I do now, that those salaries are not commensurate with the work performed. The rapid rate at which the cost of living has advanced, and the slow rate at which the salaries of our officers have been raised, give them a legitimate claim for a revision of their remuneration. Last year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> who was then  President  of the Senate, contended that they were well paid. I do not think that they are. Officers in the higher grades in the Parliament are being given increases, and it is time that men who are on the lower rung of the ladder were considered. I want it to be clearly understood that I am not objecting to the increases that are proposed in regard to the  President  of the Senate and the  Chairman  of Committees. I cannot, from memory* say what is the salary of each officer of the Chamber, but I know that it is not commensurate with the increased cost of living. That cannot be denied. I suggest to the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives that if Supplementary Estimates are to be introduced, they should give consideration to this matter. My experience in this Parliament extends over a number of years. Not one of the men whose claims I am advocating has approached me in this matter. &#39; Fifteen months ago the then  President  of the Senate suggested that provision would be made for these men on this year&#39;s Estimates. That has not been done. Now is the time, and this is the place, to raise the question. The increases that these officers have received over a period of years have not been sufficient to enable them to keep pace with the. rise in the cost of living. Last year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> told me that Parliament could not take on the duties of an arbitration court. I admit that that is correct. But these men have not the opportunity posessed by those outside parliamentary employ to present their case to the Arbitration Court. I understand that they do not even have the opportunity of approaching the Public Service Arbitrator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt. Apart from coming under the  President  and the  Speaker,  they are in a &#34; No Man&#39;s Land.&#34; The determination of the  President  &#34; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> is evidently final; from their decision there is no appeal. I do not know that it is necessary to bring these officers under the provisions of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act, or the tribunal over which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt presides. I suggest that the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> confer, and consider whether they can grant an increase to these men. Having regard to the salaries now paid, and their length of service, I think that the  President,  in his wisdom and goodness of heart, will recognize the justice of their claim. </para>

            <para>. - It is true, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that this matter was brought under the notice of a committee of the Senate not long ago, and at that time attention was called by more than one honorable senator to what was considered the inadequate remuneration of the officers of this Chamber. They are very attentive and obliging to honorable senators; they understand their work thoroughly; and they do it to the complete satisfaction of honorable senators and their superior officers. My sympathy always goes out to those on the breadandbutter line, and the officers to whom I refer come within that category. They have not approached me in the matter. I ask honorable senators, who are better placed in life than some of them, how they would like to be put on the bread line. Some of these men are receiving about &#163;250 per annum; and, while &#163;5 a week may seem, on paper, to be a fair wage, one has to remember that its present purchasing power is equal only to &#39; that of &#163;3 a few years ago. </para>

              <para>- It is very different from the dividends drawn from the woollen mills which the honorable senator purchased so cheaply; but I am dealing with officers of this Parliament. Out of that &#163;5 a week, rent has to be paid. Many thousands of working men do hot own the houses in which they live. There is a shortage of dwellings, and in some areas it is almost impossible to obtain a good house at a reasonable rental. For an ordinary five-roomed weatherboard cottage, rents of from 30s. to 35s. a week, are demanded. If we subtract 30s. from &#163;5, and allow for train and tram fares, how much is left to provide food and clothing for a wife and family? </para>

              <para>- Exactly. The working man is advised to make provision for a rainy day, but he cannot provide for the future from a low wage such as that received by these officers. The matter having been again ventilated, I hope that a substantial increase will be made commensurate with the work performed and the responsibilities which devolve upon these officers. No doubt we all sympathize with them, but it has  been well said that sympathy without relief is like mustard without beef. These men ask not only for sympathy, but also for justice. </para>

            <para>- I hope that the  President  will give consideration to the remarks of Senators Needham and Findley, and will take the matter up with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to see if anything can be done to improve the salaries of these officers. I propose to refer to another branch of the Parliamentary staff, whose position has not been mentioned, and who, I think, are deserving of every consideration at the hands of members of both Houses of Parliament, because of the. value of the work they do and its onerous nature. I have in mind the Parliamentary reporting staff. I gather from inquiries I have made, and from a comparison of the present Estimates with those of past years, that although substantial increases have been granted to officers in the higher branches of various other departments in order to meet the changing conditions of the times and the growing importance of the work that is being done, no increases have been made for a considerable time in the salaries of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. The amounts set down for them on the Estimates appear, at first sight, to be fairly adequate; but we ought to consider their work from a relative point of view. These men are  highly  trained, and are the pick of their profession in Australia. The work they do is not always pleasant, and at times, is extremely difficult. The great satisfaction that they give to honorable senators must be  gratifving  to them, and, often, I am afraid, their reports are highly flattering to us. I rarely have to do anything in the way of correcting the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs of my speeches. Indeed, I have been amazed, at times, to discover how good my speeches have been. . </para>

              <para>- Yes. We should give them every consideration when increases in salaries are being made. Since increases have been given elsewhere, why have not the claims of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff also been considered? I commend their case to the consideration of the  President,  because I know that he is anxious at all times to do the right thing. I hope that he will give the matter his earnest attention with a view to having the anomaly rectified. </para>

            <para>. - I rise to support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> My experience during the three years that I have been a member of- this Senate is that all the attendants are thoroughly capable. The small pittance paid to them is inadequate for the work they perform. One of them, with 26 years&#39; service, receives only &#163;5 17s. 6d. a week, out of which he has to pay rent, contribute to the Superannuation Fund, and keep a large family. The weekly salary of &#163;3 10s. which was paid in 1910 was worth more than, the salary of &#163;5 17s. 6d. a week now paid, seeing that the purchasing power of the &#163;1 to-day, as compared with that of 1910, is only 9s. 3d. I hope that the new  President,  in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> will do something to increase the remuneration paid to these men. - I have no objection to the higher paid officers receiving substantial increases, but I submit that the men on small salaries should not be overlooked. I agree with the remarks .of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> as to the excellent service- rendered by the parliamentary reporting &#39; staff. In my opinion, the officers of this Parliament are second to none in the Commonwealth. I trust that the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will give favorable consideration to their claims. . </para>

              <para>- Important as is the question of the salaries paid to the members of the staff, I, as the newly elected  President  of the Senate, have had to devote much of my time to many other matters of great importance in the satisfactory discharge of the business of the Senate. The salaries paid to the staff have, however, not- been overlooked. They have been discussed by Mr;  Speaker  and myself on many occasions. I have also discussed them with the principal officers of the Senate, and with honorable senators as well as honorable members of the House of Representatives who have made to me representations on behalf of the staff. In a very short time the Parliament will be transferred to Canberra, and every one recognizes that very considerable alterations in the salaries of the staff will then have to be made. That, probably, is one reason why but few increases were granted this year. In some directions, increases, by way of extra allowances, have be&#60;&#62;n made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> suggested that the staff should be brought within the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitration Court. </para>

            <para>-  Then I misunderstood . the honorable senator. If, however, the suggestion were made that the officers of Parliament should be placed under the control of the Public Service Board, and the Public Service Arbitration Court, .1 should strenuously oppose it, since I believe that Parliament should control the salaries of all those employed on the parliamentary staff. Some of the lower paid men are . not so well remunerated as I should like them to be; but it is well that honorable senators should know that generally the messengers and other attendants in this building are paid higher salaries than are the messengers in other public departments So anxious have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and I been to see that they are paid at least as well as men occupying similar positions outside, that we have instituted inquiries, and have ascertained that the messengers here are paid considerably higher salaries than are messengers in some of the departments. For instance, messengers in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department receive &#163;266 per annum; in the Treasury, &#163;270 per annum ; Attorney-General&#39;s Department, &#163;276 per annum; Defence Department, &#163;317 per annum; Trade and Customs Department, &#163;275; and Works and Railways Department, &#163;276 per annum. Parliamentary messengers receive &#163;324, &#163;299, &#163;283, and &#163;253 per annum. The lowest salary, paid to any messenger in this building is &#163;253 per annum. Honorable senators may be interested to know that since 1915-16 the percentage of salary increase has been 26.8, 38.4, 4.1.5, and 50.6 in the case of individual officers. During that period increases as high as 80 per cent, have been granted to some officers. </para>

              <para>- In those days the salaries of parliamentary officers were not under my control. When representations are made by honorable senators that the messengers and attendants of the Senate are poorly paid, I feel it my duty to mention these figures to show that my predecessors have not been unmindful of their position. Under the classification of the Public Service Board messengers in the Works and Railways Department receive &#163;252 per annum, with annual increments of &#163;8 until &#163;284 is reached. I shall not mention individual officers by name, as I do not like making public the salaries paid to them. </para>

              <para>- I disagree with the honorable senator. This year two officers have received increments of &#163;24. In order to bring their salaries up to the maximum, two other officers have each received a &#163;9 increment. A complaint has been made by the engineer that his salary is .not sufficient. It is difficult to find an exactly parallel case, because the many duties which the two engineers in this building are called upon to perform do not fall to the lot of engineers in other departments. They have to attend to the lifts, bells, lighting, and the heating and ventilating systems, and must be capable and qualified men. We are fortunate in having such men. In the chief engineer&#39;s branch of the Works and Railways Department civil engineers are paid &#163;430 per annum, mechanical engineers &#163;418, and electrical engineers &#163;424 per annum. The engineer in this building receives &#163;410 per annum. It, therefore, cannot be said that the staff of Parliament is underpaid when their salaries are compared with those of men performing similar work outside. Mr.Speaker and I, however, are still giving this matter consideration. I can assure the committee that I am anxious to- do everything in reason to place the staffs of the House on a proper footing. Before long an entirely new classification of the salaries of all the officers of Parliament will have to be made in connexion with the transfer to Canberra. I ask honorable senators to accept my assurance that I am anxious that all employed in this building shall receive good salaries, and that whatever I can reasonably do to make them more satisfied - and I do not know that they are dissatisfied - -will be willingly done. I have at all times found the members of the parliamentary staff to be attentive, careful, and reliable officers. I shall look into the matter, and- 1 have no doubt that when the Estimates for next year are under review substantial increases will be provided. I include, of course, members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff in my general commendation of the officers connected with the Senate. &#39; Those gentlemen do excellent work&#39;. Up to the present, I have not considered their claims for increases in salary. For the last two months I have been more concerned with the position of the lower-paid officials ; but I can assure honorable senators that members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff will receive the same consideration as other officers of the Parliament. </para>

I want to make it possible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to provide increases for those officers who deserve increases before Parliament is transferred to Canberra. Unless action is taken now it will be at least fourteen months before the promised re-organization scheme can be completed, and I submit that it is the duty of the committee now to instruct the presiding officer to give this matter earlier consideration. It is possible that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> misunderstood my references to the officers of this House in relation to the industrial court, presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt. What I did say was  that under present conditions they have no appeal to any industrial court in Australia, not even to the court over which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt presides under the provisions of the Public Service Arbitration Act. I also stated that I did not wish this Parliament to become an industrial or arbitration court. No blame attaches to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> for the present condition of affairs, but I think that the committee should support him in his desire to assist the employees of Parliament in the direction indicated. </para>

            <para>. - I was very pleased at the nature of the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> I knew that he would be sympathetic towards the underpaid workers connected with this Parliament. When he was in the ranks of the workers, he was always in tho forefront of any industrial movement for the improvement of his own and his fellow workers&#39; conditions. I noticed that the four male office cleaners, including the service for <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> department, receives a salary each of only &#163;238 a year, so the minimum is not. as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> &#163;253, but &#163;238 a year. Their pay is not in keeping with the dignity of this Parliament. These men have wives and families. I am sure no honorable senator would like to be obliged to support a wife and family on a wage of &#163;238 a year. </para>

              <para>- Well, &#163;50 a year will not help very much in the bringing up of a large family. We should be prepared to pay a fair wage to all employees of the National Parliament. The minimum should be at least &#163;300 a year. The wages paid by this Parliament, to some of its employees, at all events, compare unfavorably with wages paid by State Parliaments. The Commonwealth Parliament should set an example to other parliaments. There is no occasion to be parsimonious. Last year we had a surplus of &#163;2,750,000. Why cannot some portion of it be devoted to an increase in the wages of our employees ? It would be impossible to find a better staff connected with any parliament in Australia than we have. Some of our employees are absolutely geniuses in their work. The attendants at the door, for example, have other duties than that of merely opening the door for honorable senators, or showing visitors into the galleries. They are experts in other matters. If an honorable senator is absent for any length of time, and desires to know what has transpired in his absence, the attendants are in a position to inform him. Or if they wish to be supplied with some informa- tion or certain papers, the attendant supplies them with the least possible delay. . I regret to know that some of the men who have been serving members in this Parliament for over twenty years, are receiving only  &#163;320 a year, with the prospect&#39; of rising to &#163;350 a year, if they remain here until they are about 70 years of age. That is not a very attractive outlook for men of their calibre. They have no union to look after their interests, so they have to dependupon their higher officers. I assume that whilst they are not satisfied they feel that, having spent so many years here, it is hardly worth while now to seek new avenues of employment. No man can keep a wife and family under Australian conditions on a salary of&#163;235 a year. Some of our lower paid employees have to pay 30s. a week for house rent, so there is very little left after they make the usual provision for the ordinary household expenses. They are always expected to be well dressed, and, when required, to be able to remain on duty during protracted sittings. A couple of years ago, they were on duty on one occasion for 37 hours continuously, and the following day had to face another period of duty extending over 31 hours. These unfortunate men, who do their work well, cannot obtain a little rest during a long sitting, as honorable senators can, and it is a standing disgrace to the national Parliament of Australia that they should be expected to work for &#163;235 a year. Instead of wasting &#163;100,000 in meeting the cost of the referendum to be taken this month, the Government should increase the salaries of the lowerpaid parliamentary officers, who render such good service. I feel sure that, in some cases, their wages are so low that they are unable to provide fires in their homes in the winter. It is a disgrace to the Parliament, and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will see that, in future, every man working in this building does not receive less than &#163;300 a year. </para>

I remind honor able senators that there are no Senate officials receiving, as mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh,</inline> only &#163;235 a year. Those receiving that salary do not work, as he suggests, for 30 or 40 hours at a time in attending to the requirements of honorable senators, but are employed as cleaners, and work comparatively short hours. I do not say for a moment that they are receiving too much, but I do not wish the position to be misrepresented.

        <para>No Further Business Sites This Year</para>
        <para>Canberra, Sunday. - Regarding the statement in the Senate by the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator .Sir William Glasgow)</inline> that he intended to submit additional businesssite leases for sale at an early date, it is stated by the Lands Department of the Federal Capital Commission that no sale will be held for about six months, and that no further business sites will be sold this year. Building has yet to be begun on the 46 business sites at the civic centre, and materials are on 28 blocks ready for a beginning, while preparations on other sites are proceeding. Some purchasers of leases at the first sale in December, 1924, and in May, 1925, are reported to have resold at a profit, while many other leaseholders are retaining their leases to carry out their original intentions of building and settling in Canberra. They have refused tempting premiums offered by people who cams in too late. In connexion with a statement that leaseholders were demanding premiums now, it may be recalled that at the first sale, in 1924, many leases were, not sold, but, in every instance, the Commission has since disposed of these at higher prices than the upset value on the day of sale. </para>
        <para class="block">The excuse for declining to offer further business sites was that there was no demand for them. It would appear that when the Minister supplies certain information the commission tells him point blank that he is a liar. </para>

It was, nevertheless, suggested that my statements were wild and reckless, and, in refutation of them, it was said that tenders had been received for the erection of business premises in the civic centre, one to cost &#163;2,161, and two adjoining shops &#163;3,297, or about &#163;1,650 each. I have had considerable experience in connexion with building costs in this city, and can say that it would be impossible to erect in Melbourne on a 20-ft. frontage, two-story shops at the price mentioned. I immediately made further inquiry from the same firm of architects, which is the only firm actively engaged in supervising building construction at Canberra. It transpires that those figures are absolutely false. The tenders were for the erection of buildings, the bricks being provided by the owner. That is a horse of quite another colour. </para>

              <para>- The architect&#39;s estimate is that, in respect to the first building; an additional &#163;120 will have to be paid for the bricks delivered on the ground, and in respect to1 the second there will be an addition of &#163;300. Further, these tenders are for only the bare walls. In order that the Minister may be quite sure that I am not making wild and reckless statements, I shall give him the names. The first was to be erected for Woodyers and Calthorpe, auctioneers, and the second for the  architects themselves and a <inline font-weight="bold">Major Prisk,</inline> they having entered into a joint contract so as to cheapen the cost. I immediately asked the architects to explain the discrepancy between their estimate to me and that which they had obtained for their own offices. They said, &#34; The conditions under which leases are granted are exceedingly vague. It would be quite open to the commission to demand that the whole depth of the block should be covered with buildings. Most of the building leases in Melbourne contemplate a building on the full depth of the ground. We submitted an estimate based on the maximum demand that the commission could make, but in our own case it was &#39; a try-on &#39; to see whether we could build on the smallest possible space.&#34; They therefore prepared a plan, showing what is called a Florentine facade -with Roman tiles on the front, the building going back to a depth of 30 feet only. Where they are going to put the stairs leading to the second floor, 1 do not know. Possibly they were not shown on the plan which was submitted. I cannot say whether the criticism in this House and elsewhere brought the position forcibly home to the commission; but I suggest that it had some effect in that direction, and -made it realize the utter impossibility of expecting people to erect buildings over the whole depth. It is manifestly unfair for the commissioners to suppress material facts of that kind in their communications to the Minister, and&#39; I make an emphatic protest against it. Apparently the position now is that, so long as you have a magnificent facade, you can put anything you like behind it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> aptly describes it when he says that if that system is to be adopted, the civic centre of the capital will present the appearance of a man wearing a bell-topper and having the seat out of his trousers. The mention of Marseilles tiles seems to have thrown the Chief Commissioner into a state of profuse perspiration; yet he allowed an enterprising builder to get past him. Honorable senators may have heard of villas that are Queen Anne in front and Mary Ann behind. These buildings will apparently surpass those in violent contrasts as between front and rear views. I appeal to the Minister to obtain a grip of his department as he did of his troops on the field of battle, and, as a member of the Cabinet, to live up to the reputation that he made as a soldier over there. This is not a mere slip on the part of the  Chairman  of the Commission; it has become a habit with him. Recently the Public Works Committee investigated the construction of Canberra cottages. lt has presented a report, on page 7 of which appears the following statement: - </para>

            <para>The  chairman,  Federal Capital Commission, in giving evidence, stated that the cost of buildings at Canberra offered to public servants -was not unduly high. He intimated that, in an endeavour to obtain information as to the relative building costs in Melbourne as compared with Canberra, tenders were called in Melbourne for type 0 of the Canberra houses, which the commission is having  erected for &#163;1,300. It was stated that the lowest tender received in Melbourne for that house, upon exactly the same specifications and plans, was &#163;1,525 10s. </para>

            <para>. - -  It is a pity that the exhaustion of his time prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> from completing the very serious case which he was making out against the Federal Capital Commission. If his charges are true - and it would appear  that  they are, because he has  apparently  substantiated e.very one - the position is indeed a serious one. When this matter was debated some little time ago I attacked the honorable senator because of certain statements that he made regarding Canberra. In view of the further facts that he has placed before us, I tender him an apology. I now believe that he is right in what he has said. In justice to himself, to his department, and to, this Parliament, the Minister must thoroughly investigate the matters that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> has brought to his notice. If the honorable senator is correct, the officers of the commission at Canberra either deliberately misled the Minister and the Government or did not know how stupid were- the replies which they sent to questions that were asked in this Chamber. Somebody is to blame, and that blame will have to be sheeted home. Members of Parliament must not be misled by the replies that are given to serious questions which are asked for the purpose of obtaining information for the benefit of the public. I shall await, with interest, the further remarks that <inline font-weight="bold">.&#39;Senator Elliott</inline> has to make upon this matter. </para>

            <para>,-- I am prepared to lay before the Minister contracts which prove that heavy premiums have been demanded and paid for leases at Canberra. I do not object to the demanding of a premium by those who first obtained the leases, but I am entirely opposed to that being done at, so to speak, the point of the pistol, when &#34; one has either to accede to the demand or wait probably six months before an opportunity is afforded to secure a lease. Lands are lying idle which, on the commission&#39;s own showing, could be returning revenue. The commission has laid itself open to the implication that it is profiting by this practice. For the sake of its own reputation it ought to see that that state of affairs is altered at the earliest possible moment. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in a previous debate, said that isolated buildings could not be allowed to spring up. But there is no need for that. In the same area as the land offered at the last sale, there are vacant blocks lying idle, and they cannot be bought at any price. They are not for sale. The  area is not large, and a few of those allotments could be offered in order to test the market. It has been said that the land is sold in competition. At the first sale it was offered at about &#163;4,000 per acre, and nobody had a chance to obtain it at a cheaper rate than the upset price. At both sales very few blocks were sold at above the upset prices, although I admit that, in rare instances, at the second sale, at any rate, those prices were exceeded to an extraordinary degree. It has been contended that, if unlimited sales were permitted, the whole area would soon be taken up by speculators, but that is unlikely; the building conditions would soon compel them to part with their leases at a fair price. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butters</inline> stated in his evidence before the committee - </para>

          <para>I shall now deal with a matter that I consider much more serious. I propose to refer to a subject that I mentioned more or less incidentally last night, but which was given considerable publicity in the press to-day. I draw the attention of honorable senators to the conclusions of the royal commission on the affairs of Norfolk Island. I previously stated that the commission had been appointed under conditions that appeared to me to render its proceedings absolutely illegal. The Royal Commissions Act 1902-12 does not apply beyond the borders of Australia, and therefore it cannot extend to Norfolk Island. I have not personally looked into the legal aspect of this matter, but I am prepared to accept the opinion of the acting-secretary of the Commonwealth Attorney-General&#39;s Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> S. Knowles, who sent the following letter to the secretary to the Home and Territories Department: - </para>

            <para>The Administrator has not the right of cross-examining witnesses appearing before the Royal Commission. The commission may conduct its inquiry in whatever way it thinks fit, and the Administrator can only put questions to witnesses if the Commission requests or permits him to do so. </para>

The charges made against the administrator were extraordinary in character, and he was not permitted to call witnesses to refute those charges, or cross-examine the witnesses called on behalf of his opponents. The whole inquiry was conducted in such an irregular way that a gentleman from Tasmania, a justice of the peace, who observed what was going on, summed up the whole proceedings in these words - </para>

I do not know why the gentleman who made the inquiry was selected for the purpose. He has had no legal training, and he had never previously acted in a judicial capacity.

            <para>.- I am surprised to hear the comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Elliott.</inline> I have no doubt he has good grounds for his statement regarding the inquiry held by the Royal Commissioner. I can understand the difficulty that the Government experiences in administering such outlying portions of the Commonwealth as Norfolk Island, and I also appreciate the difficulties lhat face an administrator when brought into conflict with the -residents in making attempts to improve local conditions. I understand that . evidence could have been tendered at the inquiry by a reliable person, the vicar of the island, who has been a resident of Norfolk Island for many years, but that the commissioner, although requested to call him as a witness, did not do so. Honorable senators generally will admit that members of the clergy can be relied upon to state the facts as they know them. The &#39; vicar ought to have been eminently qualified to give evidence, for or against, any officer charged with maladministration. I have not visited Norfolk Island, but I have been interested in its production. Those who know the island&#39;s wonderful fertility must have been appalled at its small production for many years. For the year ended 30th June, 1924, the exports from the island were valued at &#163;3,100; in the following year they were valued at &#163;3,900 ; last year they represented &#163;6,156. It is estimated that the exports from the island this year will .be worth approximately &#163;10,000. Those figures indicate that the Administrator made seme effort to increase the trade of the island, and to instil into the minds of the inhabitants the value of greater industry. As in a place like Norfolk Island there is a tendency for the people to stagnate, it is possible that the attempts of the Administrator to increase the production of the island caused some resentment. In this connexion I speak with some experience, because I have paid two visits to the Mandated Territories. In Norfolk Island there are no full-blooded natives, tha majority of the people being half-castes, but they have not lost the indolent habits of the Pacific island natives. We do not desire to- make slaves of them, but it is to their own physical, moral and commercial advantage that they should do their best towards the development ot their country. I do not say that an injustice has been done to the Administrator, but from a. brief reading of the report it would appear that that is the case. If so, the sooner it is righted the better. I hold no brief for the Administrator, and I entertain no antipathy towards the royal commissioner. My only concern is that justice shall be done. I trust that a further inquiry will be made and that, should any wrong have been done to any person, it will be righted without delay </para>

            <para>*- I appeal to the Minister to disregard entirely the report of the royal commissioner, and to appoint a gentleman of standing, like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Arthur</inline> Robinson, who recently inquired into affairs at Nauru, and is accustomed to . weigh evidence and to form judgments, to make a proper investigation into the administration of Norfolk Island. There is ample evidence that the Administrator did all in his power to increase the production of the  island. I understand that, for the first time in its history, a substantial shipment of bananas was shipped from Norfolk Island to New South Wales during his term as Administrator. That shipment was due entirely to the energy and enthusiasm of the Administrator, who introduced plants from other .places and was responsible for the planting of a large area with bananas. </para>

              <para>- About two years. I have already read to the Senate such of the commissioner&#39;s conclusions as are favorable to Colonel Leane. Let us now consider the conclusions against him. In doing so, we should have regard .to the manner in which the evidence was obtained. The commissioner in his report states - </para>

            <para>Tt is, however, most unfortunate that the temperament of the present Administrator is not in harmony with the social and general atmosphere of this isolated community. The evidence reveals that his tendency throughout has been to usurp the powers vested in him for the protection of the .people, and disregard the need of encouraging sympathetic understanding and co-operation. </para>

          <para class="block">I cannot understand that. If powers were invested in the Administrator by law, how could he usurp them ? They were his by right. The commissioner&#39;s statement is a contradiction of terms, showing that he does not even understand the English language, in its ordinary acceptance, let alone possess any legal or other qualifications for a royal commissioner. Moreover, the very success of  Colonel Leane  shows that the conclusion that he did not encourage a sympathetic understanding and co-operation is absolutely wrong. Unless he was able to work sympathetically with the people, and get their assistance, he could not have accomplished the work which, admittedly, he did accomplish during his term of office. Later in the report, we find - . </para>
          <para>Although in the earlier period of his regime he recognized the delicate position in which an Administrator is placed in hearing the differences of the islanders before they are seated in evidence before  him  by litigants, it is manifest that in the exercise of his judicial functions his conduct was distinctly combatant and quite inconsistent with the principles of justice. Apart from the strictly judicial duties of his office, it is regrettable that he acted upon uncorroborated statements derogatory to the inhabitants, statements which simple inquiry would have made clear to him were without bases in fact. </para>
          <para class="block">Colonel Leane was not responsible for that state of affairs. As Administrator he was also Crown Prosecutor, as well as Chief Justice on the island - a most extraordinary and unprecedented state of affairs, contrary to all ideas of British justice, from Magna Charta downwards. One complaint concerned an act of petty larceny. A basket was taken from some place in the vicinity of the Administrator&#39;s house. The Administrator directed the constable to take proceedings against the person on whom suspicion rested. Later, the Administrator had to hear the evidence and pronounce judgment, although in his investigation as Crown Prosecutor it is possible that he formed biased opinions, and believed the suspect to be guilty. He was thus, in . effect, in the position of being a judge in his own cause, which is contrary to one of the most important provisions of Magna Charta. </para>
          <para class="block">The Administrator protested against being placed in that position, and eventually a justice of the peace was ap pointed. In the meantime he was told by the Crown Law officers to carry on. Yet the commissioner condemned him for doing so. When the justice of the peace was appointed, a Gilbertian situation was created. In the letter informing the Administrator of the appointment of the justice of the peace, he was told that so long as the Administrator remained on the Island, the justice of the peace was forbidden to adjudicate in the court. It is difficult to understand why the justice of the peace was appointed. Again the  commissioner stated - </para>

          <para class="block">On arrival at Norfolk Island the Administrator came into conflict with persons who were breaking the ordinance prohibiting the sale of liquor to any person except in accordance with a doctor&#39;s certificate. The Administrator found that his chief executive officer had disregarded that ordinance, and that he not only consumed inordinate quantities of liquor himself, so that his office was really a bar, and he himself often under the influence of liquor, but also that in three months he issued permits for the release of no less than 1,500 bottles of whisky without any medical certificate. And this in addition to what the  people  were able to acquire under the guise of &#34; vinegar.&#34; Surely this thing is becoming a farce. Either the ordinance making the island nominally a prohibition area should be repealed or the officers who flout it in that manner should be brought to book. Colonel Leane, reading the ordinance strictly, brought the conduct of this officer under the notice of the Minister and recommended his dismissal. The department did not concur, and it was only after the most insistent representation that Colonel  Leaue  succeeded in getting his wishes in that respect carried out. Immediately the royal commissioner was appointed to investigate the affairs on the island, this superseded officer made a complaint , that he had been unjustly treated. His case is dealt with by the commissioner on page 50, the commissioner stating - </para>

              <para>- Yes. If I am instructed aright, some curious incidents took place in connexion with the visit of the royal commissioner. Apparently it was known who was to receive the appointment. Possibly, the announcement was made through the press. At all events, this person made it his business to journey to Sydney and return to the island in the company of the Commissioner who, I am informed, partook of his hospitality both on the journey and on the island. Surely the Commissioner should have realized the unwisdom of his action. He was impressed with the fact that the Administrator erred in mixing with litigants but, as we know, the Administrator was unable to help himself. The Commissioner was under no such necessity. Like the judges of our courts, he should have kept himself strictly apart. and should not have mixed with the people. Yet I am advised, that he attended race meetings and all sorts of jollifications, and mixed freely with thepeople whose complaints he was supposed to be investigating. I think I have said enough to convince the committee that an injustice has been done. I hope the Minister will not force us to a vote. If, however, the Minister shuts his eyes to what has happened, I shall be obliged to persist in the course I have mapped out. This department seems to have outrun itself, and the Minister has not yet been able to bring it to heel. Unless the Minister can give me an assurance that he will see justice done I shall have to ask the committee to register a vote on the item. </para>

For four years he has been refused his annual increment, though no charge of inefficiency has been made against him. Shortly after his first appointment, 25 charges were laid against him and he triumphantly refuted all except one of rudeness to the Administrator. In the other case with which I have&#39; been dealing, a grave charge of drunkenness on thepart of an officer was condoned, and the officer restored to his positin ; yet, one of the highest officers in the Territory is being arbitrarily denied what he is entitled to by law. </para>

The commissioner visited the island, took evidence and furnished a report. When that report was presented to the Government,  Colonel Leane  was about to leave Norfolk Island for Melbourne. On his arrival here a copy of the report was handed to him, and he was asked to make his comments upon it. The Cabinet then considered the report, together with  Colonel  Leane&#39;s  comments upon it, and came to the decision announced. According to a paragraph in the press to-day  Colonel Leane  has publicly stated that he informed the Minister that he intended to vindicate himself in the courts, and in these circumstances I do not intend to discuss the merits or demerits of the case at this juncture.

          <para>The honorable senator also referred to an officer at Rabaul who has not received the increments to which he considers he is entitled. I remind the honorable senator that all such increments have to be recommended by a superior officer who has a knowledge of the official&#39;s capabilities. If annual increments which are to be paid on the recommendation of the Administrator are not received we can only assume that the officer is not entitled to them. It is impossible, of course, for the Minister controlling the department to have a full knowledge of the work performed by every official in the Northern Territory, Papua, New Guinea, Canberra, and Norfolk Island. </para>

The  chairman  informs me that tenders were called for the erection of two buildings on blocks with a 20-ft. frontage, for which the price was &#163;1,648 each. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> now says that that price does not include the bricks. That fact is not mentioned in the chairman&#39;s letter. I cannot say if the commission was aware of that fact, but I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> will agree  with me that the  chairman  would not intentionally mislead me. No doubt, in reply to inquiries, he was informed that these tenders had been received ; but the fact that the bricks were to be supplied by the persons inviting the tenders may not have been mentioned to him. I think it is generally admitted that the commission is doing good work. I visited Canberrarecently and was surprised to see the progress mads since it has been in control. We should not forget the great difficulty and high pressure under which the commission is working in order to provide the necessary accommodation by the time Parliament assembles at Canberra next year. </para>

            <para>- I do not say what has prompted the honorable senator to move in this direction. He certainly has made some very serious charges against the procedure which has been adopted by the commission in regard to buildings in the Federal Capital City. Those charges are either true or untrue, and unless steps are taken immediately to investigate them, something in the nature of a scandal may develop. The Minister should assure honorable senators that at the earliest possible moment he will have a full investigation made and publish the result. </para>

At the same time, it intimated to the prospective tenderers that there was no likelihood of the houses being built. Information that is obtained in that way is totally misleading. All I ask is that the Minister will- give an assurance that the right thing will be done, so that the good name of Canberra will be preserved. </para>

            <para>.- For the sake of those who will be compelled to live in Canberra, I hope that it will be possible for the commission to adopt the practice which is followed in private business in regard to building leases - that is, to prescribe the style of building and give an estimate of the cost, beyond which a person will not be required to go. I have been driven to the action that I have taken in this Chamber&#39; by the fact that the commission has treated, in an entirely flippant manner, the inquiries that I have made. </para>

              <para>- It said, &#34;We have formed no estimate and we know nothing about it,&#34; whilst it had in its possession information that it did not disclose to us. If the commission will prescribe the style of building that will satisfy its requirements, it will be of great assistance to those whom I represent in this matter. &#34;Unless the people who build on these leases can &#39;satisfy a court of law that they have complied with the conditions, their leases may be forfeited. It has been almost impossible to pin the commission down to any definite statement as to what it expects. Business men do not want to engage in  lawsuits;  they desire to have something definite so that they will know to what extent they are committing themselves. The architects to whom I have referred did not attempt to disguise the fact that they took a risk. They possessed inner knowledge that I, as an outsider, could not possibly acquire, and on that they submitted a plan providing for what they thought was  the  minimum of the commission&#39;s requirements. If that can be regarded as a precedent, my clients can proceed along those lines. &#39; They can submit a similar plan, and say to the commission, &#34; You passed it in one case, therefore you must do so in ours.&#34; I do not see how the commission can refuse. Prior to to-day we were not in that position. I am sorry that heat has been engendered in this debate, but I say emphatically that I have throughout complained of the paucity of information that has been supplied to us.  I regret that the Cabinet has definitely made up its mind to adopt a certain course in regard to Colonel Leane. He  was a distinguished colleague of the Minister overseas. Now, without having had an adequate chance to defend himself, he is discharged. I understand that when he came to Melbourne on leave he was not told that he would not be permitted to return to Norfolk Island. He is in the unfortunate position that his household property is on the island at the mercy of anybody who cares to interfere with it, and he cannot collect it except at his own expense. </para>

              <para>- It seems to me that in the past the men have been harassed by the administration. Cases have come under my notice in which they have been charged more than the contract prices for their houses. No department has required watching more than has the. War Service Homes Department. There has been no greater scandal in Australia than in connexion with that department. No sooner had the first legislation been enacted, and  Colonel Walker  appointed commissioner, than trouble began. I hope that this bill will ease the condi tions of the men who went overseas on behalf of the Empire, and on their return endeavoured to obtain homes through the department. Even to-day the War Service Homes Department is not working as it should. The Minister should inform the Senate of the cause of the recent friction between that department and the State Savings Bank of Victoria, and whether the trouble has yet been settled. It has been said that an officer of the War Service Homes Department was responsible, but we do not know whether that is correct. . I understand that in Western Australia the Workers&#39; Home Board, acting for the Commonwealth Government, builds war service homes, and that there has been no friction. Before we pass the second reading of this bill, we should know whether it will make conditions easier for these returned men. </para>

            <para>. -  I can only say that the friction between the two departments was of a departmental nature, and that the interests of returned soldiers were in no way prejudiced thereby. It has been&#39; considered advisable to enter into a new agreement with the State Savings Bank of Victoria, but the negotiations have been  somewhat hampered by the lack of elasticity in the existing provisions. This bill has been introduced chiefly to facilitate those negotiations. It is true that there has been no friction between the Western Australian department which &#39; is building homes for soldiers and&#39; the War Service Homes Department. That is the position generally of the State institutions which have built homes for soldiers on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

            <para>.- Whatever differences there were arose under the agreement between the War Service Homes Commissioner and the State Savings Bank Commissioners of Victoria. Those differences have now been composed; but, in order that they shall not recur or other disputes arise, it is proposed to enter into a new agreement. I am not sufficiently <inline font-style="italic">au fait</inline> with all the details of those differences to feel justified in attempting to convey them to the Senate. To do so would require a care-fully-prepared statement. I repeat that the returned soldiers have in no way suffered in consequence of the disagreement. Homes for them are still being built expeditiously and satisfactorily by the State Savings Bank, which will continue to act on behalf of the Commonwealth Government in this matter, although under a new agreement. To facilitate the arrangements in connexion with the agreement, it is proposed to make minor amendments, and for that reason this bill has been introduced. </para>

            <para>. -  I realize that I am appealing in vain to the Minister. I am glad to know that the returned soldiers will not be penalized more than they have been in the past,- but I think that the Minister should tell the committee the reason for the friction between the two bodies. I realize that I cannot compel him to do so, but his refusal strengthens my belief that the fault lay with the War Service Homes Department. I will not say definitely that it did, because I have no evidence to that effect; but my mind, and the minds of other people, would be relieved if the Minister would make a full explanation of the facts, and tell us where the blame lay. Unless he does so, innocent officers may be held responsible for the trouble. The Minister admits that there has been a disagreement, and has stated that that is the reason for the introduction of this legislation. Is he protecting some one in the War Service Homes Department, or in the State Savings Bank? </para>

          </quote>
          <para>This is a rather new procedure. Under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1924, the commission was. given power to borrow moneys, in pursuance of resolutions passed by both Houses of Parliament, to such amount, in such manner, and on such terms as the Treasurer approved. Pending the borrowing of such moneys, however, the Treasurer was authorized to advance to the commission, out of any moneys in the Commonwealth public account, such amounts as he might think fit. No resolution has yet been passed by both Houses of Parliament authorizing the commission to borrow, but up to the 30th June, 1926, a sum of &#163;1,970,000 was advanced to the commission by the Treasurer out of the Commonwealth public account, and further advances have been made since that date. The rates of interest charged to the commission on these moneys have been the nominal rates at which the Commonwealth from time to time itself raised moneys on the market. A sum of &#163;2,000,000 was included in the recent Commonwealth Loan Act for 1926-27, for the Federal Capital Commission. This money, when raised, will be applied towards liquidation of the advances which have been made to the commission by the Treasurer. The expenditure, which it is proposed to cover by the resolution now submitted to the Senate, includes a sum of &#163;2,000,000 to meet the ordinary operations of the commission during this financial year. It is also proposed to provide for a sum of &#163;300.000 to be obtained by loan from the Commonwealth Bank for the purpose of building residences in the Territory. A further amount of &#163;350,000 is included so as  to enable the commission to obtain temporary accommodation from the Commonwealth Bank if loan moneys are not, for the time being, available, and if the Treasurer should find it inconvenient to provide the amount required by temporary advances. </para>

I realize that its purpose is to give effect to the determination of Parliament to entrust the development of the Federal Capital Territory to the commission, the appointment of which I strenuously opposed.

I understand that prior to the contracts being entered into the Public Works Committee, through its secretary or  chairman,  informed the  chairman  of the Federal Capital Commission that the course proposed was in contravention of the Public Works Committee Act. If that was done why did the&#39; Federal Capital Commission proceed with the work? The Crown Law authorities have since advised that the commission was acting unconstitutionally. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us an assurance that in future the Federal Capital Commission will not be allowed to arrogate to itself powers which properly belong to Parliament, but that it will confine itself strictly within the powers given to it bv Parliament. </para>

        <para>That the bill be now read a second time. This is a small measure which accomplishes what is, I think, an act of justice. As the Maternity Allowance Act stands at present Asiatic women cannot receive maternity allowances. British nationality, whether inherent as natural born, or acquired by naturalization, or by marriage to a British subject, does not overcome this disqualification. As a result of this provision it has hitherto been necessary to reject claims for maternity allowances by Asiatic mothers, even though they may have been born in Australia, or may have been resident in the Commonwealth for many years. Syrian mothers, for instance, although naturalized British subjects, have not been eligible for maternity allowances; because they are of Asiatic descent. As against this, women who have emigrated from European countries to Australia have been eligible to receive maternity allowances even though they may not have been British subjects, and may have been resident in Australia for only a few weeks. The present bill proposes to remove the disqualification imposed on Asiatic mothers by virtue of their descent, and, in lieu thereof, to insert a new provision that maternity allowances shall not be paid to aliens. The result of this will be that Asiatic mothers, including Syrians, who are British subjects will become eligible to receive maternity allowances provided, of course, that they comply with the ordinary requirements of the act. On the other hand, women of European descent who become resident in Australia, but who do not possess or acquire British nationality will be debarred. The cost involved will be small. During the last year, an amount of &#163;680,855 was paid in maternity allowances. There are 1,400,000 women in Australia of child-bearing age, namely, between the ages of fifteen and 45 years. The number of maternity allowances granted in 1925-26, which may be taken as an average year, was 136,171. Statistics show that more than 99 per cent, of mothers claim maternity allowances. The proportion of claims paid to women of child-bearing age is, therefore, approximately one in ten. Information received from the Commonwealth Statistician shows that there are approximately 2,000 Asiatic women of child-bearing age in the Commonwealth. Applying the same proportion as above, the number of maternity allowance claims which would be received from Asiatic mothers wouldbe 200 per annum. The additional expenditure involved would on these lines be &#163;1,000 per annum. Of the 2.000 Asiatic women of child-bearing age in Australia. 35 per cent., that is 700, are Syrian. The admission of Asiatics into Australia is prohibited by law. While permits to Asiatic travellers, students, &#38;c. to enter Australia for a short period are issued, they cannot acquire domicile here. , The wives of Asiatic travellers, for instance, are allowed to remain in Australia for a specified period, but they cannot become domiciled in the Commonwealth, and as they are not naturalized are not eligible for the allowance. There are a certain number of Syrians of a superior class in Australia, who, if they comply with the terms of this measure, may draw the maternity allowance. The bill removes an injustice, and I trust that the Senate will agree to it. </para>

            <para>. - I have no objection to the bill. I have a warm spot in my heart for the Australian aborigines, and, in visiting mission stations, have found that aboriginal mothers love their children just as much as do white mothers. Although the principal act precludes certain very intelligent individuals from participating in the maternity allowance, I think that every mother in the Commonwealth, irrespective of colour, is entitled to receive it. I will not admit that the Australian aborigines lack intelligence, as I have seen the excellent work which some of the men on the mission stations have performed. Some of the native women are also intelligent, and marry according to their rites, as do members of the civilized community. I trust the Minister will give my suggestion further consideration, and see that the native mothers of Australia who bear children are placed on the same level as naturalized Asiatic mothers. </para>

Their salaries&#39; were &#163;1,250 and &#163;800 respectively, but, some time ago, it was recognized that they were inadequate, and, annually, a special allowance has been voted on the Estimates, amounting to &#163;250 in the one case, and &#163;300 in the other. Honorable senators will remember that the Auditor-General occupied a like position. The Government thought it was undesirable that an allowance should be voted annually for officers occupying such important positions, and the salaries and allowances were consolidated. When the present salaries were fixed the Land Tax Commissioner was responsible only for the collection of land tax. Now he is responsible also for the collection of income tax. The salaries proposed are not by any means excessive. On the contrary, . they are comparatively modest. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

            <para>. - I have frequently said in this Chamber that every man should be paid a good salary. I do not say now that the salaries which it is proposed to pay to the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner of Taxation are too high; but when, for the second time- at least t1 is session, I notice that higher paid officials are receiving . increases whilst no attention is being given to lower paid employees of the Commonwealth, I am inclined to call a halt. In the discussion on the Appropriation Bill, attention was drawn to the fact that certain officers on the bread line were in receipt of p very low wage; but we are now asked to vote increases of &#163;750 a year to the Taxation Commissioner, making his salary &#163;2,000, and of &#163;700 a year to the  deputy  commissioner, bringing his salary up to &#163;1,500. Instead of- increasing the salaries of the highly-paid officers, we should begin by improving the position of the men on the bottom rung of the ladder. Had there been evidence of practical sympathy on the part of honorable senators opposite with the lowerpaid officers, I should support this bill more cheerfully than I do when I find men on the bread line passed over contemptuously. </para>

            <para>.- The bill should not be allowed to pass without an explanation from the Minister as to why it has been introduced at the present juncture. I understand that under the financial proposals of the&#39; Government, it is  contemplated  that the Federal authorities will retire from the field of land and entertainments taxation, and from the imposition of estate duties, at the end of the present financial year, and also that they will recede gradually from the field of income taxation. In view of these facts it is difficult to understand why it is now proposed to increase the salary of the commissioner from &#163;1,250 to &#163;2,000. I do not say that he would be overremunerated, but, if these officers have later to be compensated, the passage of the Bill will involve a much larger expenditure than would be incurred if we provided an annual grant. This seems to me to be a most inopportune time to increase the salaries of these officers in the manner proposed. By means of an annual grant their emoluments could be increased sufficiently to remunerate them for the duties they have to discharge. </para>

              <para>- The bill before us proves conclusively that this is a rich man&#39;s government. It is prepared to grant large increases of salary to those who move in the same social circle with members of the Ministry, and are already in receipt of good salaries, but to give to the lower-paid officials an increase of &#163;5 or &#163;10 per annum it regards as an act of grace. This bill proposes to grant to two men already receiving large salaries increases of &#163;750 per annum and &#163;700 per annum respectively. The Government professes to believe that every individual in the community is entitled to just treatment. If men are to be paid by results, then I say that there are men in this building - cleaners, receiving &#163;238 per annum, and attendants whose salary is &#163;253 per annum - who should receive substantial increases. The Government&#39;s proposal to vacate certain fields of taxation should reduce the work of these taxation commissioners, yet it is intended to increase their salaries. That seems anomalous, especially when the salaries of the lower-paid officials of Parliament, whose duties will increase considerably when the Seat of Government is transferred to Canberra, remain stationary. It is not sufficient to say that these anomalies will be rectified when we get to Canberra. These men do essential work&#62; and their services are appreciated by every honorable senator. They should be paid more now. </para>

              <para>- The people of Australia are entitled to know the reason for the proposed increases of salary to these commissioners. I admit that the fact that they are already receiving high salaries does not necessarily mean that they are overpaid. Parliament is always willing to grant increases of salaries to men  entitled  to them, so long as sufficient reasons for so doing are advanced by the Government. The salaries paid to public servants are not high: Many men holding responsible positions in the service of the Government are inadequately remunerated. That many of them are ex-  perts is not generally recognized. If, for instance, the experts in the Parliamentary Library were displaced by other men, we should soon be brought to a realization of the fact that the men who had been displaced were, indeed, experts. Even a second-rate lawyer or a third-rate doctor receive* an income of &#163;1,500 or &#163;2,000 a year, while experts in our government departments, who are working  in the interests of the country, are thought to be well paid if they receive &#163;500 or &#163;600 per annum. The Government should give closer attention to the, salaries paid to its public servants, and not leave this matter entirely to others. A body of men appointed to deal with Public Service salaries cannot be acquainted with the work performed by those whose services they assess. They may, for instance, go into the Titles Office to value the work of the officers there, yet they probably would not be able to prepare the simplest transfer document, and would scarcely know what a mortgage deed was. </para>

            <para>. - Having regard to the way in which salaries generally are soaring, and the responsibilities resting upon the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner of Taxation, I do not think the amounts provided are out of the way. But there are . two features of the proposal that I do not favour. One is that it is retro1spective. It proposes to pay the increases as from the 1st July, 1925. The Minister may be able to advance very good reasons for this course, but up to the present he has not given them. It may be that the Government gave a promise to the officers concerned. I hope that is the explanation, otherwise I shall not be in agreement with the proposal. My second point of disagreement is that a bill of this nature might very well have been brought down months ago, instead of at the eleventh hour. Then there is the issue raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> that if the Commonwealth Government vacates the field of direct taxation in a few years&#39; time the work of the Taxation Department may slacken off, and these salary increases will involve the question of increased compensation. I do not however, regard that as very important, because, as I said before, judging by the responsible nature of the duties required of the officers concerned, I do not think they are being overpaid. </para>

            <para>. - In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson&#39;s</inline> objection as to the measure being retrospective, I should like to say that I made a note of that feature of the bill, and intended to explain it when moving the second reading, but unfortunately I overlooked it. The circumstances are these: The Government came to the conclusion, in the last financial year, that the increased salaries should be paid, and instructions were actually given to prepare the bill. It was one .of those measures which we had on the stocks when suddenly it was decided to appeal to the people, and, with a number of others, it was held over. Of course, the officers concerned knew that the Government had approved of the increases, and this measure is made retrospective to honour the promise given to them during the last financial year. As to the late arrival of the bill in the Senate, I agree with the criticism offered. I have had long experience as a member of the Government, and I admit that it is strange that-  heads of departments, for some mysterious reason, instead of having their measures ready for introduction earlier in the session, leave them until almost the last moment. As a member of the Government I must plead guilty. I have to confess that I know of no reason why this bill was not presented earlier. With regard to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> that the work of the department is likely to slacken off, I can only say that although the Government may. vacate certain fields of taxation, we shall be collecting this year about &#163;6,500,000 in income taxation, as well as land tax and other taxes. </para>

              <para>- Judging by experience, I should say it will take a very loner time. The obligation of the Government with regard to arrears of taxation will, of course, continue. Cases of hardship have to be investigated, and time given to taxpayers, if necessary, to meet their obligations. As honorable senators are aware, a man may have a good income in respect of the year for which he is assessed, and in the following year, owing to business losses may have no income. </para>

It was put before the people last year and the electors, by returning the Government to power with an increased majority, clearly indicated that they approved of our action. In reply to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> I should like to emphasize that the collection of &#163;6,500,000 in income taxation under what is admittedly an involved system, calls for unusual qualities, and the Government considers that the salaries asked for are not unreasonably high. </para>

              <para>- I can best answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan&#39;s</inline> question in the approved Scottish way by asking another - Is it not a piece of arrogance on the part of any Government to give a pledge to public servants, and, fifteen months afterwards, present a measure to this committee and expect us to endorse it ? If the proposed increases are paid to the officers concerned from the 1st of next month, instead of from the 1st July, 1925, they will be handsomely dealt with. In addition to the case mentioned the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> I could quote innumerable instances of Australian soldiers who went through the hell of France and Gallipoli, and who experienced the utmost difficulty in securing war pensions. In no case were the pensions made retrospective. Many applicants had to battle, not for a month or two, but in some cases for over a year, before they were granted a miserable pension. </para>
