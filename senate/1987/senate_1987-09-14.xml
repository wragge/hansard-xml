I recall that at that time we expressed our hopes of you as President and what we expected of you.

We look forward to seeing those same qualities in the presidency that you have now been awarded by the unanimous vote of the Senate. Mr President, we wish you well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to those honourable senators who have spoken-Senators Button, Chaney, Haines, Stone, Harradine, Vallentine and Wood-and for the complimentary remarks that they have made on this occasion. In reflecting on those remarks I am conscious of the responsibilities of the office of President, both in this chamber and in the wider context in which a Presiding Officer is required to carry out these responsibilities. Honourable senators can be assured that I will continue to preside over the proceedings of the Senate in the most impartial way I can. After occupying this chair for one session, I appreciate more than ever the standards of fairness which were set by my predecessors. I shall strive to maintain these high standards, which I trust will assist the Senate in its deliberation of matters important to all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On what is almost certainly an historic occasion-the last time on which the opening of the Parliament of Australia will take place in the provisional Parliament House-I am very much aware of challenges facing the Parliament in the next 12 to 18 months. While I must accept responsibility for the Senate facing up to these challenges, I can only do that in the knowledge that I have the support of honourable senators. I refer particularly to the opening of the new Parliament House, the holding of the thirty-fourth Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference here in Canberra and the reform of the administration of the Parliament. Honourable senators do not need me to remind them of the individual and collective implications of the move to the new building. However, we should all now be turning our minds to these matters. Some may be beyond our control-for example, the congregation of all Ministers in an executive area-but most-for example, working arrangements for senators and the appropriateness of the Standing Orders to the new building-are within the responsibility of this Senate and now is the appropriate time to start our consideration of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have recently returned from the thirty-third Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in Kuala Lumpur where, apart from the fact that I was elected President of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, I observed the very great opportunities which exist for the host Parliament in having 350 fellow Commonwealth parliamentarians gathered together. The organisational aspects of such a conference are significant but it is a challenge to which I am certain the Commonwealth Parliament will rise; and I am certain that the conference to be held here in September next year will be a highlight of our bicentennial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area of concern to me is the administration of the Parliament. Honourable senators will recall that I wrote to all senators in May this year outlining certain intentions to change the administrative support to the Parliament. It is my intention to pursue these proposals during my term of office. There are many factors which I believe make it imperative that there be changes to the administration of the Parliament. These include the greatly increased scale of operation associated with the new Parliament House, developments in computer-based technology and the heightened awareness of the need for efficiency in using personnel and financial resources in both public and private organisations. It is my hope to put in place an administrative framework which addresses those needs and is capable of responding to any demands placed upon it in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time I wish to reassure honourable senators that as President I will not be party to any change which can be seen to challenge the constitutional role and independence of the Senate. I will not condone any proposal which would denigrate the role of any senators, either individually or collectively, or would threaten the high level of services provided to all senators. It is my intention to consult fully with honourable senators on the details of any proposals for administrative reform. The normal process of deliberation will not be circumvented, the Appropriations and Staffing Committee will be involved in this consideration and the proposals will be appropriately debated on the floor of this chamber. As I have made clear throughout my time as President, my door is always open and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss any of these matters with honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I again thank all senators for placing their trust in me. As I said in the Senate on 17 February this year on a similar occasion, I realise that my task is a difficult and responsible one. However, I will tackle it with enthusiasm and in a way in which I trust honourable senators will approve. </PARA>

<PROCTEXT><PARA> His Excellency the Governor-General entered the chamber and, being seated, with the President on his right hand, commanded that a message be sent to the House of Representatives intimating that he desired the attendance of honourable members in the Senate chamber forthwith.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members having come with their Speaker, His Excellency was pleased to deliver the following speech:</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Members of the Parliament of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> At the elections for both Houses of Parliament held on 11 July 1987, the Australian people once again elected the Labor Government and, with an increased majority, decisively renewed its mandate to pursue the task of national reconstruction.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government enters its third term in office with a full agenda of reforms to continue this essential and historic task.</PARA>
<PARA> Like the policies implemented by the Government in its first two terms, these new proposals are designed to work towards two overriding and complementary goals.</PARA>
<PARA> They seek to build a stronger, more competitive and more efficient Australian economy, and a fairer and more compassionate Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA> The nation has made considerable progress towards these goals since March 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian people are to overcome the basic problems which confront us, further restraint in government spending will be required. The more efficient employment of our human and physical resources, the careful rethinking of inherited attitudes and the continued acceptance by the whole community of the need for hard decisions, will also be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> Because this is a task for the whole nation, it is fitting that the Government's program will encompass the period of our Bicentenary celebrations next year.</PARA>
<PARA> These celebrations will generate great national pride and redouble our sense of national purpose and partnership. The Bicentenary will enable Australians to reflect and to build upon their substantial achievements in all facets of human endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that this renewed national spirit will be an essential element in the successful reconstruction of the Australian economy to meet the challenges of our third century of European settlement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes it is essential, as we come to the Bicentennial year, to recognise that 200 years of European settlement come after over 40,000 years of Aboriginal history. The Government will explore how best to reflect that recognition and the obligation which this involves for the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has directed and coordinated all aspects of government activity towards the task of reconstruction. Macroeconomic policy has been complemented by appropriate policies directed to the primary, manufacturing and services industries, education and training, foreign policy and overseas trade, the encouragement of research, the improvement of the nation's infrastructure and the streamlining of the public service.</PARA>
<PARA> Social welfare policy has been progressively reformed to ensure that those Australians who are worst off receive the greatest possible assistance, while those who should not rely upon the government safety net find it more difficult to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> The agenda for the third term reflects this coordinated and farsighted approach to the continued challenge of reform.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Economy</PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting the sharp decline in our terms of trade, the major preoccupation of economic policy over recent years has been to redress the consequent deterioration in our balance of payments and foreign debt positions. Corrective action on those fronts is essential to establish the pre-conditions for sustainable growth in economic activity and living standards. The Government's monetary, wages and fiscal policies have been geared towards these objectives, while seeking to spread the burden of economic adjustment fairly across the community. Structural policies also have been receiving particular emphasis.</PARA>
<PARA> These policies are now bearing fruit. While the task of restoring external balance will take some considerable time, there is increasing evidence that the necessary structural adjustment processes are occurring. The current account deficit has been moving downwards and this is forecast to continue.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Government acknowledges the need for responsible macroeconomic policies to be maintained, increased efforts will be made to improve efficiency and to remove constraints on improved output performance in the private and public sectors. That, ultimately, is the basis of the improved living standards to which we all aspire.</PARA>
<PARA> Further steps will be taken to reduce the public sector's call on national savings for as long as economic conditions require. The Government expects all levels of government in Australia to contribute to the restraint that will be necessary to achieve these objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue its wages policy which over the past four years has, together with the mature cooperation of the trade union movement, provided the foundation for outstanding employment growth, increased economic competitiveness and enhanced industrial stability. The continued reform of outmoded work and management practices to raise productivity will also receive the attention of the Government over the life of this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> During its second term, the Government was presented with the Report of the Committee of Review into Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems. Following extensive consultations with the major parties, the Government will be reforming the industrial relations system without changing existing sanction provisions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and other relevant legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also be finalising its policy on employee participation and industrial democracy following a period of extensive consultation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will reintroduce legislation to establish the Office of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner and to set operating standards in respect of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA> In the area of taxation, the Government will be giving top priority to the legislative and administrative completion of its tax reform measures and to continuing its strong support for vigorous enforcement of the taxation laws.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Card Bill will be reintroduced in the first week of the sittings. The Australia Card program is an integral part of the Government's tax reform package and is a fundamental instrument in improving the fairness of the Australian taxation and social welfare systems. It will stop individuals taking more from the welfare system than is their due. It will ensure that all Australians pay a fair share of taxation. The legislation for the Australia Card, and the Privacy bills, will ensure full protection of civil liberties.</PARA>
<PARA>Industry Policy</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the past four years, the Government has implemented an industry and technology strategy which has aimed to build the competitive strength of Australian manufacturing and service industries to world standards. The Australian economy has been opened up to the challenges of international trade. Its emphasis on inward looking protectionism has been progressively shifted to the competitive search for overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA> Some notable successes have already been achieved. There is, however, still a long way to go in changing attitudes, marshalling the innovative skills of the Australian people, gaining the best value from our abundant resources and generating new technologies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government plans to implement a development strategy for the Australian information industries to link them into world markets and expand our capacity to develop new information industries, products and services.</PARA>
<PARA> It plans also to implement policies to encourage more value-added production in Australia, particularly through further processing of our mineral and agricultural resources, and to develop the full export potential of these industries.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the objectives of Government purchasing policy will be to encourage the development of the Australian high technology industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also seek to improve links between industry and CSIRO and education institutions to promote the kind of research and development vital to future wealth creation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will proceed with the formation of an Australian Research Council to enhance further the excellence of Australian research and its contribution to national economic and social development.</PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Affairs and Trade</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to assist Australian companies gain access to international markets and join in the dynamic growth of the Pacific rim economies. It will search for a more open trading system, particularly in agricultural trade. New initiatives include enhancing the effectiveness of AUSTRADE, and designing and implementing a strategy to attract productive foreign investment to raise our industrial capacity, quicken the transfer of technology and managerial know-how, and widen our access to foreign markets. The Government will facilitate international co-operation agreements between firms to develop and exploit new technologies, and to help Australian companies market their own technological innovations. The Government will develop a cooperative regional strategy, with the aim of helping Australian high technology industry tap the enormous potential of the ASEAN and Pacific regions.</PARA>
<PARA> In its international policies, the Government will consolidate and develop relations with neighbouring countries in the ASEAN and South Pacific Forum regions. It will work for a lessening of superpower rivalry, particularly through the achievement of effective and verifiable arms control and disarmament measures. It will further our alliance relationship with the United States under ANZUS. It will promote effective development assistance programs to developing countries within the means available to it.</PARA>
<PARA>Defence</PARA>
<PARA> The policies outlined in the Defence White Paper presented to the last Parliament will further enhance Australia's defence capabilities and increase the involvement of Australian industry. The Government will continue the Defence investment program and will ensure that our Defence Force structure and capabilities are developed within the policy of greater defence self-reliance and have prime regard for the security interests of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Major capital equipment initiatives, including the construction of eight light patrol frigates and six conventionally powered submarines, will benefit significantly our self-reliant defence capability and our indigenous industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Other Defence priorities include the continuing rationalisation of Defence factories and dockyards and further improvement of conditions of service in the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA>Primary Industries and Energy</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the encouragement and promotion of Australia's traditional primary industries, which must remain a very high priority, the Government will help rural and provincial Australia gain greater access to Government programs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will make every effort to ensure that Australian products meet international and domestic standards for chemicals associated with their production. It will introduce improved methods for clearance and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals for use in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, the Government will set in place legislation to replace the existing River Murray Commission with a Murray-Darling Basin Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> Responsible and environmentally sensible management of our forest resources will remain a priority for the Government and a broadacre afforestation program will be introduced. A balance must be maintained between the sustain- able commercial use of these production resources and the conservation and protection of areas that are sensitive or have special environmental value.</PARA>
<PARA> In the resources area, the petroleum sector will be a focus for much Government action. Legislation necessary to give effect to the Government's decision to deregulate crude oil marketing with effect from 1 January 1988 will be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> In its third term, the Government will introduce legislation to give effect to its commitment to reduce the top excise rate on `old' oil. This measure is expected to lead to considerably higher rates of production and to guarantee new expenditure in petroleum exploration, both onshore and offshore, and substantial new investment in Bass Strait.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will, as a matter of priority, re-introduce its resource rent tax legislation to replace the royalties and excise on new offshore petroleum developments.</PARA>
<PARA> Monitoring of coal export contracts will be maintained and the Government will be prepared to use its export control reserve power if it is necessary to protect the national interest and ensure adequate returns to Australia from the export of its coal resources.</PARA>
<PARA>Transport and Communications</PARA>
<PARA> Early in these sittings, the Government will introduce motions in both Houses formally to give the required three years' notice to terminate the Two Airline Policy and will also be shortly spelling out its plans and objectives for the domestic aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government made an in-principle decision, in its second term, to establish a Civil Aviation Corporation to improve the efficiency of support for the aviation industry. Refinement of this concept will take place in the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also examining reforms to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the shipping industry, with particular emphasis on the operation of the waterfront. There will also be an examination of air charter arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> The last four years have seen unprecedented changes in Australia's broadcasting environment. Legislation will be introduced to complete the reform of ownership and control rules for television and to make some much-needed changes to parts of the Broadcasting Act dealing with public broadcasting, licensing and Australian Broadcasting Tribunal procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> The telecommunications industry is a vital part of Australia's economic infrastructure and a dynamically growing industry in its own right. The Government will ensure that its telecommunications policies are adapted to the changing international environment and facilitate the use by Australian industry of the most modern technology.</PARA>
<PARA>Tourism</PARA>
<PARA> The success of the Government's tourism promotion campaigns overseas, coupled with the depreciation of the Australian dollar, has resulted in a boom in international travel to Australia. Tourism is now one of Australia's largest and fastest-growing industries, and the Government will continue to pursue policies which maintain the competitiveness of our tourism-based industries.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation will be introduced during the Budget sittings to restructure the Australian Tourist Commission to enable it to operate as a much more efficient marketing organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>Administrative Reforms</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's determination to improve overall economic efficiency has already led to a substantial reform of the public sector. The Government's first act of its third term was the introduction of new administrative and ministerial arrangements which will strengthen ministerial control, streamline administration and improve both the efficiency and the economy of the business of government.</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of a two-level ministerial structure will entail amendments to the Ministers of State Act to permit the appointment of three additional Ministers. Amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act will put beyond doubt that references in legislation to a Minister include all Ministers administering the relevant department.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation will be introduced to replace the Public Service Board with a single, full-time Public Service Commissioner, and a part-time Management Advisory Board.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to give consideration to the most efficient and effective methods of providing its agencies with common services, such as design and construction of public works and property management.</PARA>
<PARA> From the reconstruction of the nation's economy, I turn now to the Government's proposals to develop the nation's greatest resources, its people, so they too are equipped to manage the challenges ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>Education and Training</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policies on education and training are designed to ensure that young Australians have the greatest possible opportunities in life ensuring that we build an economy capable of prospering in an increasingly competitive world.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's immediate priority will be to direct education resources to alleviating Australia's skills shortage, particularly in high technology fields, and to widening our overall skills base.</PARA>
<PARA> Industry must also play its part, by developing links with schools, higher education and technical education, investing more heavily in research and development, and maintaining an open dialogue with educational institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government aims to continue its progress in lifting Year 12 retention rates to at least 65 per cent by the first half of the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA> The apprenticeship system will continue to be a major source of employment and training opportunities for young people, providing about one third of all full-time employment opportunities for school leavers. In addition, the Australian Traineeship System will provide increasing opportunities for young people to undertake high quality training in non-trades areas.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to funding a National Policy on Languages which aims to ensure that all Australians master English, our common tongue, and that more Australians learn a second language. This will contribute to improvements in the skill level of the labour force, to diversification of employment opportunities and to the advancement of our trade and economic interests abroad.</PARA>
<PARA> Job creation programs will be increasingly replaced by vocational training initiatives, to help equip people, through training or retraining, with the skills they need to compete in a changing job market.</PARA>
<PARA> In making education more relevant to the economy, the Government will maintain its commitment to equity in education. The Government will continue targeting those disadvantaged in the labour market to receive special assistance with education and training.</PARA>
<PARA>Social Security, Community Services and Health</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's goal is that, by 1990, no Australian child need live in poverty. Accordingly, in this Parliament the Government will undertake a major restructuring of government support for children. To this end, and in fulfilment of an election promise, a new Family Allowance Supplement will be introduced to rationalise existing programs and provide substantially increased levels of support, subject to a family income test. Reforms to rental assistance and improved financial help for children with disabilities will also be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, in the Budget sittings of Parliament the Government intends to introduce legislation to establish the Child Support Agency as part of the Australian Taxation Office. This agency will ensure the efficient collection of maintenance payments.</PARA>
<PARA> The second stage of the child maintenance reforms will be legislated in 1988. The Government is determined to safeguard the rights of children to adequate support and to remove the burden on the taxpayer where parents have the capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA> In its first two terms of office, the Government increased the standard rate of pension from 22.7% of average weekly earnings to 24.4%. The Government will seek to make further increases where economic circumstances permit.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Government has the objective of restoring parity between the single adult pension and benefit rates.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare, now endorsed by the electorate on three occasions, will remain the basis of health insurance in this country, thereby ensuring fairness and universality in health care provision.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will begin negotiations with the States on the funding arrangements for State public hospitals as the present Medicare agreements expire next year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also provide State and Territory Governments with extra funds over the next two years on a dollar for dollar basis to assist them to reduce waiting times in public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises the importance of prevention as well as cure and will continue to promote activities directed towards better health. It will be developing with the States the first comprehensive set of national health goals and strategies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is conscious of the enormous and continuing debt of gratitude we all owe to the veterans' community. It will introduce amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Seamen's War Pension and Allowances Act to ensure that Special, that is TPI, and Intermediate rate pensions, once granted, continue to be payable indefinitely, except where there is evidence of fraud, significant improvement in health or resumption of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> Full medical and hospital treatment will also be extended to all returned ex-servicewomen from the Second World War, and special compensation will be provided to surviving Australian ex-servicemen illegally interned in Nazi concentration camps for protracted periods during that war.</PARA>
<PARA> In its third term of office the Government will continue its major reforms of residential care services for aged people, ensuring a balanced provision of appropriate accommodation and services. Enhanced assessment services will provide a better match between care needs and services.</PARA>
<PARA> To ensure better coordination and equitable distribution of community services the Government has entered into joint funding and co-operative program arrangements with the State Governments. The Government will seek to redefine and develop these programs to ensure they remain effective, efficient and relevant.</PARA>
<PARA> The fight against drug abuse in Australia will be continued under the National Campaign against Drug Abuse, to build on the achievements gained since the Campaign's establishment in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to fund AIDS education programs and prevention and research activities.</PARA>
<PARA> In this the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless, the Government's commitment to public housing is demonstrated by its guarantee to provide over $2.1 billion in grants under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement over the next three years. The highly successful First Home Owners Scheme will continue.</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Affairs</PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to the Government's intention to explore how best to reflect the recognition of over 40,000 years of Aboriginal history and the obligation which this involves for the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA> In its first two terms the Government has increased real funding on Aboriginal programs by 50%. The Government will vigorously press on with a range of programs designed to improve the living conditions and future prospects of this group of Australia's citizens.</PARA>
<PARA> Of particular importance will be the further development of the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy, designed to provide a range of measures to enhance Aboriginal economic independence.</PARA>
<PARA> A Royal Commission to enquire into the tragically high number of Aboriginal deaths in custody has already been announced, and a series of discussions with the States has begun. This is a serious and complex problem but the Government believes a sympathetic and concerted effort by all can only achieve positive results.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government proposes to establish a new Commission to replace the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission, and legislation will be developed-for introduction, if possible, in these sittings-to this end.</PARA>
<PARA>Women</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is particularly proud of its record of achievement in regard to women's issues. It will continue to act to improve the quality of life for women-those at home and those in the workforce-by giving women a greater say, a better range of choices and a fair go.</PARA>
<PARA> During its third term the Government will complete its promise of 20,000 new child care places and will implement major initiatives to improve the health of Australian women, involving a three year program of evaluation and trials of breast and cervical cancer screening procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Agenda for Women will be finalised and released, as the blueprint for future Government action to improve the status of women in Australia up to the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will commence a $1.6 million education campaign with the objective of reducing the incidence of domestic violence in the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Immigration and Ethnic Affairs</PARA>
<PARA> The National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia-to be developed over the next two years in conjunction with the Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs-will give definition, direction and drive to the policy of multiculturalism. At the same time the Government's access and equity strategy will help ensure that Government services and programs are available fairly to all Australians. I referred earlier to the National Policy on Languages which will specifically address Australia's language needs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will ensure that its immigration policy remains relevant to Australia's contemporary needs and has accordingly commissioned a review of Australia's immigration policies. The examination will be conducted in close consultation with interested community groups, including ethnic organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> Equally, the Government is determined to maintain those essential services required by migrants on arrival in their new homeland. Additional funds will be provided for settlement services in 1987-88, based on increases in the Migration Program, including for the Adult Migrant Education Program which plays such a key role in successful settlement.</PARA>
<PARA>Law and Justice</PARA>
<PARA> The Constitutional Commission, established by the Government to consult widely with the community and to recommend changes to the Constitution, will report in 1988. The Government will consider closely the report of the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will develop further measures to improve the ability of law enforcement agencies to counter major crime. It will introduce the Cash Transaction Reports Bill, which lapsed on the dissolution of the last Parliament, to ensure adequate machinery to trace cash transactions in its effort to eradicate organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now completed a review of Australia's extradition legislation and a Bill to consolidate and modernise the extradition laws will be introduced during these sittings.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Government's response to the report of the Review of Material relating to the Entry of Alleged War Criminals into Australia, legislation to amend the War Crimes Act will also be brought forward.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill will be introduced during these sittings. That Bill will include measures to deal effectively with tax evasion and insolvency fraud.</PARA>
<PARA> Another priority is to revise the National Companies and Securities Scheme to address inadequacies of the present system to ensure it operates as a genuinely national scheme in a way which will enhance our international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> Adequate consumer protection is an essential part of the Government's policies to ensure a fairer society. Government activity in this area will complement the national Price Watch network, a system of community-based committees to monitor and report on local supermarket prices.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation will be introduced during these sittings to amend significantly the Family Law Act to implement a reference of powers from some States on ex-nuptial children and to make the Court more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament</PARA>
<PARA> The Government supports an increase in the term of the House of Representatives to four years to give greater stability and to encourage longer term planning. Fewer elections would also result in less cost and inconvenience to the electors. Legislation for a referendum on a four year term will be introduced in the life of this Parliament to allow Australians to have their say on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Environment</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's agenda for environmental action includes completion of the Commission of Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests of Tasmania and a policy response to the findings of that inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also consult with the Queensland Government and other interested parties in proceeding towards nomination of the wet tropics of North-East Queensland to the World Heritage List by the end of 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has nominated Kakadu National Park Stage 2 and Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mount Olga) National Park for inclusion on the World Heritage List. The Government will continue to protect the unique natural and cultural heritage of these and other Australian areas already on the list.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will introduce a program for the greater protection of endangered species and, cognisant of Australia's international responsibilities, will sign and ratify the Vienna Convention for protection of the earth's ozone layer.</PARA>
<PARA>The Arts</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to pursue a uniquely Australian national arts program aimed at the development of excellence in the arts across a diverse range. It will continue to foster the widest public access to and participation in the arts. To this end, amendments to the Australia Council Act will be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will maintain Australian film production at a high level.</PARA>
<PARA>Local Government</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's commitment to the further development of Local Government-a commitment demonstrated so clearly in the initiatives of the past four years-will be continued with the aim of enabling Local Government to participate as an effective partner in the Australian system of government. Attention will be given to arrangement for the devolution of programs to Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Members of the Parliament of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes the initiatives I have outlined today are essential to continue the reconstruction of the national economy and the creation of a fairer society.</PARA>
<PARA> It is your legislative task to consider and debate these initiatives as they are progressively introduced into the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> As the representatives of the Australian people, whose interests these proposals are designed to advance, you bear a grave responsibility, and I wish you well in your task ahead.</PARA>

<PARA>NOTICES OF MOTION</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine: I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) notes that persons under 21 years constituted 22.2 per cent of the Australian Public Service staff in 1966, falling to 12.2 per cent in 1974, and falling further to an all-time low of 5.6 per cent as at 31 December 1985, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) calls on the Federal Government to take positive action to remedy the apparent structural bias in appointment procedures, which at present discriminate against youth. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine: I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the committee known as the Joint Select Committee on Video Material, appointed by resolutions of the Senate of 19 March 1985 and the House of Representatives of 27 February and 19 March 1985, be re-appointed, under the same terms and with the same functions and powers;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the committee have power to consider and use for its purposes the evidence and records of the Senate Select Committee on Video Material appointed during the 33rd Parliament and of the Joint Select Committee on Video Material appointed during the 34th Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the committee report on or before 26 November 1987; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the provisions of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the Standing Orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the Parliament calls on the Government, pending the report of the Joint Committee, to implement forthwith the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Video Material, in particular to ensure an immediate ban on video materials which have received the ``X'' classification by the Film Censorship Board, and that those interim measures remain in force until such time as the Parliament has considered Government action consequent upon the Joint Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) That the foregoing resolutions be communicated to the House of Representatives by Message, with a request for the concurrence of that House in the resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine: I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate notes with concern that over the past 2 decades families have been subjected to increasing pressures from indirect taxation, as well as from direct taxation, and that moves to downgrade the spouse rebate and family allowances are a further example of this iniquitous trend of placing an inordinate taxation burden on families, particularly one-income families. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine: I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) noting the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) previous insistence in official statements and evidence to Senate Estimates Committee C that its decision to provide travel entitlements to homosexual partners of ABC staff members on the same basis as spouses, was based on advice given to the Board by its Equal Employment Opportunities Unit that the ABC was required by law to make this decision and that other corporations had so acted; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) noting that the ABC has now admitted orally and in writing to Estimates Committee C that the information on which its decision was based is incorrect and has acknowledged its error;</PARA>
<PARA>calls on the ABC to immediately reverse its unsound and anti-social decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine: I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate, noting that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Governor of Victoria (Dr Davis McCaughey) deliberately chose as the subject for the 23rd Tracy Maud Memorial Lecture the title ``medical Ethics: Who decides what and how?'' which in his speech he describes as ``one of public controversy'';</PARA>
<PARA> (b) when referring to the question of human embryo experimentation, the Governor in his speech said: ``Even if legislation of a restrictive kind were to receive a majority vote, say in the Senate, or were to reflect public opinion as expressed in a public opinion poll, it would still be questionable whether it would be good democracy to impose it'';</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Dr Davis McCaughey, in conjunction with another member of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Medical Research Ethics Committee (Dr Robert Jansen, now a director of an IVF clinic in New South Wales) drew up the pro-experimentation guidelines in 1982 which have given rise to so much public concern; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) these guidelines were subjected to the scrutiny of the Senate Select Committee on the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill 1985 which found that the marker event contained in the guidelines before which experimentation on human embryos could take place lacked inherent ethical validity and that the concept contained in those guidelines that the human embryo could be regarded as property, should be rejected,</PARA>
<PARA> declares that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the statement by the appointed Governor of Victoria, His Excellency Dr Davis McCaughey, which questioned whether it would be good for democracy in effect for executive governments to enforce laws passed by elected Parliaments restricting experiments on human embryos strikes at the heart of our system of Parliamentary democracy and raises fundamental questions as to the role of her Majesty's representatives in Australia,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the question of experiments on human embryos is a major matter of public importance which cannot be confined to and determined by selected scientists and ethics committees,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) insofar as the Governor's statement seeks to undermine an Act of the Victorian Parliament which restricts experiments on human embryos, that is a question for the people of Victoria to determine, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) insofar as the Governor's statement relates to Federal legislation to restrict experiments on human embryos, as indeed has been recommended by a Senate Select Committee and the Family Law Council whose reports are now under consideration by the Federal Government, the statement of the Governor of Victoria might understandably be interpreted to be a reflection upon and an attempt to unduly influence the democratic processes of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>CONTINGENT NOTICES OF MOTION</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine: I give contingent notices of motion as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (Contingent on the President proceeding to the placing of business on any day)-That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Harradine moving a motion relating to the order of business on the Notice Paper. </PARA>

<PARA> (Contingent on the Senate proceeding to the consideration of Government Papers pursuant to Sessional Order)-That so much of the Sessional Order relating to the consideration of Government Papers be suspended as would prevent Senator Harradine moving a motion relating to the order in which the papers are called on by the President. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 27 June 1987, of the Rt Hon. Sir Billy Mackie Snedden, kcmg, qc, member of the House of Representatives for the seat of Bruce from 1955 to 1983, Minister of the Crown from 1966 to 1972, Leader of the Opposition from 1972 to 1975 and Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1976 to 1983; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Billy Snedden was born in 1926 in Perth, one of six children. He got involved in politics at a very young age-15 years, I think. After the Second World War, having joined the Liberal Party of Australia in 1944, he took a law degree at the University of Western Australia in Perth. He was admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in 1951 and to the Victorian Bar in 1955. He became a Federal member of parliament in 1955, winning the seat of Bruce for the Liberal Party, and he held that seat through successive elections until 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important to record that during his 28 years of service in the Parliament he held a series of ministerial portfolios, including Attorney-General, Minister for Immigration, Minister for Labour and National Service and the Treasurer. He was the Deputy Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party from August 1971 till December 1972 and became its leader and Leader of the Opposition following the 1972 election. He led the Liberal Party at the general election in May 1974, an election which the Liberals lost by five seats-the closest election result since 1961. In March 1975 he lost the Liberal leadership to Mr Malcolm Fraser, and the manner in which he accepted this loss was a tribute to his innate dignity and grace. In February 1976 he became Speaker of the House of Representatives, a position he occupied with dignity and impartiality. It was perhaps as Speaker that he achieved most and made his greatest contribution to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Following his retirement he became a company director and served on a number of boards. He was also Chairman of the Melbourne Football Club from 1980 to 1985 and he followed the fortunes of that club, I understand, for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Billy Snedden will be remembered as an Australian who gave a lifetime of service to his country, particularly in the parliamentary sphere, and on behalf of the Government I extend to his family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I support the motion of condolence which has been moved by Senator Button on behalf of the Government. Billy Snedden was a person whom many of us worked with, knew well and were friendly with, and there is a great deal of sorrow among us at his death. He was, I think, a quintessential Australian success story, having had to leave school early as the last in a large family and his father having died when he was still a boy. He became a law clerk and then joined the Royal Australian Air Force as soon as his age permitted during the Second World War. I think he saw only training before the war ended. He then went to university and completed his law degree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From the earliest time after leaving university he made it clear that he intended Parliament to be his future. He ran for the State Parliament in the seat of Boulder, which I think experts such as Senator Robert Ray would tell us is not a seat for a Liberal to aspire to. He subsequently contested Fremantle against Kim Beazley Sr in the 1949 election and then in the subsequent election contested Mr Tom Burke for the seat of Perth. So by the age of 24 he had contested three elections. He then went off and tried his hand, I think, at being a public servant for a brief time. But he later obtained the seat of Bruce in Victoria in 1955. </PARA>
<PARA> I first knew Bill Snedden from that time because he went into the same Parliament as my father. They were close friends. Indeed, they shared a room, I think, on the upper floor of the building. I think it was U41 which was known as the submarine. I think they had a lot more fun in Parliament then than we do now and certainly it was the scene of a lot of touch football, poker and general revelry. I certainly knew him as a very cheerful compatriot of my father's. </PARA>
<PARA> He had a very quick rise in politics. He became the Attorney-General when he was still in his thirties. Indeed, that was my next contact with him. On my first circuit in New Guinea I went to the western southern highlands with the then Attorney-General when he was looking at the administration of justice in that territory. He went on to be the Minister for Immigration, heading a department in which he had served in a relatively junior capacity in Australia and Rome. He later became Minister for Labour and National Service and ultimately became the Treasurer in the McMahon Government. He was the Leader of the House, the Deputy Leader of his Party and, ultimately, the Leader of the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition after the 1972 election. </PARA>
<PARA> His was a very distinguished career. He was a man who is much remembered for being friendly and personable. He was the Leader of my Party when I came to this Parliament, and I must say that it was at that time that I formed the view that he had made a very great contribution to the Liberal Party. The defeat of the Party in 1972 was fairly demoralising after a very long period in government. As a member of the organisation, I saw the way he set about rebuilding the fortunes of the Liberal Party, involving not just the parliamentary Party but the Party organisation around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I agree with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) that Sir Billy's career was very appropriately capped by his distinguished period as the Speaker of the House, I think he made two major contributions. One was his contribution as Speaker and the other was his contribution to the restoration of the fortunes of the Liberal Party. He was, some thought-indeed, many thought-very unlucky not to win the 1974 election. He went within a hair's breadth of becoming the Prime Minister of this country. As history shows, he lost the leadership of his Party in 1975 to a challenge by Malcolm Fraser. It was my belief at that time, and it remains my belief, that Malcolm Fraser took over a party which was in very much better shape than it had been when Bill Snedden assumed the leadership of it in late 1972, and I believe that Bill Snedden was a substantial contributor to the restoration of the Liberal Government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree, however, with the Leader of the Government that, in his accession to the speakership in 1976, Sir Billy Snedden's career found a particularly apt crowning. I often used to think, Mr President, that there was a parallel between Douglas McClelland and Bill Snedden in that each served as Ministers, although Doug McClelland I think in only one portfolio and for a briefer time. I thought that they both shared the distinction of being very well suited by both political background and temperament to the Presiding Officer's position. I, whilst not being able to see at first hand the work of the Speaker, heard nothing but good reports about Bill Snedden's capacity to defuse difficult situations with his humour, and I think that the job that he was able to do as Speaker was the result of his very wide political experience and his very great human experience. </PARA>
<PARA> I deeply regret his death. My last conversation with him in Sydney was in terms of the dinner we would shortly share in Melbourne. I know that right around Australia his many friends grieve his death. I remember his two great political contributions with very great respect, and I hope that the memory of his contribution to Australian politics will be a consolation to his family on their losing him. On behalf of the Opposition I express our sympathy to them. Bill Snedden was our friend as well as our political colleague and we very much regret his death. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats I would like to support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). Sir Billy Snedden's untimely death not only brought great personal sadness to the many people who knew and admired him but also was a great loss to the country he served so untiringly. His public and parliamentary career showed quite clearly how his many talents were utilised to the benefit of Australia. From the time he first entered parliament in 1955 he was obviously a man destined for higher office, and that promise was realised in the offices he held later in his career. His ministerial appointments included Attorney-General, Minister for Immigration, Minister for Labour and National Service and Treasurer, and in all of these he acquitted himself with great distinction and ability. His service on committees and his representation of his country at a wide range of international conferences also revealed a man with broad interests and a firm commitment to the concerns of ordinary Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Chaney has already indicated, Sir Billy, of course, came from a relatively humble background, and it speaks volumes for his character that he never forgot ordinary people when his own career advanced so rapidly. I suggest it is a pity that more people in this place do not take after Sir Billy in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> That advancement led him to the leadership of his own Party at a time, again as Senator Chaney mentioned, of some considerable difficulty for that Party. His conciliatory approach and ability to bring people together did a great deal to heal the breaches that had developed. I have no doubt that members of the Liberal Party of Australia recognise and acknowledge the very significant debt they owe him for this. </PARA>
<PARA> Personally, of course, Sir Billy was an amiable, charming man with extensive interests outside the Parliament. His close links with ethnic communities around Australia went back to his service as an immigration officer during the 1950s and he maintained those links throughout his life. He was particularly close to the Italian community and was a fluent speaker of the Italian language. Another great passion of his, of course, was the Melbourne Football Club and it brought him enormous pleasure when he became its chairman. Shortly after Sir Billy's death-indeed, on the night before his funeral-I had the privilege of meeting some of his old friends from the club at a restaurant in Melbourne. Ross Mitchell, Stuart Spencer and Geoff Case were among a group dining at Masani's, which I understand was one of Sir Billy's favourite restaurants. They asked me to join them in their farewell to Sir Billy. The strength of feeling at that gathering was a moving testimony to Sir Billy's capacity for friendship in all spheres of life. I was enormously touched to have been made a part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honours heaped on Sir Billy during his lifetime gave some indication of the debt we owe him: a member of her Majesty's Privy Council; a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George; and, finally, his election as Speaker of the House of Representatives. To this latter role he brought dignity and an eloquent argument for its independence. He served in it with great distinction and was deservedly admired on both sides of the House. His death was a great loss both to his many friends and to this country. I would like to join other speakers in extending the Australian Democrats' deep sympathy to his widow Joy-Lady Snedden-and his children. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LJ4">Senator STONE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the National Party of Australia)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). Bill Snedden was a Western Australian, as I was originally. I first knew him at the University of Western Australia when I became, as he did, a member of the council of the Guild of Undergraduates at that university, an institution which I think is normally known on this side of the continent as the student representative council. He was already involved at that stage, as I was not, in student politics. As Senator Chaney has said, he went on at a very early age to involve himself in real politics. After leaving the university he became an officer of the Department of Immigration and was a selection officer for three years in, I think, Rome and London before returning to Australia where he took up residence in Melbourne and, like some others, became a member of parliament for an electorate outside his birth place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He rose steadily in the ranks of the Liberal Party of Australia. He became Attorney-General in 1963 or thereabouts at the relatively young age of 36. After that he served for a time as Minister for Immigration and, of course, then also served as Minister for Labour and National Service. In March 1971, when Mr Gorton lost the leadership of his party and the prime ministership, the leadership of the Liberal Party was contested by Bill Snedden. I think it is interesting to reflect upon the rather different course that Australian politics might have taken had he been successful in that election for the leadership of the Liberal Party which, Mr President, you will recall was won by Mr McMahon. He became, in default of gaining the leadership and the prime ministership, Treasurer, and in that capacity I first worked for him as an official in the Treasury for nearly two years. </PARA>
<PARA> I have several personal memories of that period. I remember accompanying him on a trip to London in the course of which I committed an indiscretion-I will not bore the Senate with the details of it-which was of some embarrassment to Bill Snedden. After properly reprimanding me he forgave me entirely and it was a tribute to his capacity as a human being and as a man that he behaved in that way to one of his officials at the time. I was also privileged to get off an aircraft with him in London a few months later. We were met, as Ministers are in those circumstances, as you know, Mr President, by the protocol people from the Foreign Office, who handed him a letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer informing him that he had been appointed to the Privy Council-an appointment of which he was very proud. </PARA>
<PARA> He brought down only two Budgets, which is somewhat more than some of his successors, and after the defeat of the Liberal Party in 1972 he became, as has been said, leader of that party for just over two years. He became Speaker of the House of Representatives and was knighted in 1978. In later years he was, I am sorry to say, estranged from his wife, Joy, a fine woman, to whom I offer my sincere condolences. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not be appropriate to conclude these remarks without referring to Bill Snedden's great love for the Melbourne Football Club. This has already been mentioned, particularly by Senator Haines. It is a shame that he died before seeing his team first of all make its way into the final five and then play so superbly, both against North Melbourne and then last Saturday against the Sydney Swans. Had Bill Snedden seen those two games he would have died happy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to be associated with this condolence motion for a great friend, Sir Billy Mackie Snedden. He was a unique man in many respects. He was the first Leader of the Liberal Party to become Speaker of the House. As Leader of the Liberal Party, Bill Snedden was the first to really recognise the importance of Tasmania. He was the first leader on either side of politics to appoint a shadow Minister for Tasmania, recognising our special difficulties and our unique position in the Commonwealth. He deliberately visited Tasmania on many occasions not only for official events but also to gauge the views of the man in the street. It was this common touch which characterised Sir Billy throughout his career in public life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He rose from very humble beginnings in Western Australia to become a prominent Queen's Counsel, a knight of the realm and a Speaker who was recognised by the Times of London as one of the best the British Commonwealth has ever seen. Billy Snedden was elected to the seat of Bruce in 1955 and was re-elected 11 times. It is significant that he retired from Parliament of his own choice: such was his popular regard in his electorate. He was a man who was truly popular on both sides of the House and will be greatly missed. It is significant that he chose liberalism in which to make his career despite the fact that some believed his origins dictated otherwise. This showed that the Menzies philosophy of the Liberal Party as a party for all with ability was well-founded. This illustrated his distinguished career not only in the Parliament but also in the law and, after his retirement, in the world of business. He was a great parliamentarian and a great man and I personally will miss him. </PARA>

I seem to recall that I first met Billy Snedden when we on the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions had discussions with him when he was Minister for Labour and National Service. I think that was about 1969. I did not really get to know Bill Snedden very well until I came to the Parliament and when he became the Speaker of the House of Representatives. He chaired quite a number of meetings of committees of which I was a member or at which I was present for some reason. I was most impressed with the fair attitude that he displayed at those meetings. One aspect of his career which has not been emphasised to a great extent in speeches on this condolence motion was the necessary work that he did, with fellow parliamentarians, on behalf of this Parliament and of parliamentary institutions throughout the world.

Of course, I knew of him for many years before I actually met him. In 1974 I was late in being sworn into the Parliament. The Parliament was already sitting by the time I got here. He was Leader of the Opposition and so he was the first person to welcome me to Parliament House. He was most civil, accommodating and considerate in doing so, and I have never forgotten it. He was a lone figure sitting at the top table in the joint party room and I remember noticing that he had one of the nicest fountain pens I had ever seen in my life, so I knew immediately that he was a man of discernment.</PARA></TALK.START>

He always seemed to get better when I looked after him. He became one of the dynamic members of our parliamentary tennis team-a game which he enjoyed as I do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Billy seemed to come from a more genteel age of courtesy, kindness and consideration. He always acted with a sense of fair play and he seemed to expect it in return, which is probably not one of the best attributes to have in this Parliament. When he did become disillusioned it seemed to sit fairly easily on his shoulders. I served under him on many parliamentary committees. He was always most competent, erudite and politically aware of a lot of things. I am sure committee members were happy to learn from his vast experience, particularly in foreign affairs but also on the Joint House Committee where he was a great instructor for us. </PARA>
<PARA> As has already been said, he acquitted himself very well as Speaker of the House. He acquitted Australia equally well, particularly in the international forums of presiding officers of the parliaments. He made tremendous contributions which have been recorded in the magazine The Parliamentarian. I recommend those articles to all honourable senators to read. I know that they have been matters for consideration in debates on parliamentary procedures in nearly all the Western democracies. Of course, he made some pioneering contributions to the issue of the broadcasting and televising of parliament. These contributions are currently being considered within this Parliament. He was a gentleman of great talent. I am honoured and proud to have known him and I am sure that all honourable senators will wish to express their feeling of sympathy for his relatives. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to support the motion of condolence moved by the Government. The qualities that I most remember about Sir Billy Mackie Snedden are his sincerity, his kindness and, of course, his good humour. These qualities endeared him to a great number of Australians and, particularly, Western Australians. In particular he holds a special place in the memories of different generations of Young Liberals. In a crucial period in Liberal Party history, in 1949-50, Sir Billy Snedden was President of the Young Liberal Movement in Western Australia. He was not only an active and very successful President in the division at that time, but also a campaigner of courage and absolute tenacity. As we have heard already this afternoon, in 1948 he fought a by-election in the Australian Labor Party stronghold of Boulder in the goldfields, a seat where Labor had seldom been challenged, but it took Billy Mackie Snedden to take on that seat. In the 1949 Federal election he carried the Liberal banner in Fremantle and gained a solid 43 per cent of the vote against Mr Kim Beazley Sr.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the following election in 1951 he failed to win the seat of Perth by only 114 votes after a very hard fought campaign, and by a narrow chance of history he failed to establish a parliamentary career in his State of origin; but I must admit that he never neglected Western Australia. As a Young Liberal branch President and later as State President in Western Australia during the 1970s, I can never forget the encouragement that Sir Billy gave the Young Liberal Movement. He was never too busy to attend State conventions and generally offer his assistance to the up and coming Liberals of tomorrow. During this time he was serving as a distinguished Speaker in the House of Representatives. He had that gift of compelling respect, without displaying arrogance, both inside and outside the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australians remember Sir Billy as the last Party Leader to address a meeting in Forrest Place in 1974, before it was closed as a political forum. He was unlucky not to become Prime Minister and Australians were also unlucky that he never had the opportunity to bring his very special qualities to that office. Sir Billy, as we have heard already, was the member for Bruce in Victoria, from the creation of the seat in 1955 until his retirement in 1983, but it was never a Liberal stronghold. I think to his credit he was a very conscientious campaigner for the more marginal seats throughout Australia, even at times when opinion polls and pundits were saying that he would be lucky to hold on to his own seat. His loyalty to the cause which he had embraced as a young man never faded after his loss of the Party leadership, and in this also he provided a very fine example to members of his Party and, I believe, to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Cynics may say that decency and humanity are a discount in politics. The respect in which we hold Sir Billy Snedden proves them absolutely wrong. I extend my sympathy to all his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sir Billy Snedden was a unique and special friend of the Northern Territory. I shared his friendship as a politician and I know that many other Territorians in many walks of life, from politics through to industry, also shared his support and encouragement. Sir Billy Snedden was also a great supporter of the Northern Territory's march forward for self-government. In many capacities he encouraged and supported many in the long fight that the Northern Territory has taken to advance its own causes in the political arena. He gave particular support to self-government and indeed followed that up as Speaker in a great way in the early years.
