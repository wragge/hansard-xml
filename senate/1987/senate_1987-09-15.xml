<TITLE>Australia Card Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned are deeply concerned at the impact of the proposed Australia Card legislation on the following grounds:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. We believe that it represents potentially undesirable interference in the lives of honest Australians and is a grave interference in the civil liberties of Australian citizens;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That it will not address the problems of tax evasion and social security fraud;</PARA>

<PARA> (2) That this form of national and compulsory identification will be intrusive and authoritarian, and alien to the Australian way of life.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. That the Bill of Rights will have the power to override and negate our Common Law within five years of its enactment.</PARA>

<TITLE>Queensland State Elections</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Honourable members of the Senate assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned in the State of Queensland showeth that the electoral system in Queensland, based on a 4 zonal weighted system, is an affront to democracy. The National Party under the leadership of Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen is always returned to Government with no opportunity for the voting public to bring about a change.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners point out that under the Queensland voting system the National Party at the State Elections on 1 November 1986 managed to achieve 55 per cent of the seats with only 39 per cent of the votes. This demonstrates that 61 per cent of Queenslanders do not want a National Party Government yet received one.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore earnestly pray that the Federal Government legislates as a matter of urgency to bring about a democratic system of voting in Queensland State elections based on the principle of one vote one value.</PARA>

<TITLE>Superannuation Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we consider the 2% discounting of Commonwealth Occupational Superannuation Scheme pension adjustments on 10 Oct 86 to be a serious breach of trust by the Government. The Commonwealth has reneged on an established commitment as incorporated in Commonwealth legislation and benefit promise pensions are not being paid in full. In particular we resent the long-term effect of the discounting. The pension loss is compounded throughout the life of a pensioner and surviving dependants-into the 21st century for many. We consider this Government-induced penalty to be out of all proportion to the short-term ``extraordinary circumstances of the economy'' given as the reason for the discounting.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should urge the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. limit the pension discounting effect of the Superannuation and Other Benefits Legislation Amendment Act 1986 to the period 10 Oct 86 to 1 Jul 87 so that pensions are restored to the 9 Oct 86 level as a base for the 1987 pension adjustment; and</PARA>

<PARA> That the May Economic Statement contained changes in Duty Free Passenger Concessions governing duty free entitlements for Australian Citizens arriving from overseas so that all goods up to a value of $400 may be brought in duty and tax free. In addition to this concession, duty free entry will be allowed for all clothing (other than furs) for the personal use of travellers. Existing separate limits on tobacco and alcohol will remain unchanged. The general limit on goods imported duty free by passengers under the age of 18 years will be set at $200. These revised passenger concession arrangements will commence from 1 July 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners request that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should rigorously defend the rights of more than 1.25 million Australian citizens arriving from overseas each year and expeditiously seek to amend the Duty Free Passenger concession to $1000 which represents the recommendation of the 1986 Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into passenger concessions. Such an amendment would equitably restore the purchasing power of Australian Citizens, discourage unlawful importation of goods and contemporaneously facilitate more efficient processing of passengers arriving in Australia by Customs Officers, all of which were recognised by the Industries Assistance Commission at the conclusion of its exhaustive inquiry and which formed the basis of the $1000 limit proposed to the Federal Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA> If, there is to be legal process against alleged war criminals resident in Australia, the foundations of justice should be clear and equitable.</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Let the term, ``war crime'', be first clearly defined.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Let specific prosecutions be swiftly launched against those individuals alleged to have committed them, thus releasing the rest of their co-nationals from unwarranted slur and suspicion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to make a statement on administrative arrangements and to move a motion relating to the statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the recent general election at which the Government was returned for a third term of office, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced a range of significant changes to the structure of the Ministry and of government departments. The Parliament will shortly consider the legislation which gives effect to or flows from aspects of these changes. For the information of the Senate I wish today to outline the overall intent of the changes and their impact, including ways they may be reflected in the operations of the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since our first election in 1983 this Government has consistently developed policies to reconstruct our economy so that it can meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world trading environment. It is not simply a task for our trade-exposed sectors such as agriculture, mining or increasingly manufacturing and tourism. It is a task for the whole economy, because all sectors can suffer if one is inefficient. In applying measures to deal with the responsible reconstruction of the economy, we are determined to apply the same rigour to the Government's own household. </PARA>
<PARA>Ministerial and Administrative Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that early in its life, this Government embarked upon a program of reform of public sector administration. In pursuing a sound administrative basis for the development of its policies, the Government has addressed fundamental issues and implemented far-reaching reform measures. The reforms were given legislative basis in the 1984 Public Service reform package, and have been augmented progressively by Budget reforms, the 1986 streamlining measures and, perhaps most importantly, the arrangements announced last July by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been concerned with two basic objectives: to enhance ministerial control over the Public Service and to give to departmental managers more responsibility for day to day management. By establishing mechanisms for greater ministerial control, we have been intent upon increasing the responsiveness of the bureaucracy to the Government's wishes and upon increasing democratic accountability, through Ministers, to Parliament and the community. The second of the objectives, greater responsibility for departmental management, has entailed the devolution of management functions from central agencies to individual departments and a new emphasis on the development of management skills in senior public servants. With greater freedom to manage, departments are in a better position to demonstrate their success in achieving the dual aims of increased efficiency and financial savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's previous reform measures have resulted in considerable progress towards the achievement of our objectives. The revamping of Budget processes has given Ministers more direct involvement in the way resources are used within their portfolios. The introduction of program and staff budgeting has allowed the Government to tighten up resource allocation, while giving to secretaries and other departmental managers greater freedom and responsibility in applying resources to the implementation of Government policies. The major package of measures announced by the Prime Minister last year resulted in an important streamlining of personnel management practices. </PARA>
<PARA> With this experience behind us, the Prime Minister decided after the Government's re-election to proceed further along the path of administrative reform. The administrative arrangements approved by the Governor-General in Council on 24 July represented perhaps the most far-reaching reshaping of the Federal machinery of government and of public administration in our history. The number of departments has been reduced from 28 to 18, providing scope for savings through economies of scale and the removal of overlap and duplication across many areas of hitherto separate bureaucratic units. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide for enhanced ministerial control over the new range of departments, any of which are significantly enlarged, the Prime Minister decided, following receipt of an opinion from the Solicitor-General, that it was time we adopted a two-level ministerial structure and increased the number of Ministers. Under the new arrangements, the burden of administering department is shared, and portfolio Ministers are released from some detailed administrative work, enabling them to give greater attention to strategic directions of policy and priorities. All portfolios are represented in Cabinet without the need for Cabinet to be expanded to an unmanageable size. I am pleased to report that these arrangements have been in place now for seven weeks and are working well. </PARA>
<PARA> Portfolio Ministers are ultimately responsible for the administration of their entire portfolios and will be accountable to the Parliament for the overall operation of their portfolios. All Ministers, however, have a clear accountability within specific responsibilities allocated to them. This accountability includes responding to questions without notice in the Parliament. The Prime Minister announced the allocation of responsibilities on 11 August, but for the information of the Senate, Mr President, and as a guide to honourable senators in the direction of questions, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list showing the division of functions. </PARA>

<PARA> Within the portfolios not covered in the above list, other Minister have not been appointed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Within their areas of responsibility all Ministers will be available to answer questions in the Parliament, and will, of course, take an active role in the legislative process. Within the Parliament, the changes will bring a number of benefits. The combination of the additional Ministers, and of portfolio Ministers having a wider spectrum of responsibility across major sectors of government activity, means that Ministers will be placed in a better position to be responsive to the Parliament. This will apply particularly in the Senate, where The number of Senate Ministers will have been increased from six to eight, after Parliament enacts the relevant legislation, thus augmenting the capacity of the Government to respond to the concerns in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should add that, in the meantime, pending the amendment of the Ministers of State Act to permit the appointment of 30 Ministers, there are three Parliamentary Secretaries, two of whom are in the Senate. It is intended that the people holding these positions will be sworn as Ministers as soon as possible. Until that time, as they are not Ministers, they will not answer questions without notice, carry legislation or perform chamber duty. </PARA>
<PARA> In allocating functions among departments we have been able to provide for improved co-ordination and broader perspectives within portfolios. We have increased our capacity for imposing functional and strategic directions on government activity in the major areas of economic reform on which Australia's response to the challenges of a highly competitive international environment depends. The new arrangements allow for greater speed and consistency in the delivery of services and advice to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of the Public Service Board takes its place in this package of reforms designed to eliminate duplication of functions and as a further step in the process of increasing departmental responsibilities. All operational aspects of personnel matters are now to be devolved to departments. A new office of Public Service Commissioner will have responsibility for the policy aspects of recruitment, promotion, mobility, discipline and retirement, and for monitoring continuing progress in relation to equal employment opportunity. A part time Public Service Management Advisory Board will advise the Government on significant issues relating to the management of the Public Service. Public Service pay and conditions matters are to be transferred from the Board to the Department of Industrial Relations; and some aspects of classification issues have been transferred to the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> The services of Mr David Block, of which the Government has been most appreciative, will continue to be available to the Prime Minister and the Government. His unit, now called the Administrative Reform Unit, is currently overseeing the preparation of reports on matters such as the possible integration of Social Security and Commonwealth Employment Service local offices, the use of the Department of Social Security as a payment agency, a single foreign service and the future of the National Capital Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The task the Government has set itself in this area is wide-ranging and ongoing. To ensure that it receives proper co-operation and sustained momentum a special committee of the Cabinet has been set up, under the chairmanship of Ralph Willis, specifically to address Public Service Reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised ministerial and administrative arrangements which I have summarised today are an important part of the Government's strategy of concentrating on its policy priorities while working within a streamlined structure which reflects both the need for financial restraint and the importance of responsiveness and effectiveness. I believe that the arrangements will provide a sound basis from which to undertake the tasks of meeting the present and future policy needs of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact that there is a division of responsibility. A document headed, `Division of responsibilities within Portfolios', has been appended to the document distributed to honourable senators. That document has been incorporated in Hansard. I move:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some two days before the last Federal election Mr John Ridley, the then Director of the Victorian Branch of the Liberal Party of Australia, did make some allegations referring to the electorate of Aston in which he said that one elector received an Australian Labor Party how to vote card within that person's postal ballot papers. I might say that, from my experience of elections, I have never known a campaign to go by in which some similar allegation has not come to my attention or someone else's attention. Quite simply, what normally happens is that political parties distribute how to vote cards by mail or by letter-boxing. People pick up their postal ballot papers with the rest of the material and get them mixed up in that process. Mr President, I ask you: What sort of genius would it take to put a mole in the Electoral Commission to put only one how to vote card in one set of postal ballot papers in a seat that needed 6 per cent of the vote to lose. What sort of a genius in politics would it take to work out that scheme?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Electoral Commission, on the day that those allegations were made, investigated the claims. It took statements from everyone working in the Aston electoral office and it found there was absolutely no case to answer. The southern division of the Australian Federal Police also investigated that incident and also found that there was no case to answer. I might point out that in that electorate Mr Saunderson, the Labor Party candidate, posted his how to vote cards to every elector rather than letter boxing them. This allegation got a lot of publicity. The main reason it got publicity was, I think, the inexperience of certain journalists. Those of us who are heavily involved in politics know that this sort of accusation comes out at every election. Indeed, the same allegation was made just some months before in respect of the Central Highlands by-election in Victoria. That allegation was investigated by police and the same conclusion was reached as was reached in the Aston case-that is, that there was a misunderstanding by the recipient of the postal ballot papers and that there was no wrong-doing by the Electoral Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this note: I know that in the heat of campaigning people think that by throwing out some wild allegation they will get some political gain. We have all done that, but the unfortunate thing in this case is that honourable senators opposite are denigrating people who are working for the Electoral Commission and who basically cannot defend themselves. I think the Australian Electoral Commission has always had a reputation for impartiality. Having impugned it for cheap political opportunism, it is no wonder that Mr Ridley had to resign some weeks after the election.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Does the Minister agree that, for the purposes of assessing the effects of the Treasurer's Budget this evening on the financial markets and the economy, it is the borrowing requirement which that Budget will impose upon them which is fundamental? Does he further agree that that borrowing requirement is represented by the sum of whatever so-called deficit will appear in the Budget, plus any proceeds from sales of Government assets which have been credited to the receipts for the purpose of arriving at that deficit?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Stone would know very well, the public sector borrowing requirement is something that has a precise definition, and borrowing money to buy assets from the Government is not recorded as part of the PSBR. The question of the sale of assets and the Budget deficit has always been acknowledged by the Treasurer-very explicitly-by me, by the Prime Minister and by various other people. Indeed, the $1,000m worth of assets sales announced in the May statement were very clearly and separately identified as such. I happened to read the `policy speech', I suppose one could call it, that was presented by the Queensland Premier. I recognised the literary style in which it was written. It certainly was not the literary style of the Queensland Premier; it was written by someone who is obviously highly literate, which the Queensland Premier's greatest admirers would not accuse him of being. In that document I noticed that even after taking into account the sale of assets-that is, taking the sale of assets and the proposed tax and deficit policy presented in that document-there was still a $1 billion deficit. In other words, there was a $2 billion deficit if the assets sales proposed in it had not been subtracted, or a $1 billion deficit remaining even after that happened. From that I assume that the Queensland Premier and those who are associated with him regard a Commonwealth Budget deficit of $1 billion, after subtracting from that deficit any proceeds from assets sales, as appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for the Environment and the Arts. Is it true, as the Queensland Premier has alleged, that the Federal Government is nominating the unique wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland for world heritage listing only so that the hippy mates of the Australian Labor Party can continue growing marihuana plantations? Given these allegations and others by the Queensland Government about world heritage listing, is the Federal Government negotiating with the Queensland Government about a joint management authority and plan for the area and about re-employment of and compensation for workers affected by world heritage listing?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Morris for his question. It certainly is true that the Premier of Queensland has insisted that the nomination of the wet tropics for world heritage listing is being done to set aside `the greatest plantation area for the whole of Australia and a big part of the world to grow marihuana'. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The forests will become completely infested with all the hippies and all the drug growers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I might say that that is not the purpose of the world heritage listing of these rainforests. On the purpose of the world heritage listing of these forests, I can quote no better person than Senator Puplick, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . they are unique, they are of international significance; they contain one of the greatest and scientifically most significant concentrations of unique flora and fauna in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Puplick was certainly right on that, if not on much else; he did get that right. But there is a problem between Senator Puplick and the National Party of Australia on this issue and I will allow them to sort that out over time.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the second part of Senator Morris's question is probably more important. That concerns what we are going to do for the people of northern Queensland who may be affected by the Government's decision to apply for world heritage listing. The setting up of a management authority with the State Government, as has been done in South West Tasmania and the Great Barrier Reef adjacent to this world heritage listing area, is exactly what this Government has in mind. The difficulty is, of course, that the Premier of Queensland will not talk to us. Not only will he not talk to us; he is making sure that nobody else can either, by threatening councils and the industry. That makes our task very difficult. If in the end we are to help the people of north Queensland and make sure that there is a transition period from one industry activity into another-that is what will happen in that area; the vast majority of those with jobs in the industry can be re-employed-we need to talk to the Queensland Government. I have no doubt that that will happen, and I might say that, in spite of some claims by the Queensland Premier, it is already happening.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Premier said in the Brisbane Telegraph only a few days ago, `There wouldn't be a man in my Department who would dare to say one single thing without my authority', I have to report that there have been discussions between officials of the Queensland Premier's Department and officials of my own Department. They took place several weeks ago. We are led to believe that they took place with the full knowledge of the Queensland Premier and that further discussions will take place. I have no doubt that that will be the case. But the reality is that while on the one hand the Queensland Premier bludgeons local government, bludgeons the industry and bludgeons free workers into trying not to talk to the national Government, he then does so himself. Perhaps that is a question the people of north Queensland might start asking.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware of the statement made on Sunday, 13 September, on Channel 10's Business Week program by the Chairman of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, Brian Loton, that BHP is to be listed on more foreign stock exchanges and that the Chairman has no objection to foreign residents owning 40 per cent of BHP shares? In view of this statement, is the Government concerned about the possibility that foreign interests may gain considerable influence or effective control of a company whose activities impact heavily on employment and production in Australia? If BHP's international competitors do gain substantial ownership of the Big Australian, will that not limit BHP's capacity to compete in export markets, and to undertake research and development in Australia to make BHP more efficient and competitive? Would the Government therefore be prepared to take action to prevent foreign ownership of BHP reaching 40 per cent, or anything like that figure?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear Mr Loton say that, nor have I read it anywhere. I knew nothing about it until Senator Haines mentioned it in her question. I shall see what the Treasurer has to say about the other questions asked, but I would make this point: Concern has been expressed by a number of people, particularly by the sorts of people with whom Senator Haines normally associates, about cash borrowings overseas by Australians for share purchase, or investment or for whatever purpose. Fashions and fads change over time. Through the 1960s and most of the 1970s the conventional wisdom was that governments should impose limits on foreign equity holdings in Australian business, which was a policy that inevitably pushed new mining developments in particular into a situation of high gearing, based on borrowings abroad, usually from foreign banks. That was seen to be the popular, trendy thing to do at that time. Ironically, when gearing, again often based on borrowings from abroad, appeared to increase in recent years, the same people were very concerned about the happening and said that something should be done to stop it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish that such people who comment about these matters would at least make up their minds whether they are for or against gearing. They supported policies in the 1960s and 1970s which put many businesses in the situation where they had no alternative but to become heavily geared, and then when some other company does so in the 1980s they are opposed to that as well. I will refer the other questions to the Treasurer to see whether he has any comments to make.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did hear Mr Moore this morning shortly after AM on 2CN. I do not have a transcript of the program, but essentially he was saying that welfare spending should be very substantially reduced, that there were too many spongers, freeloaders and double dippers around the place and that it was about time that their activities were curbed. Mr Moore, according to a report in the Australian newspaper of 6 January, had resigned from the Treasury. I do not think that is entirely true. I think that he had retired since he had attained the age of 55 years just before that. The Australian also reported:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Heritage Foundation where Mr Moore worked while in the US has just published an article by him called `Kangaroo Economics'.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether Mr Moore did work for the Heritage Foundation in the United States, but if he did he did so while he was also being paid by the Australian taxpayer. I doubt that he was formally working for the Heritage Foundation although I understand that he wrote an article called `Kangaroo Economics' which that organisation published.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Moore left Australia on 27 August 1986 to begin a senior executive fellowship-that is, a training scheme financed by the taxpayers and administered at that time by the Public Service Board in which senior public servants undertake overseas visits of up to three months duration in order to pursue projects of interest to their departments and to the Public Service. Mr Moore began such a fellowship on 27 August 1986 and returned to duty in the Treasury on 5 January 1987, the day before it was reported in the Australian that he had resigned. As I said before, I think that report was not strictly correct; I think that he retired rather than resigned. However, the day that he resumed his duties at the Treasury he either terminated his employment there or gave notice of the impending termination of it.</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to leaving Australia, Mr Moore, like all fellowship applicants, signed an undertaking that he accepted `the need for a continuing commitment to the Service'. He also signed an undertaking that he would `expect to remain in the Service for at least three years after the completion of the fellowship'. He then spent a total of almost five months overseas as can be seen from the figures I have given, three months on the fellowship which cost the Australian taxpayers about $30,000. Notwithstanding the undertakings he had signed he promptly resigned-or retired-on the day that he got back to Australia. If Mr Moore wants to say much more about double dipping, sponging and freeloading, I suggest that he clean up his own nest before he starts looking into somebody else's.</PARA>

It seems to me that the only way that the Commonwealth could take action for recovery would be by special legislation. But that would not go through the Senate because there are too many friends of the spongers and freeloaders in the Senate for such legislation to get through. Alternatively, there is the remote possibility of some civil action being taken to recover the money on the grounds that Mr Moore signed a false declaration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been reported in today's Courier-Mail that the Taxation Office did in fact issue a Supreme Court injunction against a Licensing Branch officer, one Jack Reginald Herbert, claiming unpaid taxes of more than $800,000. The report went on to say that in the application of the Commissioner of Taxation to have Herbert's four Westpac bank accounts frozen, the Commissioner estimated that Herbert had received protection money averaging $120,000 a year for five years. I note, and I ask the Senate to note, the reference to the four Westpac accounts that Mr Herbert had, and to note also that operating multiple bank accounts in the knowledge that some would not be all that easy to trace, particularly if they were in different names, is a device that has been used by various crooks for a very long time. I hope that that lesson will actually be acknowledged or received by the Opposition, although I am not optimistic about that. I do not know whether the Tax Commissioner has knowledge of people other than former Inspector Herbert having evaded tax or not having declared income received, even income received illegally, but I think I can confidently give Senator Colston an assurance that if or when the Fitzgerald inquiry manages to trace that money to its final recipients, if there is a tax liability, those people who have evaded tax will be relentlessly pursued by the Commissioner. It would, of course, be very much easier for the Tax Commissioner to do that if there was an effective identity system through which such movements of cash obtained illegally, or funds legally obtained upon which tax had been evaded-either or both of those forms of antisocial or criminal activity-could be stamped out. The Tax Commissioner would find it very much easier to do that if there was an effective identity system such as the Australia Card.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not about to get anything; he is about to get it. I am not like other senators who have time to read their own speeches all the time, particularly in the middle of Question Time. A number of factors impinge on investment decisions. If Senator Lewis is a more avid reader of my speeches than I am, he will see that I have drawn attention to many of those factors over a considerable period. I have particularly drawn attention to the fact that a wide range of factors such as interest rates, wage rates and anticipated wage rates are very relevant to investment intentions, not just the level of the Australian dollar against either the United States dollar or the trade weighted index. A whole range of other factors are relevant to investment intentions, particularly I believe for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not in any way resile from the fact that I believe that I said on a number of occasions during last year that my anticipation was that the level of the dollar would remain for some period in the mid-sixties. A variety of circumstances have changed since then, particularly the fall of the United States dollar which is not relevant in a vast variety of circumstances in which companies are trading into other countries with other currencies. For contracts written in United States dollars it is, of course, a significant factor.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not familiar with the views of the Australian Manufacturers Export Council President which were expressed last week, but let me just say this: many manufacturers are of the view that they would prefer our dollar at about US70c or slightly less, and their anticipations of an increasing value for the Australian dollar relatively are the factors which concern them most, rather than the actual current value of the dollar.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator may have got me on some sort of debating point. But let me just make the observation that, in spite of the apparent aggregate unsatisfactory investment figures in manufacturing, anticipations are currently much beter than they were a quarter ago or six months ago. That is reflected in the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Metal Trades Industry Association surveys which were published last month. According to those surveys, the anticipations are better, and I believe that throughout significant sections of the manufacturing sector the actual performance is better than the aggregate figures currently reveal.</PARA>

<PARA>Address by Senator the Hon. J. B. Button, Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce at the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association Canberra International Motor Inn Monday 22 September 1986.</PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to be here at your annual dinner. With the finalisation of the heavy engineering industry package in June and the recent establishment of the Heavy Engineering Board (HEB) this is a very opportune time for me to explain and emphasise the Government's preferred approach to support for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> As you all are keenly aware the balance of payments deficit is placing a constraint on the growth potential of the Australian economy and on the living standards of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> The problem has its roots in our over dependence on the export of commodities-agricultural products and minerals. High inflation and low productivity growth over many years have sapped our competitiveness and resulted in the contraction of our industrial base.</PARA>
<PARA> The poor medium term prospects for our agricultural and mineral commodities exports means that manufacturing and services sectors must improve their performance significantly.</PARA>
<PARA> The depreciation of the Australian dollar to a level just above 60 cents to the US dollar has substantially restored Australia's international competitiveness and will provide major opportunities for import replacement and economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturers should be making their investment plans on the basis that the dollar will remain very close to its current levels and that the government will successfully influence the course of wage and price growth to preserve gains we have made in international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> The heavy engineering industry is in an excellent position to benefit from the dollar depreciation because 80 per cent of components and materials inputs can be sourced domestically. I am aware that a number of heavy engineering companies have found new export markets and many more are actively searching them out.</PARA>
<PARA> Whether the industry's potential is fully realised is going to depend on whether it is willing to make the necessary structural adjustments and attitudinal changes. The growing willingness to tackle undesirable work practices is a good start. We also have to acknowledge and use our undoubted engineering knowledge and skills rather than believing that we always have to rely on overseas expertise. We have to obtain that recognition from the wider community.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the government is establishing the right macroeconomic settings for industry. It is also attempting to get the microeconomic settings right as well and in a number of sectors including heavy engineering is taking on a role as a catalyst for and a facilitator of industry restructuring.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not the responsibility of any government if somebody puts on a work ban somewhere or if there is a dispute in the coal industry. Honourable senators opposite know that. If it is a question of government responsibility, honourable senators opposite have a lot to answer for because in their last year in government, 1982, this country had the worst record of industrial disputation for years. The figures for 1987 represent a 71 per cent drop on the figures recorded under the Fraser Government. I am surprised at these silly interjections which have provoked me to draw the Senate's attention to some unpalatable facts for the Opposition. The figures demonstrate how the great majority of employers, unions and employees have recognised their special responsibilities, imposed by difficult world economic conditions. They have been able to discharge those responsibilities due to the environment created by a government which has dedicated itself to improving this situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and, in a sense, follows the question he has just answered, asked by Senator Crowley. I ask the Minister: Is he aware that, in terms of the reduction in the number of industrial disputes which has occurred over recent years, there was a 55 per cent reduction in 1982, a 30 per cent reduction in 1983, during part of which, of course, the Fraser Government was still in office, a 0.8 per cent reduction in 1984, a 7.6 per cent reduction in 1985 and an increase of 6.5 per cent in 1986? I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact that the bulk of the substantial reduction in the number of industrial disputes, of which he is so proud, occurred during the period of the Fraser Government and is a reflection of the inter- national recession which affected this country? Is it not a fact that at the moment the largest single investment project in this country, the North West Shelf, is strikebound? Is it not a fact that our first or second largest export industry, the coal industry, is also strikebound? Is the Minister saying that none of that is the responsibility of his Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know where Senator Chaney gets those questions from. Sure, there was a reduction in industrial disputes in 1982; my God, there needed to be. How did the then Government attain that reduction in industrial disputes? It was by having the greatest number of Australians out of work since the Great Depression. That is how the Liberal Party did it when in government. That is how it reduced the number of industrial disputes in 1982. The gentleman creeping forward to the table, Senator Stone, was a principal adviser of the Government of the day. He saw to it that the greatest number of Australians since the Great Depression were unemployed in 1982. That is how that figure was brought about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I concede that in 1987 there are strikes in the coal industry. There are strikes on the North West Shelf. Most of those coal strikes relate to a major structural problem in the industry, as there was in the steel industry in 1982 which the Fraser Government walked away from and did nothing about. As has happened with the coal industry before, Liberal governments have walked away from these issues. This Government has not. One can go around the country from time to time and find various industrial disputes taking place. That is inevitable. It is a question of what the government of the day does about them that is important in terms of allocating responsibility as Senator Chaney seeks to do by the last part of his question.</PARA>

I take the Minister's answer to be a concession that the major drop in industrial disputes did in fact occur in 1982 and 1983 because of the substantial level of unemployment which occurred in that year. Does the Minister also concede that that substantial unemployment flowed from excessive wage rises which were extorted from the system by the trade union movement in 1981 and 1982?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concede that in 1982 wage levels in this country were too high given the overall economic performance of the country over a number of years. Wage levels were too high, particularly in 1982 because the Prime Minister of the day in 1981 walked away and went to a royal wedding instead of dealing with the question of wages policy which confronted this country. There was no wages policy in this country in 1981 and 1982. Senator Chaney cannot claim to have succeeded in 1981, 1982, 1983 or 1987 for that matter in attaining a substantial, significant and ongoing reduction in real wages in this country as this Government can. He cannot claim that at any period of his Liberal Government a growth in employment as this Government can in the last four years. Senator Chaney can claim none of those things. If he seeks to make comparative claims about the performance of Liberal and Labor governments on these issues, none of those things are things Senator Chaney ought to boast about and, if I might give him a word of fatherly advice, they are not even things about which he ought to lead with his chin at Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, concerns the blighted State of Queensland. Is the Minister aware of the special arrangements for bread marketing which apply in Queensland?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In regard to the latter part of the question, I do not think that the Commonwealth Government would have any power to extend the laws that apply in Queensland to other States. It certainly would not have any inclination to do so because Queensland has some very special arrangements regarding the marketing of bread. In 1979 the Bread Industry Committee Act was passed, and in 1983 a new Bill had been drafted, in the words of the industry President, `to discipline some persons who threatened to destroy the benefits of the Act'. That Bill lapsed, but in October 1986 Mr J. G. Sheeron, MBE, in his presidential address, said that under the 1979 Act the industry had obtained regulations which would give the Committee the power to make determinations regarding the areas of distribution of bread manufacturers, the jurisdiction of the Committee in respect of disputes between the various sections of the bread industry and the giving of directions or advice by the Committee to the various sectors not to deliver or accept bread delivery. In other words, in Queensland the decisions about the people who may supply bread, where they may supply bread and to whom they may supply bread are made by a committee appointed pursuant to a statute of 1979 and to regulations. The statute was introduced, of course, because some bakers in country towns were members of the National Party of Australia. The National Party Government passed that legislation because those bakers did not like competition. Mr Sheeron also said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has already determined that activities by a major Brisbane manufacturer in Murgon, a small town near Kingaroy in the central Burnett area of the State, 230km north-west of Brisbane, should be curtailed.</PARA>
<PARA>For all those reasons I can assure Senator Cook that the Commonwealth Government would not be extending the Queensland law to the rest of the country even if it had the constitutional authority to do so. Indeed, the Commonwealth Government would hope that this sort of misuse of governmental power to protect private vested interests would cease in Queensland as well, and it would expect the legislation to be repealed. I think there is an excellent opportunity here for Senator Stone to demonstrate his intellectual domination of the National Party in Queensland-and to demonstrate that he is not just a mouthpiece for the latest flat tax fantasies-by getting the Queensland Government to repeal the legislation. If anybody could lead the Queensland National Party rednecks along the path of economic righteousness to a free market, I am sure Senator Stone could, and I wish him well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I preface it by saying that I realise that certain matters concerning the Coastwatch contract are before the Federal Court of Australia, and I in no way want to canvass any of those today. My question goes to an issue on which any senator who was here in the latter period of the Fraser Government would know the Minister considers himself something of an expert; that is, the principle of ministerial responsibility. I ask whether the Minister recalls the then responsible Minister, Senator Gietzelt, speaking on behalf of Mr Peter Morris, the then Minister for Transport, telling Senator Durack on 25 March this year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proper tendering processes were followed and the Minister had insisted upon the process.</PARA>
<PARA>and, later that day:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government did what it was logically required to do, that is, satisfy itself about the technical capacity of the lowest tenderer.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask further whether he recalls Senator Gietzelt chiding Senator Durack on 1 April for `continuing his line of questioning in respect of a matter that has been properly handled by the Minister'. Finally, I ask whether he recalls hearing Senator Gietzelt, responding to Senator Vanstone's urgency motion on 13 May, say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, through its committees, took every available opportunity to check out the bona fides and the competence with which the successful tenderer would be able to meet the Government's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Minister agree that Mr Morris was at all times aware of matters concerning the contract? Why has the man responsible for the Coastwatch fiasco not resigned as he obviously should do, consistent with interpretations of ministerial responsibility much narrower than those Senator Evans sought to apply to others in 1982?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question but that the broad guidelines that the Government lays down for the conduct of tendering processes were followed in this instance and there is no question of any impropriety or lack of probity in the operation of the tendering process in this instance-certainly not on the basis of any of the material that I have seen or that has been sighted by the senior officer whom I have had reviewing this whole vexed question on my behalf in recent weeks. What has become apparent, and what I have frankly admitted in public statements on this subject in recent days, is that there were deficiencies in the detailed administration of aspects of that tendering process. There were failures to fully secure an evidentiary foundation for some rather confident conclusions about managerial and technical competence that were communicated in the tender board's report and in other minutes and other material that was communicated to the Ministers of the time. Let me make it clear that Mr Morris was the Minister at all relevant times but he had no personal involvement in terms of any--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the vision in pink over there, Mr President, stopped haranguing me, I would be only too pleased to communicate my perception of this state of affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give one example of the kind of thing that was contained in the tender board's report which was on the desk of the Ministers concerned, or at least Mr Scholes, at the relevant time, before the contract was awarded. The contract was in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Aviation have given Amann and Gosner-</PARA>
<PARA>that was the chief pilot in question-</PARA>
<PARA>a clean bill of health, both as to proposed aircraft and technical competence.</PARA>
<PARA>It subsequently became clear well after the contract had been awarded that the particular clean bill of health that the Department of Aviation had given was nothing of the kind, that all that the Aviation officer who had been involved in a desultory fashion in this process had addressed himself to was the question of whether there was likely to be any difficulty in Amann Aviation securing an air service licence in due course without undue delay. There was never any particular question about that. What there was a question about, which subsequently came to light, was the level of aviation expertise that was available to the tenderer which did raise very serious questions as to whether or not it would be able to perform the contract or meet the contract obligations within the time available.</PARA>
<PARA> There are many matters of this kind, all of which are spelt out in my Press release of a couple of days ago, and all of which will be evident in the documents that I am very happy to make available. This has been the subject already of a freedom of information application and as soon as the necessary scrutiny has been done to apply FOI guidelines relating to commercial in-confidence and so on-that material will be made available in a matter of days-it will become perfectly apparent to anyone viewing this material that what occurred is as I have described it.</PARA>
<PARA> There were administrative failings within the tender evaluation process which were simply not apparent and could not have been apparent to the Ministers who were handling the matter in the way that they did. When the matters did come to light about the nature of these failings and when questions did arise in Ministers' minds as to whether or not the contract could or would be able to be satisfied, the difficulty confronting the Ministers and the Government was that there was no way at that stage that the contract could have been terminated. There were no contractual deadlines earlier than 12 September and it was not at all clear right up until 12 September that the contract, despite the considerations to which I have referred, would not be able to be honoured. That was the difficulty that was confronting people such as the Minister, Mr Morris, and Senator Gietzelt, representing him in this place, as they responded to questions over that period. The key statement was that made by Mr Morris in answer to a question without notice on 7 May when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The contract that has been let imposes obligations on the firm concerned. That firm has a responsibility to carry out its obligations. If that responsibility is not met, it will be dealt with at that time.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, the time has now come and the Government, as is now well known, has acted on the contract. There was nothing in any of the responses or any of the behaviour of any of the Ministers that were involved in this matter at any stage which is colourable in the way that the Opposition has sought to assert.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to that question, the short answer is that it is the Minister for Transport or the Acting Minister for Transport, as the case may have been at the relevant time, because the Department of Transport had the managerial conduct of the tendering process and the award of the tenders. The whole question of coastal surveillance is much complicated by the fact that a number of other Ministers have an involvement in it, including the former Special Minister of State through his responsibility for the Australian Federal Police which had responsibility for the general oversight of coastal surveillance, and so on. In terms of the managerial conduct of the tendering process, that is squarely the responsibility of the Department of Transport and the Minister for Transport or the Acting Minister for Transport.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary for Justice says this is nonsense knowing full well that at the moment he is in the position of being a full-scale political neuter. He can speak in this place but we cannot question him. We find that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), having read his history books, has found that 200 years ago the majority of people who were brought to the then colony of New South Wales were brought enslaved and numbered. He has thought it a good idea to bring the wheel full circle so that 200 years later the people of Australia will be numbered and will be put in relation to the bureaucracy in exactly the same sort of situation as they were two centuries ago. We know full well that the Government has a series of its own secret internal arrangements as far as this card is concerned. We know that there are documents being prepared for Cabinet indicating that this Government has a preference for introducing this legislation and getting it operative by 7 October this year, and if not by then certainly by the end of the year. We believe that the majority of members not only in the Senate but in the whole Australian community demand that there be a fuller, more open public debate and examination of the matters which are raised in terms of the threat to our civil liberties, the burden to be placed upon industry, commerce and the private sector and the failure of the Government to explain not only the purposes of this card but the cost effectiveness of it. For those reasons this motion should be supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know from the efforts of the Australian Privacy Foundation that there are documents floating around in the bureaucracy which expose what the Government really has in mind as far as this card is concerned. We know that that information is circulating within the bureaucracy. Despite Senator Ryan's attempts to deny that any of this material exists, we find the following report on the World Today program of 14 September:</PARA>
<PARA> An officer from the Health Insurance Commission has confirmed that at least one of the documents released by the Privacy Foundation was written by him. Ken Hazell, an assistant general manager responsible for the Australia Card, says he did write a discussion paper on recording changes to the data base. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hazell is indeed an interesting character as far as this debate is concerned, because he was one of the witnesses before the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card. I had the pleasure of asking him certain questions, and I shall read part of the transcript of that Joint Selection Committee report. I said to Mr Hazell:</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to direct a question to Mr Hazell, as the person who was responsible for the overseas visit. </PARA>
<PARA>Needless to say, there was an interdepartmental committee on the card and the IDC had to make a lengthy overseas visit. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Which countries did you visit which have legal systems based on British common law principles?</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hazell-Could you explain what you mean by that?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which common law countries did you visit as distinct from civil law countries?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hazell-I am afraid I do not understand what you mean?</PARA>
<PARA>So I explained to him the difference between civil and common law. Mr Hazell then went on:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the only one would be Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hazell continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In Europe we went to France and Belgium. Then we visited Israel, Hong Kong, the USA and Canada. Canada and the USA have very common systems but I am afraid the implication of your question is still lost on me. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the people responsible for putting together the regime to back up and enforce the Australia Card legislation. These people do not know the difference between common and civil law. They do not know the purport of having a common law system to protect our rights and liberties. Not only are they impervious to it but they do not even take it into consideration as they proceed with their plans. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of weeks public opinion on the Australia Card has shifted dramatically. It has shifted as the opportunity has presented itself to the Australian people to get a clearer understanding of what it is that this Government has in mind: a message that has been hidden from the people both by the Government and by the dereliction of duty on the part of the Australian media to put the facts before them. We know that in June of last year 65 per cent of Australians were allegedly in favour of the introduction of the card. We know that that number has now fallen to 39 per cent. The number against the card has almost doubled from 27 per cent to 50 per cent. The editorial writers who in October and November of last year were so in favour of all these wonderful new plans are going through a change of view. An article in the Australian Financial Review of 28 August, headed `The genuine problems with the Australia Card', concludes with these words:</PARA>
<PARA> It is simply obscene to use revenue arguments (``we can make more money out of the Australia Card'') as support for authoritarian impositions rather than take the road of broadening national freedoms. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney Morning Herald editorial of 7 September, headed `The doubts about Australia Card', states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a gold-plated answer to the Tax Office's problems. Something not quite as cost-effective but much less capable of being abused would be preferable. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial in the Australian of 10 September is headed `Closer look needed at card alternatives'. The Daily Mirror of 14 August, in an article headed `Australia Card Bill flawed', states:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Susan Ryan has introduced a totally new element into the Australia Card debate by talking of possible changes to the legislation and at the same time has cast grave doubts on the Government's credibility. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the Government's credibility and Senator Ryan's credibility which will be tested in this debate. We know that the standard reply from Senator Walsh, and those who follow his tactics in this place, is to say: `This is all the work of those who are the friends of tax cheats and the friends of people trying to rip off the system'. We shall see tonight whether he says that if there are changes to the negative gearing arrangements, which honourable senators will recall was the argument of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about that matter just two years ago. I turn to just two examples of people who have expressed their opposition to the Australia Card. I invite Senator Ryan, Senator Walsh, Senator Tate, Senator Cook, or anybody else who is going to participate, to tell us whether these people are significant friends of cheats, frauds and bludgers. I quote from the following article written by James Murray, the religious correspondent of the Australian, on 10 September:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the first vocal opponents of the Australia Card was the Anglican Primate of Australia, Sir John Grindrod. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Are we going to say that a person such as that is part of this conspiracy-the cheats, the frauds, the bludgers, the spongers and the people who want to rip off the system? On 14 September the Anglican Church Synod in Tasmania unanimously passed a resolution condemning the introduction of the Australia Card. Are these people fools, are they misled? Are they victims of the sorts of hysterical pressures that Senator Ryan wants to say are the responsibility of the Opposition for having generated them? No. They know the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> We know full well that the Government is conscious of the public ground swell against the Australia Card. Poor Mr Hurford, who has had his bags packed since he magnanimously gave up his spot in the Ministry in order to take up a nice diplomatic appointment overseas, has had to unpack his bags. The Government cannot afford to send him overseas or to allow him to leave the country and cause a by-election. The same thing is happening in the electorate of Robertson. Mr Cohen is anxious to get out. One thing he learnt from opera when he was Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Environment is that when one gets stabbed, one does not die; one sings. He is waiting for half a chance to sing, but the Government is making sure that we do not have a by-election in Robertson for the purpose of exposing what the electorate has to say about the Australia Card. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a broad-based coalition of Australian citizens who have indicated their opposition to this card. We have seen that the Australian Privacy Foundation can put together a group of people comprising Professor Wheelwright on the one hand and Professor Chipman on the other, united in their view about the Australia Card, and distinguished Australian citizens have expressed their views on the matter. Interestingly, one of the people who has expressed his view is Ben Lexcen. People will recall the Prime Minister the other day saying on the steps of Parliament House: `Who is this Ben Lexcen fellow? What is this strange coalition that he is involved in-strange bedfellows around the place?'. What did the Prime Minister have to say in his Address to the Nation on the economic situation on 11 June 1986? We know the definition of the Prime Minister. He is the guy standing next to the sporting hero whenever there are cameras around. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> As Australians we take enormous and obvious delight in the achievements of international excellence by our fellow countrymen and women. Just think of Robert de Castella, Joan Sutherland, Ben Lexcen and John Bertrand . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It requires the same elements as have brought Deek, Joan, Ben and John to the top-</PARA>
<PARA>to get on with the job. Where is Ben when we need to rally the nation? It requires the characteristics that Ben has; good old Ben. What did we hear within a couple of days of his statements? The Prime Minister said: `Who is this Ben Lexcen fellow? What is he all about as far as the Australia Card is concerned?'. This level of hypocrisy would be almost mind-blowing if it were not coming so regularly from the Australian Labor Party. We know the threats to personal privacy from not having an adequate system. Senator Ryan would do well to tell us what she thinks of the behaviour of the Health Insurance Commission as far as files in the McGoldrick case are concerned, and to tell us what she thinks of the Health Insurance Commission allowing the records of abortions in a medical clinic in Melbourne to be made available to the Australian Federal Police. We wait to hear what Senator Ryan has to say in defence of the Health Insurance Commission. We wait to hear what she has to say in defence of the Commission's leaking the details of doctors' incomes to the Sunday newspapers in order to blackmail them during a confrontation with a Labor government on doctors' salaries. We wait to hear what she has to say about the fact that, when a patient went to the Southport Hospital for treatment of an asthmatic condition, by using the Medicare file number the hospital authorities were able to determine that the last occasion on which that person had been treated for an asthmatic condition was when he was in gaol. We wait to hear what Senator Ryan has to say about the civil liberties of Australians under those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> When this matter was before the Senate some time ago we were concerned about overseas experience. On 25 September last year I asked Senator Grimes, as he then was, a question about Sweden. He could not give a detailed answer-a bit like Senator Gareth Evans at Question Time today. He thought that he knew something about the matter but he certainly was not going to say anything, not the least because he would have exposed the nonsense being talked about the Australia Card. However, Senator Grimes replied to me as follows in the Hansard of 7 October 1986:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Freese has specifically denied that his resignation was in any way to be interpreted as a protest against or an indication of any incapacity of the Swedish Data Inspection Board to undertake its functions in respect of the protection of the privacy and civil liberties of Swedish citizens. </PARA>
<PARA>Today in the Sydney Morning Herald we see part of an interview from Stockholm with the same Mr Freese in which he stated that he was `prompted to quit partly as an act of protest' because he was `fed up with the increasing computerisation of Swedish society'. He offered to come to Australia and I invite the Government to pay for him to do so. After all, it brought Lars Tegnhed from the Swedish tax board to Australia to give evidence to the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card. I now invite the Government to invite Mr Freese to come to Australia to give public testimony and evidence about his experiences as the so-called protector of civil liberties in Sweden because he warns Australia to think very carefully about the introduction of an Australia Card system. Of course, the Government does not care about these things. Of course, it does not care about privacy. Why should it? The Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has defined privacy:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say as a socialist that it is the interests of the community that should come before the individual right . . . we shouldn't get too hung up as socialists on privacy because privacy, in many ways, is a bourgeois right that is very much associated with the right to private property. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the same Minister who, on 18 November in the other place, admitted that the system would not be able to pick up forged cards quickly. It is the same Minister whose colleague, Mr Howe, when dealing with leaks from the Department of Social Security, put out a Press release which stated, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Any organisation with extensive records is vulnerable to such approaches. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were the approaches to leak and to misuse information held by the Government. We know that the Government admits that the legislation is defective. Dr Blewett put out a statement on 5 February this year headed `Changes to Australia Card Bill'. The Australian of 14 August had the following to say, in an article headed `ID card flawed, Ryan admits':</PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I think there are some minor amendments we would be happy with . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ryan has said in relation to privacy protection, `Don't worry about all of these things; there is adequate protection. You will not have to spend any money to go to the Ombudsman or the AAT'. On 17 August she said that it does not cost anything to go to the Ombudsman or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This is the Minister whose Government introduced a $200 charge to take appeals to the AAT and who then said, `You can go to the AAT. You do not need to put up any money because it will help you to protect your privacy'. It will cost $200 a time to protect one's privacy against the sort of system which Senator Ryan and her Government are seeking to put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> One almost has to feel sorry for Senator Ryan. She was included in the Cabinet not on the basis of her number of neurons but on the basis of her number of chromosomes and was given the task, like Simon of Cyrene, of carrying the cross of the ID card the last few paces to Calvary. I can tell her that she will end up nailed on it, as will the Government on behalf of which she is attempting to make out the defence that this is a system which is needed and wanted. I do not think there has ever been such a ground swell of public opinion against this card as has been manifest in the newspapers, commentaries, marches, protests, committees and representations made to members of this Parliament. </PARA>

We will ensure that fraud does not take place and that the concerns of Costigan, the Australian Federal Police, Inspector Merv Beck, and all of those who have raised concerns about this matter, are properly addressed. We will demand that there be a full and adequate public debate and that the Government explain, if it can, the sort of system which it is intending to put upon people. We will not see our Bicentenary marred by the turning back of the clock two centuries to a system of bureaucratic control and numbered people in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I saw that Senator Puplick was going to make his debut as a parliamentary shadow Minister in this debate, and knowing that in the past he appeared to have some genuine interest in civil liberties, I thought that we might actually get a reasonable debate, that the tone might be raised and that we might actually get some specific expression of concern about the Data Protection Agency or its mode of operation or something to which we could respond in a sensible and rational fashion. However, my hopes were disappointed. Unfortunately, all we have had is the same old thing: hysteria, emotional claptrap, personal abuse, selective quoting from newspapers, sourced and unsourced-usually unsourced-and generally the crazy idea that, somehow because we have a number, we have something that goes back to the convict days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I address, as I guess it is my responsibility to try to address, the nonsense we have just heard from Senator Puplick, I pose to him the question which I have posed constantly to John Howard, to Senator Chaney, and to Jim Carlton, who in those days had a bit of interest in what was happening to revenues: Where was all this concern, fear, trembling, harking back 200 years and the suggestion that the convict system was about to be restored during the eight weeks of the election campaign? If Senator Puplick now finds himself outraged to the point where he can barely speak without foaming at the mouth, why was he silent on this issue during a very long election campaign in which Mr Howard daily had numerous opportunities on television, radio and at Press conferences to point to all of these horrors? Why was Senator Puplick, a senator not renowned for his silence and restraint, never to be heard raising any of these threats of a convict system, so on and so forth? All that Opposition senators say in response to this very reasonable question put by me and my colleagues is: `It was the media's fault. We are blaming the media. We were interested in the issue but the media was not'. They scapegoat the media for failing to run the campaign which they now wish, in retrospect, they had run. </PARA>
<PARA> John Howard admitted in a report in the Australian Financial Review shortly after the election that the reason the Opposition had not discovered all these dreadful threats, terrors and defects in the Australia Card legislation to the extent where they might squeak up about it during the election campaign was that Opposition polling had shown that 67 per cent of the Australian people were in favour of the Australia Card. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened after that? There was blithering and blaming of the media. A few high profile individuals have decided that this is the best way they have ever found of getting their faces on television and have leapt into the debate, creating confusion and concern. Now the Liberals, the Johnny-come-latelys, have leapt on to the bandwagon and said, `Me, too. Me, too. We really think the Australia Card is dreadful. We forgot that it was dreadful during the election campaign, but we have discovered that it is dreadful again and we do not want the likes of Peter Garrett getting all the publicity. We want a bit of publicity, too'. So we hear the sort of thing we have heard from Senator Puplick. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me address some of these issues. Senator Puplick said that the worst thing about the Australia Card, a system of identification which will protect the taxpayers' revenue, stop social security fraud and reintroduce public decency and morality into the system-all of the things that the Australian people want; a simple, streamlined, straightforward identification system-is that it will have numbers, and numbers are what convicts had. With an incredible leap of illogic Senator Puplick says that because the Australia Card will have numbers and because convicts had numbers ergo the two are the same. Terrific! Senator Puplick should go back to school. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Haines, who is to join the debate, is a great advocate of the tax number system. Frank Costigan, who does not like the photograph on the Australia Card, is also a great advocate of a tax number system. In fact, all members of the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card argued in favour of a unique numbering system. Where they fell apart and made different reports was in respect of whether it should be a tax numbering system or an Australia Card system. On the one hand we have the likes of Senator Puplick saying, `We cannot have this system because it involves numbering' and on the other hand honourable senators opposite, such as Senator Haines, saying that they want a number system, but not the system the Government has put up. </PARA>
<PARA> Before we all shrivel up and die at the thought of having a number associated with us, let us remember that every Australian already has a Medicare number. That was introduced some years ago. If the mere fact of having a number attached to one's name somewhere in the system is going to bring down democratic civilisation as we know it, where was Senator Puplick, the great civil libertarian, when Medicare numbers were introduced? To follow the logic of what Senator Puplick is saying, why should we have a passport number? Why should we not be free to come and go? Why should we not let anyone come into the country? Why should we insist on a number on a passport? Is this not an invasion of our civil liberties? Driving licences will have to be abolished if Senator Puplick's stance is to have any logic, particularly those licences in States such as Queensland, which carry a photograph. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the term `dishonest'. Senator Puplick quoted part of an exchange between himself and an officer from the Health Insurance Commission concerning the investigation of overseas systems. He did not go on to quote the very adequate explanation given by Mr Michael Clarke, who is the officer in charge of the Australia Card Secretariat. Similarly, Senator Puplick rushes to the newspapers, finds the odd editorial that might have expressed some misgivings and quotes it. He does not bring into the Senate the dozens and dozens of positive editorials there have been in a whole range of newspapers. For those who had the misfortune of having to listen to Senator Puplick and had hoped that he might shed some light on what has become an issue of concern to the community, I am just setting out that he has, in the most gross fashion, used sources where they suited him and ignored the weight of evidence there is that the Australia Card is a system which many people judge to be in the interests of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The wording of the urgency motion the Opposition has brought to us today refers to the need for adequate public debate. Even the most avid opponent of the Australia Card could hardly say that there has not been public debate. There has been over 40 hours debate in the Parliament, we are to have another full scale debate in the Senate and we will have further debate on the issue at the joint sitting. As well as that, speaking as someone who has been in the Australian Senate for 12 years, I have never been involved in so much concentrated media debate, which is very public as we know, on a particular issue as I have been on this issue. I am sure that other people can say the same. To suggest that somehow there has been a paucity of debate on this issue is as illogical and silly as all the other things the Opposition has to resort to in an effort to continue to blow the bushfire until it goes out. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain matters have been raised and, even if Senator Puplick does not want to get down to facts and real information and an accurate description of the legislation, I am prepared to do so. I want to say a few things about the civil liberties protections during the debate. My colleagues Senator Michael Tate and Senator Peter Cook will address the other matters, such as the alleged cost to business and the costing, which is very important. The Government would not be proceeding with this legislation unless we were confident that there were billions of dollars to be saved for honest taxpayers and genuine social welfare recipients. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say a few things in regard to civil liberties. I want to say on the record that I recognise and acknowledge that by now, since there has been so much fear mongering and so many false things said about the legislation, there are people in the community who are genuinely concerned that there may be some impairment of civil liberties. I want to address my remarks to them because I realise that it is pointless to address my remarks to the likes of Senator Puplick. I want to go very quickly through the ways in which civil liberties will be protected and, as a preamble, say that there has never been such a wide-ranging package of civil liberties protections for the individual in relation to data kept about him or her in government and in private sources as we have here. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question I would like to put to Opposition senators, formally and informally, is why, if they are apparently so concerned now about the misuse of simple identity data, which is all the Australia Card database will have, have they not in the past expressed a similar or even greater concern about the enormous amount of data that is held about individuals in the private sector, with no protections, no scrutiny, no Data Protection Agency and no rights of appeal-nothing? Apparently it is all right if all the credit agencies, private finance companies and the rest of the private sector find out what they like about us and use it in whatever way they want to. In the private sector that is okay and one will never hear anything from Senator Puplick, Senator Reid or anyone else about it. But as soon as the Government wants to improve, correct, streamline and protect basic identity information it is the end of civilisation as we know it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many questions to be asked but they are mainly to be asked by these newfound, born again opponents of the Australia Card, rather than the Government. However, we stand ready to answer any genuine queries that are raised with us. In relation to civil liberties I simply point out a number of things that have been raised by our opponents and make the appropriate reference to the clauses in the legislation. It might be of interest to those who are genuinely concerned with what is in the Australia Card legislation. People are under no obligation to carry the card at all times-clause 8. Card applicants have the right to object to the requirement for a photograph and specimen signature-clause 12. Card applicants have the right to object to the Authority's request for further documentation-clause 13. The Authority is restricted to obtaining information from a limited number of data banks-clause 14. Person will be given a statement of reasons if they are refused the issue of a card-clause 16, and notice if their card is cancelled-clause 19. Information shown on the card will be strictly limited-clause 17. As I pointed out, it is less information than any driver's license contains. The Authority is to maintain the Register in compliance with directions issued by the Agency, preventing unauthorised access to or disclosure of information contained in the Register-clause 24. Information to be held on the Register is clearly defined-schedule 1, and so forth. I ask for the leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard the list of protections and their appropriate clause number as I fear that time will not allow me to go through them all. </PARA>

Honourable senators on the other side of the Senate always seem to think in terms of rich people-that is, that if a rich person says something it must be true, that we must not question what is said and that we must immediately withdraw the legislation because a rich person has said that it might inconvenience him. I wish these honourable senators would give a little thought-a very rare thing for them-to the poor people in this community. The poor people in this community do not run around with wallets containing American Express cards, Bankcards and other credit cards. The poor people cannot operate on plastic credit. They cannot go into a store and spend thousands of dollars because they happen to have a credit card which entitles them to do so. The poor people in this community deserve a better deal than they are able to get while we have this extent of fraud in the social security and taxation areas. A woman who has been deserted by her husband and needs to get a social security benefit cannot just go and get it without identification, as a rich man cannot open a bank account without some identification. Senator Puplick seems to suggest that requiring identification is a new thing that has never happened in Australia. We all know how absurd that is. A poor woman cannot go into the Department of Social Security and say that the kids are starving and that she needs money straight away. She has to establish her identity and her entitlement to that benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> At the moment-and Senator Haines might know about this because she does seem to take a bit of interest in the poor-people in that circumstance have a great deal of difficulty establishing their entitlement. The Australia Card will make it efficient, quick and honourable for that woman to get her benefit straight away. It will also mean that when all the frauds who are moonlighting and running around getting payments they are not entitled to have been weeded from the system, honest, decent social security recipients will be able to regain a reputation in our community. As it is, they are often dragged down by the cheats and frauds, and there is a backlash against them. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, single mothers suffer terrible prejudice in the community, not because the community is not sympathetic with the genuine women in that circumstance, but because the community is sick and tired of frauds who give the whole thing a bad name. I ask members of the Opposition to stop and think about the advantages to poor people of having an identity system which has integrity, which is fraud proof and which provides speedy entitlements to people who have a need. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick raised the question of the Health Insurance Commission. Much has been made in the media lately of alleged leaks. I want to say a number of things about the Health Insurance Commission. First, in relation to the documents that are in circulation, it appears that they have come from the Commission. Let me draw the Senate's attention to a few things about them. They are not relevant to the current stage of preparation for the system. They were early working drafts of proposals and discussions. There will be no assistance from such documents to those who are interested in how the system will actually operate. Second, they have nothing to do with personal information. They are flow charts and discussions about how processes can be managed and things of that kind. They have nothing to do with individuals. They are not in any sense a violation. There will be an investigation of the Australian Federal Police into that matter and there will be an upgrading of security. My colleagues Senator Tate and Senator Cook will speak further on this. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I have never heard so much illogical, hysterical and abusive content as I have had to put up with in the Australia Card debate. It is simply because the people opposite never were able to produce a substantial argument against it when it counted during the election campaign. The Opposition lost the election and it is trying to have a second bite of the cherry. It will lose that too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of urgency moved by the Liberal Opposition states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for further consideration and adequate public discussion of the Australia Card in view of increasing concern about the threat it poses to individual privacy and civil liberties, the burden it places on business and industry and the failure of the Government to prove the Card will be cost-effective. </PARA>
<PARA>What needs to be said first and foremost is that there is no one in this chamber, I would imagine, who in any way supports tax or social security fraud. To have that allegation flung at opponents of the ID card is a childish way of attempting to rebut some fairly solid arguments. I am not going to suggest that everybody who is arguing against the card has always been putting forward logical arguments. But in the main they have been logical. The cheap shot that the only people who are opposed to it are people who have something to hide and therefore something to fear is a nonsense. It does not do any credit at all to the Special Minister of State (Senator Ryan) who currently has charge of the legislation. What we in this place and those in the community want in effect is a system that will work to cut back as much as possible the tax and social security fraud that we all acknowledge has got away from governments, past and present. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree, too with Senator Ryan that the Opposition's motion could well have included a reference to disadvantaged people as well as to the well off people who are mentioned in it. For example, it could have included some reference to those supporting parents that Senator Ryan mentioned, in particular those women who are currently escaping a violent marital relationship, and in order to do so successfully move themselves and their children to another city or to another town-maybe to the country somewhere-and without any attempt to defraud anybody at all, assume another name. But how will they be able to do that successfully when the Government introduces this sort of system?</PARA>
<PARA> The motion should also have included the fact that the Card will not be effective in any significant way at all in doing what the Government argues it will do; that is, eliminate or cut out tax or social security fraud. How can it? No country which currently has a system even remotely similar to this one has managed to eliminate the cash economy or get rid of the criminal element. That is as true of the psuedo-ID card system that America has as it is of the ID card systems that apply in Europe. There is no way that the cash economy or the criminal element will be affected by the national identification system that this Government is planning to use. On the contrary, the criminal element especially could well be aided by it through the system's validation of a very invalidly assumed identity. So of course we need what the urgency motion says we need: we need much more consideration of this legislation and we need adequate public discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that one of the reasons why there was not an outcry from the public over this legislation during the election campaign or before it was simply that the public assumed that it did not matter if Labor got back into government as long as the Senate was not in the hands of the Government, because in the majority of cases members of the public were simply not aware of the constitutional device of having a joint sitting. They were certainly not aware that the Government was going to get the increased majority that it did. For the Government to argue that the election result provides some kind of magical mandate is an absolute nonsense. The Senate was deliberately kept out of the hands of the Government by the voters and the Government itself should pay heed to that fact. The Government needs to make a much greater effort to educate the public about the inadequacies of this legislation and to explain why it is trying to do what it is trying to do when there are so many alternatives available to it that would not be as costly, both in monetary terms and in terms of invasion of privacy, but which it does not seem to see fit to introduce. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to them in a moment. To begin with the Government needs to answer the challenge from the Law Council of Australia, a not insignificant body of people, that the Government's attitude-that is, its attitude to the safeguards allegedly provided in the legislation-seems somewhat contradictory. The Law Council of Australia says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the one hand it-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>argues that the information contained on the Australia Card and in the central data base will be limited and of such a character that there need be no concern about its being vulnerable to unauthorised access. On the other hand, the Government sees the need to establish a complex and costly system to protect that information-a system said to be the most secure available. It might be asked why such tight security is needed if the information held is as insignificant as the Government asserts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Law Council goes on to point out that, of course, `the DPA will have no weapon to ensure protection of privacy', because it can only act after the event-and anybody who has read the legislation will have become aware of the fact that the penalties applying to somebody who does leak information are quite inadequate and significantly lower than those applying to ordinary individuals in the community who do not in some way comply with the requirements of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also needs to explain why it is trying to implement a supposedly high integrity system by basing it on low integrity documents. Clause 13 (1) makes the following point:</PARA>
<PARA> Where an application has been made for the issue of a Card, the Authority may, by notice in writing given to the applicant, require the applicant to give to the Authority, within the period specified in the notice, such information or documents as are required in the notice, being information or documents reasonably required to enable-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the identity of the person in respect of whom the application is made to be verified. </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably that means documentation such as a birth certificate or a passport-documents which we all know are quite readily falsely acquired. Why this Government is arguing that it can produce a high integrity system based on low integrity documents and verifying data is beyond the comprehension of most people in this chamber. That point was made very strongly in the majority report of the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card, which recommended the use of the tax file number and underlined the fact that that tax file number had to be made of very high integrity indeed for it or any other system to be workable. Indeed, the Australian Taxation Office acknowledged that at the moment the tax file number system is of appallingly low integrity. So for this Government to provide, as it has in the Cash Transactions Bill, for having verifying documentation produced to banks before bank accounts and so on can be opened and citing, in order of preference, tax file numbers, passports, and birth certificates, is to ignore the fact that this documentation is worse than useless because it can only be used to give an improper validity to something which should have no validity at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government needs to explain to the Australian public why it is putting the cart before the horse in this way and not setting about getting a better integrity for the documents that we all use from time to time to verify that we are who we say we are; why it is not getting the births, deaths and marriages registry nationalised and computerised first; why it is not ensuring that passports can no longer be got on false birth certificates; and why it is not ensuring that those birth certificates cannot be fraudulently obtained in the first place. It needs to explain why it is not using alternative methods-things like a high integrity tax file number-to crack down on the tax and social security fraud that, as I said before, we all deplore. The Government should make that system one of improved integrity. We do not need to come up with a piece of legislation that is 130 pages long, has 189 clauses in it and a schedule that contains statements such as the statement that the Government will digitise the image of the cardholder. For what purpose, one wonders. I suggest that if this legislation is enacted-if it is forced through a joint sitting-there would not be a student in the country who would be prepared to go out and protest against increased tertiary fees or a peace activist who would be game to rally at Pine Gap, without being afraid that he or she will be identified from videos of those rallies matched against the identifying data that is contained in the computer, that is, the digitised image or photograph. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the Government on the one hand crowing about the effectiveness of its crack down on social security fraud, implemented a few months ago, while on the other claiming that welfare cheating is still going on significantly and can be cut back only by the introduction of an ID card of the sort that is provided for in this legislation? Why is the Government on the one hand encouraging, as it should, the Commissioner of Taxation to carry out audits on high profit making companies, raising, according to Mr Boucher recently, something like $2.5m on average from the companies so audited-indeed, he is also suggesting putting auditors permanently on the premises of some of the major companies--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not agree with Senator Schacht on much and I will probably agree with him on less as time goes on, but I certainly agree with him on that. Why, then, is the Government on the one hand arguing how effective these measures are in eliminating tax avoidance, evasion and fraud while on the other hand arguing that that same tax fraud can be stopped only by a national intrusive identification system? Can the Government explain, too-to me, to others on this side of the chamber and to the Australian public-why privacy legislation is to be introduced only if the ID card legislation goes through, legislation which will not in fact impinge in any way at all on the private sector, despite Senator Ryan's comments rather acidly directed at this side of the chamber earlier on?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have certainly made a point, through my colleague Senator Michael Macklin, of the need for adequate privacy legislation that affects the private sector as much as it does the public sector. Can the Government explain the so-called voluntary nature of a card which has to be held by every individual who wants a rebate on medical expenses or wants to sell a home, hold down a job, collect family allowances, sell goods or undertake any of the other numerous activities that we in this country have been used to doing without being fettered in any way at all-activities that are part and parcel of a democratic country. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, can the Government explain why it has failed so dismally to inform the people of Australia that all of this is the case-that there are these problems, there are these loopholes and there are these likely infringements-that this card is in fact not like a driver's licence which, despite Senator Ryan's odd comments, is in fact an item which we hold voluntarily, which we choose to hold if we want to drive and for no other reason. The ID card is not like a bankcard with our photograph on it. It is not like the sort of ID card that some people need to carry to have access to a high security building. It is not like any of those cards and licences, because they provide access to information pertinent only to the department that is issuing them, not a sort of catch-all department administered by the Health Insurance Commission which, as Senator Puplick has already indicated, has one of the most appalling records for preserving confidentiality of any department that this Government administers. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, can the Minister and the Government deny absolutely the argument put by the Society of Labor Lawyers in Victoria-which, by the way, her colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Gareth Evans), who is at the table, helped set up and was the inaugural president of-that the ID card has the potential to become an internal passport and that the data bases established by the card may in the future be used for surveillance of the entire population? Of course they cannot explain any of those things. But the public needs to be made aware of the problems and to be made aware of the deficiencies in the legislation that this Government is so proudly claiming is going to end all the rorts, welfare and tax, in the Western world as we know it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Number 59687364 rises today to speak on the urgency motion before the Senate chamber. I have no doubt that if the Australia Card Bill goes through this is what will happen to every senator in this place. I do not desire a number like that to be Australia's bicentennial gift to me. This point was put so very well by Senator Puplick when he led for the Opposition in the debate this afternoon. Most certainly, I do not want to protect tax cheats or social security frauds. I would not say that anyone on this side of the chamber wished to do that. As the Special Minister of State (Senator Ryan) said of many of us, I hold a bankcard number. I hold a tax file number, as everybody does. I have a driver's licence with my photograph on it, because I like to drive a motor car whenever I get home and have the chance to do so. Those who receive social security benefits, I have no doubt, also have a number. What I object to, and what the Opposition parties object to, is the fact that the Government, with this legislation, wants to put all of this information together in a data protection agency. This, of course, is what we are all so very concerned about-invasion of privacy. I say first of all that I do not believe that this Labor Government has any mandate to inflict on our country this most un-Australian piece of legislation. Statistics have a way of being used and abused for the sake of an argument. However, one set of statistics clearly shows that the Hawke Labor Government does not have a mandate to implement this most dangerous threat to privacy ever to be seen in this freedom loving country. I point out that 768,527 more Australians voted for the anti-ID card parties than voted for the Australian Labor Party at the last election. The anti-ID card parties won more votes than the ALP in every State and Territory with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory. So for the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to suggest that the return of his Government is proof positive that Australians want the ID card is to prove that he has completely lost touch with Mr or Mrs Average Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that most honourable senators in this chamber have been bombarded with letters and petitions from ordinary people who are very concerned about this ID card proposal. They are concerned about what it is to be used for, who will have access to it, and that they will not be able to manage without it. Of course, they have real concerns about the ability of hackers to infiltrate the system quite easily. I was very interested to see in the Australian newspaper this morning two pages of letters to the editor from people who are very concerned about this matter. These are letters from ordinary people-not cheats and frauds, but people are concerned about this matter. The newspaper received so many letters that it felt it had to devote two pages to them. It said that of the 526 letters that were written in respect of the ID card, an overwhelming 475 were against the proposal, 25 were for and 26 were from people who did not make their ideas quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is an increasing concern about the Australia Card and why the Government is bringing it in. The people who wrote those letters have not been organised by slick lobby groups. They are ordinary men and women who are concerned. Perhaps `concern' is too gentle a word. These people are scared stiff about which direction the socialist government that we have in power is taking them. The Government has failed convincingly to demonstrate that the ID card will achieve its stated aims. I want to put some of the facts about this ID card on record. The ID card will not stop tax fraud or evasion. The Australian Taxation Office is on record as saying so. The ID card will not catch the welfare cheats because the Department of Social Security has said so. The ID card will not catch illegal immigrants. Who said that? The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs said that, and it ought to know. Organised crime will benefit from the introduction of ID cards because it will be able to forge and use them. I believe that civil liberties and privacy are threatened by the ID card. The cost to all taxpayers will be excessive. With the introduction of this ID card, more public servants will be needed to control it. Goodness gracious me, the Government, with its deficit at the present time, ought to be thinking of ways and means of having fewer public servants rather than more. Private sector costs will also be increased by this ID card. </PARA>
<PARA> New personal penalties and fines will be introduced to try to ensure the ID card's complete acceptance. Actually, the Prime Minister said recently on the media that it would not be compulsory to have an ID card. That is all very well, but how is one going to get on without it if the information that we have received is correct? The Government says if one does not produce an ID card one will not be able to deposit or withdraw money from a bank, one will not be able to claim Medicare benefits, one will not be able to get a job and one will not be able to buy or sell property. So the list goes on. I inform Senator Robert Ray that that is stated in division 2 of part IV of the Australia Card Bill 1986, which deals with when the card has to be produced. Senator Tate, the then Special Minister of State, spelt it out in his second reading speech that the card would have to be produced for deposits and accounts with financial institutions, investments, income from certain trusts, primary production income, rental income and foreign remittances. Goodness gracious me, the list is as long as my arm, and my arm is fairly long. One can see that it will be necessary for people to carry and produce their ID card almost on a daily basis. These are some of the reasons why we are all very concerned about it. Democracies closest to our own such as Britain, the United States of America and Canada have all rejected national ID card proposals. Senator Puplick told us earlier about the Director-General of the Swedish Data Protection Board who resigned in protest, after 12 years in the job, because of the failure of the Data Inspection Board and the data Act to stop `our shrinking privacy and the extremely new vulnerability of the computerised society'. There I am speaking about a country which has an ID card. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the United States of America, a United States congressional report released in June this year states that the United States privacy Act is failing to give privacy protection to United States Government records. This is really what we are concerned about in this debate-the privacy aspect. When the Australia Card was first debated, 17 government agencies lobbied for access to the central identity register. The decision by the Government to allow three departments access to it has not fooled anybody. Once the card is introduced, no doubt other departments will subsequently be allowed access to the register as people start to worry less about it. Certainly, at present, everybody is very concerned. Very many eminent persons have expressed reservations about the ID card. Frank Costigan has told us in no uncertain terms what he thinks of the ID card, as have Justice Michael Kirby, Dr Ian Spry, QC, Editor of the Australian Tax Review, and the Right Reverend Michael Challen, the Anglican Bishop of Perth, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> No family, no community and no nation can really work very happily except on the basis of trust . . . We believe that people will require the card to be produced as a normal practice and therefore people will not be trusting one another . . . What is abnormal at the moment, we suspect, would become normal.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe, as Senator Ryan has suggested, that people such as those are tax cheats and frauds just because they are against the Australia Card. There are certainly very many people who feel very strongly about it. In fact I suggest to Government senators opposite that many people in their Party are against the introduction of the ID card. The Victorian branch of the ALP rejected the proposal for a national identity card at a State conference as far back as October 1985. The South Australian branch of the ALP has opposed a national identity card. The ALP National Conference held in Hobart in July 1986 considered, but ultimately defeated, a motion calling on the Party to reject totally any form of universal national identification card or system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they did, but that showed to me that they did not have too many brains. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Unsworth, has warned the Federal Government that it should drop plans for the Australia Card because of the widespread and growing opposition to it. Unfortunately, at this point in time the Prime Minister has not taken any notice of him. Mr Unsworth told Mr Hawke that he should re-evaluate the proposal and take it back to the drawing board. I believe that it should not go back to the drawing board but should be thrown out completely, or at least a referendum should be held to see whether Australians want an identity system introduced. If the opinion polls conducted by the media organisations are anything to go by, I am sure that the people of Australia as a whole will say no. That is what we want. We certainly want to make sure that all Australians have a chance to say whether they really want this card or not. I am sure that an overwhelming number of Australians will say that they do not want it. The other day in Brisbane there was a march and a rally against the identity card. People such as Mr Jones and Senator Stone marched and spoke out against the ID card. Ordinary people everywhere are very concerned about the fact that the Government wants to bring in a card.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One is allowed to march in Queensland if it is about something sensible like this. We realise that it is a very important matter. Everybody realises it, except people who strongly support and belong to the Labor Party. However, there are even members of the Labor Party who are willing to march and be counted on a subject like this. The author Mr Morris West is one of the latest opponents of the proposed Australia Card, but time will not permit me to go through all the reasons why, he says, Australia does not need a card like that. The Prime Minister and the Government have said that one of the main purposes of the card supposedly is to crack down on welfare cheats. But on the Ray Martin show the other day the Minister, Senator Ryan, admitted that an ID card would not prohibit people from obtaining employment. A person who is on the dole and who wants to go off it and do some seasonal work, bearing in mind that he will not have to produce an ID card, will still be able to work under a false name. So I really do not see that the Government is achieving anything by having this card, especially when one considers that it will cost about $2 billion to change the private sector's system and that it will cost taxpayers about $1 billion-that is a lot of money for a government that is really working hard to reduce a tremendous deficit-and when one realises that it will require 2,000 public servants to administer it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are some of the reasons why I am very pleased to support Senator Puplick's urgency motion today. I believe that Australians as a whole will give their wholehearted support to our urgency motion because they certainly re- alise that we do not need an Australia Card. The key factor of the whole debate centres around freedom and the gradual erosion of freedoms that we have enjoyed in this country. I hope that the Government will decide not to proceed with this proposal. We certainly would like to make sure that the scheme does not go forward. </PARA>

<PARA> Nevertheless, I have to deal with the debate as it has been brought into the chamber. It is perhaps time that we came back to the actual terms of the urgency motion before the Senate. There is a claim in the early wording of the urgency motion that there is a need for further consideration and adequate public discussion of the Australia Card in view of certain matters. As far as I am aware, there has never been any suggestion that other than very adequate time has been given for the community and indeed this Parliament to come to grips with this particular notion. It was raised as long ago as June 1985 by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the Tax Summit and has been the subject of continuous public discussion therefore for well over two years. Of course, it has been the subject, I believe, of something like 30 hours of debate in this chamber alone, let alone that which has occurred in the community at numerous rallies and meetings that have been called to discuss it. </PARA>
<PARA> What is really at stake in this urgency motion, though it has not been much adverted to, is that this is part of the softening-up process. What Senator Puplick is trying to get the Senate to do and to become accustomed to is the notion that we need more time. This is really part of the softening-up process to precede the filibuster that will carry through no doubt well into the autumn session next year. That is the object of this particular urgency motion-to begin that process of frustration of what is a constitutional process undertaken on 12 June when the Prime Minister visited the Governor-General. It is all very well to talk about referendums. If we are talking about the Australian Constitution, the fact is that we had arrived at a time when the impasse between the two chambers of this Parliament needed to be resolved. The Governor-General accepted and concurred in that advice from the Prime Minister and therefore gave a double dissolution. This has led to the situation where we will have a joint sitting so that the elected representatives of the people, meeting in a different structure from when they meet separately in their two Houses, can come together to vote on this matter, which was the cause for the Prime Minister successfully obtaining the concurrence of the Governor-General in the granting of a double dissolution. That is the constitutional process on which we are embarked and which needs to be resolved in a reasonably speedy time-not in a time that does not allow for adequate deliberation and debate in this chamber. We do not give up our rights to engage in those processes which are proper to us as elected representatives and parliamentarians, but the time will come, as is constitutionally provided for, when the process of joint sitting has to be undertaken. This urgency motion begins the softening up process by suggesting that there has not been enough time for discussion in the community, when this matter was introduced into public debate at the tax summit in June 1985. This is something on which we should be watchful. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bjelke-Petersen also spoke of her long arm. I was waiting for her nose to grow a little too, because some occasional little fibs were creeping in. Her assertion that the Australia Card will become something of a daily necessity is quite ludicrous. The scaremongering that has gone on among very ordinary, decent people in the community to get them into a state of almost hysteria, where they think they will have to produce this card on demand, is woeful. When I look back over the last year or perhaps two years as to the number of occasions on which I would have to produce the Australia Card under this legislation, I can think of three or four instances where I have had to obtain a Medicare benefit. I have not changed my employment-although no doubt many Opposition senators wish that I had been put in that position very recently-nor have I had to purchase a new home, nor have I had to open a new bank account. In fact, most Australians will have to produce this card, apart from the normal Medicare arrangements, perhaps only twice a year, three times in two years. The claims and the scaremongering that somehow we are introducing an internal passport, some sort of system which will require production on demand, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen said, on a daily basis, are so far removed from reality as to lead to the conclusion that there is a deliberate attempt to arouse hysteria and emotions among people who, when they come down to it, can see the good sense of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, what is the card about? I am not saying that Opposition senators are friends of tax cheats and of those who would defraud the social security system. It is a question of a simple photographic card which has to be produced on those occasions when by manipulating one's claim to an identity, one can avoid making a proper contribution to the revenue by way of taxation, or obtain a benefit from the social security system or under Medicare. Senator Puplick asked, `How many?' I agree that it is hard to estimate, but the fact is we know. We see a small portion represented in media reports and there are cases where people use multiple identities to get money out of the social security system. We know that there are hundreds of thousands of unclaimed group certificates sitting in the Australian taxation Office, and one can make a fair guess that many of those are sitting there because a person has taken a second or even a third job under a different name and does not want them all to be brought together under the one identity because then he will have to pay far more tax than he does. </PARA>
<PARA> What it gets down to in much of this debate is a question of whether the very mild proposal embodied in this admittedly very large piece of legislation amounts to an attack on our democratic traditions, as has been stated time and time again. As I understand it-and I may understand it a little better than the witness Senator Puplick had before him at the Joint Select Committee on an Australia Card-there is no principal in either our democratic traditions or common law which allows a person fraudulently to claim a wrong identity to obtain benefits or to refuse to pay his fair contribution to the revenues by way of taxation. That is all we are talking about. Since when has dishonesty of that nature had the honourable name that should obtain some protection either by reference to some common law principal or to some democratic tradition? Of course, it never has and the Australia Card Bill is designed to try to stamp out that sort of deception. </PARA>
<PARA> What undermines a democracy is the deprivation of those moneys which it requires to carry out the programs which have been decided upon by the people in electing their representatives to this Parliament. If democratically elected governments are deprived of those revenues on the scale which has been put forward by the Tax Office and which could be met by the introduction of this Australia Card, and if that undermining of the revenue of government continues, that is the real attack on the sinews and very structure of our democratic way of governing ourselves in this country. Not only is there an attack on the system in that respect, but the ordinary taxpayer is, I believe, becoming somewhat disillusioned, becoming very begrudging in the moneys that he or she will make available through payment of tax to support those who genuinely need social security or Medicare support. Unless we as a parliament can demonstrate to ordinary taxpayers that we are trying to crack down on the fraudulent misuse of identity and other matters which lead to the defrauding of social security and Medicare systems, I believe that we stand in danger of taxpayers withdrawing their support for those social security and Medicare systems in a way which will then bring about once again a diminution of what we are trying to create by way of a civilised, democratic society in Australia which offers support to those genuinely in need. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that Senator Bjelke-Petersen has left the chamber. That is unfortunate because I wanted to bring this point to her attention. She mentioned that there could be an impact on our society such that daily demands could be made for production of the card. I wanted to quote to her clause 167 of the legislation, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Except as authorised by this Act, a person shall not require another person to produce a card. </PARA>
<PARA> Penalty: $5,000 or imprisonment for 2 years, or both. </PARA>
<PARA>There one has the firmest statement that could come from this Parliament, that if an over-zealous public servant or officious policeman demanded production of the Australia Card in any situation other than is provided under this legislation-and for the ordinary average Australian, as I have pointed out, that would be on very rare occasions indeed, perhaps two or three times a year, apart from production of the Medicare card in claiming benefits under that system-we will punish that person in a very severe way, and be stating as a parliament our intention to punish in a very severe way. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition only comes up with the old tax file number as the alternative-that is the stale old alternative which is brought up time and time again. As Senator Ryan said quite rightly, in the end even if the Opposition were correct in that matter and had its way, one would have to upgrade the tax file number to such an extent and bring about such a level of integrity by the production of documents to support the identity of a particular person with the tax file number, that one would virtually have a rose by any other name. One would virtually have everything that is required by way of the Australia Card, apart from the photograph. One would have a high integrity number identifying a particular person in the community. The fact is, as we know, that the tax file number is totally inadequate because, as the name implies, it is merely a number, attached, I suppose, in the old days to a manila folder as it travelled around the Tax Office. It bears no definite relation to a particular person in the community. It is a number which identifies a file that moves around in its manila folder. The fact that we now have computers rather than the mere physical transfer of manila folders does not diminish the force of what I am saying. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to find a reason for the Opposition's continuous whipping up of emotions. This urgency motion is very sanitised and talks in quite muted terms about what is wrong. Opposition members feed on the creating of hysteria and grave misgivings and real concern out in the community, by those who portray the use of this card in totally wrong and unrealistic, but nevertheless frightening, ways. I have been in Tasmania joining in the debate and I have heard of old people being frightened by claims that unless they have their Australia Card number attached to their will, it will be void and have no effect and they will die intestate. This sort of thing causes tremendous concern out in the community. Others within religious congregations have been told that the Australia Card amounts to the mark of the beast in Revelations and that it means we are on the verge of the second coming. These are very real concerns being whipped up in the community. Senator Puplick's sanitised motion is feeding off these fears and he knows that out in the community terrible distortions are taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's reasoning can be stated fairly quickly. We are getting not only at those who are involved in defrauding the social security system; we are also attacking those who are not making their proper contribution to the taxation revenues of the elected government of the day. I believe that Mr Elliott let the cat out of the bag when he said that he was quite happy with an Australia Card which merely dealt with social security fraud. That is almost a class thing. As far as he is concerned those who are unfortunate enough to be beneficiaries under the social security system can carry a card but he and his ilk certainly will not. This legislation attacks both social security fraud and those who are not paying their proper contribution to the revenues of government. Of course the Liberals and those on the other side of the chamber will always try to protect those who try to pervert the tax system. The fact that we are attacking the perversions of the tax system really rouses the ire of honourable senators opposite. </PARA>

As honourable senators know, this legislation will be a tremendous revenue raiser. The benefits will be something like $5.6 billion recouped by way of taxes and lower welfare payments over 10 years. Establishment and running costs over those 10 years will be $759m. Therefore the net benefit will be $4.6 billion over 10 years. We need those revenues in order to fulfil the programs for which we have been elected by the Australian people. In depriving us of those revenues the Opposition will force us either to go into different forms of taxation or to cut back those programs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is clearly one of great significance to almost all Australians but its impact is still quite clearly lost on the Government. It addresses specifically the burden that the Australia Card proposal places on business and industry and the failure of the Government to prove that the Card will be cost effective. Apart from the apoplectic fulminations from the Special Minister of State, Senator Ryan, who is the Minister responsible, and a fairly pedestrian contribution by the Parliamentary Secretary for Justice (Senator Tate), we have had one minute-that is, the last minute of Senator Tate's speech-which addressed the revenue-raising implications. It is quite clear that revenue is the last thought on the Government's mind. It is very difficult to understand why that should be. The silence is deafening when it comes to supporters of this legislation. Two Ministers and one near Minister, who is obviously on a promise for next time, have been wheeled out today by the Government. Apart from that no one is prepared to stand up. I have been trying to organise a public meeting for October. So far I have invited Senator Tate, Senator Ryan, Mr Brumby and Senator Aulich-the latter two of course strongly espousing the Government line on the Select Committee on an Australia Card. None of them are interested any more; they have all gone to ground. It is really very sad that the Government, which professes an interest in democracy, is not prepared to recognise the overwhelming view of the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the basic motivation behind this legislation we find that it was aimed at preventing losses to revenue through the tax system and through the payment of Commonwealth benefits. The four major areas targeted by the Government's proposal are taxation evasion, social security fraud, illegal immigrants and benefit protection and other areas of Commonwealth expenditure. Of course, the reality is that this proposal does nothing to address any of those areas. It is a sad reflection on the Government's supposed commitment to efficiency, to being good economic managers and to being latter day champions of privatisation. However, one has to say that the Government has very quickly gone off the boil in that regard-Telecom Australia and Australia Post are now sacrosanct and we now see that airport terminals are not going to be flogged off. Of course, it is quite clear that the Government is going to water in that area. Nonetheless, it puts itself before the people as being very concerned about the cost-benefit implications of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt we will have a Budget presented to us tonight that will achieve a better Budget deficit than some commentators have suggested. That is the sort of nonsense that is usually put forward in praise of a government initiative-that somehow it is better than the commentators thought it might have been. In other words, it manages to improve on the leaked misinformation that had been put out sometime earlier. Nonetheless, that Budget will be presented tonight on the basis that somehow there are much greater revenue gains than were previously thought and therefore the Government is able to achieve a lower deficit. One of the principal reasons why it will achieve greater than expected revenue gains is the increased efficiency in the tax and social security systems, which has nothing to do with the yet to be introduced Australia Card. That in itself blows out of the water the whole notion of an Australia Card aimed at recouping all those massive escapings of Government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I will put to one side the selective squeals that we have heard to date and deal with something that has not been touched on so far-that is, the whole question of cost in this area. If one goes back prior to the formation of the Select Committee on an Australia Card, the draft White Paper on the reform of the Australian taxation system estimated that an additional tax revenue sum of some $800m would be collected from the system within a period of three years of the implementation of the Australia Card. By September of that year-in other words, some three months later-the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was forced to concede that that estimate was significantly higher than was now anticipated. The Australian Taxation Office estimated that benefits would accrue of the order of $700m by the fourth full year of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Health Insurance Commission put out figures which were light years removed from that sort of level. It estimated that the cost benefit in total over a 10-year period on a net present value basis would be of the order of $2.4 billion. At the very same time in a submission to that Select Committee the Department of Finance, using a 10 per cent discount rate which was precisely the same approach adopted by the Tax Office, came up with a figure in excess of $3 billion. It is quite clear that the figures vary wildly and that the Government is not in a position to assess anything like the real benefits of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, which is supposedly committed to open government, still has freedom of information on the books although it makes life harder every day for those who wish to pursue it. I can announce to the chamber that James Porter will be appearing at a preliminary conference hearing next Thursday in order to obtain a copy of the Business Regulation Review Unit report. This report, which is more than 12 months old, recommended very strongly against the introduction of the Australia Card legislation on the grounds of massive costs to business. It has not yet been released by the Government despite numerous attempts to secure that release and, as I say, a FOI request which is to be dealt with at a preliminary stage. That is the sort of open government we get. The fact is that the Government is not in a position to reveal in any manner of accuracy the sorts of cost savings that will accrue because it simply does not know what they are. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the extent to which this legislation might have any impact on the black economy, one finds that the Tax Office estimates that income tax evasion costs this community about $3 billion per annum. That is a very conservative figure, as put before Senator Aulich's Committee. The draft White Paper estimated that income tax avoidance was of the order of $1.5 billion. By putting together avoidance and evasion one arrives at a figure of $4.5 billion at the very least. </PARA>
<PARA> What is this sort of legislation going to do? If we are prepared to wait five or 10 years, it will recoup some hundreds of millions of dollars, apart from the massive start up costs of the order of $750m to $1,000m, which have to be paid up front. Where is the benefit in that? If the Government were serious about acting on decisions taken at tax summits and the like, it would have adopted option C and introduced a consumption tax that would have done something about the black economy, but no, here we are faced with a nebulous proposal that will do virtually nothing for the black economy. I am sure that those honourable senators who have read the Select Committee report will know precisely that: that all of the evidence demonstrated that the card simply would not achieve those sorts of gains. One of the witnesses before the Committee was Doug Meagher, QC, who is no wimp in anybody's language. He said that the ID card system would have no effect on the cash economy as moneys would simply not be put into bank accounts and would not be traceable. In the two major departmental submissions to the Joint Select Committee, the Australian Taxation Office favoured increasing the integrity of the present taxation system and the Department of Social Security pointed out that most overpayments to welfare recipients are due to departmental error or false information on income rather than falsification of identity. The Department of Social Security favoured pursuing its own automatic data processing strategic plan. The inevitable recommendation of that Committee was this:</PARA>
<PARA> The majority believes the creation of a new bureaucracy of 2000 public servants within the HIC-</PARA>
<PARA>the Health Insurance Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>with the sole task of identifying every man, woman and child in Australia, is a wasteful exercise which will not address the problems of tax evasion and social security fraud but will provide the mechanism by which the very fabric of our society will be irreversibly altered, opening the way for the greatest attack on the privacy of individuals as the `Identity Bureau' identifies, monitors, and updates information on every person in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That report was able to come to the Australian people only by courtesy of one courageous member of the Australian Labor Party. Of course, anyone else doing the same thing now would have his membership revoked and would go the same way as former Senator Georges. Nonetheless, that is the penalty one has to pay for being truthful. </PARA>

<PARA> The majority report, for which I take some credit in its preparation, has rejected the introduction of an ID card with or without a photograph. It did so after receiving overwhelming evidence that Tax Evasion and Social Security can be tackled successfully, using the alternate Extended Tax File System, in a cheaper and more effective manner. </PARA>
<PARA>If we look at the extent of tax evasion, the Tax Office by its own concessions is now getting its act together. Clearly, it needed to do that because the House of Representatives Expenditure Review Committee, reporting on five Auditor-General efficiency audits of the Tax Office, made it abundantly clear that it was not even in the game, that it was letting massive amounts of revenue go past because it did not have the resources, because it was significantly underspending on the provision that had been allocated to it. Now, of course, the Tax Office has finally and belatedly started spending something like $700m on updated computer equipment and, as a result, it is at last giving effect to the recommendations of the Auditor-General and the Expenditure Review Committee. The result of that, of course, is that it pulls the rug out from under the very proposition that we somehow need an Australia Card to catch up with tax evasion and social security fraud. It is vastly overstated in any event, but the reality is that the Tax Office is now performing very much better than it ever has in that area. It is doing the sort of job that it should have been doing quite some time ago, and it does not need any help from the un-Australian card. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the cost to business. Business has an entitlement to know what it is likely to be up for. Business costs, it is estimated by the Confederation of Australian Industry, will be of the order of $377m. The Government has never provided any information to the contrary. We therefore have to assume that that is a best endeavour to assess the cost. What do the banks say about the cost to them? It would be of the order of $100m, so we thought, until the other day when the Westpac Banking Corporation came out and said that 64,000 customers may well need to have spent on them about $5 per account. That amounts to $300m. That is the sort of cost to industry that we are talking about. Who is that going to be passed on to? It will be passed on to the taxpayers who are supposedly to benefit from this iniquitous legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the benefits do not add up at all. The proposals that are envisaged are clearly short-sighted, have been blown out of the water and are being pursued only because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is still sufficiently ego-obsessed that he is not prepared to back down in the face of overwhelming community opposition. Even his State Premiers are not prepared to stand up and be counted. Mr Cain must have a very painful and tender private region from the amount of time he has spent sitting on the fence in recent weeks. Mr Bannon has said that he is not prepared to make the register of births, deaths and marriages available until he knows how much money is going to be reimbursed to the State Government. Mr Unsworth, of course, wants to call the whole deal off, and we know that the Premier of Queensland will not have a bar of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> What sort of an arrangement is that going to be? It is quite clear that it is going to be ineffective and unworkable. But, more importantly, the costs of the system are going to be all one way. There are not going to be any benefits. Indeed the Prime Minister, in his address to the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress, went so far as to put forward this master of equivocation. He estimated that the benefits of the Australia Card would ultimately be $900m per annum. He then went on to say, as have Senator Ryan and Dr Blewett, that the Government was losing $2.5m a day for every day that the Australia Card legislation was not introduced. If we do our sums, we see that the current figure would be $1.3m. Do honourable senators know how the Government gets to the $2.5m figure? It says that if we go to a 10 year period that is when it will start costing $2.5m, and that we can somehow bring that figure forward to today. It is a nonsense and it is a ludicrous proposition. It is quite clear that it is a desperate attempt by the Government somehow to try to shame its supporters into standing up and supporting this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid the game is up. It is quite clear that the Prime Minister is only waiting until a convenient time to withdraw this legislation, probably around Christmas when the Parliament has risen. Until then we are going to have to put up with the time of this Parliament being wasted on debating what is clearly a totally ineffective and useless piece of legislation which will not achieve any of its objective, which the Government is not prepared to address sensibly in terms of the cost benefit implications, which ultimately has no mandate at all and was not even given a guernsey during the election campaign and the benefits of which clearly do not leave much of an impact on the Prime Minister's mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating an urgency motion which has been put down today, the first working day of the new parliament after an election, which followed a double dissolution because the Senate refused on two occasions to pass legislation to deal with the Australia Card. It is passing strange that this first debate is on the very issue which led to the dissolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives. I thought the Opposition would have less shame than that, but obviously that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the debate is about the Australia Card, let me put a direct challenge to all of those who have spoken in this debate in opposition to the Government. My challenge is: `Put your plastic on the table. Show us whether you have a Mastercard. Put down your Visa card. Show us whether you have a Diners Club card. Produce your American Express card'. By seeking consumer credit have we not voluntarily given all the details and more that the Opposition complains the Government might have-but in fact which it will not have-not to the Government but to private organisations with controls which the Opposition complains the Government might have in that position? Those opposite have no idea what sorts of controls over information they have given up to private organisations, yet they come in here and criticise the Government for trying to establish a high integrity identification system which is, as best it can be devised, foolproof from hackers, foolproof in terms of the penalties and other technological restraints on the system and foolproof from being in any way abused. I bet that all those who have spoken in this debate have some sort of credit and that much more information is available about them-and they pretend it is a matter of privacy. If they do not have any credit cards, they do of course have a Medicare card. One of the functions that an Australia Card will perform is to rationalise the Medicare system and help it to operate more effectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, Senator Haines is not troubling me one wit with her interjections. I will deal later with what she said. Let me go back to the beginning of this debate. The Senate has twice debated the legislation that will shortly be presented to it so that it can again debate the Australia Card. It has conducted an inquiry which brought down a majority decision and reported it here. The Parliament was dissolved prior to the election, and the people of Australia had a chance during the election campaign to express a view on the matter. We are on the Government side; members of the coalition are on the Opposition side. It seems that we won the election. In expressing a view the people of Australia have returned us, not them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the dying throes of Senator Alston's speech he said that the Australia Card would have been an election issue had it been given a chance, or words to that effect. Let us deal with that matter because there are motions on notice in the Senate suggesting that there should be a referendum. We have just had an election but the Opposition now wants a referendum. Why did the Opposition not take advantage of the democratic processes laid down by the Australian Constitution and argue in the election campaign the issues about which it now claims to have some conscientious view?</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who saw the 7.30 Report last week would have seen an interview conducted by Paul Lyneham with some of the doyens of the parliamentary Press Gallery in Canberra. Paul Lyneham put this question to the Gallery journalists:</PARA>
<PARA> Was the Australia Card raised as a serious issue for debate during the campaign by either side?</PARA>
<PARA>Let us see what the Gallery said about that. If members of the Press have been cited as impartial umpires in this debate, which I have never accepted they were, let us see what the direct observers of this process had to say. Michelle Gratton of the Age stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it was a minor issue, I think the government was quite happy to talk about it because it felt that certainly at that stage it was quite a popular issue but I think it was just overwhelmed by other issues. </PARA>
<PARA>Michelle Gratton recognised that we certainly talked about the matter; we never hid our light under a bushel. Laurie Oakes said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was certainly raised by the government, I remember the first of the Labor Party newspaper ads was about the I.D. Card. It had four photographs of the card and in Hawke's speech in Adelaide, where a bloke threw himself in front of the car that got all the headlines, but that speech was primarily about the Australia Card and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Oakes continued:</PARA>
<PARA> So Labor raised it but the Opposition certainly didn't because their research showed that it wasn't an issue and they let the chance go. </PARA>
<PARA>What did Geoff Kitney of the Times on Sunday say? He talked about his newspaper's efforts to raise the matter and stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . largely because John Howard didn't have his heart in it. In fact John Howard, when they first proposed the idea, was in favour of an I.D. card. </PARA>
<PARA>What did Kerry O'Brien of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation say? He said that the Opposition did not raise it; it let it go. Gregory Hywood of the Australian Financial Review said:</PARA>
<PARA> The government triggered the double dissolution on it. The Opposition obviously didn't feel it was enough of a vote winner to raise in the campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>What did Mike Steketee of the Sydney Morning Herald say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think John Howard said after the election when this was raised with him-why didn't you make more of an issue of it-he said. I wanted to concentrate peoples attention on tax and there's a limited number of things that you can get people to focus on. </PARA>
<PARA>He wanted to concentrate people's attention on the fraudulent effort to pretend that he could buy votes in Australia by cutting taxes, selling off everything and operating voodoo economics to try to swindle Australian voters into believing that he could do miracles, which was not true. The interviewer on the 7.30 Report turned to Mr Howard and asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howard, thanks for joining us. With the benefit of hindsight, could you have done more with the Australia Card as an election issue?</PARA>
<PARA>What did John Howard say to that? This is the first issue the Liberal Party has put down for debate in the new Parliament; this is the one issue which the Liberal Party has tacked its banner to the masthead to go into battle over. What did Mr Howard say when asked why he did not make the Australia Card an issue during the election campaign? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Well we could have but I don't regret the priority I gave to certain issues in the campaign . . . I don't regret the priority that I gave to other issues.</PARA>
<PARA>Was John Howard fair dinkum and can we expect the Opposition to be fair dinkum now? The answer is that those who talk about a referendum had their chance during the election campaign. They know the Constitution and the parliamentary process. They blew it and they are now trying to regurgitate a campaign which, I suggest, is based mostly on a motion, primarily on fear, and fundamentally on a misrepresentation of the facts in order to gull Australian electors into believing that something will happen to their privacy which will not happen and which is not intended. In any case, if they volunteer to take consumer credit, they are open to risks that this high integrity system is absolutely not open to. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I leave the Liberal Party, there is one other person in the Liberal Party who ought to get a run in this debate but who has not been mentioned. He deserves to be given a go: John Elliott, the aspirant President of the Liberal Party and its former treasurer, a person who sometimes goes abroad and shafts the Australian economy to foreign audiences-the so-called possible future Leader of the Liberal Party. What is John Elliott's view about the Australia Card? Emphatically he does not have an in-principle objection to it. All he says is that certain people should be required to have it. Who are those people? They are only those on welfare, that is, only those citizens in this country who are poor, only those in unfortunate economic circumstances. He does not have a principled objection to the idea as long as the poor are made to have the card. I ask John Howard: Why, when this card is directed at tax avoiders as much as it is at welfare fraud, does he not want those who pay tax and have the option of defrauding the tax base in this country to have the card? That may or may not be a question which John Elliott will answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of us sat through the arguments in the Senate about bottom of the harbour tax avoidance in the 1983 sessions and in 1984 when this Government put two Bills before this Parliament in order to stamp it out. Which parties voted down those Bills? The Government introduced them but who knocked them off? It was the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats. If a government is to stamp out tax avoidance of the sort that the Government aimed at, it needs the capacity, once it has identified a fraudulent taxation system, to retrospectively recover the ill-gotten gains that those who have been operating that system have acquired. If a government has that ability, there is absolutely no incentive for people to engage in tax avoidance. Who denied this Government that ability? It was the Liberal Party, the National Party and some-not all-of the Democrats. Some of them had principles, stuck with us and voted for the proposition. We hear arguments in this chamber that those opposite really are opposed to tax avoidance and that we should look at the record to decide not what they say but what they do and take what they do as a guide to what they may do in the future, but the record on tax avoidance is very patchy. Unfortunately, some of my friends in the Australian Democrats are subject to that allegation just as much as those in the Liberal Party and National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> How did we get into the question of the Australia Card in the first place? We won government in 1983 because there were widespread tax rorts and tax ramps in this country. The people of Australia disbelieved and regarded as non-credible any fundamental conviction that a Liberal government would do anything about them. They elected a Labor government to clean up the tax base of this country. We have done that. In 1985, after being returned to office for the second time, we published a White Paper on tax reform. Options A, B and C all proposed an Australia Card. We had a National Economic Summit. No one can say that there has not been enough debate. The debate has been raging backwards and forwards since 1985. The Australia Card was part of our fundamental commitment on coming to power in 1983. It survived the election in 1984. We have been returned again in 1987. No one can say that there has not been adequate debate on the issue. No one in this chamber can say that there has not been adequate debate, except those new senators who have just joined us. We welcome them to our ranks. They will hear the debate pretty soon. We have had the Bill here twice before and argued every single stitch and clause of it. It will be back here again soon and the new senators will have their opportunity to take part in the debate then. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I want to make before my time expires is that I am fundamentally, as is Neal Blewett and Susan Ryan-the two Ministers who have carriage of the card-and as is the Australian Labor Party, committed to the protection of civil liberties in this country. We are a party with that record of protection. We are a party that is believed by the constituents of this country to stand for those things. I do not say that because we are believed to stand for them we can rest on our laurels. In this sort of an issue one has to prove one's achievements every day and every hour of every day all the time. Civil liberties are a delicate question that constantly requires defence. </PARA>
<PARA> But when the articulate middle class in this country raises the question of our civil liberties I want to pose the question on behalf of the poor and on behalf of people who rely on welfare: What about their civil liberties? By holding up the introduction of this card, the Opposition is denying $4.7 billion which it will net in real government revenue over 10 years. That is money this Government can use to improve the situation of people in real need. Who speaks for them? The articulate middle class, with their Visa Cards in their hip pockets who have surrendered all their information to the privately controlled privacy banks, do not speak for them. Who speaks for them? They are entitled to say: `We want more out of this economy. We want an end to tax fraud. We want an end to welfare fraud. We want a bit more of the revenue base that goes to government because we are the people in real need'. The Labor Party speaks for them. That is why this urgency motion should be defeated today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-A couple of points need to be made in concluding this debate. The first is that if Senator Cook is so anxious to argue the figure of $4.7 billion, perhaps he can also explain to the Senate why his Government refuses to release the Business Regulation Review Unit report on this legislation and why he can indicate to us that $4.7 billion is the figure when no calculations have been made of the cost to be imposed upon the private sector, State governments or local government. Those matters are covered in the Business Regulation Review Unit report which Senator Cook's Government is deliberately seeking to suppress. The second point I make in relation to what Senator Cook has had to say is that if there has been adequate debate, what does he say about the fact that Ministers in his Government admit that this legislation needs amendment and that we are not going to be given the opportunity to debate the amendments which the Government itself accepts are correct and proper and which ought to be made?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the matters raised by Senator Ryan. Senator Ryan says quite glibly that there may have been leaks from the Health Insurance Commission. She is not prepared to do anything about that. Her Government is not prepared to do anything about it. When she makes claims that there are thousands of fraudulent people in the community, let her and let her Government explain why Senator Tate and his Department are deliberately suppressing the report by the Australian Federal Police on fraud against the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to Senator Tate. Senator Tate says that it will not be necessary to produce the card perhaps more than three or four times a year for most people in the community. If he is telling the truth he will have to admit that, for instance, if one employs a babysitter once a week one will have to obtain the Australia Card number of that babysitter. The same applies to somebody who might do one's gardening, cleaning work or whatever. Every one of those transactions will require one to obtain the Australia Card number. I can understand why Senator Tate might not understand these matters, but the Australia Card legislation requires a person to obtain the Australia Card number of the individuals concerned in such transactions, to record them and to report them to the Australian Taxation Office. The idea that one might have to have the Australia Card produced for such purposes only three or four times a year is absolutely spurious. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that our case in this urgency debate has been adequately made out by speakers on this side of the Parliament, particularly by Senator Bjelke-Petersen and Senator Alston. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, because of the late commencement of the sittings-which in turn was occasioned by the mid-year election, which is an unusual time to have an election and which was of the Government's making of course, and not of the Opposition's-has set a series of sitting dates for the Parliament which are extremely intensive. I wish to record at this stage the Opposition's concern about the length of sittings which are being imposed. Under this Government the Parliament moved some time ago to a two weeks on, two weeks off, back-to-back sitting pattern, which was in part brought in to assist people such as Senator Collins, and honourable senators from Western Australia and Queensland, who have long distances to travel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that was entered into in very good faith by the Parliament as an attempt to find a more satisfactory pattern of sittings. Whilst the two weeks on, two weeks off is the theory, we are sitting for three weeks at a time with one week up. The Government is proposing to have sittings of Estimates committees in one of those weeks when the Parliament is not sitting. I think that the pressure not only on the Opposition but also on the Ministers and on the members of parliament generally is very unreasonable. It is likely to lead not only to bad behaviour in this place but also to the deterioration of senators' and members' health. </PARA>
<PARA> I do no more than express my concern about that. The Opposition has for the last 4 1/2 years accepted the obligation to sit when the Government has requested that we should do so, but I believe that the sitting pattern which has been adopted is most unwise, and I ask the Government, in looking at the sitting pattern next year-bearing in mind no doubt that it will be arranging considerable festivities during that year-to try to arrange a more manageable sitting pattern for the sake of everybody who serves in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I give the Government notice that the Opposition will be seeking a variation in the proposal for the sitting of Estimates committees because it does not believe that it is reasonable that in the very brief periods we are not sitting we are required to come back to do Estimates committees. I am pleased to see an indication of approval from the Australian Democrats for that point of view. I am mentioning it now-and I have mentioned it privately to the Manager of Government Business-to ensure that the Government is not caught short in its own arrangements on that matter. The sitting pattern is not one which we are seeking to oppose; I simply indicate my very considerable concern about what the Government has in place. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1987</PARA>
<PARA> The Ministers of State Act currently provides that there can be no more than 27 Ministers. As announced by the Prime Minister on 14 July, the Government wishes to have a Ministry of 30, administering 18 Departments in place of the previous 28. </PARA>
<PARA> The total cost of Ministerial remuneration (salary and expenses of office allowance) in a full year would be $97,752. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS BILL 1987</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend two Acts: the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, to clarify the scope of existing provisions of that Act in the light of the recent changes to Ministerial and Departmental structures; and the Public Service Act 1922, to abolish the Public Service Board and establish new arrangements in its place. A separate Bill will be introduced to amend the Ministers of State Act 1952, to increase from 27 to 30 the number of Ministers who may be appointed. </PARA>
<PARA>Administrative Arrangements Legislation</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Prime Minister's announcement of the introduction of revised arrangements for the administration by Ministers of Departments, it is desirable to clarify provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act relating to the meaning of references in legislation to Ministers and Departments. In particular, the amendments deal with situations where a Minister administers two or more Departments or where a single Department is administered by two or more Ministers. While the existing provisions of the Act are capable of application to the new arrangements, it is obviously desirable to put the matter beyond doubt and also to deal with the particular features of the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, in the May Economic Statement, announced that the existing structure of the Public Service Board was under review. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, the Prime Minister has accepted a recommendation from Mr David Block, in his capacity as head of the Efficiency Scrutiny Unit, that the Public Service Board be abolished. The amendments before the Senate repeal provisions of the Public Service Act establishing the Public Service Board and substitute provisions establishing an office of Public Service Commissioner. Further legislation will be prepared to give full effect to the Government's proposals for the distribution of the Board's powers. In the meantime the Bill provides for the continuation of the existing delegations of the Board's powers and functions to related management agencies, for example, the Department of Industrial Relations, and to Secretaries of departments generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the establishment of an Australian Public Service Management Advisory Board comprising part-time members who will include the Commissioner, the Secretaries of certain departments, a person with a trade union background and a person with private sector experience. The new body's functions will include the provision of advice to the Government on significant issues relating to the management of the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a number of consequential and transitional provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that the abolition of the Public Service Board will save approximately $8 million in 1987/88 and $16.5 million in 1988/89. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> It is now some three and a half years since the introduction of legislation to provide the Australian National Railways Commission (AN) with a charter which gave AN the task of becoming a commercially oriented business operation.</PARA>
<PARA> In the previous year, AN had recorded its highest ever loss of $106 million. Since then, AN has made considerable progress. </PARA>
<PARA> This progress reflects this Government's approach of creating an environment in which its business authorities can get on with the job of improving their performance. In real terms AN's call on the Federal Budget has been reduced by over 60% during this period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a record in which everyone associated with AN, the Chairman, Commissioners, AN management, Unions and AN workforce can take pride. </PARA>
<PARA> But we cannot stop there. Accordingly this Government is continuing to work with AN, and its staff to maintain that momentum which will lead AN to become a genuinely commercially viable Government railway. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of this continuing drive for improved efficiency, on 1 October 1986 the former Minister for Transport the Hon Peter Morris, MP, announced a package of further initiatives including a new approach to AN's passenger services. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that like virtually every railway in the world AN's passenger services are not currently commercially viable. However, with operational and marketing initiatives, their future prospects are improved. </PARA>
<PARA> While AN's performance is better than many of the other Australian rail systems, particularly for its long distance services, there is room to achieve greater efficiency. The Government and AN are embarking upon the demanding approach of upgrading these services rather than allowing them to drift into a state where they are beyond redemption. </PARA>
<PARA> We have agreed with AN a set of increasing cost recovery targets to be achieved in respect of these passenger services. From a level of around 45% in 1984-85 AN now has the task of improving its passenger cost recovery level to a 60% target by 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> AN has already launched a number of major initiatives to provide better, more efficient services to its customers. These include</PARA>
<PARA> upgrading the Mount Gambier service with improved transit times and on-board service which has resulted in a 15% increase in patronage</PARA>
<PARA> the Launching in 1986 of a new Adelaide-Whyalla Budd car service which replaced the Adelaide-Port Pirie service. This service, known as the Iron Triangle Limited, is currently running at almost full capacity</PARA>
<PARA> diversion of the Indian Pacific into Adelaide in 1986 without adding to the total journey time</PARA>
<PARA> the launching of a new service, known as the Silver City Limited between Adelaide and Broken Hill in December 1986</PARA>
<PARA> launching of a conference car on the Ghan to cater for business functions. </PARA>
<PARA> AN considers that it should further extend the facilities it provides to its passengers to make train travel a far more enjoyable experience in itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly it has refurbished rollingstock to provide a special entertainment car, offering facilities such as</PARA>
<PARA> video and sound booths</PARA>
<PARA> video games for children</PARA>
<PARA> tables for cards and chess</PARA>
<PARA> a souvenir shop</PARA>
<PARA> a hair salon</PARA>
<PARA> a limited number of poker machines. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide a clear legislative base for these activities it is necessary for the amendments contained in section 3 of this Bill to be enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> AN has consulted both the South Australian and Northern Territory governments on the proposal and both Governments have raised no objections. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment incorporated in the Bill will preserve the existing workers compensation entitlements for AN employees who were transferred from the South Australian Railways in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> A condition of the transfer was that these employees would have the option of claiming compensation benefits under either the South Australian or Federal provisions. This was embodied in Section 47 of the ANRC Act 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the existing South Australian Act is to be repealed on 1 October 1987. This means those employees would lose their right to claim compensation under South Australian law. In view of the Government's commitments at the time of transfer, it is only proper that the Government should continue to honour those commitments. This amendment will ensure that the right to choose between the current SA provisions and Federal provisions is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The third provision of the Bill will amend Section 70 of the Act to expand the powers under which Boards of Inquiry undertake investigations into the causes of accidents involving AN. </PARA>
<PARA> Two Boards of Inquiry have been established under the Act. They have proven to be extremely valuable in having an independent body examine major accidents. </PARA>
<PARA> It is considered that future inquiries would benefit by having wider powers to allow them to consider the broader causes of accidents. The proposed powers are similar to provisions governing accident enquiries under the Air Navigation Regulations. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is unchanged from the form in which it was passed by the House of Representatives on 26 February 1987, and the form in which it was introduced into this House on 17 March 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes some fine-tuning amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. As many honourable members will no doubt know, this Act, which came into operation on 1 October 1980, codified and modernised the ancient prerogative writ remedies under which the lawfulness of government decision making could be challenged. The Act streamlined the procedures under which citizens could challenge, on legal grounds, administrative decisions and it did away with technicalities that applied under the old remedies. This innovative legislation has thus been in operation for some seven years and it is now an appropriate time to be examining the Act to see where improvements can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> A particular concern has been the use made of the Act in the course of administrative proceedings before some other tribunal in circumstances where the particular decision can be challenged at the conclusion of those administrative proceedings. Recourse to the Federal Court under the Act in the course of the administrative proceeding, rather than assisting in the dispatch of business of that tribunal, can have quite the opposite effect. It can frustrate and delay the proper decision making processes of the tribunal. We are all aware of the events which surrounded the hearings of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal into the granting of a third commercial television licence for Perth in which, in the course of these proceedings, 16 cases were decided by the Federal Court under the Act. The effect of all this litigation was to delay the decision of the Tribunal on the third licence for some 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will facilitate the efficient operation of administrative tribunals, authorities and persons by minimising the disruption caused by the making of applications under the Act in the course of proceedings. Clause 2 of the Bill provides that where an application for review is lodged in relation to a decision made by a tribunal, authority or persons during those proceedings and a review of that decision is available at the conclusion of those proceedings, and it is desirable to avoid interference with those proceedings, the Court shall refuse to grant the application unless the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for the application to be granted. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of concern is where overlapping remedies are available. For example, in Public Service discipline matters, a person is able to appeal to a Public Service disciplinary appeal body, which can review the whole case. The person can also test the lawfulness but not the merits of the decision under the Act. The Act at present gives the Court a general discretion to refuse an application where there is another remedy available. The Government considers that some strengthening of this provision is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not remove any existing rights of review, but seeks to rationalise those instances where there exist overlapping remedies by encouraging applicants, where review is provided for under some other law, to avail themselves of that alternative review before seeking review under the Act. Review by means other than by recourse to the Act is often a more cost and time effective means of obtaining proper review of an administrative decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 2 of the Bill therefore amends section 10 of the Act by inserting a new paragraph 10 (2) (c). That paragraph provides that where an application for review is lodged with the Federal Court under the Act, and provision is made by any law other than the Act under which the applicant is entitled to seek a review of that decision otherwise than by a court-the Court shall refuse to grant the application unless it is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for the Court to grant the application. This latter qualification recognises that there may be cases where the Court should hear the application, notwithstanding the existence of an alternative remedy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes express provision for the Court to refuse to grant an application for review, or to stay an application where it considers it inappropriate to grant the application or continue the proceedings. This gives statutory expression to the Court's present wide discretion to refuse relief and in addition makes it clear that this discretion extends to enabling the Court to stay proceedings in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is intended to ensure these powers conferred on the Court are exercised in such a way that costs and delays are kept to a minimum and to this end the Bill provides that these powers be exercised at the earliest appropriate stage in the course of proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the revenue implications of these proposals are not quantifiable, the measure should result in fewer hearings under the Act, and thus will have an impact on the Court's workload. By minimising the disruption to hearings it should also aid the efficiency of Tribunals. This will result in revenue savings. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1987 marks a major turning point in the administration of bankruptcy law in this country. The amendments proposed by the Bill have been developed in response to:</PARA>
<PARA> The Costigan Royal Commission finding that bankruptcy laws were being abused by fraudulently motivated insolvency claims;</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's commitment to sensible and considered law reform; and</PARA>
<PARA> The need for modern bankruptcy law to attack insolvency fraud while also providing appropriate protection for those whose bankruptcy is caused through misfortune. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (No. 2) 1986 amended the Bankruptcy Act in a number of ways, including significant changes to the administrative powers and functions of the official trustee. This Bill takes that process one step further by implementing Mr Costigan's recommendation that the trustee in bankruptcy should be equipped with wider powers of investigation in order to combat insolvency fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Act in three significant areas by:</PARA>
<PARA> extending the investigative powers of the trustee;</PARA>
<PARA> reforming Part X of the Act and introducing a prebankruptcy moratorium period; and</PARA>
<PARA> modernizing the Act in relation to spouses' claims and the retention of personal transport. </PARA>
<PARA>INSOLVENCY FRAUD</PARA>
<PARA> It has been recognized for many years that the duty of the trustee in bankruptcy is twofold: to realise the debtor's property and distribute the proceeds amongst creditors and also to protect the public interest by investigating a bankrupt's conduct with a view to upholding standards of commercial morality. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers which the Bankruptcy Act presently gives the trustee to facilitate the discharge of this duty have not kept pace with the wider use of modern commercial structures of companies and trusts. The trustee's ability to investigate companies and trusts associated with the bankrupt is severely circumscribed. For example, a bankrupt who is being examined on oath cannot be asked questions as to any actions he took in his capacity as managing director of a number of companies. Such limits on the trustee's powers have opened the way for unscrupulous debtors to defeat the aims of the bankruptcy law. By using a plethora of family trusts and companies, debtors have been able to organize their affairs so that they are apparently without any assets, while they continue to enjoy the use of property and assets which have the guise of being owned by a company or trust. Practices such as ``remuneration skimming'', which put assets of companies or trusts associated with a debtor beyond the trustee or creditors, fall into this category. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, provisions which presently limit which property of a bankrupt may be realized by the trustees exacerbate the problems. In broad terms, only that property in which the bankrupt had a beneficial interest at the date of the bankruptcy is available to the creditors. These provisions are ineffective to deal with ``remuneration skimming''. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes to deal with these problems by extending the trustee's powers to investigate the bankrupt's affairs and by enabling the trustee to recoup from companies, partnerships, trusts and other persons, assets which have been acquired by the personal efforts of the bankrupt. The Bill will introduce related concepts of ``associated entities'' and ``examinable affairs'' and a proposed division 4A of part VI which will enable a court to make orders in relation to the property of entities controlled by a bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> An associated entity will be one which the bankrupt is able to influence by virtue of close business or family relationships or which is under the control of the bankrupt. The examinable affairs of the bankrupt which the trustee will be able to investigate will be included to include the power to investigate the financial affairs of an entity associated with the bankrupt insofar as those financial affairs are relevant to the bankrupt's financial affairs. This will be in addition to the existing powers of a trustee to investigate the conduct, dealings and transactions of the bankrupt himself. Associated entities will be placed under an obligation to cooperate with the trustee by making books of account and financial records available where this will assist in shedding light on the bankrupt's financial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the powers of the trustee to investigate all the circumstances surrounding a bankruptcy is of itself not enough if at the end of the day no real benefit will flow through to the creditors. Accordingly the court is to be empowered, on application of the trustee, to transfer specified property of an entity to the trustee, or to order the payment to the trustee of a sum of money representing the amount by which the net value of the entity has been enhanced, where the trustee establishes:</PARA>
<PARA> that the entity acquired the property or the entity's asset position was enhanced during the ``examinable period'';</PARA>
<PARA> during the examinable period, the bankrupt supplied personal services to the entity in accordance with the bankrupt's direction, wishes or instructions; and</PARA>
<PARA> the entity made property available or would in the future, make property available for the use and enjoyment of the bankrupt in accordance with his or her wishes or instructions, as if the property actually belonged to the bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of provisions requiring the court to take account of the interests of third parties who have an interest in property of the entity, and creditors of the entity. The Government is confident that the new division 4A of part VI will be an effective weapon in stamping out insolvency fraud. </PARA>
<PARA>PREBANKRUPTCY MORATORIUM</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognizes that bankruptcy is and must be a remedy of last resort. While an insolvent person must be able to obtain relief from his or her creditors, people should be encouraged to explore the alternatives to bankruptcy which are available. Those alternatives include the three forms of voluntary arrangement available under part X-a Deed of Arrangement, a Deed of Assignment, or a composition-or by an informal repayment scheme. These alternatives all involve consultation between a debtor and creditors and accordingly they usually proceed in a more co-operative fashion than bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of a prebankruptcy moratorium period will allow a debtor to consider the alternatives to bankruptcy. Under a new division 2A of part IV, a debtor will be able to present to the registrar in bankruptcy a declaration of intention to present a debtor's petition. Once this declaration is accepted by the registrar, the debtor will be able to invoke a limited stay upon certain debt recovery processes for a maximum period of 7 days. The registrar will be obliged to direct the debtor's attention to the sources of advice and guidance with respect to the debtor's financial affairs, and to the procedures under the Bankruptcy Act for dealing with insolvency. </PARA>
<PARA>REFORM OF PART X</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Government is aware that there are flaws in Part X which have been exploited by a small number of unscrupulous trustees and solicitors in order to defraud the creditors. The Government has therefore moved quickly to include a group of amendments to Part X to minimise the facility for abuse of its procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has identified three particular problems with the procedures set out in Part X. First, creditors do not receive sufficient information about a debtors affairs before they accept arrangements under Part X. Secondly there are no provisions in the Act which ensure that previous dealings between a debtor, a particular creditor or creditors and the trustee are disclosed. Thirdly there is no effective supervision of Part X arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill addresses the first of these three problems by requiring a debtor to submit a statement of affairs at the commencement of the process, rather than at the first meeting of creditors. At present, under Part X a debtor may execute an authority to authorise a registered trustee to take control of their property or a solicitor to call a meeting of their creditors. This Bill will require this authority to be supported by a recently prepared statement of affairs which has been given to the trustee or solicitor. The trustee will be required to prepare a report on the debtors affairs and indicate in that report which of the alternative modes of administration-Deed of Assignment, Deed of Arrangement or Composition would be in the best interests of creditors. </PARA>
<PARA> The trustee will also be required to indicate whether or not the creditors should accept a Part X arrangement or require the debtor to present a bankruptcy petition. A registered trustee or solicitor will also be required to prepare a statement setting out the alternative special resolutions that may be passed by a meeting of creditors namely, that the debtor execute a deed of assignment or a deed of arrangement, that the creditors accept a composition or that the debtor present a debtor's petition within 7 days of the day on which the resolution is passed. The report by the controlling trustee and the statement outlining the alternative special resolutions which creditors may pass at the meeting are required to be circulated, with notice of the meeting by the controlling trustee or solicitor. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are completed by changes to the proxy provisions relating to voting at meetings under Part X. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the second problem of ensuring that prior dealings between debtors, creditors and trustees are fully disclosed, a new provision is to be inserted into the Act so that a resolution purporting to nominate or appoint a registered trustee to a particular trusteeship will be deemed not to have been duly passed unless the registered trustee has consented to the nomination and has made a declaration concerning his or her professional, business or personal relationship or connexion, if any, with the debtor or the creditor who proposed the resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> To overcome the third problem-the inadequacy of the supervisory power in relation to Part X arrangements-the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy is to be given the right to apply to the court for orders setting aside deeds and compositions. The Inspector-General will also be empowered to apply to the court for an order that a trustee make good any loss that is caused by a breach of duty by the trustee, and for orders cancelling or suspending the registration of the person as a trustee. Where the court makes an order cancelling the registration of the person as trustee, the bond into which the person entered as a condition of becoming registered will be able to be called in. In another significant change in this area, examinations of registered trustees will now be conducted before a registrar, rather than before a court. These changes will continue the reforms of administration of the Bankruptcy Act which are designed to free up judicial resources to enable them to be used in the resolution of more important disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>MODERNIZING THE ACT</PARA>
<PARA> Numerous other important reforms to modernize the Bankruptcy Act are introduced by this Bill. Section 111-`postponement of spouse's claims'-is to be repealed. In addition, the provision whereby certain property of the non-bankrupt spouse which had been `made available to or lent to' the now bankrupt spouse was expropriated and made available to the creditors will be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 116 (2) will be amended by including in the category of property not available to the trustee, a motor vehicle or other form of personal transport to the modest value of $2500. Typically, creditors get little or no benefit from the sale of motor vehicles and this action places considerable hardship on the bankrupt and his family. </PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY</PARA>
<PARA> The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill will introduce significant changes to the Bankruptcy Legislation which will greatly improve the administration of insolvencies in the future. The amendments will, on the one hand, ensure that trustees in bankruptcy can investigate sophisticated commercial arrangements which have used the bankruptcy laws to defraud creditors. On the other hand, in recognition that bankruptcy is not the most appropriate solution in all circumstances, the Bill also introduces procedures to encourage debtors to consider possible alternatives to bankruptcy in appropriate circumstances and introduces reforms to Part X to ensure that these alternative procedures can be of real benefit to both debtors and creditors. </PARA>
<PARA>FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by the Bill will not involve any additional financial impact upon Government expenditure. Following the restructuring of the official trustee to which I referred earlier, the resources necessary to discharge the wider investigatory powers conferred by these amendments will be available within the official Trustee Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to establish the Defence Housing Authority. This Bill is substantially the same as the Bill that was received from the House of Representatives and introduced into the Senate by the then Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Evans, on 30 April 1987. The earlier Bill lapsed with the dissolution of the last parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech, Senator Evans made it clear that the proposed legislation is the cornerstone of the government's strategy to provide adequate accommodation for members of the defence force. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the pressure of parliamentary time during this period of sittings, I do not propose to repeat the previous speech. However, in commending it to honourable members, I would like to emphasise the following points:</PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Housing Authority will implement the Government's obligation to ensure that members of the Defence Force are ad- equately housed;</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will operate with commercial freedom consistent with meeting the housing needs of the Defence Force;</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority, in charging the Department of Defence full commercial rents, will have a guaranteed level of income;</PARA>
<PARA> The level of rent paid by individual service tenants will, however, continue to be determined by the government as a condition of service;</PARA>
<PARA> Within overall Budget priorities, it is the Government's intention to have $750m committed to Defence Housing capital outlays over the next decade. To the extent that its income is insufficient, the Defence Housing Authority will be able to seek supplementary funding to achieve this objective;</PARA>
<PARA> There is a justifiable expectation in the Defence Community that the Authority will remedy long standing deficiencies in defence housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The financial impact of the Bill is set out in the accompanying explanatory memorandum. In summary, there will be an additional recurrent budget outlay of $39m-the difference between the $126m that the authority will charge the Commonwealth for rent and the $87m in present outlays that the authority will pay instead of the Commonwealth. In addition, the authority will retain revenue from the disposal of surplus housing. In 1986/87 this was about $5m. </PARA>
<PARA> The authority will use its profits for capital acquisition and improvements so demands for capital from the Budget ($65.8m in 1986/87) will be reduced. However, there will be supplementation from annual budgets to meet the government commitment of $750m. Over the next decade to upgrade the defence housing stock. </PARA>
<PARA> As the purpose of this Bill is to overcome one of the more serious difficulties facing members of the Defence Force and their families, I am confident that it will have support from both sides of the Senate. I commend the Bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I present the second reading on my private members Bill titled the ``Australia Card Referendum Act 1987'' designed to submit the ultimate decision on the Australia Card to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently there is an Act in existence to regulate referenda on proposed amendments of the Constitution. This is the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. I have followed the procedure laid down in this Act, and indeed incorporates that Act, with modifications, and applies it to the proposed Referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> I have provided for the Referendum to be decided by a majority of votes cast. I have not followed the special provision for amending the constitution where majorities in a Majority of States are also required. </PARA>
<PARA> This is because the legislation concerned is fundamentally a Commonwealth law which does not effect any changes to the Constitution or to the consequent legal rights or position of the States in our Federation. As a purely Commonwealth law it should be put to and decided upon by all the people in their capacity as Commonwealth electors, on a truely national basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the reasons why I have presented this Bill. Why the people must decide on the so-called Australia Card legislation, which could so gravely impact on their lives and liberties. </PARA>
<PARA>INVASION OF PRIVACY</PARA>
<PARA> Today, personal and confidential information is listed under many numbers-Credit Cards, Medicare Cards, Tax File and Social Security number. This multiplicity of unlinked and unmatched numbers is a protection which will be removed by the ID Card. After the Card is introduced one single number will be the key to all personal and confidential information. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, it will be obligatory for all individuals to provide this number to banks, employers, real estate agents, stock and station agents, produce merchants, share brokers and Medicare, Social Security and the Tax Office. Quite clearly, persons with illegal intent will have little difficulty obtaining other peoples numbers and, as the newspapers record every week, getting inside a computer, however sophisticated, is not difficult, all that is needed is the number. No one can guarantee the security of computer records. </PARA>
<PARA> You must give a prospective employer the same number which can access your medical records-a matter of great interest to employers in these days of workers compensation abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Your bank accounts will bear the same number as your accounts at the real estate agent or stock firm-and so on-and whilst I do not suggest that every employer or banker would choose to cross reference such vital information, it is certain that the opportunity to do so is greatly improved by this single numbering process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that the only information that is accessed by the card is the details of your birth, address and such. The legislation refers specifically to this ``register'' but by requiring production of the card to all the other instrumentalities I have mentioned it guarantees that your card number is the common factor in linking of this information for government purposes and their computers will be linked by telecom line; government departments are notorious for their leaks. </PARA>
<PARA> People may have nothing to hide but may have legitimate secrets they are entitled to keep. </PARA>
<PARA> The card will deny you any privacy. </PARA>
<PARA>INCONVENIENCE</PARA>
<PARA> If you have done nothing wrong and probably pay your tax through P.A.Y.E., why should you suffer the following inconvenience?</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Queuing to be numbered and photographed. $500 fines if you then lose the card in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Attending personally at the bank to validate your bank accounts with your ID number. The account will be frozen if not so validated by a certain date. There are 64 million accounts to be revalidated. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Sporting, social and service clubs will also be required to have a card number and the incumbent secretary or treasurer must carry the card in their name, meaning more queuing and paperwork every time you change office bearers.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. You must appear personally at the real estate agent and registrar of titles with the card to effect a sale of your home. So must the purchaser. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Father and son, or other individuals must exchange card numbers to conclude a family loan and report the transaction to the tax man. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Farmers and/or people dealing in shares will not buy and sell through agents without producing their card. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Keating, however, will not need one to buy or sell antiques. </PARA>
<PARA> You will not initiate most new business without presenting the card personally. This is an anti-business measure so it is no wonder that the Government is suppressing the business regulation review report on the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>THE CONSCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND THE COMMUNITY AS THE ENFORCERS</PARA>
<PARA> Employers, (this includes you employing a babysitter) face fines of $20,000 for simply failing to ask an employee for their ID card and/or reporting the number and wages to the tax commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Banks, real estate agents, stock brokers, stock and station agents, produce merchants, all other financial institutions, even people loaning money in the family, face similar fines for failing to record their client's card number and business transactions for transmission to the tax office-all these fines are multiplied by five if you are a company, this could be the local ``Golf Club Inc''. Yet by comparison, the fine for giving false information to get a card is only $5,000, and the penalties for improper disclosure are derisory. </PARA>
<PARA>THE COST IS HUGE</PARA>
<PARA> Even by the Government's estimates, (proved to be low in the past), the cost to achieve an up and running system is approximately $800 million. Two thousand public servants are required for general administration. No one has estimated the additional police, judges and gaol warders needed to enforce the penalties. Two billion dollars of tax payers' money is a more likely guess. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic rule in such matters is that if Government spends one dollar, the community cost is three dollars. The Government has received advice on this matter from its specially convened committee, the business review unit. The Government refuses to release this report. Clearly its findings regarding the community cost is embarrassing to Mr Hawke. The banking industry alone says the cost to validate bank accounts will exceed $60m, Westpac estimates of cost per account could mean a cost closer to $300m, and this cost will be passed on. Retailers will go through a period when it will be necessary to phone the bank each time a cheque is presented to them to ensure the account is operable and has been validated with an ID number. </PARA>
<PARA> Much business will be lost as people delay or discontinue transactions because its gets too complicated. </PARA>
<PARA>IT WILL NOT WORK</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's stated claim is that the card will wipe out tax evasion and welfare fraud. International experience is that the very reverse will apply. The more the card is accepted as a universal identifier, the easier it will be for criminals to use it as evidence of false identity. The private sector in particular will have no means of checking that a person is the rightful holder of a particular card. Photographs, even fingerprints can be of the forger, whilst other card details are of some other person. The Department of Social Security has already said it will not accept the card as sole evidence of identity and they will have computerised access to additional back-up evidence including a digitised photo recorded on computer. Dr Blewett says forged cards may be hard to detect. So what hope has a bank of identifying a false card used to open a bank account in your name by some criminal, who later closes the account and leaves you to explain the interest earned and the source of the original funds to the tax man. No wonder Costigan, the Australian Federal Police and Inspector Merv Beck call on us not to proceed with the card. Forging credit cards is a highly sophisticated, world wide industry and recent court cases in Western Australia show how students managed to forge cards suitable to withdraw money from other people's accounts through automatic bank tellers. Please remember, getting your number is as simple as asking for it, or if not, by requesting it of an employee of your employer, bank, real estate agent and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government further believes for instance, that genuine cheats will be so naive as to leave their false bank accounts in place once a card is necessary. Obviously, when confronted with legalising their accounts, they will withdraw the money and close the account. The card has no control over cash transactions unless of course the government requires the production of a card on every occasion of a cash purchase and if it is reasonable to accept the card for the reasons already stated, when is it reasonable to demand it be used for everything? Mr Hawke cannot commit future governments and his own promises have not been worth much in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's own written explanation (notes on Clauses 32 to 51) on clause 49 says although employers must demand to see the card, failure to produce it should not `prohibit' one getting a job. This is an open invitation to those, particularly in seasonal employment, to work under assumed names whilst retaining the dole under their correct identity. The only penalty will be a high tax rate which will be a cheap price to pay for keeping full-time social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> It all adds to tough times for honest Australians and easy street for the cheats in our society. This is directly opposite to what the Government pretends. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obscene to use the word `Australia' to give credibility to this national compulsory identity system; it is ridiculous to claim the Government has a mandate for the Card when a majority of electors in the last election voted for Parties clearly opposed to the Card. I now challenge them to let the people of Australia decide the issue</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have my second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's proposed national identification system, to be implemented via the Australia Card Bill, is one of the most far-reaching and significant proposals ever to come before this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Government first mooted the ID card proposal at the Tax Summit in 1985, the Australian Democrats warned that the suggestion involved very serious civil liberties aspects and that the efficacy of the proposal would need to be carefully examined. </PARA>
<PARA> So concerned were we, in fact, that later that year I negotiated with the Health Minister and the Opposition spokesperson to establish a joint Parliamentary Committee to enquire into the proposals and its alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event, a majority of the Committee, of which I was one and which included representatives of all political parties, recommended against the ID card and suggested the use of a high integrity tax-file number to address the undoubtedly serious problem of tax cheats and social security fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, the Government has arrogantly ignored not only the Committee's findings, but also the opinions of a wide range of experts who have expressed strong opposition to the card and the system. These opponents of the card include crime and tax evasion experts like Frank Costigan QC, computer experts, legal bodies including the Law Council of Australia, Councils for Civil Liberties throughout the country and both employer and union bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Deaf to this comprehensive body of opinion, the Government proceeded to introduce its deceptively-named Australia Card Bill into the Parliament where it has been defeated twice and then called a double dissolution using the Bill as a trigger. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the election, community concern about the implications of the ID card has mounted as more and more people have become aware of the contents of the Bill. I do not intend to detail here the very real dangers and immense cost of this proposal because that will be done later this week in this Chamber. Suffice to say that the scheme is unworkable, expensive and dangerous and it distracts attention from the task of finding real solutions to tax and social security fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> We have now reached the point where, after the Government has presented the Bill again and it is defeated in the Senate, a joint Sitting can be called. Since the Government's new majority exceeds the numbers against it in the Senate, it will be able to push the Bill through unamended. Certainly the opponents of the Bill in this Chamber will combine to ensure that the Bill is properly examined by a Committee, but the Government's actions so far suggest that they would ignore any argument or finding, no matter how compelling. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one opinion, however, that the Government cannot ignore-the voice of the Australian people. The Government has claimed, of course, that it has a mandate to proceed with the ID card by virtue of the Australia Card Bill being the trigger for the double dissolution. Any objective examination of the issues which featured in the election campaign would expose this claim as nonsense. To suggest that the election result can be interpreted as support for the identification system and card is absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if the Government is so confident that it has the support of the Australian people on the ID card issue, it will have no difficulty in supporting this Bill. On a matter as important as a national identification system, far more important than many other matters that have gone to referenda, a referendum is the only answer. The Australian people are entitled to express their view about this proposal and its implications for the future. Consistent with their general support for citizens' initiative referenda, the Australian Democrats want this matter to be decided by those who will be most affected by its implementation-Australian citizens. It is difficult to see how any party could argue with that approach and I am confident this Chamber will support the Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition sees no reason either in logic or in ethics to accept the Government's motion. The only reason that the Government has moved this motion is one of cynical political gain. That is the reason why yesterday, on behalf of the Opposition, I gave notice of a motion which runs in effect totally counter to the Government's motion, to enable the system of election, in order, of senators that was agreed to by the Senate in 1983 to come into effect at the first opportunity that it could be put to the test, that is, today. As my motion will not be debated because of Senate procedures, I move the following amendment to the Government's motion to bring to the Senate's attention the motion of which I gave notice yesterday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave out paragraph (2), insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ``(2) The six Senators for each State whose order of election was determined in a re-count of ballot papers pursuant to section 282 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and certified by the Australian Electoral Officer for that State shall be Senators of the second class, that is, the long-term Senators, and the remaining six Senators for that State shall be Senators of the first class, that is, the short-term Senators.''. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 13 of the Constitution provides that we senators shall decide who will serve in the long term and who will serve in the short term Senate positions in the event of a double dissolution. Until now the practice for deciding who will be long or short terms senators has been the one that the Government now proposes; that is, that the method of counting the votes at a Federal election when there is a double dissolution should determine the order of classification into long and short term senators. That system came into operation many years ago and it had its first use in the days of block voting for the Senate. When the Senate moved to proportional representation in 1949, that had the effect of changing the importance of the votes cast for the first elected for each party. The absurd situation which the old practice throws up is one to which the Senate's mind was addressed in 1983 after very lengthy, serious and important deliberation by the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. One of the things that that Committee threw up was the absurdity of the situation where simply the election of senators, after a double dissolution, on the basis of the order determined on the smaller quota for senators which double dissolutions provide, can lead to the situation where, for example, a minority party senator with less than 8 per cent of the vote-in fact with 7.8 per cent of the vote-could get a long term, a six year term, whereas a major party that may have polled 45 per cent of the vote would still end up with only two long term senators. That is a situation that all parties in this chamber-certainly all major parties and I think the minor parties as well-agree was absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform looked at the matter it agreed that the old practice resulted in confusion, that it was the subject of political manoeuvrings and that it did in fact encourage the promotion of double dissolutions. The Joint Select Committee therefore recommended that the past practice be changed by the insertion in the Commonwealth Electoral Act of a new clause which would enable senators to be ordered in terms or short and long term on the basis of the election having been a half Senate election rather than a double dissolution election. The implication, of course, is the very significant effect that that has on the quota required for any senator to be elected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Select Committee made two recommendations. It recommended first of all that following a double dissolution election the Australian Electoral Commission conduct, as I said, a second count of Senate votes using the half Senate quota in order to establish the order of election to the Senate and therefore, very importantly, the terms of election. The Committee also recommended that the practice of ranking senators in accordance with their relative success at an election be submitted to electors at a referendum for incorporation in the Constitution by way of amendment so that the issue is placed beyond doubt and removed from the political arena. It is very important to note that those two recommendations were not dependent upon one another. They are two separate recommendations. The first of those recommendations was enshrined in the Commonwealth Electoral Act in November-December 1983. The second recommendation, concerning an amendment to the Constitution, has not yet been adopted. However, that in no way alters or lessens the significance of the recommendation which flowed through and is now law in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the first occasion on which the amendment made in 1983 to the Commonwealth Electoral Act has been put to the test. This is the first time since 1983 that there has been a double dissolution election. I believe that what we are looking at today is a very important issue because we as a Senate are being asked to put to the test, to adopt or not to adopt in usage, the unanimous recommendation of a joint select committee of this Parliament which was agreed to by this Senate less than four years ago without any amendment or dissension. It was a very sensible and desirable amendment. As I said, all parties agreed to the amendment. So, the first question that the Government needs to answer in relation to this motion is why is it going back on the decision that this Senate made in 1983. I repeat, no party formally disagreed with the amendment in 1983. There was no vote on it. As I understand it, there was no reservation by any member of the Joint Select Committee to the proposal concerning the new method of determining ordering in Senate elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin, the Democrat senator on that Committee, made no dissenting report and, indeed, when the matter came up for debate in the Committee of the Whole, Senator Macklin went to great pains to make the clause, which is now section 282 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, more clear, precise and accurate than the Government had proposed in its amendment to the Bill. Indeed, Senator Macklin's amendment was accepted by the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's motion is a cynical and unprincipled one. The Senate agreed to use this new system--</PARA>

<PARA> It is unusual for me ever to quote Senator Vigor, who was in this chamber until recently and who I noticed came back yesterday. It was a great pleasure to see him in the gallery yesterday. Just prior to his leaving the Senate, Senator Vigor made a very important contribution by telling the people of Australia a little bit about the change that has taken place over recent years in the situation of the Australian Democrats. On 4 June, in what was almost his final speech in this place, Senator Vigor drew attention to the early days of the Australian Democrats and their present position. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1987-88.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the budget proposals of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Budget for 1987-88 is in balance. </PARA>
<PARA> The deficit has been cut to just on zero, a mere $27 million. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, having inherited a prospective budget deficit of almost $10,000 million, the largest in the Nation's history, has in the space of just 5 budgets wiped that dismal legacy out. </PARA>
<PARA> What is more, this monumental achievement has been accomplished while keeping to our election commitments not to increase taxes and not to make major additional spending cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> Relative to the size of the economy, tax revenue is down on last year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the same basis, government spending is down two percentage points compared with the level confronting us in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget incorporates nonetheless significant new initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> We have provided $250 million to meet our election commitment to a Family Allowance Supplement for low income families. </PARA>
<PARA> We have financed the massive $4,500 million cost of the personal income tax cuts introduced in December last year and July this year. </PARA>
<PARA> We have introduced a new company tax system which eliminates the double taxation of dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> These achievements have been made possible while simultaneously balancing the Budget by the most wide ranging and detailed review of government spending ever carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget incorporates a 2.4 per cent real reduction in Commonwealth spending, the biggest cut in the 35 years for which comparable records are available. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget also lays the foundations for sound budgets over the life of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The decisions which have cut outlays by $3,500 million this year will produce the same reductions next year. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the savings are on-going. </PARA>
<PARA>THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC STRATEGY</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, this fundamental shift down in the Commonwealth budget is making a crucial contribution to the process of adjustment that Australia has been undergoing since the collapse in our export prices in 1985-86. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike almost any other economy in similar circumstances, the Australian economy has not been driven into recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy response has been innovative, strong, and most of all, right. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the enormity of the trade difficulties we have faced, our economic strategy is now bearing fruit. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians have responded earnestly by lifting the national export effort and successfully seeking out new markets. </PARA>
<PARA> No less than half of Australia's export growth last year came from the sale of manufactured goods-a remarkable achievement given the parlous state of manufacturing only 4 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also developing services such as tourism into major earners of foreign exchange. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time we have cut imports by making locally more of the goods we used to buy from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together, increased exports and reduced imports accounted for all of Australia's economic growth last year. </PARA>
<PARA> One hundred and forty thousand new jobs were created. </PARA>
<PARA> Our trading bill was cut by $1,000 million from 6 per cent of Gross Domestic Product to 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In this coming year we forecast that it will decline further to 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> These achievements are extremely gratifying. </PARA>
<PARA> They have exceeded the expectations of almost everybody. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, as successful as we have been, the magnitude of our trading problem is such that we still have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The big trade deficits since the early 1980s have built up a substantial foreign debt burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Our external deficit, although falling, remains too high. </PARA>
<PARA> To reduce permanently our debt burden we must go further in reducing our dependence on overseas savings by lifting the level of Australian savings. </PARA>
<PARA> This is why we have acted to cut the demands of all levels of government on savings, releasing them for private investment to enhance our trade performance. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is only part of the story. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to sell more abroad-and if our manufacturers are to win a greater share of the domestic market-we must ensure that the goods we produce are priced competitively. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, we must make sure that labour costs in Australia are competitive with those of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian community has shown enormous maturity and commonsense in responding to the trade crisis by exercising wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> This has helped sustain the new-found competitiveness of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly it has ensured that the difficult international trading conditions have not led to a surge in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> This is being reinforced by the two tier wage system which for the first time in our history is requiring efficiency and productivity improvements at an industry and enterprise level as offsets for wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA> In the public sector the Commonwealth is insisting that any second tier wage increase granted to its own employees be offset by genuine productivity and efficiency gains. </PARA>
<PARA>EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, if Australia is to compete successfully in the international market place we must also raise our educational standards. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now redirecting our spending so that it better conforms with Australia's economic priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In May I announced a major restructuring of unemployment benefits and study allowances which greatly increases the incentives for our young people to stay in the education and training system rather than moving onto welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> The centrepiece of those reforms was the abolition of unemployment benefits for 16 and 17 year olds and the substitution of a modest job search allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> This restructuring of study allowances has been carried further in the Budget by changes to the student assistance schemes for Aboriginal children, isolated children and the children of veterans, bringing them more into line with mainstream income support programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also recognises that if we are to encourage young people to stay in the education system, we must provide more student places. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently we have approved an extra 5,800 higher education places for young school leavers in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Our reforms in education and training have also been geared to getting better value for money. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1988 funds for new TAFE capital works will be allocated on the basis of competitive bidding by States and individual colleges, with priority being given to projects in economically important areas, such as computing studies and hospitality, and areas which involve joint funding with industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding for the Australian Traineeship System-which provides young people entering the workforce with a mixture of on-the-job and formal training-is to increase from $14 million to $45 million. </PARA>
<PARA> This will provide places for 13,000 new trainees. </PARA>
<PARA> At a cost of $31 million, a new program to provide short-term vocational training opportunities for unemployed young people will be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, will issue tonight a comprehensive paper explaining the Government's skills formation strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other measures, $15 million will be provided in 1987-88 and $28 million in a full year to implement a National Policy on Languages. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding for the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy will be increased by $26 million in 1987-88 and by $49 million in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA>FAMILY ASSISTANCE PACKAGE</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the Hawke Government has always believed that only those in genuine need should be entitled to social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA> We have systematically implemented measures to exclude welfare cheats from the system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the May Statement I described a range of further initiatives to crack down on fraud and abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Already these are proving very successful. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these measures we will save more than $100 million in unemployment benefit payments in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> We have consistently held that people who can readily support themselves should do so, rather than putting their hand out to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> But we have not shirked the Australian Labor Party's historical commitment to assist the most needy in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget further strengthens that commitment by implementing a landmark social reform in the shape of the Family Assistance Package. </PARA>
<PARA> From Christmas this year this package will provide help to more than half a million families in need. </PARA>
<PARA> More than one million children will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to an income test, the new scheme will provide a Family Allowance Supplement of $22 per week per child. </PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the higher costs associated with teenage children, the payment for each child aged 13, 14, or 15 will be $28 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we will provide low income families renting privately with an extra allowance of up to $15 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> This means, for example, that families with income up to $324 per week who rent privately and have three children, two aged under 13 and one 14, will receive a supplement of $87 per week free of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an increase of up to $69 per week on what they would have received under the old Family Income Supplement. </PARA>
<PARA> The most any of these families would have received under the discredited election tax policy of the Liberal and National Parties would have been $20.46. </PARA>
<PARA> This new Family Allowance Supplement is additional to the existing Family Allowance and will be paid directly to the primary carer of the children, generally the mother. </PARA>
<PARA> It is structured so that it will increase the incentive for unemployed people to find work and will provide a positive inducement to avoid welfare dependency. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of assisting low income families in genuine need, this new Family Allowance Supplement ranks with any initiative introduced by any Australian government in any period. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, this is a landmark change in social policy and a source of much pride to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA>As promised in the election campaign, the Government will provide $25 million to the States this year and next to reduce waiting lists in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure of $20 million will be provided for prevention and education measures to combat the spread of AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA> Following a review of requirements, repatriation hospital staff numbers are to be increased by 337. </PARA>
<PARA>STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister recently announced a major restructuring of Commonwealth departments. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes are estimated to produce savings of $107 million in a full year and to cut 3,100 off staffing levels by 1988-89</PARA>
<PARA>ASSET SALES</PARA>
<PARA>In May the Government announced a program of asset sales estimated to yield about $1,000 million in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to maintain maximum flexibility in aviation policy, and in the light of our election commitment to deregulate the industry, the Government has decided not to proceed with the sale of its international airport terminals. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding this change, however, we still expect the other elements of the program of asset sales announced in May to raise at least $1,000 million in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1988-89 financial year we will be selling the loans portfolio of the Defence Service Homes Corporation and other defence assets, producing savings of around another $1,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as generating important efficiency gains, this will add a recurrent quality to the budgetary numbers as far as the disposal program is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>REVENUE</PARA>
<PARA>Turning to the revenue side, I repeat that we have adhered to our election commitment not to increase taxes or introduce new taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been able to cut spending and taxes at the same time partly because we are now reaping the benefits of earlier actions to restore integrity to the tax system and to upgrade its administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax and related measures like many things that are new, were controversial at inception, but are now fulfilling their proper structural function by massively broadening the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> It is largely because of these measures that despite legislated lower tax rates and subdued economic growth, 1986-87 tax collections came in $1 billion above budget-time estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are they yielding the revenue but they have made the system much fairer than it has ever been. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is firmly committed to continuing its efforts to make the tax and welfare systems decent and secure, and consequently we will proceed with vigour to implement the Australia Card national identification system. </PARA>
<PARA> This system will return up to $1,000 million a year in revenue that is presently being evaded or defrauded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And it will be done, despite the efforts of that unholy coalition of the ratbag right and the ratbag left. To further reinforce our anti-avoidance measures, this Budget will fund the Tax Office to establish special audit teams of highly qualified and experienced officers to mount more effective and detailed scrutinies of potential tax avoidance activities, particularly in the corporate sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As most Australians are aware, some people in this country have accumulated substantial wealth because of booming stock-market and property values. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the old tax system much of those profits would have gone tax-free-and I interpolate that under the tax system proposed by the Opposition two months ago, they would also have gone tax-free. That is no longer the case. </PARA>
<PARA> We have made the system fairer and those who have previously benefited from tax-free capital profits are now making a substantial contribution towards the costs of government services like schools, roads, social security, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of this new, fair tax has been a fundamental factor in the Government's review of tax deductions for investors in rental property. </PARA>
<PARA> Since we have restored the integrity of the tax system by subjecting capital gains to tax, we are now in a position to permit the restoration of deductions against taxable income without exposing the revenue to the threat which existed before July 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The full interest costs of owning and maintaining rental property will now be deductible against income from any source. </PARA>
<PARA> In the recent past the Government has canvassed in detail the principle of allowing tax deductions for interest costs in the case of both rural investments and equity investments. </PARA>
<PARA> In both cases we decided in favour of allowing offsetting deductions. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight's decision restores the symmetry between investment in property and other assets such as shares or farms. </PARA>
<PARA> It will enhance the attractiveness of in- vestment in both commercial and residential rental property and have a beneficial effect on the supply of residential accommodation in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of this decision the 4 per cent depreciation allowance for both residential and non-residential construction is to be reduced to 2 1/2 per cent for new properties. </PARA>
<PARA> This will moderate the cost of these concessions, which has been growing at an annual rate of $55 million, while still representing a substantial concession to construction activity. </PARA>
<PARA>NEW POLICY DIRECTIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Following introduction of the Government's revolutionary full imputation system for company tax-to remove the double tax on dividends-the Government has now instituted a complementary review within the Treasury of the remaining structure of the business taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA> The overriding objective of this review is to identify options for financing reductions in the company tax rate through sensible broadening of the company income tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> This is in line with similar recent reforms in a number of major Western economies, including the United States and Britain. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome of that review will be announced either in or before the next Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In the coming term the Government will be concentrating its energies on the quest for efficiency throughout the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already foreshadowed the removal of outdated regulatory arrangements in the crude oil industry and the aviation sector. </PARA>
<PARA> More reforms of this nature will follow as we review and remove impediments to doing things better in different sectors of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>FUTURE PROSPECTS</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's economic performance will continue to be constrained until we overcome the fundamental problem of our trade imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA> Even so, in the coming year Australia's economic growth rate is estimated to increase modestly from 2 per cent last financial year to 2 3/4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This should generate over 100,000 new jobs-meaning that by the end of our Bicentennial year one million new jobs will have been created since the Hawke Government first won office. </PARA>
<PARA> Continued buoyancy of employment, and the tax cuts, will lift household purchasing power from last year's low. </PARA>
<PARA> But the cuts we have made to government spending will restrain total domestic demand and avoid any spillover into unsustainable import pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that we have eliminated the budget deficit we will be repaying $1,000 million of Commonwealth overseas debt this year and the same amount of domestic bonds. </PARA>
<PARA> No other Commonwealth government in more than 50 years has made repayments of both external and domestic debt in the same year. </PARA>
<PARA> This year we have seen significant falls in interest rates, both for businesses and for home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> The withdrawal of the Commonwealth Government as a net borrower this year will further reduce pressures on financial markets and help to sustain those lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> While fiscal policy is now carrying more of the burden of policy, monetary policy will continue to play its proper role in containing domestic demand and cost and price pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> Lower interest rates and an improving economic climate should contribute to a lift in business investment of at least 4 per cent in real terms and much more than that in the areas taking advantage of new export and import competing opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore expect that Australia will make further substantial progress in reducing the current account deficit in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> It should fall to around $11 1/2 billion, 4 percent of Gross Domestic Product. </PARA>
<PARA> With the worst of the inflationary impact of the depreciation of the dollar behind us, and wage restraint under the Accord, inflation is expected to fall from over 9 per cent last year to around 6 per cent by the middle of 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, Mr President, I have described tonight how Australia is successfully responding to the most adverse external economic difficulty we have faced since the Great Depression nearly 60 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We could have reacted to this trade deterioration by pushing all the economic policy levers into reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> That has been tried in the past, both here and in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> And where it has been tried it has not produced the quick results hoped for and it has resulted in sharply higher long-term levels of unemployment, declining living standards and destructive social conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA> We have rejected that path and the events of the last 18 months have shown that we were right. </PARA>
<PARA> We have turned the corner and the big gaps in the trade accounts have begun to close. </PARA>
<PARA> Essential to our success to date has been cutting the size of government and pulling down the Budget deficit from the near $10,000 million that we inherited from Mr Fraser and Mr Howard to just on zero. </PARA>
