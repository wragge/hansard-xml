I have learnt that there are men of high capacity in the Senate, although that opinion may not be shared by some people outside this chamber. There has been a tendency to decry the work of this Parliament, but my experience of it is that both in this chamber and in the House of Representatives' there are men of high calibre, whose great desire is to do all they can in the interests of their country. I trust that in future we shall do much to enhance the status of this Parliament. It lies within the power of honorable senators to place this branch of the legislature on even a higher plane than that on which it rests to-day. By concentrating our attention on matters of national importance and discussing them intelligently in this chamber we can raise the status and increase the usefulness of the Senate. For certain constitutional reasons, -members of the Senate have more time at their disposal than members of the House of Representatives for the consideration of urgent national problems, and I am looking forward to the Senate becoming of even greater importance than at present.

                    <para>In the South- West Pacific, United States troops in the Solomons, and Australian and United States troops in New Guinea, are relentlessly forcing the enemy out of his forward bases. With each advance, the range of our air attack becomes more extensive, and the enemy's rearward bases more vulnerable. The overwhelming air assault on the enemy's base at Wewak and the landing of both air-borne and sea-borne forces near Lae have again emphasized the predominance of our air and sea power. The achievements of our land forces have demonstrated that the arms of the United Nations have established a definite superiority over the enemy from whom the initiative has been wrested. </para>

                    <para>The capture of Lae by Allied forces on 16th September, following so closely on the successes of Allied arms at Salamaua and in the Solomon Islands, marks another notable stage in the war in the Pacific. The gallant members of the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces and their heroic comrades in the American forces have again demonstrated their superiority over a stubborn foe and the thanks and admiration of the people of Australia go out to the commanders and to the officers and men of the Australian and American forces of all arms for these magnificent victories. </para>

                    <para>In the European theatre, the unconditional surrender of Italy has deprived the Axis of some 65 Italian divisions, many of which were employed as garrisons for the occupied territories, and will have to be replaced by German troops. It has also transformed the naval position in the Mediterranean and this will undoubtedly have its effect on the Pacific theatre. In due course, we may expect that Allied aircraft operating from airfields in Italy will be able to attack the dispersed industries which Germany has so laboriously transferred from Western Germany to regions believed to be less vulnerable. At the same time, the occupation of the Italian mainland will expose the flanks of the Axis positions in the Balkans. It is clear, however, that Germany does not intend to relinquish Italy without a struggle. </para>

They have also compelled Germany to weaken the air forces on the Russian front in an endeavour to cope with the British and American raids from the west. The raids are imposing a heavy strain on the German civilian defence organization and are undermining German morale on the' home front. </para>

                    <para>The outbreak of the war with Japan had a far-reaching effect on the Australian national economy. The call-up of man-power for the mobilization of the Army and the intensification of production of munitions and other Service needs caused a diversion of man-power and productive resources from nonessential or less pressing purposes. In short, Australia's capacity in the last resort to defend itself against invasion became paramount over every other consideration. </para>

                        <para>. - -The news of the death, on the 4th July last, of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honorable James Cunningham was, I am sure, received by all honorable senators with deep grief. The community is the poorer for the passing of one whose sterling  personal qualities and kindly nature gained the esteem of .all who were associated with him, .and, in particular, those present here to-day. His public service extended over many years. In the political sphere, it commenced with his -election for North East Province to the Legislative Council of Western Australia .at the by-election held in July, 1916. He was defeated .at the general elections held in 19.22., but, in January, 1923, be was elected at the by-election for Kalgoorlie, which seat he held until he was defeated at the .general elections in 1936. During the latter period he served as Honorary Minister from the 16th April, 1924, to the 15th December, 1927, and from that date to the 23rd April, 1930, a? Minister for Goldfields and Agricultural Water Supplies. He was elected to the Senate as ;a representative of Western Australia at the general elections .held on the 23rd October, 1937., taking his seat as from that date. He was a Temporary Chairman of Committees from December, 1937 to August 1940. He was Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from the 10th September, 194Q, to the 1st July, 1941, on which date he was appointed to the high office of President  of  the Senate, which bc held until his death. </para>

                    <para>In Western Australia, -James  Cunning- ham,  first as "trade union organizer, and later as a Minister of the 'Crown, did his best for workers, especially die mining community which has played such an important part in the development of Western Australia. As President of the Senate, he performed the functions of that important office with dignity and courtesy, and maintained the high standards set by his predecessors. As a tribute to the services he rendered to the Commonwealth and to the State of Western Australia, the deceased gentleman was accorded a State funeral.

During his term of office he endeared himself to all members of the Senate. James Cunningham was a man of very great courage, character, and common sense. I, as Leader of the Opposition, and, I am sure, all honorable senators, appreciated the manner in which he carried out the duties of his high office. We also appreciated his keen regard for the constitutional and traditional rights of the Senate. Every honorable senator feels .the deepest sympathy with our late colleague's widow am i children, whom most of us have had the opportunity to meet. </para>

                            <para>- The members of the Australian Country party in the Senate desire to associate themselves with the motion. The late Honorable James Cunningham endeared himself to nil with whom he came in contact. He impressed honorable senators by the absolute fairness with which he carried out the duties of his  high  office of  President,  of the Senate. During his life he had many ups and downs and in his early career as a miner and as a farmer he received many hard knocks. That experience imbued him with a spirit of tolerance which was evidenced in his unfailing willingness to help those who found themselves in less fortunate circumstances than himself. Australia can ill spare men of his honesty of purpose. We regret that the country has been deprived of his services. In his public career he was a member of both Houses of the Parliament of Western Australia and in the Commonwealth sphere held the high office of  President  of the Senate. We extend to his widow and family our deepest sympathy in their bereavement. </para>

                        <para>The passing of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham</inline> is a distinct loss to the Labour movement. He was associated with the industrial side- of the movement, occupying executive positions in his union, which proved a training ground for his future career in politics. " Jim " Cunningham was one of the most likeable men I have met in politics. He made friends wherever he went, and he never lost any of them. He proved himself to be an extremely capable administrator during the years he held office as a Minister of the Crown in Western Australia. He also filled the office of  President  of the Senate with distinction during a particularly difficult period. However, he will be best remembered as a generous and considerate companion. He never forgot the men who sent him to represent them in Parliament. The welfare of the workers, particularly the miners, of whose difficulties and needs he had first-hand experience, was his constant concern. He earned a wide popularity in the Labour movement throughout the Commonwealth, and he was a fluent  speaker.  As a colleague of his in ' the State Parliament of Western Australia, I learnt a great deal from him, and had the greatest respect for his capacity and administrative ability. He served Western Australia well in the Parliament of that State and was equally successful when he entered the Commonwealth Parliament, as was proved by his election to the office of  President  of the Senate, which is the highest position the Senate has to offer. The State of Western Australia will be the poorer by the passing of such an estimable citizen. My deepest sympathy goes out to his widow and children in their bereavement. </para>

                            <para>- During a somewhat lengthy term of service in the Senate, I have served under seven presidents. It is a tribute to our parliamentary system, patterned as it is on our judicial system, that, although the office of  President  rests very often upon the fluctuations of party fortunes in the political arena, yet when men have been called to undertake the duties of that high office they have discharged them in every case, during my period of service in this chamber at any rate, with an imparti ality worthy of the head of the highest tribunal in the land. In that respect no  president  stood out more than did the late lamented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> Cunningham. He brought to bear upon the interpretation of the Standing Orders a sturdy measure of common sense, without which parliamentary government would be difficult. He was impartial in the highest degree. He was steadfast in upholding the rights  of  the Senate, realizing that as its president he occupied one of the foremost positions in the land. He maintained the best traditions of that high office, and  his  name will go down not only amongst  honorable  senators but also in the outside world as that of a man who did his duty. None of us can expect more to be said  of  us than that when our time comes to  pass  away. I join most feelingly in the tributes that have been paid, to his memory by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(.Senator McLeay)</inline> and other honorable senators, and in the expresions of regret which they have voiced. </para>

Idaresay that Ican possibly claim to have known the late SenatorCunningham as long as any other honorable senator in this chamber, and I have had many occasions to realize the value of his industrial and political activities. The outstanding feature of his public life was that politically and industrially he always rang true to the working class. To that extent, at least,his name and has memory will be evergreen in the minds of those who knew him in the State whence he came.  His  political record,both State and Commonwealth, washighly honorable, and manyworkers have had occasion to bless him for the efforts that he made ontheirbehalf. In fact, many in this country regarded him more as a friend and a companion than as a senator. He was honest, and he was always true to his trust. I do not think that any greater tributethan that could be paid to the memory of any man.  His  attainment of the high honour of becoming  President  of this chamber is something which the people of Western Australia will always remember. I desire that my condolences be extended to his widow and family. </para>
