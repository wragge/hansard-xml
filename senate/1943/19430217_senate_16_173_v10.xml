                        <para> - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - For some years past, the United States of America has been according Australia most-favoured-foreign-nation treatment on Australian goods imported into America, but Australia has not, up to the present, reciprocated. Whilst Australia had only a two-column tariff and the general tariff applied to goods from all foreign countries, it might be fairly claimed by Australia that all foreign countries were receiving most-favoured-foreign-nation treatment. But, upon the re-institution of a three-column tariff in the Australian tariff, certain intermediate tariff rates were applied to goods from certain foreign countries, including countries which are now our principal European enemies, whilst goods from America remained on the general tariff, which is higher than the intermediate tariff. In present circumstances, trading with enemy countries or enemyoccupied countries is prohibited. After the Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> returned from his mission abroad last year, he represented to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> that, having regard to the great material assistance received by Australia from the United States of America during a most critical period in our history, it would be right for the Commonwealth to take the initiative so as to remove the existing anomaly. Therefore, without any formal request from the United States of America, the Commonwealth Government lias decided that the time has now arrived to remove the anomaly. Most-favoured-foreign-nation treatment has been accorded to most foreign countries, including our European enemies and enemy-occupied countries, and it is wrong that our principal ally should remain on what might fairly be termed the punitive tariff, i.e., the general tariff. The Government has therefore decided to issue proclamations which, in effect, accord to the United States of America most-favoured-foreign-nation treatment. These proclamations will be issued forthwith and thereby place good? coming from our ally, the United States of America, on the most-favoured tariff accorded to foreign goods. </para>

Is he aware that it is stated that in a period of three months £155,000 was spent by the Australian Comforts Fund in the purchase of tobacco and cigarettes for free issue to Australian fighting men, and that of that sum £115,000 represented excise duty? In view of the fact that the funds of the Australian Comforts Fund are subscribed by the public, and that the cigarettes are issued free to members of the services, will the Minister give further consideration to remitting the excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco issued, free to troops in Australia as is now the case in respect of men serving on overseas fronts. </para>

                            <para>- I have read the report referred to. It is true that the Prime Minister was asked to receive a deputation on a matter which had already Deen decided by myself and subsequently by the full Cabinet. When the request was made I again conferred with the Prime Minister, when I pointed out that the matter had been discussed at length by the full Cabinet and that a considerable sum of money was involved. I recommended that the subject should not be reopened. Australian troops serving abroad are given concessions in that cigarettes and tobacco are issued to them free of excise duty on the same basis as applies to American soldiers in Australia. The concession was originally granted to the Australian Comforts Fund in respect of men at the operational station at Darwin. At that time it was suggested that the  amount  involved would be merely nominal, but before long the Government was inundatedwith applications for a similar concession to be granted to other excellent organizations. The Australian Comforts Fund is not the only organization concerned in this matter. In view of the difficulties of finance and the fact that the same treatment is given to our troops as is given to those of our allies when serving in their own country, the decision was not altered. Should the honorable senator desire it, I shall supply a full statement on the subject. </para>

                            has objected to the restrictive provisions of subregulation 4 of regulation 17 with regard to the time in which claims for compensation may be lodged. I point out that growers have been able to lodge such claims since the commencement of the acquisition scheme in 1940. The subregulation referred to gives the Minister discretionary power to accept a claim, although it may not have been received within the time prescribed.

It is proposed to withdraw sub-regulation 4 and to insert the following: - </para>

As regards the present and future seasons, application should be made before the end of July in each year. In the interests of administration it is very desirable that some time limit be fixed within which applications should be made. At the commencement, of the season growers are aware of the advances which will be made by the Apple and Pear Marketing Board on their fruit, and well before the end of July their crop will have been delivered and they will be in a position to determine whether they propose to claim for any further payments. If they wish to do so a formal claim can, therefore, be lodged without inconvenience before the end of July. In view of the assurance that action is being taken to meet the objections raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>

                            <para>- You, sir, will remember a wonderful occasion some months ago when members of both Houses of this Parliament took part in an historical gathering to welcome a splendid man, General Douglas MacArthur. None of us, I think, can ever forget how the Prime Minister, on behalf of Australia, warmly, cordially and eloquently welcomed the General, who, in a most stirring response, gave us the soldier's pledge. He pledged to the uttermost the blood and treasure of the country that he represents. It is just as well that we should look at the actual facts regarding General Douglas MacArthur's directive. He was, as the Commander-in-Chief of the South-West Pacific Area, given a directive issued by PresidentRoosevelt and agreed to by the Governments of Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands East Indies and the United States of America. It specifies the objectives which his operations will be designed to accomplish. The first phase of the campaign in the South-West Pacific Area, which ended with the recent destruction of the Japanese army in Papua, was directed to ensuring the security of Australia as a base by removing the immediate threat of invasion to the eastern parts of Australia. The sphere of land operations, with the exception of small Australian military force units in Timor and Dutch New Guinea, has, within the meaning of the Defence Act, been on Australian territory. The defence of Australia is not confined to its territorial limits. Provided that adequate forces are available, that can best be secured by denying to the enemy that outer screen of islands from which attacks can be launched upon the mainland. The occupation of those outposts also provides points of vantage from which offensive action can ultimately he developed. At present, by reason of the holding strategy in the Pacific, the strength of the allied forces, and the superior strategic position of the enemy in the archipelagoes of the Pacific where there are air-fields for land-based aircraft, we are still fighting a defensive war. With the passage of this measure, the whole of the Australian forces, naval, land and air, will be available to the Commander-in-Chief for employment in the South-Western Pacific Zone as defined in the measure. </para>

                    </continue><para>I should like to deal briefly with the construction of the Australian Army, because in the disposition of our effective fighting strength we should not attempt to do things which are utterly beyond us. It may be just as well to take stock of the forces at our disposal. First, there are four Australian Imperial Force divisions, three of which are in Australia, and the other in the Middle East. In addition, we have a considerable Militia force, the exact strength of which I do not propose to state, for reasons which will be appreciated by every honorable senator. I say without any hesitation that Australia has loyally, completely, and thoroughly played its part in the war effort of the United Nations. There is no need to waste time either reaffirming or disputing that statement. The contract that we undertook - when I say " we ", I do not mean this Government, but the Australian people - was that we would stand with the British Commonwealth of Nations and our other allies comprising the United Nations, in the face of any eventuality. "When Italy entered the war we sent troops to Great Britain to help meet a possible invasion. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Although I have no intention of taking any more than passing notice of interjections by honorable senators opposite, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> I may say this : I am of opinion that the measure which we are called upon to debate to-day is of first importance. It involves the question whether we shall be invaded by Japan; whether we shall see our children slaughtered, and our women raped. I ask - not in order that I, personally, may be immune from interruption but in the interests of honorable senators generally - that this chamber be spared the indignity of continuous interjections of the type  just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride,</inline> as to whether it was this government or that government which did certain things. I repeat that Australia has done its share in this war. When an invasion seemed imminent we sent our sons to Great Britain - that country from which many of us came and of which, so far, nobody has any reason to be ashamed. That portion of our fighting forces became the 9 th Division and was later transferred to the Middle East where it withstood the siege of Tobruk, one of the outstanding epics in the history of Australia's fighting men abroad, and later acquitted itself brilliantly at El Alamein. There has been considerable criticism of this bill and I propose to traverse some of it in order that we may get an orderly view of the situation. First, we should endeavour to place that criticism into its various categories. I do not say that criticism is not justified. No government and no Minister defending or supporting a measure has a right to object to reasonable criticism, although, on occasions, a Minister may have a right, in fact a duty, to refuse to lend dignity to destructive criticism by replying to it. In my opinion the criticism that has been offered in respect of this measure can he divided into certain definite categories. First, there are those critics who oppose the bill because they have an honest belief in complete and unlimited conscription. Then there are those who criticize the measure because they have a completely honest and sincere antagonism to conscription in any form. That, also, is quite understandable. Lastly, however, there is that utterly dishonest, disreputable and discreditable criticism which arises from no higher motive than a desire to discredit the Labour Government and its administration. Into those categories all critics of this measure may be divided, and honorable senators who follow me in this debate, knowingly and or unknowingly, will sort themselves out into those three classes. Honorable senators must make their choice and, according to the category which they choose, the people of this country, and those who fellow them in the years to come, will decide whether the opponents of this measure were or were not justified in acting as they did. </para>

                            <para>- I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> will continue to draw his parliamentary allowance whether he believes that posterity will declare his actions to be worthwhile or not, but that is a matter for himself.  One criticism that has been offered upon this measure is that the Defence Act should have been amended earlier. That criticism is perfectly justifiable. If honorable senators believe that the Defence Act should have been amended earlier, they have a right to say so, but I point out that section 49 of the Defence Act, which limits overseas service to volunteers, became law in 1903 - exactly 40 years ago - and that, during those 40 years, no government has sought to amend it. In 1940, the then Commonwealth Government passed the National Security bill, and inserted a clause preventing the imposition of any form of compulsory military service beyond the limits of Australia. </para>

                    </continue><para>The second criticism is that the delay has prejudiced operations. I submit with all respect that there is not the slightest approximation to a vestige of truth in that criticism. If there were, it would imply that we Australians have not carried, out our contract to stand loyally by the United Nations. With the exception of small Australian Imperial Force units in Timor and Dutch New Guinea, all operations have been on Australian soil. Another popular kind of criticism has been that the bill should provide that the members of the Australian Citizen Forces should be required to serve anywhere abroad. That is quite justifiable criticism, if we have taken into consideration what that criticism involves. We must surely ask ourselves, " What number of troops have we,1 and what have we in the matter of equipment and transport ? " Australia's national policy, endorsed by all political parties, has been one of voluntary service, whether in the Navy, the Army, or the Royal Australian Air Force. A similar remark is applicable to South Africa, as far as the African continent is concerned. </para><interjection>

That also is justifiable criticism, but let us put the critics into the witness box, and ask them what they would have. What do they mean by an area being too restricted? Without equivocation or reservation, the Government gave the reasons why it considered that the boundaries needed to be extended. It claims that the extension provided for in the bill represents the minimum that this country must have and the maximum of what it is capable of adequately using. I want honorable senators to keep that fact in mind. In a debate on the matter of legislation the use of indefinite terms serves no useful purpose, except that, if they become embodied in an act, they provide endless profit for lawyers. What i.s meant by the term "too restricted"? It would be easy to say that, a distance of 1,000 miles in one direction was not sufficient, or that an extension of even 10,000 miles would make the area too restricted. Such critics cannot be pinned down to anything, except that they believe that any man who can be put into the fighting services should be sent anywhere in the wide world. </para><interjection>

I have said some wrong things in my life. I have lived long enough to know it, and wisely enough to admit it, but this form of criticism is one of the most cruel and cowardly kinds that. J. have heard. It is easy, in the calm atmosphere of this Senate, to say that the non-inclusion of Malaya in the area implies an abandonment of Australian prisoners of war in that region. We should remember that the sorrowing relatives of the many hundreds of men locked up in Malaya will read that statement, but I hope that they will not believe it. They will understand that those who indulge in that form of criticism have no objective other than to discredit the Government politically, although in the process they wring the heart-strings of the relatives of the prisoners of war. My eye caught some adjectives which I had included in -my notes. I have not employed them, because I believe that honorable senators' sense of decency will make what I have said sufficient. Another form of criticism has been hurled at the Government. One member of the Opposition interjected, " Why did the Government go to the Labour Conference?" A more illustrious gentleman than that honorable senator offered that criticism in the House of Representatives. He did it not by way of a disorderly interjection, but, while standing on his feet, he took his courage in both hands  and challenged the Government.  I  can admire  a  man who acts that way, but  I  have very little regard for  a  man who is not prepared to do more than make  a  disorderly interjection. </para><para>Since the Labour Government came into office, we have heard a good deal about the desirability of forming a national government.

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite, who know nothing of the Labour party, pose as fountains of knowledge concerning it. No honorable senator on this side would be here except for the fact that the Australian Labour movement gave him its imprimatur and the electors said "go ahead". Is it any worse that a Labour Prime Minister should attend a conference in Goulburnstreet, Sydney, not as Prime Minister, but as a delegate elected hy his comrades in Western Australia, than that an honorable senator opposite should go to a conference of his party in York-street or some other place in the same city? Do not let us hear any more about this crime of going to a Labour conference. </para>

We might have a very sordid reason for not wanting the Prime Minister to go either to London or Washington. But the fact is that the Prime Minister told the right honorable member for Kooyong. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> when he was Prime Minister that while there was a war on, his place, duty and opportunities were here on Australian soil, and not in gallivanting around the universe. </para>

                            <para>- That interjection is perfectly justifiable. I am quite sure that in. the years to come the people of Great Britain and other countries will ask, " What did Churchill do ? " ; but I am quite sure that not one person in the days to come will ask, "What did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> do?" They will not even be in the picture; Churchill will always be there. When the right honorable member for Kooyong was Prime Minister he went abroad and had a very wonderful time. He brought back some wonderful films, and for quite a long while we saw his exploits depicted on the silver screen. We were very glad he came back. No one wanted to lose him. I suspect at times that honorable senators opposite want to lose the present Prime Minister. However, when the right honorable member for Kooyong came back to Australia he unburdened his soul. He did not wait until he met the Parliament before doing so. He had something ito say when he arrived at Auckland, later at Sydney, and at Canberra, when, at long last, he arrived here. He said one of the most tragic things that any homing Prime Minister has ever said 'on his return from a journey of that kind. Speaking in Sydney, he said that he noticed with horror that he had to come back to Australia and play the dirty game of politics. If that is all that Australia got out of that long and expensive trip by the right honorable gentleman, I assure the Senate that we on this side have a very fervent hope that our leader will never go abroad while the war is on. Should he do so, I am quite sure that, when he comes back, he will not make such an undignified remark, because, so far as the Labour party is concerned, we regard politics,  not as a game, but as a wonderful opportunity. We have faith in our policy, and in the fact that without us and. the policy we stand for, the postwar Australia will not be worth having. We do not regard politics as a game; we regard it as a high privilege and honour to be part of the machinery of government which, in this democracy at any rate, is worth while being associated with. The right honorable member for Kooyong returned to Australia; but he did not provide for the adequate defence of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I advise the honorable senator not to say too much about that, or I shall give the unhappy facts. The right honorable gentleman did not come back and ask for one army; that never occurred to him. He did not even call up the available men; that did not occur to him either. It did not occur to him that we should get every available man in the Military Forces. He did, however, indulged the meaningless babble of members of the Opposition about a 100 per cent. war effort. It was easy to talk about a 100 per cent. war effort but to do nothing about it. While he was talking about it - and I say this without reservation - he knew only one-half of our resources were being used, and that his own slogan " Business as usual " was still being followed. It remained for a Labour Prime Minister to tell honorable senators opposite and the nation that we must use the 'total resources of this country, and that " Business as usual " was impossible now, and would never return in spite of the hopes of honorable senators opposite. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator is working himself into a fever about socialism, I advise him to buy the Dean of Canterbury's book, <inline font-style="italic">Socialist Sixth of the World,</inline> and read it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachan interjected just now about foundations. It is with great grief that I recite these facts, but I think the time has come when they should be recited. I expected opposition to the bill, but when the honorable senator interjects that his party laid the foundations, let me say that here in Canberra are great and wonderful foundations, laid years ago, but perfectly useless, because nothing whatever has been erected upon them. That is all the satisfaction that honorable senators opposite can get about laying foundations until they can produce some evidence, either that their Prime Minister of that day put something upon them or that they themselves are now willing to stop obstructing us from building more and more upon them. Here is the story. When Labour came into power, there was not one modem fighter aeroplane in the whole of the Commonwealth. Make a note of it. I am not saying that there were only 100 or 150 when there should have been 500. That would have been something on the foundations. The sordid truth is that there was not one. We had only about fifteen rounds of anti-tank ammunition per gun. </para>

                            <para>- Would the honorable senator suggest that I was guilty of some political or rhetorical crime if I quoted from the Gospel according to St. John, or some other Biblical record ? He probably would not believe St. John, and he obviously does not believe me. This is the easiest kind of thing to refute, because it is not argument but a statement of fact. Let us have a look at it again, for I have a long list of crimes to read. There was not one modern fighter aeroplane in the Commonwealth. If there was one, letus hear of it, because if so we have lost it. It is not on the stock sheets of that time. If honorable senators opposite can show that there were two, and that therefore my credibility as a witness is destroyed, let us hear from them. They will have their opportunity to speak. We had only about fifteen rounds of anti-tank ammunition per gun. </para>

                            <para>- We had only about 60 per cent, of the rifles required to equip our forces as they were then, we had only about 20 per cent, of the number of tommy guns required, and there was a very serious shortage of the machine guns we needed, with hopelessly inadequate supplies of spare parts. We had had in this country for many years a large number of .310-calibre cadet rifles which this Government issued to the Volunteer Defence Corps, but when we took office there was no ammunition in all Australia for them.. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> had been abroad, he had returned, and he was annoyed because he had to get back into the dirty game of politics. It never occurred to him to get into the honest and honorable game  of making Australia safe from invasion. One of the most urgent problems facing this country was the creation of reserves of petrol and fuel oil. During the whole of the two years that a previous Government was in office, it stood idly by and did nothing while our petrol resources dwindled from week to week until, when this Government took office, they had reached a perilously low level. Every one of these things means that honorable senators opposite were callously indifferent to the need for the protection of the women and children of the Common- . wealth. They do not mean simply that there was no petrol, or not enough, or that there was no ammunition, or not enough. They mean that, charged with the great responsibility of governing the Commonwealth in war-time, the party opposite was indifferent to the fate which awaited its men, women and children. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that what I have said so far forms some semblance of an intelligent approach to the subject, which I do not expect from the honorable senator when he speaks. Up to date I have been making a calm, cool and collected address, but I now approach a subject which almost tempts me to abandon that senatorial calm, sacrifice a little dignity, and " tear in ". At the time of which I have been speaking, I was, as the representative of Queensland in this chamber with five other senators, very concerned indeed about the condition of that State, as also was the Prime Minister. The armchair strategists and the fire-side generals on the Opposition benches could not see anything of importance beyond Princes Bridge and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Towns on the coast of Queensland which has a wider divergence of railway communication, and a more decentralized population than any other State, were only: ghost towns. Every body had left. Physically fit males had enlisted, and others had gone south where high wages were being offered. It remained for a Labour Prime Minister to point out the fact that the river Yarra, Sydney Harbour, Tocumwal, and other places in the south of this continent were not threatened ; it took a Labour Prime Minister to see that if an attack did come it would be on the northern parts of Australia. Recently I made a tour in an American bomber of many of the huge defence works which have been accomplished in our northern areas, including, of course, northern Queensland, and I was overjoyed to see what had been accomplished under the guidance of a Labour Prime Minister who had some conception of what global war meant. I shall not make public just what I did see on that tour, but I assure honorable senators that what has been done in the north of Australia has made it possible for them to live peacefully in Canberra while they are engaged upon their parliamentary duties, and to return safely to their homes in Sydney, Melbourne and other parts of the Commonwealth when Parliament adjourns. We have made the north of this continent an arsenal \ of immense strength. That has been  accomplished by Labour alone; let honorable senators opposite not forget that. </para>

I shall now tell the story of what the Labour Government has achieved. . Almost the whole of our manpower has been diverted to the armed forces, to direct war work, or to essential civilian production, which in effect must be regarded as war work. I warn honorable senators opposite to be careful if they seek to contradict anything that I may state, because as Minister for the Interior I have had control of all constructional works for the fighting services, and I may be able to confront them with letters written by themselves asking thai some of these undertakings be not proceeded with because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-so's</inline> farm would suffer, or some one else's stud stock would not be looked after. I have received such letters day after day. As a result of the efforts of this Government, Australia's man-power today is almost entirely engaged on works of high priority. The number of Australians under arms in the three services is almost double the total number that served in the last war. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I point out that the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> was a member was responsible for the number which has been trebled by this administration. During  1942  the strength of the Royal Australian Air Force was increased greatly. The number of men and women diverted to direct war work of all kinds during last year substantially exceeded the number so diverted in the entire four years of the last war and the first two years of this war. Since February,  1942,  between  400,000  and  500,000  'mcn and women have been diverted from civil production to the fighting services to direct war work. Since the outbreak of this war, employees in Government munitions factories, including aircraft plants and ship-building yards, have increased by more than SOO per cent. In September,  1939,  Government munitions factories employed  13,500  people of whom only  1,300  were women. By the end of  1942,  the number of employees had risen to  113,000  of whom  26,000,  or nearly  25  per cent., were women. The number of factoryemployees producing goods for the civilian market, has been reduced by  64  per cent, since the war began. Before the war the factory employees in Australia numbered  540,000,  practically nil of whom were producing for civilian needs. To-day only  194,000  are producing for the civilian population. Almost as many men and women arc now engaged, in the manufacture of war materials as were required to supply the whole of Australia's civilian needs before the war. From  540,000  before the war, the overall number of factory employees has risen to  700,000,  of whom  513.000,  or  72  per cent, are engaged in direct war work. The employment of men and women in direct war work in Australian factories has increased one hundredfold since the war begun. </para>

I desire the people of the Allied Nations to know that the Commonwealth Government, conscientiously believes that it has nothing whatever to apologize for or regret in its plans for the defence of this country. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duff-Cooper</inline> visited Australia recently, he declared that. Australia's contribution to the war effort was remarkable, and lie complimented this country highly on what it was doing. Every important visitor has been impressed by our work in the interests of the common cause. The Government intends to go on doing the job .that must be done, not for political advantage, but for the safety of the nation. It will continue to  do it, despite anything that the Opposition may do or say, so long as it is left in control. If the Opposition considers that the Government should be removed from office, it is at liberty to try to bring about that result. In any event, the Government will not say untrue and cowardly things about what has happened. The conditions which will be imposed upon the people will become more difficult as the days pass. The legislation which the Government finds necessary to introduce will operate severely, but, whatever the obstacles may be, the Government is determined to continue the work that has been entrusted to it. It will see the job through in the interests of the nation. </para><para>Some honorable senators opposite have shown considerable agitation regarding the bill. I have dealt with every phase of the measure. It merely proposes an extension of the boundaries within which members of the Citizen Military Forces may be required to serve. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- They had to be fixed somewhere, because we have not a sufficient number of fighting men to spread them all over the world. Last week I saw a proposal by a gentleman who is obviously very gifted, in which he submitted for the consideration of the Government a post-war reconstruction scheme. One of the proposals that he made was that all lunatics at present confined in asylums should be let out and other persons put in their places. When I hear such inane interjections as we have heard during this debate I am inclined to think that there was something in that suggestion. If the persons now in the asylums were let out, I could nominate a few others to take their places. When honorable senators opposite get the opportunity to do so I am sure that they will talk about the bill, and I hope that they will try to advance some arguments in relation to it. This is not a matter which should be treated lightly; it is one of the most serious proposals that has ever been placed before this Parliament. In this bill, the Government says to the Parliament that Australia cannot be defended as the Government thinks it ought to be defended unless the extra territory indicated in the bill be added to the area in which the Militia may now serve. </para>

Japan can invade Australia successfully only if its fighting forces are allowed to become entrenched in certain portions of the South-West Pacific Area.

The Government believes that if the boundaries in which the Militia may serve are extended in accordance with its proposals, Japan can be fastened clown to the positions in which its forces are now situated, but that otherwise Australia will be unable to prevent a Japanese invasion of this country. </para>

                            <para>- The question before the Senate is not merely the passing or the defeating of this bill. It is not a matter of the Opposition securing a victory over the Government. Those are not the things which are at stake. The issues before us involve the future of this wonderful country. All that we have now, and all that we hope for in the future - the preservation of the lives of our people, the safeguarding of their property, the well-being of the men, women and children of to-day and of the future - is at stake. Whichever way the vote, goes, I can say with conviction that in the days to come we shall be judged more by our attitude towards this issue than by any other decision previously made in this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. -  We have listened to a most remarkable speech by the Leader of Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> The Minister told us that he had not distributed copies of his speech as is usually done when moving the second reading of a bill, but those of us who have perused <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> know that he quoted almost word for word from an abusive speech made in the House of Representatives by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> Most of the time taken up by the Leader of the Senate was devoted to abuse of the Menzies Government and praise of the present Government; very little attention was given to the bill- When the history of this period is written, the Right Honorable R. G. Menzies will be given credit for having laid the foundation of Australia's war. effort. Prior to the outbreak of war Australia was not as well prepared for war as it might have been, but that was true also of Great Britain and other allied countries. It ill becomes the Leader of the Senate to criticize previous governments when he knows that in 1938, when a proposal involving expenditure for defence purposes of about £40,000,000 was before the Parliament, it was severely criticized by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and other members of the Labour party. The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has alleged that when the present Government assumed office there was not one first-class fighter aeroplane in this country. Aeroplanes are not built in a day. In February, 193S, the Lyons Government ordered 200 Beaufort bombers. However, at that time, all countries were seeking to obtain aeroplane engines; and, thus, many difficulties had to be overcome. Perusal of the correspondence which passed between the Menzies Government and the Governments of Great Britain and the United States of America, in which the first mentioned urged our allies to assist us in that respect, reveals that the Menzies Government did all it possibly could to obtain Australia's requirements. We have also heard much criticism concerning the alleged failure of the Menzies Government to build up adequate supplies of petrol in this country. We know, of course, that supporters of the present Government, when they were in opposition, were loudest in their  protests against the decision of the Menzies Government to introduce petrol rationing. The fact is that when the present Government assumed office, Australia had in store more aviation petrol than had been recommended by our military experts. The reason why we did not have as much ordinary petrol as we might have had was because the British Government had been obliged to draw on our supplies to meet requirements in theatres where fighting was actually taking place. On the 29th January, when this bill was introduced into the House of Representatives, I described it as an " abomination and an insult to our allies ". Now, almost three weeks later, I marvel at the restraint I exercised in describing the measure. I say most emphatically that I dislike its limitations. Its main purpose is to define a zone for the future operations of the Militia Forces. This zone i 3 to he known as the South-Western Pacific Zone. Whereas, previously, members of the Militia were barred from service in areas beyond the Commonwealth and its territories, they will be permitted, under the bill, to operate right up to the boundaries now prescribed. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, gave the reasons why the Government considers the 'bill to be necessary. I intend to go a little deeper into the matter, and to show how Australia's prestige has been trifled with by the Government. during the last three months. </para>

                    <para>A few days before the outbreak of the Great War " in 1914, the Leader of the Australian Labour party, the Right Honorable Andrew Fisher, addressing an election audience at, Colac, made the following impressive statement: - </para>
                    <para>AH, I am guru, will regret the critical position existing at the present time, and pray that a disastrous war may be averted. 13ut should the worst happen after everything has been done that honour will permit, Australians will stand beside our own to help and defend her to our last man and our last shilling. </para>
                    <para>Two nights later, on the 3rd August, 1914, at Benalla, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> said - </para>
                    <para>We are strongly opposed to the present Government in our Australian politics; but, as I have frequently stated in Parliament, in a time of emergency there are no parties at all. We stand united against the common foe, and T repeat what I said at  Colac:  That our last man and our last shilling will be offered and supplied to the Mother Country in maintaining her honour and our honour, if we should happen to come into the conflict. </para>
                    <para>Then came the declaration of war and Australia's entry into the struggle. We recall the storming of the gates of hell by the sons of Australia on the 25th April, 1915,' the glorious exploits of the Light Horse in the Holy Land, the desert campaign, the work of the Camel Corps, the valour and sacrifice of the Anzacs on the bloody battlefields of Flanders and France. Then came the assault of the AustralianCanadian Armies on the 8th August, 191S, which evoked from  Ludendorff  the cry : " This is indeed a black day for Germany ". That glorious inscription on the pages of history, written in the blood of our own boys, immortalized the Australian nation. It won nationhood for this young country. These are a few of the many highlights which have established for all time a real Australian tradition comparable with the highest ideals of other nations. For those traditions we are, and will be eternally, grateful. They mean more to us than mere words. They express national qualities which are entitled to perpetual preservation. </para>
                    <para>How difficult and depressing is it, therefore, when an attempt is made to correlate the attitude of political Labour of to-d.ay with national sentiment. This bill, by accepting the principle of military conscription for overseas service, cuts across a traditional Labour principle. It is, at least, a step in the right direction. </para>

I have been and always will be a  conscriptionist;  but statements made by many leaders on the Government side, and their predecessors in the Labour party, show that they will for ever remain  anti-conscriptionists.  I do not. intend to delve too deeply into history. I shall content myself with a brief reference to the deplorable, short-sighted and selfish attitude of Labour leaders in this country in respect of national military service. Conscription has always been regarded by the Australian Labour party as a monster raising its ugly head, and with its poisonous tongue disturbing the peace and calm of Labour unity. The Labour party has lived in mortal terror of this serpent; but stouter hearts in the movement, who, like St. George, stood up and conquered their fear, have earned the respect and admiration of fellow Australians. </para>

                    <para>I need not go too closely into the details of the conscription split in the Labour party .in 1916, as I am anxious to spare me feelings of honorable senators opposite as much as possible. Suffice it to say that men of the calibre of the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes; the Right Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce; the Honorable J. A. Jensen; the Honorable W. Webster; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honorable E. J. Russell, all members of a Labour Cabinet, and a host of other levelheaded thinkers, felt compelled to dissociate themselves from the narrow attitude of their Labour1 colleagues on this question of national military service. Our present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> although not in Parliament at that time, was, as we all know, actively engaged  in industrial Labour circles.  His  attitude on that occasion was definitely one of open hostility to conscription, and, in fact, any service outside Australia. He, together with a. number of other prominent Labour men of to-day - several of them now Cabinet Ministers - helped to formulate the policy of Australian Labour, and that policy they have advocated ever since. To -me there is one salient objective in the make-up of a, Labour politician, and that is the maintenance of unity within the Labour party, even at the expense of national unity, national safety, and national honour. Australia was surprised, in mon? ways than one, at the bombshell dropped by the Prime Minister on ;the 17th November of last year. Every newspaper throughout Australia on the following day published a story which contained as  its feature a suggestion made by the Prime Minister to the Australian Labour party conference, that the conference should give its consent to the merging of the Australian Imperial Force and the Citizen Military Forces into one Australian army for service abroad. The Prime Minister has been in constant - in fact, day to day and probably hour to hourconsultation with those in the high command of our fighting services, who are  administering  the grand strategy of the United Nations, and the leaders of all other allied nations. As the result of information given to him, and no doubt forcibly impressed upon his mind, he became convinced that, for the successful prosecution of the war and Australia's part therein, one army was a vital necessity for this country. I quote his own words in this matter - </para>

                    <para>Within a few weeks of the approach to this outside organization by the Prime Minister, one of his . supporters told members of this Parliament that the Prime Minister at. the Australian Labour party conference, in Melbourne, had said : </para>
                    <para>Gentlemen, there is no argument against one army ". I know that I am speaking for every one, on this side of the Senate at least, when I say that at the time of the Prime Minister's approach to the Australian Labour party conference, the people of Australia were clearly led to believe that he was convinced of the necessity for merging all our land fighting forces into one homogeneous unit, in preference to the heterogeneous fighting force provided for under the Defence Act. The majority of the people of Australia really believed that that was the Prime Minister's objective, and his firm belief in it as a national necessity, yet what do we find? Briefly, when we trace the day today recordings of the Labour party conference, and the subsequent meetings of the Labour Cabinet, we find a distinct whittling down of the original proposals to give greater striking power to our Army. I cannot find words which fully and adequately describe my disgust at Che action of the Prime Minister of a country such as ours in going cap in hand and on his bended knees to an organization politically irresponsible to the people, for " authority " to amend the Defence Act to give effect to a policy which had obviously been accepted as an urgent military necessity. Seven weeks after his approach to the Labour party caucus meeting, the Prime Minister secured the consent of the trade union secretaries to the amendment of an act of Parliament which affects the lives and safety of all of us. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have mentioned on other occasions that the Prime Minister, by going to the Australian Labour party executive, subordinated responsible parliamentary government to 35 union officials or Labour party supporters. When we read those words which the Prime Minister was forced to move himself, " . . . the Government be' authorized to add to the Defence Act", I am sure that members of Parliament are ashamed to think that that step was necessary. The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of the 17th December last very clearly depicted the Prime Minister going cap in hand for this authority. That attitude showed very great weakness on his part. It is because the Australian Labour party will not allow the Government to do any more  than  this bill authorizes that we now have the sorry spectacle of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth almost appealing to the United States of America to send more of its conscripts to defend Australia, whilst he is not prepared to send the Militia, which is an important part of our Army, to accompany the gallant troops of General Douglas MacArthur to the Solomons or the Philippines. </para>

                            <para>- I advise the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> to refresh his memory as to how many of the Militia were engaged in actual fighting in that area. I give the members of the Militia every credit for what they have done, but this is the deplorable spectacle with which we are faced : unless we remove all these restrictions, it is impossible to have one army, and we shall have a division in our fighting forces in Australia. That is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. Great difficulty will be created in the post-war period. The maintenance of two separate armies must involve an enormous waste of man-power. I urge the Government to take its courage in its hands, and in fairness to our Allies, agree that our fighting, men may serve in whatever theatre of war they are required. Some months ago the British Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill,</inline> said that when the Germans were defeated Britain would send its conscript soldiers 12,000 miles to help their kith and kin in Australia to defeat the Japanese. That is the spirit that we should display in this country, but while we retain the limited boundaries set out in this measure, we shall not have unity in our armed forces, and we shall not be doing what is expected of us by our Allies. "We are in this war on equal terms with our Allies, and wo believe in equality of sacrifice. I urge the Government to take the necessary action to permit this country to play its full part. </para>

                    <para>I do not propose to vote against the second reading of the bill. As I said before, this measure establishes the important principle of conscription for overseas service. My objection to it is that it does not go far enough, and when it is in the committee stage, I shall move for the insertion of the following new clause : - 4a. - (I.) If the Governor-General is of opinion that a grave emergency exists in the present war he may make a Proclamation to that effect. ( 2. ) On and from the date of issue of any such Proclamation and until its revocation, the Governor-General may, notwithstanding anything contained in this or in any other Act, make regulations requiring members of the Citizen Military Forces to serve in such area beyond the limits of the South-Western Pacific Zone as is specified in the regulations as being an area in which it is necessary or expedient for the efficient prosecution of the war for them to serve. </para>
                    <para class="block">I hope that my amendment, will be carried and so remove the stigma on Australia's good name. I shall reserve further remarks upon this measure until the committee stage is reached. </para>

                        <para>.- In view of the debate which took place in this chamber last week upon another measure, I do not propose to speak at length upon this bill. I endorse heartily the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> and I regret that in a time of national emergency such as at present, the Government should have seen fit to bring down a bill such as this. Listening to the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> this afternoon, my memory carried me back to the last war when violent anti-conscription campaigns were being conducted throughout the length and breadth of this country. At that time, I little dreamed that I would live to see the present Leader of the Senate a conscriptionist. It shows that the world to-day is different from what it was 25 years ago. </para>

                            <para>- Has it ever been suggested that our men who are fighting overseas are not fighting in the defence of Australia? Did not the men who fought in France during the last war fight in the defence of Australia just as our soldiers in New Guinea are fighting in the defence of Australia to-day? It gives me a certain amount of satisfaction to see the Leader of the Senate supporting a bill of this nature, in view of the hectic campaigns in which he and I participated during the last war. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> doubt he will remember some of the clashes that occurred when we visited the same towns at the same time. I never thought then that I would see the day when he would be convinced that conscription for overseas service was necessary. He had a difficult task to perform this afternoon, and in carrying it out, he endeavoured to draw as little attention as possible to the bill by indulging in a tirade of abuse against the previous Government. I was most concerned with the honorable gentleman's statement - I presume that as Leader of the Senate he was speaking on behalf of the Government - that this measure represented the absolute maximum to which Australia could go. Let us consider for a moment what difficulties might arise in any division composed partly of militiamen and partly of men of the Australian Imperial Force, should if. reach, say, the equator. Apparently the order would be given for the militiamen to fall out and to remain on the southern side of the equator while the Australian Imperial Force, which has been doing all our fighting for the past three and a half years, continues to press the enemy back. What an idiotic proposal! In view of the emergency which exists to-day, a measure such as that demanded by the Opposition, providing for unlimited military service overseas, should be introduced. The men who fought in Greece and Crete, defended Tobruk, and broke Rommel's army at El Alamein, were fighting in the defence of Australia just as much as are the soldiers stationed in the islands around Australia's coast. The same thing may be said of our seamen who have fought in the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and the Pacific, and our airmen who have been operating over Germany. Yet now, apparently after being asked by its military advisers to grant them wider powers, the Government has brought in a measure of this kind. The good old Australian Imperial Force will keep on fighting, but the Militia must not go north of the equator ! </para>

Since it has become convinced that additional powers are necessary, why has the Government not been courageous enough to introduce a. measure providing for unlimited conscription for overseas service? I cannot see what objection honorable senators opposite can have to such a proposal, because obviously the Government will decide to what part of the world Australian troops shall be sent. The Leader of the Senate made reference to the fact that a map showing the extended area was disclosed to the public for the first time by himself at a meeting of the State executive of the Australian Labour party in Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- Can the Minister justify his action in showing a secret map to a body which is not responsible to the people, before it was shown to members of the Advisory War Council, members of which are under an oath of secrecy regarding executive matters ? The Minister said that the map was not shown to members of the Opposition, who were members of the Advisory War Council, because he would not trust them. He feared that they would " blab " information of value to the enemy. I say that the members of the Advisory War Council who represent the Opposition should inquire whether that is the opinion of the Government regarding them.. I make no secret of my attitude to the council and my opinion regarding the position which Opposition members of it should occupy. I said first at a party meeting, and the information soon became public, that, unless those members were given some executive authority, and access to the whole of the information which partners in a body such as that were entitled to, they should nolonger remain members of the council.. </para>

                    <para>The Minister stated that owing to the danger facing men, women and children in Australia, the Government regarded as essential the power proposed to be taken under this bill. Three or four months ago, the Prime Minister had his attention drawn to the necessity for power to be taken to send members of the Citizen Military Forces beyond the boundaries of Australia and its territories, but this bill comes before us as late as the middle of February. If the matter were regarded as serious, why was not Parliament called together immediately ? Why were not themembers of both branches of the legislature told at a secret sitting of thedanger that had arisen, and of theurgent necessity for this additional power, instead of the proposal being first submitted to an outside body? This Parliament is the tribunal which should first be consulted. </para>

                    <para>I make no secret of my own attitude to the vote taken on this bill in the House of Representatives. Personally I consider that my own party made a grievous mistake in accepting the bill without making' a serious attempt to amend it on the lines of the policy advocated by the Opposition ever since it relinquished the reins of government. I am not a last-minute convert to that view. I wired to my leader, urging him to submit an amendment to enable Australian troops to be brought into line with those of our allies and with our kinsmen from other parts of the Empire. T regret that iri the House of Representatives the Opposition did not, make a unanimous attempt to amend the bill in conformity with its well-known policy on the subject of military service overseas. Such action would have been in accordance with the joint letter which members of the Opposition in both branches of the legislature forwarded to the Prime Minister about a year ago. </para>
                    <para>When the bill reaches the committee stage, I propose to support any amendments that may be submitted with a view to extending the area in which members of the Citizen Military Forces may be called upon to serve. When the Leader of the Opposition proposes an amendment to give to the Executive Council the right, after the issue of a proclamation by the Governor-General, to extend the area, I shall support it. When the bill submitted by the Leader -of the Opposition for the amendment of the National Security Act for a similar purpose is debated, I shall give it my support.- I shall give to any government in power the right to make full use of Australian troops in any theatre of war. A bill of this kind is an insult to the intelligence of the Parliament and the people of Australia. The measure reeks with the narrow, sectional interests that are dividing the Labour party outside Parliament, and has been introduced in order to pander to the "  Langites  ", the " Thornton! tes " and any other "Labourites" that happen to exist. This measure is not worthy of a Government that must have been asked by its military advisers to obtain increased power with regard to the area in which the Australian forces could be used. </para>
                    <para>As has been mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, in referring to the work of previous administrations, the Leader of the Senate should not endeavour to cover up the sins of the Labour party by referring to the Government's belief in the necessity for a maximum war effort. Most of the difficulties with regard to the Military Forces can justly be laid at the door of the Labour party. I say without hesitation that the worst blow ever dealt at those forces was the abolition of compulsory training, which was brought about during the regime of the Scullin Government. </para>

An efficient military organization of that kind could not be rebuilt in a short period. In addition, the Royal Military College, at Duntroon, which trained many of the brilliant officers who fought in the last war, was closed down by the Scullin Government. </para>

                            <para>- It was in office long enough to do a lot of damage to the defences of this country. The shutters were put up at Duntroon, and men, who were in training as staff officers were taken to a " pokey " hovel at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, where there was not sufficient room to train them. When the Scullin Government was defeated, ite successors restored and enlarged the Royal Military College. That institution, with its long courses as well as its refresher courses, has rendered wonderful service not only to. Australia and its sister dominion, but also to our other allies. </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Senate had something to say on the subject of man-power. I realize that the position is extraordinarily difficult, but for the Minister to say that this hill affects the position is utter nonsense. As young men are being called up every day to serve in the Militia Forces to the limit of Australia's capacity and as every man who volunteers for service with the Australian Imperial Force immediately becomes available for service overseas, what becomes of the argument of the Minister? </para>

                    <para>I regret that the Government has not been hig enough to introduce a bill which would put Australia in the same category as other members of the British Empire and our allies. I pay my tribute to the work performed by our gallant allies from the United States of America. It is useless for the Leader of the Senate to say Australia's safety ' is due to the achievements of the present Prime Minister. I give some credit to our allies who fought the Japanese at Guadalcanal, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. Australia is safe, largely because many of its young men have been prepared to fight anywhere in its defence, whilst others have performed a wonderful job in various factories. In saying that it is nonsense to attribute </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia's safety to John Curtin, I have no desire to detract from what that right honorable gentleman has done; hut we must be fair. Let us give credit also to previous governments which were in power during, the first two years of the war - a period much more difficult than any which the present Government has experienced. I remember the situation which confronted us after the evacuation of Dunkirk, when Australia was called upon to go short of arms and ammunition in order to help our allies in other parts of the world. I claim that the Government of the day did right in taking risks to help our kith and kin overseas as well as our allies in other countries. That action- gives to honorable senators opposite a chance to say that there are more munitions of war in this country to-day than when the present Government took office. That was because we did not adopt a dog-in-the-manger attitude with respect te our meagre supplies. At that time our British allies had lost-most of their equipment. They were fighting with their backs to the wall; and it looked as though England was going to be invaded. Out of our slender supplies we did not hesitate to extend aid to them, and I shall always be proud of the fact that I was a member of the Government that did so. I intend to support the second reading of the measure, but I hope that in the committee stage we shall be able to improve it. </para>

He told us his story, and, in doing so, established a certain background. Both the story and the background will bear close examination. I have given considerable thought to the position which has arisen as the result of the introduction of this measure. A study of the progress of the war affords to us considerable grounds for comfort. In many respects, however, we must admit, unfortunately, that we have not done so well as we should like. To that degree we can heed the injunction expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> in an address which he delivered to the Scottish nation some time ago.

                    <para>This measure in its general purpose has been fully canvassed in Parliament and in the press. There can be no doubt that the people are interested in it and in the discussion which takes place upon it in the Parliament. However, we can only conjecture the views of the members of the services. They are most vitally concerned in the measure; and they are looking to us for support in a great human and national venture. I have yet to be assured that the Government realizes that fact. It has only one real soldier in its ranks; and it is scarcely able to conceive the real significance of its proposals. </para>
                    <para>I propose to confine myself to a consideration of two features - the actions of the Government and the effect of the proposed law on the members of the fighting forces. Undoubtedly, the thinking members of the Government were sincerely and wholeheartedly "committed to the prosecution of the war to a victorious conclusion. Their attitude, at one stage, can best be described in words used by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> in relation to the Commonwealth Powers Bill 1942, when he said - </para>

                    <para>That was the statement of a man with a purpose, and a determination to give effect to it. These were the things of the spirit that the people were looking for. They said to themselves, "He is the strong man. No longer will there be any hesitation about an ' all-in ' effort to win the war ". It will be recalled that some time previously the Prime Minister had expressed approval of, and adherence to. our form of democracy, consisting of the Grown, and the supreme authority of a parliament elected by the people. Every one appreciated that statement from the Prime Minister. Later, in interviews and press statements, he made illuminating  references  to "global strategy" and Australia's part in the plans of the Allies. He described the Commonwealth as the bastion of the South-Western Pacific, and as the base from which a great allied offensive against Japan would ultimately bc launched, and in which our own forces would march "knee to knee" to victory with, our kinsmen from the United States of America and the other democracies. Something of what he had in mind he defined in a statement made on the 20th November last, which I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Digest of Decisions and Announcements.</inline> No. 46- </para>

                        <para class="block">On the 20th November. 1942, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> in <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> discussion on war strategy, said that Australia was at present being defended on an miter screen running through New Guinea, the southern Solomons, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia and Fiji. If the more eastern parts of the screen were held, we could defend the eastern part of Australia from the Owen Stanley Range in New Guinea. If the Japanese could be pushed out of the Solomons and New Guinea, he would have to retire to Eis liases in the Marshall Islands. It was better to keep the eastern part of Australia, inviolate from the ravages of war by keeping the enemy at arms length than to let bini in. The same applied to the defence of the northern and western part of Australia, where the battle would have to be fought in Timor and the islands adjacent thereto. These islands were within the theatre of the South-West Pacific and were vital to the holding of the Commonwealth. Because of the nature of the continent of Australia, it became, in fact, a series of military islands, the movement to and from each involving transport problems, all of them making mobility a matter of difficulty and taking time; The delays iti this connexion were a bitter handicap in dealing with the enemy. That was why one army under one command for the military operations in the South-West Pacific was now a military necessity. </para>

                            <para>-He did it to the the Labour party, but not to the Cabinet. We know what followed. The issue was canvassed around Australia for weeks whilst Parliament suffered the indignity of being denied its proper functions, and Ministers disputed publicly with their reputed leader. The pains which Australia is enduring at present are similar <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> those experienced 25 or 26 years ago. So, if I may presume to interpret the minds of those who fought or are fighting for our cause, it will be to say that they view all these proceedings with concern and as a rather shabby business. There is no doubt that the proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> to the Labour conference did not emerge from it in the form in which it entered, or that it was later whittled down by the caucus of Government supporters in Parliament. In fact, the plan explained by the Prime Minister to sundry members only a few days before the bill was brought down is not the plan now contained in the bill. This emasculated instrument is far from what the public expected, and far from what they hoped for. Its whole history reveals a marked departure from the British system of parliamentary government and cabinet responsibility, and yet I have heard it said that the actions of the Prime Minister were indicative, of true democracy. That theory I maintain cannot be accepted. As global strategy has been so freely mentioned, particularly in this afternoon's debate, I have been at a little pains to differentiate between it and local strategy. I wish, therefore, to say something that I hope may assist honorable senators to appreciate the real problems which our leaders have to solve. Obviously global strategy comprehends a world war, but the term is a fluid, one and not static in its application and in its strength. I will put it this way if I may: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> and  President  Roosevelt are accepted as the supreme directors of our actions in this war. In consultation with experts they decide upon immediate and ultimate physical and political objectives for the war. </para>

                            <para>- At present Stalin has little to do with global strategy, in which he is playing a minor, part. The experts, after our two great political leaders have determined upon plans, evolve the strategy needed for gaining each objective in turn. Global strategy develops and expands in phases, and the completion of each phase necessitates adjustments in the plans, or even the preparation of new plans. Here, to-day, it will be a defensive scheme, and there an offensive. At a later period, the processes may be reversed. For these and other purposes the world has been divided into zones and commands. Such zones and commands are altered as progress is made and our forces pass from the defensive to the offensive. As an illustration of this I invite honorable senators to con.sider the changes brought about during the last four months by the allied victories in North Africa, in which, it might well bc pointed out, an Australian division and the Royal Australian Air Force played a not inconsiderable part. The main instruments used to give effect to strategical conceptions are the armed forces. It is known that these must be highly organized and thoroughly trained and equipped with ample reserves of men, supplies and materials. Their numbers must be sufficient for the task allotted and the allotment of the task must be considered and governed by the strength available at the time or likely to be available in the immediate future. A concomitant of success is that the personnel of the forces is imbued with the spirit of national service, of every one taking a share of risk incurred in rendering that service, a realization that the whole people are behind the forces in their aspirations and hopes, that conditions for all are similar, and that, too, there is a common expectation in respect to rewards when that service terminates. The words " conscription " and " conscripts " have 'been used <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> in political circles. I doubt if such will be heard outside. The principle of universal service in defence of this country was affirmed without opposition, as the Leader of the Senate told us this afternoon, in the terms of the Defence Act of 1903. It was at that time devoutly hoped that the call would never have to be made, but the menace is now here and the people have been warned repeatedly and called upon to serve. "We shall never again be secure, I submit, whatever local victories we may gain, until the cause of the menace is finally removed, and that entails the subjugation of Japan, which means going to Tokyo. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> says that this desired end is to be brought about by volunteers - the people whose patriotism is nearest the surface and that as they gain ground, the conquests made will be held and garrisoned by the Militia, provided that the locality and area of such conquests does not overlap certain geographical boundaries. What a reflection on the Militia! Militiamen are of the people who are now thoroughly aroused and more than anxious to play the part for which primarily they exist. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett's</inline> suggestion that the Militia is made up largely of old men and crocks is hardly encouraging to the many splendid corps that have undergone hard training, and are now impatiently awaiting their chance to acquit themselves. </para>

                            <para>- That in effect was the honorable member's suggestion. I agree that the present strategic situation does not indicate a need for the immediate use of large expeditionary forces. We are on the defensive; that Ls our role in global strategy for the time being. That is confirmed by the Prime Minister's statement, but I 'think that with confidence we can look to the time when we shall strike back. Then we shall have to keep the spearhead sharp and effective by a constant flow of fresh troops and rested formations in proportion to our commitments, but not beyond them. In order to play our part fully, we must prepare for that day now, and not leave our plans so late that lack of preparation will embarrass and retard allied strategy. It is not suggested that the Australian Imperial Force or the Militia should be sent hither and thither indiscriminately and thus be frittered away, nor that the essential defence of a major base should be neglected. Even the proposal to use Militia troops for garrison duty abroad after the cessation of hostilities will not bear examination. Fresh young forces will be needed for that purpose. It is impossible to hold war-weary troops in comparative idleness for an indefinite period, and it will take more than six months to enforce security guarantees when once the guns are silent. </para>

                            <para>- I return to the volunteers in the last war - the members of the first Australian Imperial Force. The Prime Minister has referred to the present Australian Imperial Force as the spearhead by which we shall have to share in the final victory against the Japanese. I shall tell honorable senators what may happen to those volunteers, if adequate support be not forthcoming. In December. 1917, the Australian Corps emerged from the third battle of  Ypres.  In three months fighting, it had suffered over 3S,000 casualties. One morning during that December I was standing on a roadside in Belgium, and the ground was covered with four inches of frozen snow. I was expecting a visitor, and he happened to be General Birdwood. He said to me, " Well, Collett, they have turned us down ". I asked, " What do you mean ? " He replied, " The Australian Government has refused the authority to send the Australian Corps the reinforcements which it needs. You will have to go back into the line again". We went back. </para>

                            <para>- They did not. They voted for it. Men went back into the line who had been wounded on two or more occasions, and some of them did not come out. I remember the case of a man who left Australia in the same unit as my own. He came under notice for bravery at Gallipoli, and was mentioned in the proper quarter. I saw him carried out at the battle of Pozieres on a stretcher. Later, when I returned to the unit, I found him with his right arm strapped to his body, and in command of a company in  the  front line. I took him out, but after I left he went back again, and he participated in almost the last battle of the war. That cost him his life. Circumstances of that kind have to be considered in connexion with the provisions of adequate reinforcements for what the Prime Minister has called the spearhead of Australia's defences. The right honorable gentleman spoke recently in a post-prophetic vein. He claims that he is not a strategist. I am not so sure of that. But he referred to something said by him in 1937 regarding air forces, omitting to mention that the Lyons Government had already adopted the Salmond plan, which promised even a greater strength in the air than the Prime Minister then advocated. There is nothing wrong to-day with our Air Force. The Labour party did not design or, <inline font-style="italic">ab in.il.io,</inline> accept the Empire Air Training Scheme. The Leader of the Senate told a story this afternoon which was not quite worthy of him. It was partially true, but .there was a good deal of suppression of the truth. In referring to Australia's contribution to the war effort under the previous Administration, he did not mention the contribution made to other dominions in arms and material, or the help sent to Great Britain owing to the shortage which Britain itself was then experiencing. The Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> has defined truth as a matter of opinion. </para>

There are other people with the power of prophecy. There is a newspaper called <inline font-style="italic">The Bulletin,</inline> which is published in Sydney. In its issue of the 30tb November, 1922, appeared a cartoon which I shall describe. There is a gentleman standing on a box, and I think it has some association with the legendary soap box. In front of him is a Japanese soldier fully equipped and applauding. Alongside him is a miserable looking youth labelled "Australia".

                    <para>I pass to another sort of prophecy. A little over 60 years ago a boy was born in the United States of America. A hunchback, his youth was 'filled with hopes of being a great soldier. He studied to that end and,, eventually, went to China where he strongly supported Sun Yat Sen in the establishment of the republic. He became a general. Somewhere about 1910 he wrote and published a book which he entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Valour of Ignorance.</inline> Part of that work is devoted to the philosophy of war, and. part to the political and defence problems of the United States cf America. It was largely as a result of this writing that the Government of the United States of America reviewed its then defenceless condition and embarked on the preparation of strategical plans for the defence of the Pacific. For their subsequent adoption and. development we in Australia have reasons to be very grateful. Amongst the many conclusions which this strange man, General Horner Lea, came to there is one on the note of preparedness that stands out. It is - </para>

                    <para>I trust that I have made it clear that this bill in its present form is not regarded by me with favour. I shall give four reasons for my opposition - First, it is not a true reflection of the Government's considered views on strategical requirements, ultimate possibilities and needs; secondly, it does not provide for a merger of the land forces into one army so as to ensure the maximum of strength, efficiency, and striking range; thirdly, it perpetuates invidious distinctions that should not exist amongst a patriotic people imbued with a common purpose; and fourthly, no equality of effort is demanded. I opened my speech with the quotation of an utterance of the Prime Minister of Great Britain. I shall close by recalling to the minds of honorable senators the words of the Prime Minister of Australia when he said - </para>

                        <para>.- The most significant thing about the speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> to-day was the difference between his attitude and that of the Leader of the united Opposition in the House of Representatives and the Leader of the party to which he belongs. Honorable members are aware that leading members of the Opposition parties have expressed the wish that the Militia Forces' should be available for use wherever the Government desires, and that an agreement was reached, in that connexion. Is it the desire of the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber that the Government should be guided by the leaders of global strategy - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> and  President  Roosevelt - or those who would serve party political ends? In a bill which the Leader of the Opposition introduced into this chamber a few days ago, he spoke in somewhat similar terms to those used by. him in relation to this measure. In my opinion, the honorable senator was utterly insincere when he brought that measure before the Senate.  His  only purpose was to place his colleagues in the House of Representatives in an invidious position. </para>

                            <para>- Before that measure was introduced, members of the Opposition parties had decided to accept the decision of their executive, but since then there has been some disunity, leading to a breakaway. Previously, they bad accepted the views placed before the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> but after visiting various capital cities and reading what appeared in the press, their views changed. Among the many things which have happened during the last two weeks has been a united effort on the part of the press of Australia, with few exceptions, to use the Government's proposals in relation to the Militia as a means of changing the leadership of the United Australia party. I repeat that the sole purpose for which the bill which was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition last week was to nullify the support given by the Opposition parties in another place to the Government's measure to extend the area in which the Militia may serve. In his second-reading speech on the bill introduced by bini, the Leader of the Opposition reviewed in his own way the development of the idea that the area in which the Militia could be used, should be extended. I remind him that it required a Labour government, under the leadership of a courageous Prime Minister, first to bring the Militia to its full strength, and, secondly, to extend the sphere in which it could operate. The present Leader of the Opposition was a member of two previous governments, which, whilst realizing the need for that to be done, were inactive in matters relating to the defence of this country. In saying that, I do not assert that those governments' did not play a big part in organizing Australia's war effort; nor do I deny that they laid the foundation of the great production of war materials, that is taking place in </para>

That is what the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe when he stressed that, shortly after Japan made its attack, he suddenly realized the need to extend the area in which the Militia may operate.

                    <para class="block">Australian people stressing the seriousness of the threat by Japan. I hope that members of the Opposition have not forgotten that incident, because it took place twelve months before the letter to which the Leader of the Opposition has so frequently referred was written. .Surely at that time the Government in office was conscious of the likelihood of Japan entering the war. The Government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member possessed the power at that time to take the action which he now asks us to take; but it made no attempt to do so. The Government of that day appealed to the present Prime Minister, who was then Leader of the Opposition, to emphasize to the people the dangers which were then threatening this country from Japan. Why, therefore, did it not attempt to bring the Militia up to its full strength? I, and the people of Australia, would like the Leader of the Opposition to answer that question. The honorable senator also drew invidious comparisons between our defence policy and that of New Zealand. To say the least, such comparisons can do no good for the cause for which our allies as a whole are fighting. I have no doubt that, in many respects, our war effort compares more than favorably with that being made by any of the other United Nations. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett,</inline> in the course of his speech, referred to those two great leaders, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> and  President  Roosevelt, I interjected that he should also include M. Stalin in his reference. To my amazement, the honorable senator replied that Russia was playing only a minor part in the war. </para>

                                himself, and representatives of  President  Roosevelt, have visited Russia in order to take counsel with M. Stalin with regard to the strategy of the war. I admit that much of Russia's success to-day is the result of the assistance which it has received from the British Empire and the United States of America. Any one who is familiar with the political history of New Zealand and Australia knows that New Zealand has always imposed compulsory military service in order to meet its requirements, whereas

                    <para class="block">Australia has traditionally adhered to the voluntary system. The voluntary system has been adhered to by all Australian governments. It is noteworthy that the Leader of the Opposition made no mention of the fact that South Africa also relies upon the voluntary system. That fact has figured in recent history, and every one is well aware of it. Surely, if the honorable senator had any intention of facing the matter squarely, he would not have referred to New Zealand only and failed to mention South Africa at all in that respect! The Prime Minister has dealt effectively with the respective positions of New Zealand and Australia in relation to the South-West Pacific Area. In order to show that the utmost co-operation and agreement exists between the two dominions in the prosecution of the war, I quote the following from an official Government cablegram, despatched from New Zealand to the Commonwealth Government on the 12th February last: - </para>

Similarly, he could also state that, if Australia were attacked, New Zealand, would assist to the utmost of its capacity. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That official pronouncement by the New Zealand Government shows that complete co-operation and understanding exists between it and this Government. It also explains the reason why the Government's policy is along the lines set out in the measure now before us, in contrast to the mock heroics embodied in the bill introduced into this chamber last week by the Leader of the Opposition. Of course, in this discussion, honorable senators opposite are playing to the gallery in order to gain some political advantage. The Leader of the Opposition also interpreted statements made by the Prime Minister in a most remarkable way. He said that the Prime Minister had cried to the United States of America to send its conscripts to Australia while we were not prepared to send our troops outside Australia. The impediment which has prevented us from despatching members of the Militia Forces outside Australia is part of the legacy we have inherited from past governments. This Government was not responsible for that impediment. It was brought into existence by governments formed by the United Australia and Country parties, which have been in office in this Parliament for over 25 years. Therefore, honorable senators opposite must accept their full share of responsibility for the position that this measure seeks to rectify, together with the people of Australia who elected the governments which have held office during those years. The Leader of the Opposition did not tell us that the Australian Imperial Force can be used in any theatre of war. Members of that force have actually fought in practically every theatre of war. The honorable senator, however, gave no credit whatever to those men, and did not pay any tribute to their glorious deeds. He is concerned solely in gaining some political advantage in this discussion with the object of disseminating a certain kind of propaganda regardless of the honour due to our soldiers. In proportion to our population the numerical strength of our armed forces bears favorable comparison with those of Great Britain and the United States of America. In order to equal our effort in that respect, those countries, in proportion to their populations, would need to despatch 13,000,000 men beyond their borders. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to refute those figures. Can any honorable senator visualize, at any stage of the war, 13,000,000 men being sent outside the borders of Great Britain and the United States of America? Only if they can visualize that are they entitled to ask for still greater Australian forces to be released for far-flung battle fronts. In the world strategy of this war, Australia's part is to provide and keep inviolate a base from which the defeat of Japan can be launched. The Government has framed its policy to meet this requirement of world strategy, and I remind honorable senators opposite that that policy is not finally dictated in Australia. It is determined by the higher commands, and this and any preceding Australian Governments could only make recommendations. In view of the greater power of other nations, we must be subject to their decisions, and rightly so, too. I have no disagreement on that score. I emphasize that this Government does not determine the strategy of the war. It will be remembered that in December, 1941, the Prime Minister said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Following that statement there was in this country a campaign which suggested that the Labour Government and the party that supported it, were disloyal and trying to sever the ties which link us with the British Empire. I remember that campaign well. It was started not only in New South Wales and Victoria, but also in South Australia, from which last mentioned State the most voluble senators on the opposite side of the chamber come, but it found little or no support in Australia, and it was ignored in America and Great Britain. An undercurrent of it has, however, continued ever since. Certain people have been trying to resurrect it on every possible occasion, as is evidenced by the action of the Leader of the Opposition in interpreting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin's</inline> statement which I have just quoted as " crying for help to be sent to Australia ". What was the position? This Government asked for help from America because it realized that Great Britain was not in a position at that time to give it. Great Britain had been savagely attacked and was in desperate circumstances itself. I take no exception to the action of the previous Commonwealth Government in sending out of this country, after Dunkirk, whatever it could lay its hands on to help the British Government. It was to the credit of that Government that it gave all the assistance it could to the Government of Great Britain. But when Great Britain was not able to assist Australia, when Japan prepared to attack us, and our Government realized that that attack was imminent, it appealed to America, whereupon America helped to save Australia. We were criticized and called disloyalists because we appealed to America. Statements to that effect were published in the British press, but I nave here extracts from newspapers published in Great Britain, which show the reception that that campaign received there. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> on 1st January, 1942, under the heading, " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin's</inline> view defended ", published the following: - " Outspoken John Curtin hae demanded a plan for the Pacific and for Australian self-defence. He is understood to have received a promise of one - 1 definite and decisive '," says the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> in a leader. </para>
                    <para> What has he said that is so dangerous and ' subversive ' ? " the leader continues. " In substance merely that Australia's views must be heard, that Australia must wake up and face the strategic problems of her own defence; in short, that there must bc a plan - now promised - for Australia." </para>

                        in a leader says: "Nobody in Britain will contest the essential soundness of Australia's case. She must, as a Pacific power in her own right, be given, and must assume, more responsibility in the conduct of a war that touches her so nearly. The only point at issue is the method. Does an Imperial war cabinet any longer suffice?
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline>
                        asks for a plan with the U.S.A. as keystone. He is only asking for what, in working out strategy in the Pacific, the Washington Conference must have decided upon."

                            idea as " forthright .and in many senses realistic ". The leader continues, however: "It does not follow that one must join him in refusing to consider the struggle in the Far East as  a .subordinate segment of the general conflict'.  Of course, it is not subordinate in any sense of the word. But certainly it is only part of the greater conflict. Yet one can well understand

                    <para>Those leading articles give a true interpretation of the Prime Minister's appeal to America, and reflect the opinion not only of the people of Australia, but also of the American people and those of the British Empire. In times of peace, I might have conceded that there was some justification for the campaign that has been indulged in for some time to destroy the confidence of the people in the present Government, but I say frankly that, in a time of national stress, when we are standing, as it were, with our backs up against the wall, fighting for our very existence, it ill becomes the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues to indulge in specious propaganda of the description for which they have been responsible. Honorable senators will also remember that even last week the Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Prime Minister and his Cabinet preferred to rest the burden largely upon the shoulders of our American friends. That statement is not founded upon fact. Between America, its .soldiers, the Commonwealth Government and the Australian people there has been the utmost co-operation. The Leader of the Opposition's interpretation of the statesmanlike and realistic utterance of the Prime Minister was, in effect, that we asked the United States of America to save us and yet would refuse to play our part in defeating Japan when the danger was removed from our shores. That also is incorrect. While <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> was in opposition, particularly during the war period, no man in this country played a more noble part or assisted the Government in the prosecution of the war more than he did. He made himself a big man 'in opposition. He never resorted to specious propaganda, but helped the Government in every possible way 'and restrained his party from attacking it lest it might interfere with the successful prosecution of the war effort. Further evidence of the campaign that is being waged to disunite the Australian people .and create a wrong impression in the British Empire and America is contained in a cable addressed to an overseas press agency. ' It was lodged as part of a service, arranged by the former Director of Information, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Murdoch, to be sent regularly to the United 'States of America, giving information based on editorial opinion and news published in the Australian press. I propose to read the cable. The cost of its transmission was charged to the Department of Information, which was the reason that my attention was officially drawn to it. It was as follows : - </para>

The .decision to arbitrarily and pointedly exclude Guadalcanal will profoundly humiliate every decent Australian. Worse still, our British kinsmen will have a full share of this astonishment and dismay. The cynical wounding gesture directed at the American people by the Australian Prime Minister, who a few days ago renewed his shrill invitation to the U.S. to send more and more of her conscripts to fight for us in sectors in which important elements of our own forces are specifically, even ostentatiously, forbidden to go " . . . </para>

                    <para>That shows the continuity of the propaganda that has been going on since the early part of last year, when we were accused, as a Government, of being disloyal. That propaganda is still being disseminated through all possible channels. Its originators are endeavouring to spread it not only throughout this country but also in the United States of America and in Groat .Britain. I point out to honorable senators opposite that the harm caused by that propaganda will not be done only to the Government, but also to the Australian nation. The message that I have read was based upon the contribution made by <inline font-style="italic">The Advertiser,</inline> published in Adelaide, in a leading article, to the proposal that the Government should extend the area in which the Militia may serve. It is a typical example of the distorted reports which are being printed for propaganda purposes by certain press interests which guide honorable senators opposite who represent South Australia. Incidentally, an interesting item was published in the press last week. It stated that last year Adelaide Advertiser Limited, after paying £43,000 in taxation, made a net profit of £91,750. The taxation paid was actually £13,000 less than during the previous year, and a dividend of 12 per cent, was paid for the seventh successive year to the holders of ordinary shares. The balance was added to the reserve, increasing the carryover to £82,576. That is the newspaper which guides certain honorable senators opposite. One can read in that, editorial the words that were uttered by the Leader of the Opposition. The figures which I have quoted show that during last year, when the Australian nation had to dive so much deeper into its resources to pay for a vastly accelerated war effort, the Adelaide Advertiser Limited accumulated a surplus of £91,000 and paid a dividend of 12 per cent, to ordinary shareholders, 3.2 per cent, being added to reserves. It is common knowledge that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Murdoch has a close interest in that newspaper. </para>
                    <para>In the course of debate on this measure I was surprised to hear one honorable senator opposite, in reply to an interjection, refer to the war service that is being given by a certain section of the community, namely, the sons of graziers. It is unfortunate that any particular section of the community should be selected for special mention in that way. No honorable senator will deny that the sons of graziers are playing their part  in  this war, but so also are the workers. Moreover, whilst in many cases the graziers' sons have left comfortable homes, many less fortunate individuals were, until the time of enlistment, on. the dole as the result of the misgovernment of this country during the past 25 years. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure I have many " pals ", and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clothier</inline> is not aware of the dissatisfaction that exists throughout the community over this bill he must be blind.' I shall go further, this bill does not represent the views of the Australian people - thank goodness - and I am quite satisfied that it does not represent the views of members of this Parliament and of at least some members of the Government. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> told us that he would relate the whole story, and I was looking forward to some rather interesting revelations. Had he told the whole story he would have satisfied my mind on some very interesting points in regard to which I remain so dissatisfied. This measure has been presented to Parliament, and to the public, in a form which I suggest is in. itself a misrepresentation of its real objective. Discussion on this matter opened with statements by the Prime Minister which indicated the necessity to amend the Defence Act to enable the Government to send Militia forces to any part of the South-West Pacific Area. However, the South-West Pacific Area referred to by the right honorable gentleman in these statements, was quite different from the area which is described in this bill as the South-Western Pacific Zone. I shall prove that to be so by quoting the Prime Minister's own public statements. </para>

                            <para>- There is no need to twist anything on this occasion. I am prepared to take the Prime Minister's word, and I take  his  word  not  from something that I remember but from a publication printed and published by the Commonwealth Government Printer, namely, the <inline font-style="italic">Digest of Decisions and Announcements and Important Speeches hy the Prime Minister.</inline> That publication includes the statement made by the Prime Minister on the 20th November, 1942, to which reference has already been made. In that statement the Prime Minister referred to the area in which Australia was being defended. He said that this country was being defended on an outer screen of islands running from New Guinea to the southern Solomons, New Hebrides, New Caledonia and Fiji. After referring also to Timor, the right honorable gentleman went on to say that the islands mentioned were within the theatre of the Southwestern Pacific, and were vital to the holding of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- No, but it indicates clearly that there is something wrong with this bill, because the area prescribed in it does not include Fiji, New Caledonia, New Hebrides or the southern Solomons. As a matter of fact, the curious thing is that of all the places referred to the only one which has been included in this bill is New Guinea. All the others have been excluded, although in the Prime Minister's statement they were referred to as islands within the South- Western Pacific Zone vital to the holding of the Commonwealth. </para>

What I am anxious to show is that the Prime Minister, who  above all is in possession of the information that would enable a judgment to be made on this matter, said these things in November last, and they were the foundations of his approach to the conference of the Australian Labour party. I call attention to another portion of the statement of the right honorable gentleman, who went on to say - </para>

What is the attitude of honorable senators opposite to a bill which limits the operations of the Militia to not only some of those islands but also to that part of them that is south of the Equator. Surely, if it is the negation of common sense to say that we shall send troops to some islands and not to others, it becomes ludicrous to divide an island by an imaginary line, and say that our troops may go up to that line but not north of it. </para><para>The Leader of the Senate began to tell us a story this afternoon about a map.

                            <para>- The section of the Labour party led by the Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> won that dispute. I congratulate him on the success that has attended his efforts - that, despite the prestige of the Prime Minister, he and his colleagues have been able to whittle down this proposal, so that it will not be in conflict with the policy of isolationism, for which he and the Australian Labour party conference stand, and always have stood. This bill is pure isolationism in another form. It sounds grand to say, " We will send Australian Militia troops as far north as the Equator ". Just imagine setting off on a military operation in the Netherlands East Indies with troops that the Commander-in-Chief knows may go only so far as an imaginary line, and must then stop ! The result is that, although on its face this bill appears to extend the area as far as the Equator, it does little more than include the territories of Timor and Dutch New Guinea. We should be thankful that Australia has received help from our American ally. </para>

I do not want it to go down in history that the best that this Parliament was prepared to do in this crisis was to pass a bill which allowed the Australian Militia to <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> only so far as Timor and Dutch New Guinea. I believe that when this war is over Australiawill be greatly in need of friends. We shall need Friends and supporters in the international sphere. The degree of assistance and sympathy which is likely to be extended to us by other communities then will depend in a great measure upon how wo undertake the burden which we should shoulder now. I agree that this measure does not represent the whole of Australia's war effort; but it is the kind of legislation by which Australia will be judged in other countries. It will be known in other countries that the Commonwealth Parliament passed this limiting act. The people of those countries will easily forget the exploits of the Australian Imperial Force even should they hear of them; but they will not forget a tiling like this to which a great deal of publicity is given. If we have any regard for our international reputation, we shall see that we put on the statute-book a measure which is more in accord with the real views of the members of this Parliament and of the people of this country. </para>

I remind the Senate that in the first two years of the war, when other governments were in office, the Labour party had its representatives on the Advisory WarCouncil. They were in a position to know the real situation in regard to aeroplanes and other war materials. Now they endeavour to present to the Australian community a picture indicating that the absence of some of those things wasdue to some negligence on the part of previous governments. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- That is so. When we talk about the strength of the Militia when the Menzies Government went out of office we should not forget that Japan had not then entered the war. That argument cuts both ways. In New South Wales, particularly, an important issue at the last election was the rationing of  petrol. The Labour  paTty  won. a number of seats in that State because of its opposition to rationing. Every time that I hear such misrepresentation I shall endeavour to make the position clear. I regard the bill before us as a bad one, but I shall not vote against the second reading because I believe that it is a measure which is capable of improvement by amendment. In committee, I shall move an amendment which I believe will improve the bill. However, should it not be amended in committee, I shall continue to regard it as a measure which will not warrant my casting a vote in its favour. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the bill. I shall oppose any attempt to amend it, because it is entirely adequate for the purpose which it is designed to serve. Nations, like individuals, have principles, and we must maintain our national principles at all cost. All of us know the dangers which threatened us following Japan's entry into the war. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> then appealed to Great Britain for assistance, but found that the Mother Country itself was in dire straits and could not come to our aid. Therefore, we made a direct appeal to the United States of America for assistance, and, to-day, in response to that appeal noble fighters from that country are helping us to defend our shores. The Labour party believes in the Militia as a unit of our defence forces. This party founded the Militia in 1910. Unfortunately, a Labour government, under duress during the depression years, was forced to abandon compulsory military training, but no succeeding government saw fit to re-establish it. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> G. Ogilvie, who was the leader of the Labour party in Tasmania, and for many years Premier of that State, made a tour of the world, and, as the result of what he saw in Germany, Austria, Italy and other European countries, he advocated, on his return to Australia, the re-introduction of compulsory military training.. He took up that matter with the anti-Labour Government then in office and urged it to establish a super air force.  He  urged it to blacken our skies with aeroplanes. We know that Australia was not properly prepared to defend itself when the war broke out. That was not the fault of the Labour party, because a non-Labour government was in office at that time. Speaking on the Supply Bill on the 27th September, 1938, in my first speech in this chamber, I said - </para>

                        <para>The Labour party believes that Australia must largely depend upon aerial defence. We cannot expect Great Britain to send its navy to the Pacific in order to protect Australia when its ships are urgently required at home. Australia's preparedness for defence depends upon the number of fighters, bombers and aircraft carriers at its disposal. We should have an aerial fleet that could easily defeat any force that is likely to be brought against us, and it is essential that the Air Force be provided with facilities such as landing grounds and oil supplies. </para>

                    <para>But how long was it before the Government established air-training schools and aerodromes throughout Australia? I believe in the Militia as an organized fighting force. Youths under 21 should not be sent to combat zones. They should be trained and gradually welded into a fighting force, before they are actually sent into battle. I base that observation on personal experience. I was only nineteen years of age when I had my baptism under fire. So long as the younger men were under expert officers they did the job allotted to them, and did it well; but when they were thrown on their own initiative they were unable, owing to lack of experience, to do the right thing. The utilization of youths under 21 in battle zones should be carefully considered. -  1  was a member of the Militia under the compulsory service system in 1912-13-14. I took a great interest in the work of that force, and I say definitely that the greatest stumbling-block to the proper use of the Militia in any zone is the arrogance and stupidity of a great number of officers. The officers of the Australian Imperial Force were superb. They were well trained and knew that they were leading volunteers. However, officers in charge of compulsorily enlisted men seem to have a peculiar psychology. They treat the men harshly simply because they know that the latter have no " come back ", and give them a very raw deal. For these reasons, our officers must be specially trained in the management of men.  The  most successful officer in any fighting zone knows how to manage the men under him. The Government should immediately take steps to  establish in all training schools for officers throughout the Commonwealth a special course dealing specifically with the management and welfare of the men. </para>
                    <para>I repeat that the bill is adequate for the purpose for which it is intended, namely, to enable us to hold certain zones for the protection of Australia. It is a fallacy to suggest that a small nation like Australia, confronted with the problem of defending a large continent with a small population, should be expected, when faced with a lifeanddeath struggle in its own region, to send forces to other theatres. It is not in the same position as are the great nations which, after providing for the security of their home territories, have a substantial margin of strength for service in other parts of the world. We can only resolve this problem on the facts of the military position. It is clear that Australia's strength is not sufficient to meet all the contingencies of the military situation with which it may at any time be confronted, and the strength of the Allied forces in the South-West Pacific Area is inadequate to provide for more than a holding strategy with a limited offensive action. The South-Western Pacific Zone has been defined on sound military principles. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has effectively answered all criticism to the effect that our failure to permit members of the Militia to be sent beyond the limits of that zone means that we refuse to attempt to free our prisoners of war in Malaya. I am certain that the enemy would not be so foolish to keep prisoners taken in Malaya in that region in view of its proximity to India and Burma where the Allies are now commencing an offensive. I quote the Prime Minister's exact words on this subject - </para>

                        <para>Criticism has been made that the Citizen Forces cannot serve in Malaya and the Solomons. 'Ih is quite ignores the strategical set-up in the South-West Pacific Area. Our forces are assigned to the Commander-in-Chief of the South-West Pacific Area, whose sphere of command does not extend to those regions. 1 would repeat, however, that when the position permits, Australian forces will be available in any theatre in which they can best be employed. The criticism that, because the boundaries of the area do not extend to Malaya, the Government is abandoning Australian prisoners of war in that region is a gross distortion of the position and the facts, and creates unwarranted anxiety in the minds of their relatives. I repeat that, if our forces are assigned to General MacArthur who is conducting one campaign in the South-Western Pacific Zone, how can they be placed at the disposal of Field-Marshal Wavell who is conducting another campaign in the Indian area which embraces Malaya? It would be equally true to say that we are abandoning our prisoners of war in Germany and Italy because the boundaries of the zone do not extend to Europe ! When the time comes to use forces from the South-West Pacific Area in another theatre, it will bc soon enough for the critics to raise their voices on this matter. At present, their ideas cut across the whole strategical set-up of the campaign. Their adoption would result only in chaos and defeat, with the consequence of endless servitude for these Australian prisoners of war. The Government has no intention of following any course other than the soundest military course, which will result in the earliest possible release of these men. </para>

                        <para>Australia has once been perilously near to the brink of disaster. No nation, not even Britain, has been in greater danger of invasion and yet lacked the resources with which to defend itself. We possess neither a large navy nor a large air force, and the most effective part of our Army was overseas when Singapore fell. Our inability to despatch battle-trained troops to the New Guinea area to stem the Japanese advance almost let Japan into a base from which the whole of eastern Australia would have been vulnerable to attack. This would have neutralized Australia as a base from which the United Nations could attack Japan. When the holding phase is passed, when the enemy has been driven beyond the boundaries laid down, and when the size of the Australian naval, land and air forces which go forward from this area are realized, it will then be early enough for the critics to complain about the extent of Australia's cooperation. We may go through many trials in the Pacific before then, but the immediate aim and responsibility of the Government to the Australian people is to ensure the security of Australia as a base; to co-operate in driving the enemy from threatened points of attack; and to co-operate in offensive action from the jumping-off points as soon as the. strength of the forces in the South-West Pacific Area permit. </para>

                        <para>. -  Before addressing myself directly to the bill, I shall replyto certain statements made by honorable senators- opposite. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> in his opening remarks, told us of what had been done in the defence of Australia and, added, " We sent troops abroad ". That is not correct, because every honorable senator knows that on each occasion when, the Menzies and Fadden Government proposed to send troops abroad honorable senators opposite, who were then in opposition,, strenuously opposed those proposals. The Leader of the Senate declared that the South- Western Pacific Zone, as defined in the bill, represented the minimum and the maximum. However, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> stated some time ago that when our troops reach the limits of that zone they will, if necessary, continue beyond those limits. The Leader of the Senate has contradicted the Prime Minister on that matter: </para>

                    <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> was speaking with regard to the vote on the conscription referendums taken in. 1916 and 1917, an honorable senator opposite challenged his figures. This measure is, in effect, a conscription measure. It is advisa'ble, therefore; to give the figures in connexion with those referendums. Some people have an erroneous idea that on each occasion the majority of our soldiers voted against conscription. That is not correct. The soldiers' vote- in 1916 showed a majority of 13,505 in favour of conscription, and, in the referendum held in 1917 a majority of 9,S79. The- bill is very long overdue, and, as a member of the Opposition, I welcome it. Although it is a- very meagre contribution to what we require, it does indicate an awakening- in the ranks of the Government and the Labour party to the fact that an all-in war effort requires something more than the making of regulations and cheer-chasing speeches. Although the bill is only the nucleus of what we should like to see, it does indicate the preparedness of the Government to defend this country in a proper manner. </para>
                    <para>In its effort, Australia has done remarkably well in proportion to its population. I do not say that it has done a 100 per cent. job,, but it has done a really good. one. As regards the manufacture of arms and ammunition,, it has surprised not only itself, but its neighbours with larger populations by the supplies it has produced. The people of Australia responded very generously to the Government's appeals for funds to finance the war. In their fighting qualities, our men, wherever they have been engaged in. this conflict, have maintained the traditions- set up by their predecessors in the war of 1914-18. The civilian population of Australia has put up with minor inconveniences - and they have been only minor ones. Circumstances and situations always give rise to comprehensive phrases, and people nowadays talk glibly about a global war. The most casual observer, glancing at the map of the world, must recognize that that, is- a. very suitable designation, because, with the exception of Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, part of Russia beyond the Ural Mountains, and portion of Turkey north of the Bosphorus, all Europe is to-day under the- control of Hitler and Mussolini. In that I must include Sweden, because, although Sweden has not yet capitulated to Germany, it is practically under German control. That is the debtor side. On. the credit side are Great Britain, China, the United Sta.tes of America, the British Dominions as well as other smaller countries. A comparison of countries requires also a comparison of populations. I propose to make the calculation in order to show what a small portion of the Allied Nations Australia represents, and- how absurd it is that we should attempt to say just what we should do, how we shall do- it, and where. Just prior to the war, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Max</inline> Werner published a book entitled.. <inline font-style="italic">Military Strength of the Powers,</inline> in which he gave the relative fighting strengths of the different countries of the world at the time.

                    <para class="block">I gather from statistics that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Werner</inline> was somewhat conservative in his estimates of the strength of the Axis Powers, and I am rather inclined to take the figures of Professor Karl Brandt, an American economist who was attached to the University of Berlin at the time the war broke out. In an article on foreign affairs he credits Germany and its European allies, which include Italy, Bulgaria and Rumania, with 170,000,000 people. Germany also has, in the countries it has occupied, another 165,000,000 people, entirely subservient to their masters, the Germans, who will exact from them everything possible by violence or fraud. If to these are added Japan's 65,000,000 people - this does not include Korea, as against which I am omitting the populations of the British dominions - it gives an Axis total of 400,000,000 people. As the Allied total is about <inline font-style="italic">S00,600,000</inline> people, we have practically two-to-one against the Axis. The  all-in  war effort of the Allies cannot be confined to any particular zone. The members of the Royal Australian Air Force at present in Great Britain, and participating in bombing raids on Berlin and other cities in Europe night after night, are fighting for Australia just as surely as if they were fighting in Australia. The American soldier in New Guinea is fighting just as much for America as he is for Australia. Our allies, being very busy, arc probably not taking much notice of what we are doing, but the history of this war will some day be written, and I am afraid that our parochial attitude will then reflect no great credit on us. The Government and its supporters appear to think that we on this side of the chamber are trying to dictate to "them what they shall do with the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia. We are doing nothing of the kind. We are trying to give the Government power to do what it likes with them. We are not dictating to it in any way how far they shall go, and where they shall stop, but we want it to have the power to send them wherever they are required. In comparison with the immense population figures that I have just quoted, our people number abo.it' 7,000,000. Is it not ridiculous arrogance on the part of so small a nation to attempt to dictate to its S00,000,000 allies where its men shall fight? Our allies have 1.00 people for every person that we have in Australia, yet we are attempting to tell them what we are going to do, and where we shall do it. That is unfair, not only to our own people, but to our allies. The Leader of the Senate made an appealing speech a few weeks ago on the defence of Australia, in which he told us that this country was well worth defending. We knew that quite well without his advice. Every member of the Senate, and the majority of the people of Australia, know it, and are prepared to defend their country, but there is a section which does nothing towards it. The Leader of the Senate might have stirred their enthusiasm if he had told the people of Australia who is defending them to-day. If Japan had struck at Sydney Harbour instead of Pearl Harbour, none of us would be sitting here to-day. That shows who is defending us. </para>

Our present contribution is in my opinion a feeble effort to repay what has been and is being done for us. The Government is confident of full support for the bill at least from honorable senators on this side ' of the chamber, because it is a step towards our objective, which is much wider and bigger, but we should be lacking in our duty to the people of Australia if we allowed it to pass without stressing its many weaknesses. Its greatest is that the area defined by it is not wide enough. "We should at the same time make an apology to our allies for our arrogance, seeing that people are fighting for us all over the world in numbers totalling 100 for every single individual that we can muster. </para>

                        McLACHLAN.Yes, but I shall deal with that subject on the bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition. Let me view this measure from another angle. How did it come into existence? Let me trace it from its infancy. In November last the Prime Minister informed the people of Australia that the military advisers of the Government definitely  stated that the safety of our country demanded a fuller strength outside of our territorial boundaries; in other words, that our volunteers were not sufficiently numerous to hold positions necessary for the safety of Australia. In those circumstances did the Prime Minister call his Ministers together? Did he call a meeting of the War Cabinet, the Advisory War Council, or even the Parliamentary Labour Caucus? He did none of those things. He preferred to consult his political advisers, by which action on his part the safety of Australia, and the advice of his military leaders were made subordinate to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fallon</inline>
                        and his executive, whilst Parliament was made subservient to an outside junta.

                            <para>- I shall leave the matter to the Minister for External Affairs and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> to fight out between themselves. I am concerned only with what led up to the framing of this measure. We all know what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> did : He submitted certain proposals to the Australian Labour party conference, held in Melbourne, and presided over by M~r. Fallon, but, in the words of Robert Burns, " The best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley". Apparently the Prime Minister was confident that his eloquence would be sufficient to win over the conference, but his proposals did rot get the support that he expected. Obviously, in anticipation of obtaining that support, he had summoned Parliament to meet on the 7th December, but it seems that, although he himself was prepared to scrap certain ideals to which he had clung for a number of years, some of the delegates decided to stick to the old platform of the Labour party. It is true that a few delegates thought that they had better follow their leader, but others, as a matter of political expediency, announced that they wished to consult their State executives before making a decision; but whether that account of the proceedings be right or wrong, the Prime Minister's proposals were not accepted by the conference, and the two-day session of Parliament, held on the 7th and 8th December, was an absolute fiasco. Western Australian members were brought thousands of miles to Canberra, and all that was put before them was- a statement, the contents of which could have been read in the newspaper a fortnight or three weeks before. Since then this question has been settled and unsettled half a dozen times. Honorable senators were told - it was almost whispered to us - that if we walked along a certain passage and knocked at a certain door we would be permitted to see a certain map. Apparently the map was so secret that the official secretary had to be in attendance while honorable senators and members of the House of Representatives were inspecting it. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> and several others, I tip-toed down the passage, knocked at the door, and was admitted to view the map. Although we were not satisfied with it, we decided that it would be better to take what was offered. This bill was in print at that time. By interjection, we have heard this evening that the Commander-in-Chief altered the zone before the bill was presented to Parliament. The result is that the zone prescribed in this measure is not even that which honorable <inline font-style="italic">senators were</inline> shown on the all-important map.* When introducing this measure in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister said, " It is a bill drawn up in accordance with the realities of our problems". I do not think that statement has a parallel in -any British community. It is absolutely true; but it was given with a sinister meaning, and a clever cover-up. After four months, this contemptible attempt, to strengthen the defence of our country has been submitted to Parliament. If the Prime Minister had said that this measure had been drawn up in accordance with his own problems, and those of his .party, that statement would have been absolutely true. It is quite apparent from a perusal of press reports, or an examination of information from al: Y other source, that there was no problem so far as the people of Australia were concerned, nor was there any problem in either House of this Parliament. To say that the measure had been drawn up in accordance with the problems of the country was simply nonsense. I hope that never again will a political leader have to bring down in this Parliament such a miserable remnant of his own opinions, after they have been pulled to pieces by the party to which he belongs. The civil laws of our country make it a criminal offence' for a person to obtain money by false pretences, and I think that if he were tried for that offence, the Prime Minister would have considerable difficulty in avoiding conviction. Some time ago the Government appealed to the people of Australia to subscribe to a £100,000,000 loan, and during the period of that loan the Prime </para>

                            <para>- No, I think that it was a very fine statement, and the people responded wonderfully, but now the Prime Minister is not going to do the job. He has obtained the money, but he is not prepared to go as far as he said he would. Surely that is obtaining money under false pretences. People do not like being deceived, and when the Prime Minister made a definite promise he should have been prepared to carry it out. I shall support this bill - let honorable senators opposite make no mistake about that - but the fact remains that its history is so well known that no amount of reiteration can make it more despicable. It has one redeeming feature, namely, that although the Labour party, ever since its inception, has strenuously opposed conscription, it has now, with some degree of consent from caucus, decided in favour of extending the area in which our fighting forces may serve - to the Equator in the north, and, if necessary, to the South Pole. Although the eastern and western boundaries of the zone are indeed narrow, the proclamation of that zone is also a declaration that the " noconscription " flag has been lowered and that, in spirit at least, the antieon.scriptionist has capitulated. We on this side of the chamber are pleased to see the Government go this far, and I promise that we shall keep it up to the mark. All we desire is that the Government shall have power to send Australian troops to whatever part of the world their services may be required. I repeat that I am not appealing for the proclamation of any particular area; I am merely asking that the Government be given power to do the job that should be done. </para>

                        <para>. -  Much has been said about this measure, and I for one believe that too much stress has" been laid upon the circumscribed area specified in the bill and not enough upon Australia's duty as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and to our American cousins who rushed to our aid when we were in dire distress. In other words, there has been too much selfishness and too much consideration for the safety of our own hides. I should much prefer to see a broader outlook. As a Britisher, I consider that we are not doing justice to the name of Australia, and are letting down our allies when we seek to confine the operations of our Militia forces to the narrow zone prescribed in this measure. </para>

                    <para>I should like to make passing reference to another measure which is now before the Senate, and which the Government would have been well advised to adopt. I make only brief reference to that legislation, because if it were passed the Government would have the great technical advantage of being able to move our troops anywhere whether they be members of the Militia or of the Australian Imperial Force. I make that reference as an ex-service man and to indicate that I am not opposing this measure with a desire to be obstructive. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has submitted legislation which I contend would meet the needs of the case fully, and I consider that even at this late hour the Government would be well advised to take advantage of that legislation to know the cause of all this ill-feeling and counter the many arguments that are being raised with regard to the provisions of this hill, not only in this chamber, but also among the public generally. In the first place, when we compare the aims of this measure with what is being done by the  people  in the Old Country, it is clear that it is sadly lacking. The same I would say to our cousins of the United States of  America,  in comparison with their action in sending the expeditionary forces to ensure  the  safety of Australia. By fixing a zone beyond which the Citizen Military Forces may not be employed against the enemy, we are stultifying ourselves after what has been done so readily by our American cousins. It is futile for the Leader of the Senate to quote what General MacArthur said, or the pledge which Australia gave to him through the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> when he came to Canberra last year.  As  a matter of fact, General MacArthur's name should not have been mentioned in this debate. In my opinion, he had nothing whatever to do with the drafting of the zone beyond which the Citizen Military Forces may not be used. Nor do I think that the British Commander-in-Chief in this so-called global strategy, was consulted. Even if he had been consulted, I doubt whether .he would have had the temerity to give advice on such a domestic matter. The Australian people have to decide the question, and I should like them to decide upon something more substantial and generous to the Old Country and to our American cousins. </para>
                    <para>By interjection previously, I likened this bill to a dead fish. In response to our urgent appeals, the Americans hastened to our assistance, and we now repay them by figuratively smacking them in the face with a dead fish. The bill was severely man-handled throughout Australia. The Prime Minister carried it on his journeys to and from Melbourne to consult with his Australian Labour party bosses, or the "Fascist Grand Council of the Labour party " as it, is rightly called, and to Sydney to discuss it with the Trades Hall josses there. Then he handed the fish to the Leader of the Senate who pirouetted to Brisbane for the purpose of seeing what he could do with the Queensland Central Executive. </para>

In my opinion, the bill should be rejected as a gesture from the Australian people that they can think more broadly than is indicated by two . parallel narrow lines drawn north and south just beyond the boundaries of the territories of the Commonwealth. We  should be able to demonstrate to the British and American people that we have a conception far broader than has been displayed by this Socialist Government in drafting this legislation. </para>

                    <para>Too much emphasis has been laid upon the word "conscription". The Labour party has clearly indicated that it has not progressed during the last 45 or 50 years. One might have understood that attitude many years ago. Before the Boer- War, there was a certain amount of antipathy to what windy gentlemen on the Yarra bank were prone to describe as the " imperialistic grabbing by Great Britain of every available acre on the globe ". Those windbags constantly bruited it abroad that Great Britain was ill-treating the people of India. They loved to use the word "exploiting". One can imagine the Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> getting his tongue around " exploiter ". Those windy gentlemen claimed that Great Britain used to exploit the downtrodden masses of India, and browbeat and shoot the Dutch settlers in South Africa. Therefore, 'we can understand why certain misguided people in Australia were opposed to the conscription of Australian manhood for the purpose of " exploiting downtrodden races ". Then there was the conscientious objector and the ragged end of the Sinn Fein element who hated' the word " Britain ". They would have sacrificed their right arm so that they could not have been called upon to help Great Britain. Finally, there were the feather-brained pacifists who liked to prate about the " international brotherhood of man ". All of them were opposed to war, and hoped that Australia would never be called upon to fight. All those types were opposed to conscription, and they made their presence felt in the Australian Trades Hall movement. Incidentally, they were helped on their way by the fact that Australia was isolated from war-like countries, and Great Britain always kept a protecting arm near us in the form of certain naval strength, also substantial numbers of troops stationed in India, Burma and China. Their very presence deterred countries whose covetous eyes turned to Australia. This protection helped pacifists and others in their advocacy of " no conscription for overseas service "". </para>
                    <para>But those things all belong to the dead past. To-day, it is a question not of conscription, but of national service to our own country at a time when it is threatened with invasion. How can we apply conscription, as Australians knew it 40- years ago, to national service for the purpose of repelling the Japanese? All the arguments which have beon used by the Trades Hall, party regarding conscription fall to the ground because of this threat of invasion. Every one must do his or her best to hurl back the Japanese to Tokio. The Germans in South Russia- are already on the run, and when the Japanese commence to retreat, they will not halt until they reach Tokio. Consequently, no restriction should be placed upon the use of the Citizen Military Forces to pursue this enemy right to his own doorstep. It is wrong, fundamentally and ethically, for the Government to restrict the use of a portion of our forces in view of the generous help which has been extended to us by Great Britain and the United States of America. </para>

Now that Australia has an opportunity of rendering material assistance to its allies, the Government submits this anaemic bill which gives with the one hand and takes away with the other. This is not the true Australian spirit.

                        hope that the Government will accept another bill that has been introduced in this chamber to provide for the unrestricted use of all our troops against i he enemy. It would be absurd to say that this bill is not causing heartburnings among the people of Australia. I daresay other honorable senators have received copies of a letter, dated the 9th February last, which has been sent to me from the Housewives' Association of  New South Wales. It is signed by

The limitations imposed on the Government bill by a comparatively small number of men outside Parliament because of party politics is breaking the hearts of many mothers, and I have promised to send on their plea to you to save their sons and let party politics go to the wall during the war - that is, if you all have the courage. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is a reasonable expression of the views of many people who are concerned about the fate of their sons who are prisoners of war in Malaya. It was stated by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> in the House of Representatives, that to argue that this bill prohibited the movement of the Militia into the Malaya peninsula, where a few Australians were still held as prisoners, was wrong, because most of those prisoners were nearer to Japan. That statement has been ex- posed by an announcement made by the British Minister for War, who has declared that the bulk of the prisoners taken in the Malayan campaign have not been moved from that area. Therefore, the Attorney-General made a misleading statement, because a large percentage of the 17,000 Australians captured in Malaya are still there. The fact is that the passage of this bill would preclude the sending of the Militia to the help of their own kith and kin in Malaya. It is necessary to amend the bill by removing its restrictions or by extending the area to which the Militia may be sent. I shall vote against the second reading of the measure, and, should it reach the committee stage, I shall seek to have it amended. </para>

                        <para> - To-day I received an answer to a question asked by me regarding the curtailment of the omnibus service from St. Mary's to Launceston. I protested to the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lawson)</inline> against the action taken in this matter, but the reply that I have received shows no justification for the curtailment. I asked whether the Minister had any further evidence in support of the action taken, and, if so, whether he would lay it on thetable. The reply received to-day indicated that the Minister had no further evidence to submit, and I therefore feel compelled, in the interests of the war effort, to bring this matter to the notice of the Senate, and lodge a protest against the curtailment of the service, particularly as no saving in rubber, petrol or man-power has been effected. The Minister states that a railway runs parallel with the omnibus route to which I have referred: That is true, but it is one of the worst railway services in Tasmania, and, perhaps in Australia. Many of the railway passengers are compelled to stand in the carriages for the whole of the distance from their home towns to Launceston. The omnibus service which has been further reduced had already been reduced by 50 per cent. The advisers to the Minister for Transport are evidently victimizing country districts under the pretext of saving rubber, petrol and man-power. Other towns and cities have omnibus services, some twice a day, and some of them run parallel with railways. The Minister claims that these services are necessary, and I admit that they are; but it is even more necessary that certain country services should also be maintained. The restriction of the service from St. Mary's to Launceston will result in a loss of man-power, because it is of value to the people in the district who are producing tin, wolfram, coal and rural produce, four products that are essential to the war effort. It has been the custom in this district when anything goes wrong with a piece of farm or factory machinery to put it on the omnibus and send it to Launceston for .repair or replacement. Unless replacements can be obtained quickly a serious loss of man-power occurs. The curtailment of this service will not save a single man; it will cause the loss of many man-power hours. Insufficient attention is being given by the authorities to the serious result of breakages in machinery in country districts. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There can be no doubt that the residents of Avoca, Fingal, .Cornwall, Storey's Creek, Rossarden and St. Mary's are being unfairly treated in this matter. The mines and sawmills operating in the district are making a useful contribution to the war effort which will be seriously" minimized unless replacements are quickly available when breakages occur from time to time. </para>
                    <para>Under normal conditions, when a breakage occurs, either the manager or one of his men in the industry concerned goes to Launceston .on the omnibus, spends two or three hours searching the city for a suitable replacement, and returns on the omnibus the same day. The breakage is repaired by the next day and production is resumed. The Minister said in his reply' to my question that the telephone could be used to obtain replacements and that the necessary spare part could be put on the train. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> S. "Wilson, the Director of Emergency Land Transport, nor the Director-General of Land Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harold</inline> Clapp, who is on a salary of £4,000 a year, has had any experience in this matter. Those individuals apparently do not realize what breakages of machinery means on farms, in saw-mills and mines. Although it may be possible to describe by telephone the nature of a breakage and to order a spare part, we all are well aware that such descriptions frequently result in unsatisfactory spares being forwarded, thu3 causing an additional loss of time. The stoppage of a machine may cause the temporary unemployment for quite a number of men in a given industry. The guards on trains cannot be expected to scour a city in order to obtain a suitable spare part for replacement. It is highly important that the St. Mary's service shall be maintained. </para>
                    <para>It is said that this service involves an undue use of petrol. As a matter of fact, it involves the use of only 5 gallons of petrol a month, for the 80-mile run each way is done principally on producer-gas. I am informed that the authorities in one district issue at least 30 petrol tickets a month in order to enable serious cases of sickness to be taken into Launceston by car. If it were not for this omnibus service, a much greater quantity of petrol would have been used in order to transport cases of sickness which could not be accommodated on the railway at the required times. I am quite satisfied that the curtailment of this service will involve the use of much more "petrol for this purpose. I do not suppose it. would be argued that petrol tickets should be refused to the persons who need them for the transport of serious cases of illness. </para>
                    <para>The Minister also stated in his reply that tyre wear equivalent to 25,000 miles of running per .annum will be saved by the curtailment of this service; but, in my opinion, that is not likely to be the result, for the curtailment of the service will involve many more private car  trips  to meet urgent needs of one kind and another. Additional man-power will also be required. I am quite satisfied that the omnibuses would involve considerably less tyre wear and considerably less petrol consumption than would be involved in the additional and unavoidable use of private cars. The talk about tyres in this connexion is all hooey.. The curtailment of the service cannot be justified in any way. </para>
                    <para>I wish now to refer to an omnibus service operating between Burnie and Smithton which has been running one trip a day each way. The Smithton to Burnie run is 60 miles. There is a railway service available, but it is the most obsolete in the Commonwealth. Mo.eover, it is not available to persons who live in some parts of the district, and they have no means of transport available other than the omnibus service. Even those people in the area who own cars receive a ration of only four gallons a month.. The Smithton to Burnie service is of particular value to the people in certain parts of the district and the action taken by the authorities to curtail it has not only definitely hindered :.he war effort in the district, but has also victimized the residents in the count/y. </para>
                    <para>Why has Tasmania been singled, out for treatment of this description? When the Director of Emergency Road Transport in Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> S. Wilson, was replying to a deputation which waited on him in connexion with this service,, he said that he was prepared to visit the district to make an investigation on the spot. I asked him if be would also visit the Fingal and St. Mary's district, but he declined to do so. He knew that I had been in the district, and that T had interviewed the members of the district council, the executive of the Shale and Coal-workers Federation, and the managers of the mines and sawmills and also other citizens. I had checked up on the facts. How can <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harold</inline> Clapp be expected to have any knowledge of the circumstances, in this district? He has never visited it and hd does not know the requirements of the people. </para>

                                Clapp was appointed to a certain position for a stipulated' term by the previous Government.. He was, in fact, Director of Aircraft Production, and he did not make a success of the job. Had this Government not found him another position it would still have had to pay him £4,000 a year for the unexpired period of his previous appointment. Judging by the treatment that the Director-'General of Land Transport is meting out to the country people in Tasmania he is likely to make just as great a failure of his present job as he did of his job as Director of Aircraft Production.

                    <para>In reply to the suggestion that the people in the districts to which I am referring have an adequate train service available I point out that the service was never adequate, and that since the outbreak of the war, even the former inadequate service has been seriously curtailed. The train leaves St. Mary's about 10 a.m. Fifty miles on their journey the passengers have to wait an hour and a half for a connexion to be made by another train and when the train runs on time it reaches Launceston at 2.46 p.m. I have travelled1 on the train scores of times and I am able to say from bitter experience that it runs on time 'on only about one trip in twenty. It is regarded as something in the nature of a record if a train arrives on time twice in succession. The train which is due to arrive at 2.46 p.m. often does not arrive until 3.30 p.ra:. The return train leaves an hour and a half later, so that travellers have only about one and a half hours to do their business, have their lunch, and  join  the return train. That frequently means that a journey of two days is required, involving loss of time and manpower. In case it should be said thatadditional rail transport will be made available, I shall read the following paragraph from the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> of last Thursday - </para>

                <para>PROBLEMS OF TRANSPORT</para>
            <para>Railway Services.  " Transport difficulties are world-wide and are not peculiar to Tasmania," said the Commissioner of Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wilson)</inline> yesterday, when referring to the criticism of the  chairman  of the Women's Employment Board (Judge Foster) of the Tasmanian railway services, and to thecomplaint of the Richmond Council regarding the service betweenHobart and Colebrook. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline>
                said the services at present were not as satisfactory as the commission would like, but the railways were being conducted under extraordinarily difficult circumstances because of the shortage of man-power and equipment and the lack of sufficient rollingstock to meet the demands of the extra traffic brought about by the war.
            </para>
            <para>The commission was doing its utmost to give the best service possible under the conditions, but some inconveniences would have to be put up with. The complaint of the Richmond Council would receive consideration when it came before the commission. </para>
            </quote>
            <para class="block">That is a clear admission by the Commissioner of Transport that the railway rolling-stock is already overtaxed, and that more cannot be provided. With a reduced railway service, how can a full war effort he expected in those districts? Has the Minister who has issued these instructions over considered the practicability of putting off the road ears which are used only for pleasure, and making their tyres available for use on vehicles which provide essential services? If not, I offer the suggestion to him. If the Minister intends  to  take more notice of men who have failed in other jobs, and probably have never visited the district in order to become acquainted with local difficulties, than he takes of men who have personally investigated this matter, he will meet with trouble. The residents in the district, particularly those in the St. Mary's and Fingal areas, know that they have been victimized by both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Wilson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harold</inline> Clapp. I shall therefore not attempt to justify the action that has been taken. 1 appeal to  the Minister  to  let an independent officer accompany me  to  the district in order  to  ascertain the facts. If that bo done, it will  be  found that between Hobart and Launceston, where there is one of the most efficient train services in the State, the owner of a bus service which is supposed to be restricted to one vehicle sometimes has three other vehicles running on the road. The flame thing occurs in connexion with some other services. Yet the people in the district to which I have referred are denied an essential service, notwithstanding that many of them have discontinued using their cars and rely on the services to which I have referred in an effort to save petrol and rubber. The Minister should not be gulled by some one who is prejudiced against the district. If further action be not taken to remedy the present unsatisfactory state of affairs, I shall be forced to take other action. </para>
