                    <para>. - As I indicated in my speech on the second reading of the bill, I intend to move an amendment to this clause, because, under it, the Government of the day is obliged to pay £30,000,000, or a sum equal to one-fourth of the amount received in each financial year as income tax from individuals other than companies, whichever is the less, into the proposed national welfare fund. Members of the Opposition have no objection to the Government submitting social welfare proposals , and, if they are acceptable to the Parliament, the Treasurer of the day must make money available to finance the services authorized. Therefore it should not be incumbent upon the Government to impose taxes upon the people in excess of the actual requirements. I move - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>That all the words after the word "fortythree," be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words, " such sums as are necessary to meet the cost of social services approved by the Parliament ". </para>
                <para class="block">Acceptance of the amendment would remove the obligation upon the Treasurer to transfer a fixed sum from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the national welfare fund, but he would naturally place in that fund the revenue necessary to meet the cost of services approved by the Parliament. I know that the highest motive of the 'Government is to establish a fund which will afford a sense of security to people who expect to benefit under social service measures approved by this Parliament, but that sense of security is illusory. The proposal of the Treasurer is that no money in the fund shall remain idle. Indeed, he pointed out in his financial statement that the balances would be invested, thus providing a useful source of temporary finance for war purposes. He also stated that they would be replaced by moneys obtained from long-term borrowing when funds were required later for welfare purposes. How the moneys are to be made available by long-term borrowing I do not understand, because the contemplated benefits are not distributed in the form of long-term investments, but in the currency of the country. As I stated yesterday, I should have no objection to this procedure if the Government had surplus funds, but the shortage of funds is greater now than it has ever been in the history of Australia. Although taxes are levied at the highest rates in our experience, the revenue is insufficient to meet the calls upon it. Consequently the money which will be taken from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and placed in the National Welfare Fund will mostly be used immediately for war purposes, but that which is paid out of the fund to meet social services will be replaced by treasury-bills for purposes of war expenditure. Built up in this way, the fund will be a mere travesty of what it ought to be, because it will consist merely of I O Us which will have to be redeemed later. When the moneys have to be replaced by long term borrowing, the Government of the day will have a first-class problem in the conversion of the unfunded debt with which the country will then be burdened. If, with the country at war, and the people, actuated by a sense of duty and patriotism, in subscribing to loans, the Government finds it difficult to raise money, how can it be expected to succeed in raising large amounts when the war is over ? No stability will be given to social services inaugurated under this proposal. The Treasurer has rightly stated that the fund will be subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth Audit Act. For the information of honorable senators, I point out that under that act the Treasurer of the day will have, at any time, the right to close the fund, discharge the liabilities entailed, and place the balance in Consolidated Revenue. That is perfectly apparent from a reading of sub-section 4 of section 62a of the act, which provides - </para>

                        <para>- He will merely have to pay into the fund each year an amount of £30,000,000, or less. He could close it and open it repeatedly, but there will not be in it an accumulated surplus which will provide security for any social services which may be sanctioned by this Parliament. Are we to assume that the body of responsible men who constitute this Parliament will pass legislation for the inauguration of social services for which finance cannot be provided ? I cannot accept such a proposition. When  schemes of social benefit are brought forward, we believe that they can be financed, and that those on whom it is proposed to confer benefits will, in fact, be benefited. To suggest that the Government entertains any doubts in the matter, is to reflect on it. If the Government considers that certain social services are necessary, surely it has no doubt of the ability of this country to meet the cost of them! When invalid and old-age pensions, child endowment, widows' pensions, and repatriation benefits were instituted, was it suggested that this country would not be able to meet the cost of them? Such a suggestion would be a reflection on this Parliament. What has been done has been intended to give a semblance of security to proposals which the Government has not yet placed before this Parliament, but which I have no doubt it will eventually introduce, in order to encourage the people to believe that benefits will be provided for them which it will be beyond the capacity of this country to finance. If, in any year, the revenue should be insufficient to meet the cost of any scheme passed by this Parliament, the Government of the day would have to raise, by loan if necessary, whatever amount was needed to implement the scheme; but no social service can be financed permanently with loan moneys. To suggest that a welfare fund consisting entirely of I 0 Us will afford greater security than the procedure ordinarily adopted in the financing of such schemes, is merely to employ camouflage. I hope that the Government will agree to the amendment because, if adopted, it will place the proposed national welfare fund, and the whole of its social proposals, in proper perspective. </para>

It is essential that a balance shall be built up to meet heavy commitments. If the honorable senator reads clause 6, he will find that the proposals contained in clause 5 have been guaranteed, and that his objective has been met. He has made scathing comments regarding what is to be done with the £30,000,000 pending its use upon social services. The money standing to the credit of the trust fund may be invested by the Treasurer in the following ways : - (o) in any securities with, or guaranteed by, the Government of the Commonwealth or of any State - consequently; the investment will be a sound one - or <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> on deposit in any bank. If the balances are invested in Government securities, a useful source of temporary finance for war purposes will be provided. The securities would be realized as the money was required for social welfare purposes approved by the Parliament. Interest on the investment of any money standing to the credit of the National Welfare Fund will be credited to that fund. I believe that all of us look to other nations for a lead in regard to big national  work3.  We British people look to the Mother of Parliaments.

                <para class="block">Therefore, the scheme is not so fragmentary as the honorable senator would wish us to believe. It would be stupid to place in a fund £30,000,000 raised by taxes, and allow it to remain idle when there is a good investment for it. The best investment, at the moment, is in the production of means for waging the fearful struggle in which we are engaged. Such an investment would ensure that practically every section of the community was contributing to the national effort. I frankly admit that so far that has not been the position. The base of the scheme of national welfare will be the National Welfare Fund. The amendment, if adopted, would be disastrous to the bill. Honorable senators have already been given sufficient assurances - but these will be repeated, if necessary, on clause 6 - of the necessity for the National Welfare Fund, if a scheme of social services is to be implemented. It must be borne in mind that only a small moiety of the total welfare scheme will be contained in the three measures which will reach the Senate next week from the House of Representatives. The big features of the scheme are the sickness benefits and the unemployment insurance scheme. The latter will certainly be needed at the termination of the war even though it may not be required at the moment. </para>

I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> that neither this nor any other government can completely rid the country of unemployment, because of the divers factors which cause it. Some men are unemployable. Certain work is beyond the capacity of others; whilst there are still others for whom work cannot be found. It is the wish of the Government, that when such a cloud descends on Australia, parents and little ones shall at least be assured of the existence of a fund from which they may receive assistance that will not be eleemosynary in character. The matter of unemployment will be covered by the post-war plans of reconstruction. Either this Government or any government that may be in office will have to undertake big works in order to absorb those who, in the change-over, will leave munitions establishments, because of the complete cessation of employment of that type. It will be impossible- to reassemble, at short notice, the many small businesses that have been closed. The principal factors, as I have said, are unemployment insurance and sickness benefit. The payments by way of maternity allowance and on account of funeral benefits for the invalid and old-aged, will probably increase only slightly. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> is sound. The Government proposes to establish a trust fund into which approximately £30,000,000 a year is to be paid, yet it is proposed to draw only about £2,000,000 during the first year from it. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> says that the amendment would destroy the bill, but I cannot see that that is so. The Joint Committee on Social Security recommended that the whole of the social services of the Commonwealth should be brought within the scope of the fund. As the Minister for Trade and Customs pointed out in an excellent speech yesterday, clause 6 provides that moneys standing to the credit of the National Welfare Fund shall be applied to making such payments as are directed by any law of the Commonwealth to be made from the fund in relation to certain, services and benefits. All that the Government has to do, in order to fulfil the requirements of the amendment, is to bring invalid and old-age pensions and existing social services which, total about £30,000,000 a year into this fund. There can be no objection to that. If that were done, the Government would get what it seeks in this bill - a national welfare fund of approximately £30,000,000 a year - and any further social services which may be authorized by the Parliament from time to time could be brought within the scope of the fund. That would meet the claims of the Opposition, and should be satisfactory to the Government also. </para>

                    <para>. -  The speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> avoided the real points which have emerged from this discussion. The establishment of a trust fund is a proper step to take. The Minister endeavoured to show that the National Health and Pensions Insurance Fund is sacrosanct - that the money placed in that fund is still there, or has been invested in sound securities such  as government bonds. The beneficiaries of the fund will want to know that this fund will remain sacred. I offer no objection to the money being invested in safe securities which are authorized by the Audit Act, but it amazes me that there is no .provision to prevent a needy Treasurer from dipping into the fund and transferring money from it to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Such things have happened before in Australia, and there is nothing in the measure to say that it shall not be done in connexion with this fund. I suggest that it is only fair that the fund should be made inviolate, and not capable of being drawn upon to swell Consolidated Revenue. The section of the Audit Act to which reference has been made should not apply to this fund; there should be no risk of any Treasurer of the .Commonwealth' balancing his budget by drawing on the trust fund to be established under this legislation. A fund into which will be paid either £30,000,000 a year or one-fourth of the revenue derived from a tax on the incomes of individuals is to be established. It has been suggested that the money may be invested in government loans and employed for war purposes. To that the Opposition offers no objection. Clause 6 does not go far enough because it does not negative section 62a of the Audit Act. We should place be yond all doubt that the money in this fund shall not be at the mercy of any needy Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Large</inline> appreciate the  effect of the provision to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> drew attention? Under it, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth - not the Government, or the Parliament - may, of his own free will, close a trust fund and pay any balance into Consolidated Revenue. I should have thought that the supporters of the Government, who appear to be desirous of establishing a fund to enable social benefits to be conferred on the people, would have some regard for the sacredness of the trust fund to be established for that purpose, and would not leave the money subject to the whim of any Treasurer, whatever his political associations may be. We all know the difficulties which sometimes confront Treasurers when trying to balance budgets. If the Government is really anxious to protect those for whom the fund is being established, it should accept the amendment, because it will secure the maintenance of the fund for that purpose. Even though the money be invested in bonds, or in other ways authorized by the Audit Act, it will still be there, and some one will have to account for it. If the money in the fund may, at any time, at the whim of the Treasurer of the day, be paid into Consolidated Revenue, we may have a repetition of what happened in Great Britain with the Lloyd George Insurance Scheme Fund; we may find that the amount to the credit of the fund will not be sufficient to meet liabilities. It is almost farcical to pass the bill and say that the money in the fund may be invested in certain ways authorized by the Audit Act, and then place the fund at the mercy of the Treasurer of the day. I appeal to the Minister in charge of the bill, who has a mind capable of understanding financial matters, and is, I think, anxious to provide security for those who will become beneficiaries under this legislation, to consider whether section 62a of the Audit Act should apply to this fund. I shall not willingly place any Treasurer, whatever his political associations, in a position which will enable him to take action to cause a sinking fund established under legislation passed by this Parliament to disappear.  In  Great Britain it was found that a fund which was established without the safeguard which we seek to provide was tending towards insolvency, and a grant of about £300,000,000 had to be made. If a fund is to be established in order to provide social security for those whom this bill seeks to cover, let us protect them in reality, by freeing it from the provisions of section 62a of the Audit Act. Even if the amendment foe carried in the form in which it has been moved, the position will not be improved, unless action is taken in respect of section 62 of the Audit Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> aims at maintaining parliamentary control over the funds established under measures approved by the Parliament. Let us suppose that the Parliament continues to approve legislation providing for additional social services. In that event, is the Senate, as a responsible branch of the legislature, to allow  a  fund which should be regarded as sacred to be at the whim of any Treasurer who may be in office? "Whatever else we may do with the bill before us, let us ensure that parliamentary control of the fund which it seeks to establish shall be maintained. The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> is of first class importance, and is worthy of the most careful consideration by the Government. If we leave this fund exposed in the way that has been indicated, we shall do a great disservice to the people whom the Government is seeking to protect. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators opposite seem to think that if the bill is passed in its present form the money in the trust fund which it seeks to establish will be used for different purposes altogether, and will not be available when it is required for the purposes set out in the bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan said that he would not give that power to any Treasurer. That was a strong statement. Does he think that any Treasurer of the Commonwealth will be dishonorable that he will use public moneys wrongly? It has been suggested that the money in the fund may be used for war purposes. I remind the Senate that all revenues of the Commonwealth, whether used for war purposes or to provide social security for the people, must come out of the pockets of the people. If a man has to provide £100 for a certain purpose, and he has £100  in  each of two pockets, what does it matter which pocket he dips into ? Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan think that there is no honour among Ministers, and that  no  Treasurer can be trusted to do the right thing? I have no doubt that when the money is required for the purposes set out in the bill it will be available. No honorable senator has a right to make the statements which the honorable senator made here this morning. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be seen that a previous government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan was a Minister, passed legislation containing a provision similar to that which the honorable senator now condemns. Section 62a of the Audit Act exists for a definite purpose. There are numerous funds in existence, and when the Treasurer of the day considers that there is no longer necessity for any fund, that section of the Audit Act provides that the balance standing to the credit of the fund may be paid into Consolidated Revenue. With all respect to the honorable senator, I say it is too stupid to suppose that, while the Government has in mind a considered welfare scheme of the kind which will be launched with the passage of this bill, it would do anything like he has suggested. I see no reason for the amendment, and the Government will not accept it. </para>

                    <para>. - If the Senate were to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride's</inline> amendment it would bring the hill more into line with the recommendations of the Social Security Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> was himself a member of that committee for some time, and is aware that it collected a great deal of evidence upon which it has issued five unanimous reports. Its recommendations embody three main principles. In regard to finance, it recommended that social security schemes should be financed by a graduated tax on income. The Government has adopted that recommendation, and I support it, though I may have advanced other views to the committee itself. Another recommendation was that all existing social service legislation should be combined in a comprehensive social service act. In the first report, which was issued on the 24th September, 1941, the committee, in paragraph 29, states - </para>

                <para class="block">I realize that the report of a parliamentary committee is not binding on the Government, but the Government has, in fact, accepted one of the principal recommendations, while refusing to accept the others. It refuses to accept the recommendation that the proceeds of the tax should be placed in a special fund, -from- -which- all disbursements for social welfare would be made. The amendment is in accordance with that recommendation. Yesterday, I suggested that the Government could immediately apply the principle of an all-embracing social security act by disbursing funds up to the amount of £30,000,000 among the social services already operating. In this way, the fund would be placed upon a sound basis, and the Government would have the honour of introducing a comprehensive social service scheme of which it would have reason to be proud. The Government would not lose any: thing by accepting the amendment, and our social service legislation would be improved. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment chiefly because it puts this bill in its proper perspective. This is not a bill to provide £30,000,000 for social welfare; it is a bill which pretends to provide £30,000,000 for that purpose, while, in fact, providing only £2,500,000, and I should like to see that clearly stated. The Minister has completely failed to answer . the criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> which he based on the .provisions of the Audit Act. He told us that the bill was a guarantee, and in a measure that is true. It is a promise that something will be done in the future1. No considered social welfare plan is provided for in the bill, and the only justification for the measure is that it provides the Government with an opportunity to say to the public, " We are putting aside £30,000,000 which is secured for the purpose of something that we propose to do in the future ". </para>

                        <para>- The truth is that it is not secured. Members of the Labour party must be very gullible if they believe that the form of words used in the bill constitutes a guarantee that the fund will continue to exist and will be used for the purposes described in the bill. Under the bill the Treasurer is to' pay £30,000,000 into a special account. He is required to do that, but the very moment he has done so he may, under the provisions of - the Audit Act, take it out again, seeing that there is in existence no social welfare scheme. </para>

                        <para>- I do nor. agree with that, but even if it were true, the fact is that there is no such act in existence at the present time. There is only a proposal to introduce three bills which will, provide for the expenditure of £2,500,000. I do not agree that a few paltry measures providing for an increase of the maternity allowance and for some slight variation in the matter of widows' pensions constitute a scheme of social insurance. If that is the best the Government can do in the way of a social security scheme, the sooner it gives up the job the better. When I speak of a social welfare plan I have in mind something comprehensive, something which would have regard to the social ills of the community, and which would seek to remedy them, or to alleviate evils arising out of them. I repeat that there is nothing before the Senate or even in the three bills referred to, which can, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as a plan for social welfare. Ear from there being anything of the kind, what the Government has so far placed before us is nothing more than a hotch-potch. According to the Government's proposals, some social services are to be financed out of the special fund, while others are not, but we have not been told why. I regard invalid and old-age pensions as part of a comprehensive social service scheme, but they are not included in the Government's plan. Apparently the 'Government is not concerned to provide what it calls a guarantee m respect of invalid and old-age pensions. Honorable senators opposite probably remember that the Scullin Government had to reduce the rate of invalid and old-age pensions, so they do not want to tie themselves to a guarantee in relation to such pensions. For that reason, invalid and old-age pensions are not to be included in this scheme. No guarantee is sought under the bill in respect of the cost of invalid and old-age pensions, which amounts to over £20,000,000 annually, or the cost of child endowment, which amounts to £12,000,000, or in respect of the millions of pounds expended annually on other social services. The guarantee now sought by the Government is in respect of the sum of £2,500,000, which is required for maternity benefits and funeral benefits for invalid and old-age pensioners. But even in respect of that small amount, the Government is not prepared to state its proposal frankly; it pretends that it is providing £30,000.000 for new social services. </para>

                    <para>. -  The arguments advanced by honorable senators opposite in this debate could emanate only from persons with Fascist and Nazi temperaments. Honorable senators opposite contend that no scheme is set out in the bill. That is " imaginitis ". The purpose of the bill is to provide &amp; fund for purposes which are briefly stated in it and to implement other bills which are to be introduced. I have no doubt that any proposal to place this money in the hands of trust companies, of which the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was a director when he was a Minister, and from which directorates he resigned a few years ago, would be supported by honorable senators opposite. In the near future, we must provide proper dwellings fox the poorer sections of the community. If that be not done, existing slum areas will become even worse. It is possible that portion of this fund will be used to afford relief to soldiers of the last war who were settled on the land under various schemes, and were starved off their holdings, and to-day are in need. The history of soldier settlement schemes in New South Wales commenced with the acquisition of a large estate at Coolah by a member of the New South Wales Parliament, who bought that land for £4 an acre, and the same land was sold to the New South Wales Government for £8 an acre. To-day, not one of the original returned soldier settlers remains on that land. The bill definitely states that money standing to the credit of the fund to be established under it shall be applied in making such payments as the Government determines. The measures under which such benefits will be specified must be dealt with progressively. </para>

                        <para>- Obviously, honorable senators are endeavouring to belittle the measure in order to hinder the Government in undertaking progressive schemes designed to help people who are most deserving of assistance. The amendment, if it be adopted, will mean that only £2,500,000 will be paid into the fund. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride,</inline> who has moved the amendment, knows that in one State alone as much as £9,000,000 a year was required to provide the unemployed with a dole which was only sufficient to enable them to purchase a loaf of bread a day. Therefore, it is useless to provide so small a sum for the provision of any social service benefits. Any fund for this purpose must be sufficient to assist our people when they are in distress. </para>

                    <para>. -  The main cause of the misunderstanding which has arisen in respect of the establishment of the proposed national welfare fund is due to the manner in which the Government has presented this and cognate bills to the Senate. We were asked to deal first with taxation proposals associated with this proposal. Although honorable senators opposite said that there was no connexion between the two measures, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> stated definitely that they were complementary. The Government should have submitted this bill before asking us to deal with the measure for financing this scheme. In addition, it should set out its scheme clearly and in detail. Once Parliament has agreed to the establishment of such a scheme it is obliged to raise in some way the funds necessary to implement it. However, in this instance, the Government has put the cart before the horse. We have already dealt with the taxation measure by which the welfare scheme will be financed, and now we are dealing with the bill covering the scheme itself. Even that would be acceptable if the bill clearly set out the details of the scheme. We have not been told what class of benefits are to be provided. We are asked to take a leap in the dark. No difference of opinion exists between honorable senators on this side and the Government with respect to the wisdom of providing social services. Indeed, honorable senators on this side have given proof of their bona fides by supporting past governments which have established the majority of our existing social services. One could almost say that all parties have competed with each other in their desire to provide essential social services. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable senators on this side have been endeavouring to ascertain exactly the purposes for which the fund proposed to be established under the measure will be used, but so far we have not received a satisfactory answer. We have been told that some of the money will be used to provide maternity allowances, but the amount required for that purpose will be but a very small proportion of the total fund. The clause dealing with the purposes of the fund is couched in vague and shadowy terms. It does not indicate exactly what is in the mind of the Government. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arthur,</inline>  who, I presume, has some knowledge of what is in the minds of the Ministers, has just informed us that some of the money will be used for housing schemes. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that assurance from the Minister; because if one of the purposes for which the fund is to be used is the provision of housing, the amount proposed to be set aside would be entirely inadequate to finance social' services. The Opposition does not desire to defeat the measure. We wish to improve it. Indeed, the provision of social service benefits is dear to the heart of every honorable senator on this side. Our concern is that the Government should not fail in any respect in dealing with this matter. Honorable senators opposite have reiterated that the Government can finance social services out of loan money and still maintain solvency. The fact is that any government which does not finance Social services out of ordinary current revenue is heading for disaster. The bill will bolster up the opinions of honorable senators opposite, who are always saying that whilst we have always been able to find millions for war purposes, we have failed to find the money necessary to finance ordinary social services. That statement has been constantly repeated not only in this Parliament but also in the country. </para>

                    <para>. -  The contentions of the Opposition in support of the amendment are a repetition of the general objections that honorable senators opposite raised to this clause during the debate on the motion for the second reading of the bill. They must be aware that the Government has consulted with the Treasury regarding the administration of the fund. Surplus moneys in the fund will be invested, and interest accruing on them will be placed to the credit of the fund. If the Government had agreed to bury the money in a jam tin in a suburban garden, the Opposition would have been well content. Honorable senators have even questioned the Audit Act. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators opposite have questioned the right of the Government to make provision for the post-war period, but they ignored the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Social Security, which was appointed, not by the Labour Government, but by the Menzies Government two years ago. That committee is representative of all political parties in this Parliament. After exhaustive inquiries, it has submitted recommendations for the provision of social services generally, and those matters are covered by the bill. The time is now opportune to plan for the future, and that is the object of the Government in establishing the proposed national welfare fund. True, only a small amount of the money paid into the fund will be expended immediately on social services; but the remainder will be invested in gilt-edged securities. This is not the first occasion on which moneys in trust accounts have .been invested on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I have had an opportunity to consider the second-reading speech made by the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> on this measure, and I propose to support the bill. It is only fair to state that, in war-time, one could not expect the Government to establish a more elaborate mortgage institution than the proposed mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank provided for in this measure. However, I consider that there is some merit in the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald, who dissented from the recommendations of the special committee which examined this matter, that, having regard to the serious financial strain that is imposed upon this country to-day owing to the war, the time is not opportune for a measure of this kind. I should like to make it quite clear, however, that the principle of a national mortgage bank department has no greater supporter than that honorable senator. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The setting-up of a mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank involves an important principle. There is no doubt that long-term loans can be of immense value, particularly to  those individuals who are starting out in industry. Every man who has had some business experience realizes that there is some foundation for the criticism that, in effect, private banks give to a businessman an umbrella when it is dry, and take it away when it is raining. I know from my experience of the last depression that the most difficult time to get an overdraft is when it is really required. Of course, our private banking institutions are business undertakings. They are holding the money of their shareholders and depositors, and they have to impose adequate safeguards in their business dealings. If any institution should lend money on a long-term basis at a reasonable rate of interest, it is the Commonwealth Bank, and although the limitations imposed under this measure may cause some disappointment in certain quarters, at least it is an important step in the right direction <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> far as our national bank is concerned. It is a foundation, and, as I said earlier, one could not have expected the Government to have done much more in time of war. </para>
                    <para>It is regrettable that, as has been the case with many other important national projects, the establishment of a mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank has been made the plaything of party politics. For the last fifteen years, politicians and would-be politicians have been saying what a wonderful help a national mortgage bank department would be. I have said it myself in the course of many election campaigns ; but if any criticism is to he levelled, it should be aimed at those irresponsible individuals who have advocated something that is ridiculous and ludicrous. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> has said on many occasions in this chamber that the recommendation contained in paragraph 504 of the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems should be adopted and that the Commonwealth Bank should lend money free of interest. </para>

                            <para>- Many individuals who have supported the findings of the royal commission in this regard have advocated something along those lines. In the House of Representatives when this measure was under discussion, we had the sorry spectacle of one of the Government's satellites, anxious to make political capital out of long-term lending, advocating loans for a period of 40 years at 3 per cent, or less. Surely that honorable gentleman must know that no bank could trade on such terms and break even, far less make a profit. It would definitely lose money. How could the bank possibly pay 3£ per cent, on loans, and then lend the money out on a long-term basis at 3 per cent., meeting at the same time all the expenses attached to its activities, bad debts, and so on? Such a proposition obviously would be unsound business, with the exception that in order to assist individuals to get a start in industry, it might be advisable to advance money at 3 per cent. It is of no use fooling ourselves or endeavouring to fool the people that the Commonwealth Bank can lend money at 3 per cent., unless it takes it out of somebody else's pocket. The obvious thing to do is to make long-term loans available at the lowest possible rate of interest which will enable the bank to conduct its business on sound lines. Experts who gave evidence before the special committee which considered this measure stated that 4 per cent, was about the lowest figure at which the mortgage department could break even, and I am pleased that the Government has not included in this measure any specific rate of interest. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and on future conditions. Assistance should be given to sound business and industrial undertakings, or to individuals starting out with new propositions, at the lowest possible rate compatible with sound business principles. If assistance has to be given to an industry that is experiencing bad times, the correct method is for the Government to pay a subsidy, either by means of a direct contribution, or by the fixation of a payable price based on the cost of production. </para>

                    <para>Much loose criticism is levelled at the private banking system in Australia, but it is interesting to know that the majority of the shareholders in private banking institutions are persons in receipt of very small incomes. In respect of some of the banks as many as 70 per cent, of the shareholders have incomes under £500 a year. These people have used their money in making what they consider to be safe investments. My experience of the private banks is that they are sound and honorable, and those conducting them are highly respected citizens. In the depression of 1931, all of the private banks in Australia honoured their obligations, but that cannot be said of some banks in other parts of the world. It cannot be said of one bank in Australia, because of the actions of a well known Labour man, who had views on banking which were similar to those held by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey.</inline> Much loose criticism is heard about the profits made by the private banks, but if a person invests his money in a business he is entitled to make a profit. If he obtains too much profit, the Government should tax him, but there is not a great deal of profit to be made in investments in banks in Australia today. I am proud of the service which the private banks of this country have rendered to the community. I have made comparisons between those banks and the government-owned banks, and the losses sustained by some of the government banks in Australia during the last twenty years give no cause for pride. It has been proved many times that, in 99 per cent, of cases, private enterprise can do a job, even in the realm of banking, better and more cheaply than can a government undertaking. Some honorable senators, who have examined costs during the war, have noticed that some private firms have produced articles' at one-half of the prices charged for similar articles produced by government-owned undertakings. The cheap criticism levelled against the private banks is unjustified. I quite approve of having a Commonwealth Bank which is looked upon as a central bank. Such an association with the private banks has worked exceedingly well, and I hope that the Government will not allow the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> and other cranks who have theories about a new order, to destroy the private banking system. If honorable senators opposite think that, by nationalizing the banks and resorting to the use of bank credit, all will be well in Australia, they are only fooling themselves. </para>
                    <para>I regret that the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> is not in the chamber, because I desire to convince him that some of the statements made by him in connexion with the advances to farmers are entirely wrong. The wheat-farmers in this country will not be saved by long-term loans free of interest. The only thing that will save them is a payable price, having regard to all of the circumstances. What has been the practice and policy of the Curtin Government over the last two years? It has set up a Women's Employment Board to ensure that those engaged in certain industries are paid a reasonable wage, including cost-of-living adjustments and a war loading. I believe that all employees are entitled to reasonable industrial conditions, but conditions should be determined by experienced judges of the Arbitration Court. Yet the Government, for political reasons, is most anxious to spoon-feed a section of the people whom it regards as its own political supporters. The members of trade unions contribute a certain sum to the Australian Labour party to enable elections to be won. This Government has looked after the interests of its own political supporters, but has similar consideration been shown to the growers of wheat, barley, grapes, potatoes and blue peas? We have had the spectacle of the Government being prepared to buy the support of those who it hopes will vote for its candidates at the next general elections. The Government decided to set up a tribunal to fix the wages of men employed in the harvesting of the wheat crop sown in 1942. The board was politically picked and loaded against the farmers. It was not competent to deal with the evidence submitted to it, but within two days it made an award as to the wages to be paid to the men employed in harvesting work. It awarded 3s. 3d. an hour, which worked out, with keep, at about £9 6s. a week of 48 hours, with time and a half for overtime. </para>

On a number of occasions the prices paid to farmers for their wheat have been discussed in this chamber. I have taken the opportunity to obtain official figures from the Department of Commerce and Agriculture in this matter, and I propose to give them to the Senate. For the wheat harvested in 1939-40, the average price paid to farmers was 3s. <inline font-style="italic">Bid.</inline> a bushel at country sidings, after deducting 4£d. a bushel for freight. The following year, 1940-41, farmers received 3s.  6¾d.  a bushel at country sidings for their wheat. For the first year that the Curtin Government was in office - the season 1941-42 - the farmers received payment at the rate of only 2s.  7½d.  a bushel for the 153,000,000 bushels of wheat that they delivered. </para>

If the Government wishes to keep wheat-farmers solvent, it will assist them more by making a further payment in respect of wheat already delivered than by establishing a mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank, because at the prices paid for their wheat, they would not have sufficient security on which to borrow money. </para>

                            <para>- They have a great deal to do with the bill. A payment of 2s. 7-Jd. a bushel does not cover the cost of producing the wheat. An Australian standard has been established for workers in industry, including women workers, but payments to farmers for their wheat are less than the cost of production, thereby forcing wheat-farmers to accept a coolie standard of living. I have received so many requests for a further payment in respect of wheat already delivered that during the next recess I propose to visit various wheat-growing districts in order to tell farmers how they have been treated by the Curtin Government. Should <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clothier,</inline> who professes to know so much about the wheat industry, regard my statement as a challenge, I am prepared to visit any wheat district in Western Australia and discuss the subject on the same platform with him. </para>

                            <para>- This year, the Government has agreed that 4s. a bushel is a payable price for wheat, but that rate is to be paid in respect of only the first 1,000 bags of wheat delivered by any grower. Seventy per cent, of the wheat-growers of Australia produce less than 1,000 bags of wheat. For wheat delivered by any grower in excess of 1,000 bags 2s. a bushel, which is below the cost of production, will be paid. It has been said that the farmers will receive an additional payment when the balance of the wheat in the pool has been sold. </para>

Every wheat-grower who delivers more than 1,000 bags of wheat will get only 2s. a bushel for the additional quantity. Should a man deliver 8,000 bags of wheat, the average price which he will receive for it will be only 2s. 3d. a bushel. I ask the Government to bring all payments for wheat up to 4s. a bushel. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to connect my remarks with the cost of interest under loans advanced by the mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank. The amount of advances is limited to £5,000. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wilson)</inline> has suggested that the rate of interest should not exceed 3 per cent. This measure is the price which the Government is paying for the support of that honorable member. I propose to show that it is practically worthless. It does not represent any substantial benefit to the wheat-farmers. If loans up to £5,000 were made available to farmers free of interest, the saving to the farmers on the basis of interest at the rate of 4 per cent, as set out in the bill would amount to £200. Yet, despite the attempt by the honorable member for Wimmera to obtain some saving for the farmers by limiting the rate of interest on advances made by the mortgage bank department to 3 per cent., he supports the Scully wheat plan. Under that plan a price of 4s. a bushel is guaranteed in respect of the first 1,000 bags, and in respect of all production in excess of 1,000 bags, a price of 2s. a bushel is guaranteed. If the honorable member supported our contention that the guaranteed price of 4s. should be applied to all production he would save a farmer who produces 2,000 bags of wheat £300 in respect of the second 1,000 bags. I have already said that the price of 2s. a bushel represents only 50 per cent, of the amount which the Government itself considers to be a payable price. Honorable senators can work out for themselves the substantial savings which would be effected by growers who produce over 2,000 and up to 8,000 hags. Therefore, when the honorable member for Wimmera and the Minister for External Territories claim that this measure will save the wheat-farmers, they are simply endeavouring to mislead them. The same observation applies to producers ofbutter, barley and other products. Those producers can best be helped by the provision of a payable price for their commodities. </para>

I urge it to make to farmers a further advance in respect of wheat delivered in 1941, for which they have received on the average only 2s. 7½d. a bushel. It could thus do something really worth while to help the wheat-farmers. I admit that this legislation will help the farmers to some small degree, although it will not solve their problems. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not propose to givemy blessing to this measure. The primary producers will receive very little assistance under it. Obviously, it has been brought down for the reason mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> namely, in order to satisfy what one newspaper has described as the Government's synthetic majority. I am not satisfied with the proposals embodied in the bill. The assistance provided will not be made available to the man who really needs it. Under the Government's original (proposal, producers could not apply for advances from the mortgage bank department unless they had a 40 per cent. equity in their property. I point out that any man who has a 40 per cent. equity in his property is in fairly good circumstances, and can obtain advances from many private sources at 4 per cent. He can have such loans spread over any term he wishes. He does not have to tie himself to a term of 40 years, but can pay off such loans over any period he wishes. At the same time, hundreds of wheat-farmers in the Mallee district in Victoria and in Western Australia do not possess 40 per cent. equity in their properties. Therefore, they will not be able to apply for assistance under this scheme, which compares most unfavorably with that which has been in operation in Victoria for the last 30 years. Under that scheme, a producer can obtain an advance up to 80 per cent. of the value of his property, and additional advances in respect of improvements. The proposal under this measure, however, simply slams the door in the face of any producer who receives advances up to 70 per cent. of the value of his property. Repayments under the Victorian scheme, to which I have referred, can be spread over 40 years, and are made in equal half-yearly instalments, the interest being at the rate of 4 per cent., and at the rate of 1 per cent. in respect of the sinking fund. Under that scheme, any producer who has received advances on up to 80 per  cent.  of the value of the property can obtain further advances against his improvements and plant. This bill will force farmers into the hands of stock and station agents and the machinery merchants. We know that the latter charge interest at rates up to 16 per cent. on the price of machinery bought on the hire-purchase system. The Victorian scheme is designed to prevent such exploitation. The Minister for Trade andCustoms <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> has repeatedly stated that the Commonwealth Bank was hamstrung by the Bruce-Page Government; but I point out that the Commonwealth Bank has had absolute freedom to make advances to producers up to any amount it deems advisable. If it so desired, it could make advances to producers up to 100 per cent. of the value of the asset, and spread the loan over any period, at whatever rate of interest it decided. Under this measure the Government will hamstring the Commonwealth Bank. The same provisions to which I have just referred also applied in respect of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Neither of those institutions will now be able to advance money  to producers on the liberal terms which they were able to do in the past if they would. Any producer who cannot repay a loan over a period of 40 years would be far better off working for wages; otherwise he would simply be a slave. After receiving advances from the mortgage bank department to the limit provided in the bill a farmer will have to look elsewhere for finance to enable him to increase hL stock, or to effect additional improvements on his property. Once the stock and station agents know that a farmer is tied up with the mortgage bank department under the conditions set out in this measure, they will refuse to sell the stock to that farmer and will call in for sale any stock held, but not purchased, by the farmer. The result will be that many sheep-raisers will be obliged to sell their stock just when they are reaching a marketable condition. Ear from conferring a blessing on primary producers, this scheme will be regarded by many as a curse. Under this measure, the farmers will not be able to obtain finance for the improvement on their holdings. The man who has the equity that the Government stipulates could get his money anywhere for 4 per cent, to-day, but for the fact that the State Parliaments have passed moratorium acts which will not permit money to be lent. There is any amount of money available at 4 per cent., but the banker lends not on the asset, but on the borrower and his system of management. That is why some people make a success of life and others do not. The difference between the 4 per cent, proposed and the 2£ per cent, suggested is a mere bagatelle on a loan of £3,000, and would not mean ls. an acre, but the margin between success and failure is so slight that, in effect, one drought will wipe a man's business out of existence. The whole system that the Government has laid down in this bill is entirely wrong. I shall not oppose it because I believe that every member of the House of Representatives supported it. Of course, that is no reason why I should support it, but I shall not vote against it. </para>

                        <para>. - When I heard the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> describe a banker as a man who will lend one an umbrella when the weather is fine, and send for it when it looks like rain, I almost thought that I had made a convert, because that just describes bankers and the banking system as I know them. When, however, the honorable senator went on to ask the Senate how the Commonwealth Bank was going to .pay depositors interest on their money whilst lending it out interest free, I could see that he did not understand the real position. I have never at any time asked the 'Common wealth Bank to lend money to private individuals. We own the Commonwealth Bank, and its profits go to the nation. The only object for which I ever advocated the use of national credit is public works, which are quite different. If I asked the Commonwealth Bank to lend me money I should have to put up my security and pay the usual rate of interest as a private citizen, but we are here to look after the interests of the nation, not to pay the private banks, as in the past, scores of millions of pounds in interest. That is no longer necessary when we have our own Commonwealth Bank which can issue credit free of cost. -The Leader of the Opposition should know that the banks do not lend money at all. What they do is to create credit. My authority is <inline font-style="italic">The Story of the Commonwealth Bank</inline> by D. J. Amos, and the authorities that he quotes are: The Commonwealth Bank Acts 1911-1927, The <inline font-style="italic">Official</inline><inline font-style="italic">Year-Books</inline> 1910-30, the Commonwealth Bank balance-sheets, 1912-32, <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Debates</inline> 1911-27, <inline font-style="italic">Dun's Gazette,</inline> 1926-29, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> 1924-25, <inline font-style="italic">The Commonwealth Bank of Australia</inline> by C. C.  Faukner,  and <inline font-style="italic">Facts and Theories of Finance</inline> by the late F. Anstey, M.P. Therefore I hope that no one will question the statements' which I am about to make. We are told that the Commonwealth Bank was not" affected in any way by the act passed by the Bruce-Page Government to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act, and that it is still just as easy to borrow money from it as it was before that act was passed. Let me show how the Bruce-Page Government favoured the private banks. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Amos</inline> states - </para>

                            <para>- I bow to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> I was merely endeavouring to reply to misstatements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline> Such misstatements should not be permitted to go unchallenged. In rebuttal of the allegations made by these honorable senators I have cited the most eminent authorities available. The Leader of the Opposition referred to men supporting financial ideas similar to those that I have expounded so often in this chamber as a body of cranks. In spite of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has said, I shall support the bill. The honorable senator spoke of going to private banking institutions and borrowing money at 4 per cent. for long periods, but he knows quite well that unless a special arrangement is made, a bank overdraft is carried on only from day to day. The establishment of a mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank will be particularly valuable to the primary producers as it will tide them over bad seasons. The Leader of the Opposition said that the private banks had been of great assistance to Australia generally, and particularly to primary producers, but I can prove conclusively that those institutions have not been the friends either of the Government or the people. The depression of 1929-31 was deliberately caused by the private banks. Thousands of primary producers were ruined, and our primary industries have not yet recovered from the blow that they suffered. To those who say that it is impossible to lend money to primary producers free of interest, I point out that in 1930 the Lyons Government was forced to come to the assistance of our primary industries, and a measure was, passed making a straight-out grant of £12,000,000. Of course, when that was done the private banks merely created the £12,000,000 out of nothing, and then assessed the liabilities of the wheatgrowers to the banks only, disregarding debts to storekeepers, &amp;c. The banks then issued cheques which eventually were returned to them, so that in actual fact no money went out of the banks at all ; yet we have been paying 5 per cent. on that money ever since. That is the banking system that the Leader of the Opposition says has been of great help to this country. </para>

                    <para>I support this measure because it is definitely a better one than that introduced on the 25th November, 1938, by the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey.</inline> That measure was introduced at the instance of the private banks, in their own interests, and to the detriment of the Commonwealth Bank and the people of this country generally. It was proposed to sell inscribed stock and debentures to finance the new mortgage bank department, whereas all that was required then, as is the case now, was to establish a mortgage department of the Commonwealth Bank. Many people speak of a mortgage bank as though it were a new idea, but every bank is a mortgage bank; that is how they flourish. They make their profits on overdrafts </para>
                    <para class="block">Banks do not lend money; they monetize the real wealth of the people. That is why we started this war with a national debt of £1,200,000,000. When the previous mortgage bank legislation was introduced by an ex-Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> I travelled all over Australia speaking in opposition to it. Eventually we succeeded in destroying the measure. This bill represents an honest attempt to assist the primary producers, and I am surprised at the attitude that has been adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> although I suppose that it is impossible for a conservative mind to change, although conditions may change. I do not claim that this bill is better than the Victorian legislation, but at least it will operate throughout the entire Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I do not approve of many things that this Government does in regard ,to finance. No section of a community is so badly treated as our primary producers. They have to fight against the weather, and the markets. Any one who examines the economics of the situation will not wonder, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham</inline> does, why the price of wheat fell to ls. a bushel in this country during the last depression. The reason is obvious, and it has a direct relation to the measure now under discussion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> claimed that the amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act made by the Bruce Page Government did not harm that institution; such a 'suggestion is ridiculous. </para>

                            <para>- It ruined the primary producers of Western Australia and brought down the price of wheat to ls. a bushel. After the private banks secured rights to draw £30,000,000, they raised the interest rate to <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> per cent. They asked for this right ostensibly to help the primary producers, but the results were disastrous. Price levels are governed by available purchasing power, and when purchasing power was withdrawn in huge sums when the private banks called in overdrafts in 1929-30, little purchasing power remained in the hands of the people and prices slumped very quickly. It is true that in the interests of self-preservation many European countries which previously had imported wheat from Australia and Argentina grew their own wheat. That was part of their preparation for this war. Honorable senators opposite deride my financial theories, but in the first speech that I made in this chamber I said that the present monetary system had caused nothing but poverty and chaos, and that we were rapidly being drawn into a. war which might destroy civilization. Referring to paragraph 504 of the report of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> said that the commission had not directed the Government to adopt that recommendation; but what power has a royal commission to tell any government what it must or must not do? </para>

                            <para>- Obviously, a royal commission has no power to direct a government as to what it should do. Had it not been for the composition of the Commonwealth Bank Board at that time, that recommendation would have been adopted. Recently, I drew attention to the fact that when the royal commission made its report, the directors of the bank were all representatives of the private banking institutions. Obviously, men who were former managers of private banks or were associated with the biggest money lending institutions of this country could not be expected to adopt such a proposal. It was not until <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller died that the private financial institutions had the courage to attempt to interfere with the Commonwealth Bank. I remind honorable senators that when the Bruce-Page Government amended the Commonwealth Bank Act the rate of interest was doubled immediately. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> visited Hobart on one occasion, I told him that his amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act was the greatest piece of political treachery ever perpetrated on the people of this country. It caused the interest rate to rise immediately to <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> per cent., and in 1924 primary producers had to send to the Co-operative Wholesalers Society of Great Britain to obtain finance to export their produce. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham</inline> is well aware of that. </para>

                            <para>- There is a chance of some help being given to the primary producers under this bill, but that was impossible under the measure submitted in 1938 by the Government with which the former honorable member for Corio, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> was associated. It proposed to establish a mortgage bank department by issuing £30,000,000 worth of debentures, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> knows that if debenture holders were dissatisfied, they would simply take over the bank. Under the measure submitted by the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> was a member, the debenture holders were expected to make a profit, and if they were not satisfied, they could take over the bank, but, under the present Government's proposal, the position is much more satisfactory, because the matter will be in the hands of the Government. Therefore, I believe that, under this bill, the primary .producers will be assisted to some degree. The farmer can grow wheat, but he cannot grow the money with which to buy food. </para>

                    <para>Regardless of what the Government does in the way of helping the farmers, if the private banks call up overdrafts, the farmers will have no opportunity to obtain a satisfactory price for their wheat. That was proved in 1929. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham</inline> should have been called to order for saying that I knew nothing about financial matters. I sit here with a " poker " face and can see nothing to laugh at, but honorable senators opposite laugh and jeer. There has been no change in the attitude of honorable senators in this chamber towards the monetary problems of this country, notwithstanding our serious financial position. What has brought the world to its present deplorable state but incompetent and corrupt governments ? The people elect parliamentarians to manage the business of the country, but they have returned representatives who support the financial system which has brought about the present war. </para>

                            <para>- It may not assist Victorian farmers so much as those in other States. When the farmers were asked to grow more wheat, the private banks volunteered to make the necessary advances available to them for that purpose, but soon afterwards they called up their overdrafts. I know a man who had a large dairy farm in North Queensland. He was improving it, and when the banks called up his overdraft in 1929, he lost the farm, which comprised 14,000 acres.  His  only son, who expected to inherit a valuable property, had to work at breaking in horses at 10s. a week. Yet we are told how great a debt we owe to the private banks, which have put thousands of people into their graves and a large number into lunatic asylums. Nobody has been able to prove that my statements on financial subjects are incorrect. On one occasion, an official of this Parliament told me that he was surprised that, with my knowledge offinance, I had not taken up some work in connexion with financial matters. He was an officer of this chamber. I said, " That is what brought me to Canberra ". Finance is the most important phase of government, but it is a subject which is sadly neglected. I have said these things many times, and, in order to vary my remarks a little, I have quoted different authorities in support of my argument. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> was Treasurer of the Commonwealth and a loan of £10,000,000 was being considered by the Loan Council, he was asked how so great a sum was to be raised. He replied, " In the orthodox way ". I support the bill and have given good' reasons for so doing. </para>

                        <para>. - We have waited so long for this bill that I thought that when it came before us it would be of great assistance to farmers. The measure before us is not without merit, but if it is to be administered strictly some farmers will have cause to be greatly disappointed. I suppose that the object of the bill is to enable farmers to own their farms. Under present conditions farmers, especially those engaged in farming in a small way, have not much chance of owning their properties. Usually they have a short- term mortgage, and the general experience is that, instead of getting out of debt, they get farther into debt as the years pass. This bill does provide for a long-term mortgage on a 30 per cent. margin. That is a gilt-edged security, because any one who owns 30 per cent. of his property can probably get the money from other sources without much difficulty. The bill should encourage farmers to own their own farms. Provision is made for a 1 per cent. sinking fund, so that a farmer may purchase his property in 41 years. That term is provided in order to make the annual payments as small as possible. It is not always a kindness to extend the period of repayment over too long a term. The same mistake is frequently made in legislation to assist persons to own their homes. It is not a kindness to give a man 41 years to purchase his farm. </para>

                    <para>I do not agree with some honorable senators who have said that the mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank should be run on strict business lines, and standard rates of interest charged. The interest rate ought to be as low as possible. If the Government were to charge 1 per cent. less interest, and put an equivalent amount into a sinking fund, the farmer would get out of debt in half the time. A long period would elapse after this bill comes into operation before the amount of advances would total £50,000,000. Interest at the rate of 1 per cent. on that amount would be only about £500,000 a year to be provided by the taxpayers generally. If a government were to introduce a social security scheme, or some welfare scheme estimated to cost £500,000 a year, or even as much as £3,000,000 a year, the Parliament would not hesitate to support it. What better social service could we provide than a measure which would benefit small farmers by enabling them to own their farms within a reasonable period? These small farmers are the most industrious and thrifty persons in the community. They are performing a most useful service, yet they are the worst paid section of the community. Under  successive governments the legislation of this Parliament has been mostly in the interests of people who live in the cities. Although that legislation has helped the farmers in some degree, they have not benefited as have the city dwellers. That is shown clearly by the fact that for many years people have been flocking from country districts to the cities. </para>

It is the result of the industrialization of this country. I do not say anything  against  the establishment of secondary industries, but our industrial prosperity has been gained largely at the expense of country districts. What is needed is a comprehensive scheme which will benefit all sections of the community and restore the balance between country and city. </para>

                            <para>- I shall have no hesitation in asking the taxpayers generally to pay something towards meeting the interest bill of farmers so that they may be able to remain on their holdings. Heavy interest bills make successful farming most difficult. We need to do something to make the conditions in the country more like those in the metropolitan districts. At present, most of the advantages are enjoyed by city dwellers. If we were to go into any high school and ask the boys how many of them wished to be farmers, clerks or professional men, not many of them would hold up their hands to indicate that they wished to be farmers. Some say that people flock to the cities because they can go to the pictures, attend race meetings, and sports gatherings, but, in my opinion, that is not the reason. They go to the cities because it is easier to make a living there than in the country. That is the result of our legislation. A comprehensive scheme to' counteract the drift to the cities is necessary. After all, Australia is a primary-producing country, although many people say that it is an industrialized country. I have nothing to say against our secondary industries. Up to a point, the more of them that we have the better. Some time ago I read a report of a meeting of the shareholders of one of the biggest emporiums in Australia. The managing director said proudly that 75 per cent, of the goods sold by the company were made in Australia.. It would not be a big step to increase that 75 per cent, to 100 per cent. After the war is over, we shall find that our secondary industries will be able to supply all our requirements of many articles. But what will happen then? We shall not be able to export manufactured goods to any great degree owing to our high costs, and so we shall be driven back to primary production, where we ought to have been all along. We must help our primary producers. It has been said in this chamber to-day that we can help them by fixing the prices of their products. I believe that that would help them, but it is not so easy to fix the prices of primary products as of the products of our secondary industries. A manufacturer makes only as many articles as the market will absorb, but the primary producer cannot always dispose of his products. If there is a good season, there will be a glut of the commodities which he produces. Should the season be poor, there will be a shortage. We shall have to do something in the way of fixing the prices of primary products to enable farmers to make a fair living. Parliament is not unwilling to do so, as for some time it has indicated clearly its desire to help the primary producers. It is true that millions of pounds have been advanced to assist the wheat industry, but the farmers did not ask for assistance until they were in the depths of despondency. Fruit-growers also have been granted assistance by way of bounties, but the word " necessitous " was added in their case. More recently, the dairymen have been assisted by a grant of £2,000,000. I read in the newspapers recently that in New South Wales dairymen had, as a result of that grant received 5/7d. per lb. more for their butter. What is the use of talking about such an amount when an industrialist raises the prices of his goods by 25 per cent, if his costs increase? Yet the Government asks the butter producers to be satisfied with such a small increase. This problem must be tackled by people who know something about it. Perhaps, boards consisting of primary producers could be asked to devise a scheme to deal with the problem. In the meantime, however, we are simply ~ "drifting." "We" are" doing everything possible to assist secondary industries, and, at the same time, neglecting our primary -industries. The result of such a policy must be that our secondary industries, when they are able to produce all of our manufacturing requirements, will be up against a dead-end, because we shall then have very few farmers left. The bill has some merits. However, even at the risk of losing on the scheme, the Government should be prepared to make the rates of interest as low as possible. That is not an unreasonable request to make in view of the millions of pounds which have been made available in the past for other things. By providing another £500,000 under this measure the Government would do the job completely, and would enable the majority of the farmers to rehabilitate themselves in one half of the time that they would otherwise take. The farmers are more in need of assistance than any other section of the community. The Government should at least place those engaged in primary industries on a basis equal to those engaged in secondary industries. If it incurs a loss in so doing we must put up with that loss. Indeed, it would be well worth our while doing so. We have voted millions for the provision of social services; but T do not know of any social service more valuable than that which would help our primary producers to make a fair living. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the bill. It is long overdue. It will alleviate the burden of interest being carried by the farmers. At the same time, however, it will not help to solve the problem of over-production. It is true to say that in the past, conditions in primary industries have been such that the farmer could say to himself, " The more I grow the more I owe ". The problem of over-production can be solved only by the guarantee of payable prices for farmers' products. The Government  should  fix a minimum and a maximum price for all products in order to guarantee a fair living to the producers. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes that primary production forms the real basis of secondary production. If our primary industries are stabilized, secondary industries can confidently be built up on the basis of the markets provided by those engaged in primary industries. Not long ago in Tasmania, half-grown calves were selling at 3s. and 3s. 6d. each ; potatoes, in a period of over-production, were being sold at as low as 4s. a bag; whilst no market could be found for pumpkins, melons, garden produce, and apples. The problem of over-production can only be overcome by guaranteeing a minimum price to producers. I do not intend to discuss the merits of this bill because I am not competent to do so. </para>

                        <para>.  -  I support the bill because it will afford a measure of relief to at least a section of primary producers who are carrying a very heavy burden, and are able to qualify for advances under the conditions set out in the bill. The nightmare of many producers with respect to short-term loans, say, for from three to seven years, is that very often the loans fall due at a time when the producers have experienced bad seasonal conditions, or when prices are most unfavorable. However, many of our producers will be disappointed with this measure, particularly those who, as the result of loose talk about easy money on the part of the supporters of the Government, have been led to anticipate much greater benefits. N o doubt the Government will be severely criticized by such people ; but the Government has only itself to blame for such criticism. With the exception of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> honorable senators opposite have flirted in that fashion with the primary producers. They have given the impression to the producers that the Government will make money available to them for nothing. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has emphasized that the mortgage bank department must be conducted strictly on business lines. Indeed, he pleaded with supporters of the Government not to reduce the rate of interest below 4 per cent., because if that were done the scheme would be wrecked. The Treasurer has thus shown that when the Government is confronted with practical issues it cannot yield to the idea of providing easy money. However, that is the responsibility of the Government, which has stated that the new department is to be conducted on banking principles. The Minister's speech indicated that the total indebtedness of farmers was about £400,000,000. That is a large sum of money, but it is not altogether owing to bad business methods of farmers that that state of affairs exists. The average price of wheat between 1910 and 1930 was approximately 5s. a bushel, but between 1920 and 1930 it was approximately 6s. a bushel. It is difficult for a young farmer to make a start without some financial assistance, and farmers' sons generally know no other occupation, being trained only in farming pursuits. Many transactions which were quite legitimate business deals at that time, after 1930 became impossible business propositions and the fault was not altogether that of the person who incurred the debt. It was because he had to produce on the Australian standard and sell on the world's standard. In 1930 and 1931 the price of wheat was reduced to about ls. a bushel and remained at approximately that figure for two or three years. Ever since then the producing community generally, owing to the high cost of living, has been up against it. The policy embodied in this bill will be of great benefit to those who can come within its provisions, but they will represent only a small percentage of those who are more or less in financial difficulties. There are others beyond the limits of the bill worthy of consideration. They are men who really need loans up to 85 or 90 per cent, of the value of their properties, and who possibly over a period of years could get out of their trouble if they had some security of tenure. Consideration might be given to them at some time. An honorable senator referred to the desirability of bringing into production certain lands in good rainfall areas. That is really a life-time job. In such instances, some financial assistance on a long-term basis would be of great benefit to the community. I have in mind country in South Australia and the southern districts of Western Australia, where there is a good rainfall, and portions of Victoria. The Government might consider some scheme in those areas with perhaps easier conditions of security. I do not suggest any specific limit, but the proposal is worthy of consideration. Of course, if this is to be an ordinary banking scheme, the Government must tread very warily. Whilst there is room for legislation such as this, I do not think we should enter into competition with the other financial institutions, such as the State savings banks, insurance companies, agricultural banks and various other organizations, including the trading banks, which lend money on reasonable terms. "We should do nothing to upset that class of business, because those institutions are really lending people's savings, and if a bank that will compete with them is established it will probably tend to upset the whole financial fabric of the country. The Government would be wise to watch that aspect. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> dealt fully with the interest rate, and suggested the fixing of a payable price for produce. In that respect, I support him. He indicated that that was the angle from which this matter should be approached. If the Government would pay to the wheat-farmers what is due to them on the 1941-42 crop, plus the price that was promised in respect of this year's crop it would relieve farmers much more than a mortgage bank scheme. I appeal to the Government to give some consideration to that aspect of the question. Whilst I agree with the proposal embodied in the bill, and am prepared to support it, because it will give a measure of relief, I remind the Government that it will not give the relief that a great number of people were inclined to expect from it. That trouble is of the Government's own making, because Ministers talked about easy money, and they must bear the consequences, which I can assure them will possibly be very severe in some districts, where I know that people are greatly disappointed with the bill. However, the Government has definitely stated that it is not a bill to rehabilitate farmers who are heavily in debt. That is the Government's own responsibility. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>I understand that by that provision the Government intends to establish a system through which State instrumentalities will do the administrative portion of the work. If the Government wishes to achieve success in this proposal, that aspect of the administration should be very carefully watched. Local advisory boards should be set up in each State. Local managers should be given power to approve advances, say, up to £1,000, subject to the approval of the local board, and applications for over £1,000 could be dealt with first by a local board and then forwarded to the head office. If those methods were adopted and men who understood the different seasonal conditions and characteristics of the land in the various States were appointed to executive positions, it would facilitate the success of the new department. If that is not done, great delay will result because everything will have to be sent to head-quarters in Sydney, where the men in control may be competent bankers but will not know the difficulties or the peculiarities of applicants in the different States. I hope that the Government will take that matter into consideration. Nothing is said in the bill or in the Minister's speech about the manner in which the cost of mortgages, valuations, and other incidental charges are to be met. I presume that these costs will be provided for in the ordinary way. </para>

The Fadden Government was defeated not because it had failed to fulfil the pledges that its supporters had given to their constituents, but because certain individuals put their private interests before the interests of their country and decided to support the then Opposition. Naturally, the Government would be ungrateful it' it did not recognize the assistance that it received on that occasion, and this measure is a tangible token of that recognition.

To substantiate that statement, I point out that the Government does not regard this as a very important matter.

That was done, and another bill based to some degree upon the recommendations of that committee, has been placed before us. However, the Government still does not think that it is a matter of urgency, and it would not be unduly perturbed if the bill were not passed. </para>

                            <para>- It may be that the Government desires to have the measure passed through both Houses of Parliament, but it is noticeable that it reserves to itself the right to proclaim the measure when it so desires. Therefore, I maintain that the Government is merely holding this legislation out as some sort of a reward for services rendered by certain individuals. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wilson)</inline> no doubt was anxious that these proposals should be brought to fruition, and we cannot blame him for that. He had a perfect right to put whatever price he liked .upon his vote. </para>

                    <para>There are two outstanding points relating to this measure. First, it will make available long-term loans, principal and interest being repayable concurrently, over a period of years; secondly, many people have been under the impression that the establishment of a mortgage department of the Commonwealth Bank, would result in money being made available at extremely low rates of interest. Long-term loans, of course, have many advantages. It is of great benefit to a borrower to receive a loan for a fixed number of years, so that if he happens to encounter bad seasons he is able to carry on and retain his property, whereas sometimes private mortgagees, including both banks and individuals, take advantage of the position of their clients. In regard to the rate of interest, the Government was well advised to accede to the suggestion made in the House of Representatives. The suggested rate of interest is reasonable, and in view of the security that is offered, mortgagors will be prepared to pay that rate. It will be agreed that there is a limit to the level to which interest rates can be reduced. </para>
                    <para class="block">If interest rates be reduced to such a degree that money has little value, there will be no incentive to save; in effect, a restriction will be placed on thrift. A man will say to himself, " Why should I save £100 when I shall be paid only £1 a year on it ? " <inline font-style="italic">For</inline> that reason the Government was well advised in leaving interest rates at the figure mentioned. </para>
                    <para>This measure will not grant to primary producers or to any one else benefits that they have not enjoyed before. In fact, after a careful examination of this proposal, I find that it restricts a borrower from using his loan as he pleases. A person who borrows money under this measure will be told that loans obtained through the mortgage bank department are not intended to provide working capital, as it is considered that ample provision is already made for short-term advances. It is ridiculous to suppose that the lender of money should dictate to the borrower as to what he should do with it. In the first place, the money will not be advanced unless substantial security is offered. Therefore, once the money is lent, the borrower should be permitted to use it to what he considers to be the best advantage. The borrower is also restricted, because the measure provides that if a borrower misuses money lent to him by the bank, it becomes due and payable on demand. I suppose that an inspector would be permitted to say to a borrower : " As you are not using this money in the way we expected, you must repay it to the bank." Long-term loans are desirable, but, ever since 1927, the Commonwealth Bank Board has had power to do all that is contempl ated in the bill before us. </para>

I have  not  had many dealings with banks, except for other people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan says that this bill limits the functions of the Commonwealth Bank, but, speaking without a full knowledge of the  act,  I should say that the matter which he has brought up relates to certain facts whereas the bill before us deals with other facts. Under the existing banking practice a person who has assets may obtain an overdraft. I have never had an overdraft, but I understand that at any time a banker may say to a borrower. " I want my money back ", and it must be repaid. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> will bear out what I am saying. The bill before us does not deal with overdrafts but with the specific matter of granting loans for a period. </para>

The measure before us is one to assist primary producers to obtain loans which are repayable in 41 years. Such loans may not exceed 70 per cent, of the value of the property. </para>

                            <para>- Under this measure a farmer may go to the mortgage bank department and obtain a loan. I should like to go further than that. Workers in industry should be able to borrow money from this source. All the time that I have been a member of this Parliament I have listened to honorable senators describing the troubles of the farmers. I know that their troubles are many, but I know also that assistance has been given to them, and rightly so. Why not let the workers borrow money from the same source? Honorable senators opposite have been remiss in their duties for a number of years in not forcing the governments which they have  supported, and which have been in control of this country for many years, to establish a mortgage department of the Commonwealth Bank.It is true that the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has advocated such a bank for a great many years. He may be regarded as an expert in this matter. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan is right, why should <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page advocate the establishment of a mortgage bank department to assist farmers? The honorable senator says that such a department is not necessary, but <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce and other leaders in Australian politics have said that such a bank is necessary. Were they all wrong? Is it correct that all these years farmers could have gone to the bank and obtained all the finance that they 'needed on better terms than are set out in this bill? </para>

"T he Banking Commission reports that there are two gaps still in the hanking structure," said <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page. " One is the absence of specific provision for long-term lending, especially in connexion with the purchase of farms, and the report suggests the creation of a mortgage banking corporation." </para>

                        <para>- Therefore, it is essential to give that power to the bank. The Government proposes to do so under this measure by establishing a mortgage bank department to which farmers, and others engaged in pastoral and agricultural pursuits, will be able to mortgage their properties for the purpose of raising money, such loans to be repayable over a period up to 40 years in very small instalments at the rate of interest to be decided by the bank itself. I should like to see such revolutionary changes effected in our present banking system as would place the entire business of banking in this country under the control of the people's bank. I should like to see every mortgage taken over by -that bank. I should like to see -the millstones of 'interest, which have hung around the necks of the primary producers for so many years, removed, by that institution, by charging rates of interest simply sufficient to cover administrative costs. Just as the Lord chased the money-changers out of the temple, and just as the early Christians fought usury, so I would fight that evil to-day. The present system is the means of enabling one 'section of the community to exploit other sections. In attempting to reform our present monetary system, however, we must be careful not to destroy the rights of many humble people who have saved some of their money. The Labour party is anxious that the people's savings deposited in the banks shall be safeguarded. This Government does not wish to do anything inimical to the interests of those thrifty people. Our aim should be to safeguard the interests of all our people, and to prevent any one section from exploiting another section. The aim of monetary reformers is to eliminate usury and interest mongery. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> has just handed me a statement made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> which supports all that I have just said.

                <para>That is a most desirable objective. It is intelligence applied to our economic circumstances. As we develop our powers of production, the time approaches nearer when interest as we know it to-day will bo abolished. I admit that, in the past, it has been necessary to encourage the people not to expend their money on consumption goods, and to transfer the labour so released to the production of capital goods. With the development of capitalism, it was essential to get as much labour as possible to develop the capital section of the economic machine, and to extend factories and exploit our mines. Therefore, by means of loans, on which interest was paid, we limited the production of consumption goods in order to transfer more labour to the production of capital goods. That happened in Russia, where the Soviet authorities raised loans and paid interest on them in order to encourage the people not to consume goods, but to release workers who otherwise would have been making consumption goods for the purpose of building up capital goods. When any country reaches the surfeit stage in the intense production of goods, so that itproduces more than it requires, it is absurd to ask the people to save money to produce more goods than are really needed. Therefore, if we have all the  goods that we need for consumption, it is absurd to ask people to save. I should like to put certain questions to honorable senators opposite who continually decry and smile at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey,</inline> and look with suspicion on me. - The first is : Should the supply and control of credit be in the hands of private companies? If it be right that the supply of credit should be in their hands, is it not just as feasible that the supply of water also should be in the hands of brewery companies? "We say that the credit of the nation, which is its lifeblood, should be completely controlled by the people acting through their representatives in this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- No; the reservoirs are owned by the people. There may be here and there a private supply of water, but in the main it is owned and used by the people. It is as feasible to say that we should hand over our reservoirs to the brewing companies as to say that private companies should control the supply of credit. The next question is: Should industry close down because of the lack of money or credit? It would be as sensible to say that we must cease fighting the Japanese because there is a lack of money. We shall continue to fight the Japanese while we have the men and material, and until we secure victory over them or they defeat us. The war will not terminate owing to lack of money, neither should industry cease for the same reason. Another question is : Is it not true that hundreds of thousands of people have been out of work because of the private control of money? Honorable senators opposite can think over those questions during the week-end. Another point with regard to the power of the Government to issue money is this: If the private banking system had the right to issue credit based on the power to tax the people, what amount could it issue? The Government of the country has the power to tax the people, and therefore it should be the authority which has the power to issue credit. In those questions there is material for many hours' debate. I advise honorable senators opposite to study this subject not from the narrow viewpoint of private capitalism but from a broad outlook in the interests of the nation. I hope that this bill will do some good, but so far as I am concerned it does not go far enough. When the Labour Government is in full and complete control of both Houses of the Parliament, I believe we shall have a reform of the banking system so effectual that we shall be able" to utilize all our economic powers and forces for the good of the nation as a whole, and not for the aggrandizement of the few. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate the Government on the introduction of this bill, which is a distinct advance upon anything it has produced up to the present, because the bill, although it will not do any good, will not do any harm. The usual feature of this Government's bills is that although they do no good many of them do incalculable harm. This bill, therefore, is a distinct advance on anything that the Government has yet introduced. I am afraid that the primary producers of Australia are going to be very disappointed, because it will not help them. One has only to read the Minister's speech to determine how circumscribed is the area in which the bill is to operate. First loans made by the mortgage bank department are to be upon first-class security only. The Minister also said - </para>

                        <para>- If the new department of the bank is specifically forbidden to lend money for working capital, the measure will be of no use to any one on the land.  His  sheep and cattle, plant, machinery, horses and drays are part of his working capital. I may omit his house, because that I presume would be the subject of a mortgage in the first pla'ce, but there is his right to buy superphosphate, and cornsacks for his wheat, to pay for cartage to the station, and so on, and he is forbidden by the bill to borrow for any of those purposes, because that money would be working capital. People producing wool or wheat have their harvest once a year, and have to carry on in the meantime, paying for what they get as they go along, or finding some one to give them credit during the year. If money used for those purposes is not working capital, I' do not know what is. Yet the bank is forbidden to lend money to provide working capital. In these circumstances, a farmer who had. mortgaged his property to a bank would be in serious difficulties.  His  activities would be restricted considerably, and I am sure that any one who was acquainted with this provision in the bill would think three or four times before mortgaging his property. I realize that the intention is good and that it is aimed at conferring certain benefits on a particular class of the community, but I am afraid that, despite the Government's intentions, certain provisions in this measure are rather unwise. If the measure is to fulfil the Government's desires, it will be necessary to amend certain portions of the bill. In spite of the promises that the Government has made, and of the fact that the primary producers of this country have been looking forward eagerly to such a measure in the hope that it would lighten the financial burden that is placed upon them, I am afraid that they will be rather disappointed. The establishment of a mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank will not solve their problems to any great degree, and before long the Government will be forced to introduce more liberal provisions. However, I give the Government credit for its good intentions, and I earnestly hope that the bill will produce the results that the Government seeks. </para>

                    <para>. - Many people will be pleased that the Government has introduced this measure. For many years farmers have complained about the financial difficulties under which they have been labouring, particularly in relation to overdrafts and short-term loans from private banking institutions, and the establishment of a mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth Bank will fill a long-felt want. It will enable primary producers to fund their debts, and look forward to the future with a greater feeling of security. No longer will they have to fear the calling in of overdrafts by private banks. The Government is to be commended for introducing this bill, particularly at present. Like many members of the Opposition, I do not consider that this measure is all that could be desired, but at least it is a sincere attempt on the part of the Government to tackle first things first, and it is a practical illustration of the Government's desire to do what previous administrations only promised to do. As experience of the working of this measure is gained, it may be found necessary to effect improvements, and I feel sure that the Government will be prepared to take whatever action it considers to be desirable. I do not expect that the establishment of a mortgage bank department will bring about the rehabilitation of primary industries, that is not the function of a mortgage bank. The soundness of a banking institution depends upon its ability to carry on its activities in a practical and economic manner; by that I mean that all such institutions must conform with certain established business principles. The Commonwealth Bank is fundamental to the welfare of the Australian nation, and I should hesitate to make the Commonwealth Bank a plaything of political parties and so risk its destruction owing to unsound financial transactions. I contend that what is proposed in this measure will not only be acceptable to the primary producers, but also will conform with sound banking practice. If it be necessary to assist the primary producers, that problem should be tackled in some other way. </para>

                        <para>- There are many ways in which it could be done; for example, by fixing a fair price for commodities. The point I wish to make is that the functions of a mortgage bank department are clearly defined, and that the proposed department of the Commonwealth Bank has been- designed to carry out those functions. This Ls only one of a series of measures which will assist in the rehabilitation of primary producers. It is the basis on which other legislation, will be built. I am hopeful that in the coming months the Government, will continue to put its proposals into concrete form, and will proceed with its plans to rehabilitate not only the primary producers but also the masses of the people throughout Australia. I am confident that in the near future many more measures such as this will be passed. When this bill becomes law, it will do much to place the farmers of this country on a sound financial footing. I support the bill because I consider that it will fill a long-felt want. </para>

                    <para>. - I have given quite a lot of consideration to this measure, and I am wondering to what degree we can make use of it. I do not think for one moment that it will provide very much relief in the immediate future, although that may be its effect at a later date. For instance, I cannot imagine the Commonwealth Bank Board taking over some of the existing liabilities of the farmers, and if that is not done, there will be keen disappointment amongst farmers who to-day are carrying a tremendous financial burden. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> that there is considerable difficulty in providing relief from that burden. That problem is not an easy one. I have given the matter careful consideration for a long time in an endeavour to find the best way in which assistance may be given to primary producers. It is a difficult problem. Immediately the price of a commodity is fixed at a payable figure, production of that commodity which already may be in over-supply, will increase. The only advantage I can see that the bill provides is that the mortgage bank department may be availed of when a man -desires to purchase a property or obtain an advance with respect to a property he is holding which is not already subject to a mortgage, but a long time may elapse before any great use will be made of the department. 'Commenting on the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> about the value of the measure, I point out that there is nothing in the bill to compel the Commonwealth Bank Board to make an advance of one penny. From what I know of that board it is fairly conservative. When the associated banks were making advances against rural securities, the Commonwealth Bank would not do so. In Western Australia I found it difficult to get any advance at all from the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>This bill provides for the establishment of another department of the Commonwealth Bank for making advances. First, there is the section under the original act; secondly, there is the savings bank section; and, thirdly, the rural advances section which is limited to loans of twelve months' duration. Now we are  adding another department which will provide for a 40 years' mortgage. That is not a fixed mortgage. If a borrower gets in arrears to the extent of a year or six months, provision is made for calling up his advance. Therefore, the bill does not provide for the security that honorable senators probably think will be afforded because of the fact that the period of the loan has been fixed at 40 years. I have had some experience with associated banks and I object to honorable senators condemning them. Many farmers, and many business men in Australia, have a lot for which to thank the banks. After all, they do not make advances for the purpose of dispossessing men of their land. Their business is to obtain interest upon advances made and to see that the necessary security is given to ensure the return of the loan. I have never met a bank manager who, with any degree of pleasure, has foreclosed on a property. Neither do the owners of land desire that, because foreclosures immediately reduce the value of properties in the neighbourhood. </para>
                <para>It is proposed under the bill to give authority to the board to make advances up to 70 per cent, of the value of the property. That value will not be static, but will vary from time to time according to the value of production. From 1921 to 1928 the values of land increased tremendously, but from 1930 to 1934 they greatly depreciated. In many parts of Australia so many properties have been abandoned to-day that even the values of holdings that are being worked have been considerably reduced. </para>

                        <para>- No. Would the honorable senator say that the people in the Newdegate area in Western Australia will find a remedy for their troubles under this bill. In every State a bank of some kind has made advances for the purpose of opening up country. In Western Australia very good work has been done by means of the State Agricultural Bank We have produced an immovable asset that will be of benefit to the people of that State for centuries to come, but the condition of most of the men on the land to-day is such that their industry is not an attractive one, and the provisions of this bill will not be used to relieve them. The 'Commonwealth Bank Board will not make advances to people in such areas because it will not take over the debts of people who cannot be relied upon to meet their interest payments from year to year. The board will want its interest the same as the associated banks do, and the same as any private individuals or any lending authority would do. </para>

                        <para>- No administration could make any difference. Anybody who uses money for the purpose of getting an income from it has to take the greatest precautions in making advances, because they run a risk of losing not only an income but also their capital. I could trust even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> with the administration of a department of this kind, and I venture to say that he could not make a success of it with the primary industries in the condition in which they are to-day. People engaged in those industries have had to ask for financial assistance year after year, and this bill will not help them at all. The limitation of the advance to 70 per cent, will provide a problem for the Commonwealth Bank Board, and, in consequence, the advances will not amount to anything like 70 per cent, of the valuation because that is the maximum. set down. Ta probability is that the bank will start off with 50 per cent, of the valuation. If interest is in arrears it will probably get a better deal than if it advanced money up to the full amount allowed by the present law. </para>

                <para>In Western Australia there are two problems that have to be faced. I do not know any members of the Commonwealth Bank Board, but they are probably better acquainted with the conditions in the primary industries in Victoria and New South Wales than in the rest of Australia, as they have been residents of those States for a long time. Personally, I know enough of Australia to appreciate the variation of conditions in Queensland and Western Australia and in the intervening areas. Any man would require a wide knowledge if he were to legislate for the whole of those areas. The problem is not an easy one, and therefore I hope that, if additional appointments are to be made to the Commonwealth Bank Board, in order to deal with the mortgage department of the bank, representation will be given to those States which are not now represented. Speaking from memory, I should say that in Western Australia, the area of which is one-third of that of the Commonwealth, there are five branches of the Commonwealth Bank. That is not a great number. Two of them in the city area and two others are within 100 miles of Perth, so that leaves only one in other portions of the State. The situation could possibly be met by appointing travelling inspectors, but even Western Australia would present difficulties for any person who had to make valuations for the purpose of advances. </para>

                <para>I was keenly disappointed with the report of the committee appointed by the Parliament to consider this bill. </para>
                <para class="block">It would appear that the committee's investigation was rather superficial. The proposals in respect of advances for the industries mentioned in the bill cover a wide scope - from cotton-growing in the north of Australia to butter production in the southern districts. They could cover all commodities for which there is a prospect of additional markets and could apply to areas which are now devoted to crops for which no market can be found. </para>
                <para>It is proposed in this bill that interest shall be paid half yearly. As the producers of wheat and wool receive payments for their products once a year they should be allowed to pay their interest once a year instead of half yearly. About March would be the most satisfactory time for their. payments. The Minister might ask the board to consider this suggestion. lt is somewhat galling to hear honorable senators say how useful the Commonwealth Bank has been to the farming community of Australia. The bank's transactions have always been on a business basis. Interest is charged on all advances. The Commonwealth Bank has not lost money through assisting the farming community. </para>
                <para>I had hoped that the bill would aim at improving the home life of the people on the land. We must have a balanced economy in this country if we are to progress. It is useless to think that we shall become a great nation merely by expanding our cities. We must develop our back areas. I warn the Government that when the men in the fighting services return, and the girls engaged on various forms of war work change their uniforms for civilian dresses, many of them will not want to go back to hum-drum country life. In our cities every home has its electric light, which has only to be switched on at a door, but in most of our country homes the illumination is by means of a paraffin lamp, and the atmosphere is somewhat dull and uninviting. </para>

                        <para>- A previous Commonwealth government did a great deal to improve country telephone services, but there is room for a great deal more to be done in that direction. This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> made some references to the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> I wish that the right honorable gentleman had had an opportunity to do more than he did for our country districts. Do not let us say that we cannot afford to make country life more attractive. We cannot afford to have a badly balanced population. No country which allows large areas of its land to remain idle can be great. We must populate this country if we hope to defend it. Much has been done to make life in our cities attractive. Indeed, although I love the country, I am beginning to like the cities also. This bill does not instruct the Commonwealth Bank Board to make advances ; that matter is left entirely to the discretion of the board. All that we have done is to limit to £5,000 the amount that may be advanced. We have not even fixed the rate of interest, although I agree that high interest rates are a heavy burden. </para>

                        <para>- I told the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(.Senator Collings)</inline> some time ago that he would find that I held moderate views. Nevertheless, I think that I would have a long way to go before I could accept some of the advanced ideas of honorable senators opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> has continually referred to our banking system. Motions in accordance with the views he has expressed in this chamber have been submitted in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia. The purpose of such motions has been that the Government should provide money free of interest. They had the support of people affiliated with the organization which has spread in Australia within the last few years under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Douglas,</inline> who visited this country a few years ago. In one motion it was proposed, not only that the Government should provide loans free of interest, but that it should also buy up all the debts of the farmers and transfer them to the Commonwealth Bank. Supporters of that proposal apparently imagine that debts can be liquidated by a wave of the hand. Throughout the many years I have 'been in public life, I have never attempted to persuade any people that  something can be done which I believe cannot be done. Nothing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> can say will persuade me that his theories are sound. If they were sound I fail to understand why governments throughout the world would not have implemented them years ago. All attempts which have been made to put such theories into practice produced fatal results. </para>

                        <para>- Such attempts were made in Russia, Germany, Austria and France. Probably France came out of the experience better than the other countries, but even in that country those attempts produced certain evils. I, and several other members, voted against the proposal which was submitted in the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia. I have been associated with farming people all my life, and I have always endeavoured to render real assistance to the man on the land. I hope that the Government will not consider this  measure as the last word in dealing with this problem. Our main problem is to provide relief for our primary producers who, year after year, have provided the goods by the .sale of which on the markets of the world we have been enabled to meet our overseas commitments. Up to date, those people have not received a fair deal. I am hopeful that we shall gain experience under this measure which will enable us to render more effective assistance to the primary industries which are the backbone of the country. Perhaps, the measure may be used as a basis to assist persons to buy farms, provided they have some capital. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has pointed out, however, the bill is defective in so far as it prohibits advances for working capital. In many cases it is difficult to separate ordinary capital from working capital. I should like to know whether the mortgage bank department will be separated entirely from the bank itself. "Will the amount which a man has at credit in the bank be taken into consideration in connexion with the intereston an overdraft with the mortgage bank department and in that way have the interest on his overdraft reduced? The Agricultural Bank of Western Australia is an advances bank solely, the advances being made for periods up to 30 years. During such a period a farmer might frequently have a considerable balance to his credit in an associated bank on which he is not earning interest, but, under the Western Australian scheme, he is unable to use that balance to reduce the interest on his overdraft. Farmers who receive advances from the mortgage bank department and who have a credit balance in another account should be charged interest only on their actual daily debit balance. Interest charges should be calculated on the basis of the combined accounts. Because of the restriction I have pointed out, many farmers withdrew their business from the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia. They found it much cheaper to deal with an associated bank which charged interest only on the actual debit balance. I support the measure. </para>

                        <para>- Many men whose property is not encumbered in any way may, nevertheless, be in financial difficulty. In such circumstances will a farmer be able to obtain an advance from the mortgage bank department; or is this measure designed to benefit only people who wish to purchase farms? Further, can a person whose property is mortgaged, say, up to 20 per cent, of its value, apply to the mortgage bank department for an advance to pay off his mortgage, and an additional amount, say, up to 10 per cent, of the value of his property? If the mortgage bank department is not to be permitted to make advances in such circumstances, I consider the bill to be inadequate. However, it is a step forward; and, as {-Senator Brown said, the Government, when it has a majority in both Houses, can introduce a comprehensive measure for the purpose of completely rehabilitating our primary producers. To-day our primary object should be to assist persons who have had experience on the land and who know their job, despite the fact that they get into financial difficulty. We should ensure that experienced people are retained on the land. That policy will prove far more profitable than helping inexperienced persons to purchase farms. Such persons are more likely to make a failure of it than the man who has been and still is on the farm and just wants to be helped owing to a small financial difficulty. I hope that the Minister will explain the position to which I have referred, because I am sure that some people will be misled by the statement which has been attributed to him, that the bill will not be used to rehabilitate farmers who are in financial difficulties. </para>

                    HAYS (Tasmania) [5.26J. - I am sure that keen disappointment will be expressed by primary producers when they know the provisions of this bill, which I expect will soon become an act. I can find nothing in it or in the Minister's speech to encourage the belief that it will assist in attacking the real problems of the man on the land. It provides for doing certain things which are already provided for by other money-lending institutions.  The only exception is that advances may be made for a long term. The period fixed by the bill is 40 years, but does any one really suggest that it is necessary to lend money to a farmer for such a long term? Would it not be a greater kindness to him to provide for a more substantial sinking fund, and give him a greater incentive, or place upon him the obligation to " make hay while the sun shines " and whilst he is still a young man?

                        <para>- We know the conditions that operate in regard to time-payment. Many people adopt that method of obtaining goods when they could quite well afford to pay cash for them, because they prefer the system of making small weekly or monthly payments. The average age at which a man goes on the land is, I should think, 30, and so, under the terms of this bill, he may be over 70 years of age before he pays off a mortgage. That is an invitation to him to delay repayment. It would be infinitely better to reduce the terms to 20 or to 25 years, and, if necessary, double the sinking fund contribution. That might cause periods of hardship, in which the borrower would have to deny himself for a year or two, but in a normal year he could pay off 2 per cent, or more. The obligation should be placed on him to liquidate the debt in a much shorter period than 40 years. A borrower is to be allowed to use the money to pay off an existing mortgage, but how far will that be helpful to him if his land is over-mortgaged and other money lenders are pressing him to clear off at least a portion of his indebtedness? We know that the Commonwealth Bank Board is a conservative body in regard to making advances, and we have no reason to believe that the new department will be more liberal. </para>

                        <para>- But the supreme control will be exercised by the Commonwealth Bank Board. In those circumstances, how can the new branch be used to advantage in helping a farmer to pay off an existing mortgage? If the Commonwealth Bank Board will take over the mortgage, there is no reason why other money-lending institutions should not. I support the second reading of the bill, but all it does is to create another competitive bank, lending on practically the same terms as all the other banks. It may serve the useful purpose of keeping rates of interest down, and making the associated banks alter their policy by granting advances for longer periods. At meetings of the Rural Industries Committee, witnesses have been asked again and again, " What is your conception of what the mortgage bank department of the Commonwealth </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para class="block">Bank should be, and how do you think it will operate ? " With few, if any, exceptions, each one has replied that it would be of great assistance because it would provide cheap money by means of liberal advances at a low rate of interest for long terms. This bill does not provide for anything of the kind, nor did I ever believe that it would, because the new department is to be a business undertaking. It does not even compare favorably with what the States have done by means of their agricultural banks or Advances to Settlers Acts. The landholder, if he is hard up and cannot raise the money elsewhere, can get it from a State agricultural bank or other such institution, which has really been established to assist him by making advances so as to provide him with sustenance and help him to clear his land, and to buy stock and implements to work it. Whilst the States have lost money in that way, they have indirectly benefited greatly by keeping settlers on the land. I am not prepared to say whether that should be the function of this new department, but, if we want people to stay on the land and be contented, and to implement a real land development policy, the time has come to deal with the whole subject in a comprehensive way. This bill may make a small contribution towards that end, but we must have a complete survey and stocktaking, so that the Commonwealth may introduce a comprehensive policy which will rehabilitate many of these men, at the same time giving the people in rural districts a standard of living approaching that which obtains in the cities. That is the great problem which Australia must face. Although to-day prices in the main are reasonable, it is clear from sworn evidence and from figures issued by the Commonwealth Statistician about three months ago that costs of production have risen by about  40  per cent. So, while this bill is a step forward and a token of the Government's earnest desire to do something for our primary industries, it is not entirely what was expected by many people. Actually the mortgage bank department will be merely another competitive banking institution, the only difference between it and existing banks being that it will make available long term loans. However, as I have said, this measure establishes a principle, and I shall support it. I desire only to draw attention to its weaknesses and to express the disappointment which will be felt by many people who have been expecting assistance, but who will gain little benefit from the scheme. </para>

                    (Western Australia) [5.38 |  . - I am confident that, generally speaking, primary producers will thank the Government for this measure. In years gone by legislation such as this was promised by various governments, but nothing was done. It has been left to this Government to take action, which I consider is particularly commendable in view of war-time conditions. In his second-reading speech the Minister for External Territories

                    <para>The establishment of a mortgage bank is an objective which has been approved by all political parties. Such a bank has long been considered necessary in order to provide long term loans to rural producers at reasonable rates of interest and at the same time give borrowers protection against pressure for repayment in difficult times of short-term loans or loans callable on demand. It is hoped that the activities of the now mortgage bank will thus, at least in some measure, relieve the financial position of such primary producers. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That in itself is sufficient justification for supporting this measure. Farmers will be freed from the anxiety usually associated with overdrafts from private financial institutions. This measure is particularly opportune in view of the need to impress upon the people the fact that the wheels of industry in our metropolitan areas could not turn if it were not for the primary producers, and that the man on the land must be granted every possible assistance to enable him to remain in production. For many years past, primary industries have been sweated industries. I agree that wages have increased in recent years owing to the shortage of man-power, but there is still room for advancement. Usually a farmer has to work long hours and to call upon the assistance of his wife and children in . order to make his land pay. This measure will assist the farmer to obtain what he most earnestly desires, namely, the freehold of  his property. Obviously, it is much more desirable that a farmer should own his property, rather than let it remain in the hands of a financial institution. I know a large number of farmers in Western Australia who are eagerly awaiting the promulgation of this legislation. I am pleased that the Government has seen fit to introduce the bill, and I take great pleasure in supporting it. </para>

The point that I endeavoured to make previously was that if the Commonwealth Bank were used by fi.n individual for ordinary banking purposes, would he be permitted to offset the amount of money in his ordinary account against his indebtedness to the mortgage department. Obviously, a bank manager would be very pleased to know that a client of the mortgage department was also using the Commonwealth Bank for ordinary banking purposes, and unless depositors are credited with the amount that they have lying idle in their ordinary accounts I am afraid that that practice will be discouraged. </para>

I have studied the bill very closely and I cannot find any provision covering the case mentioned by  the  honorable senator. I should like to know from the Minister whether the Commonwealth Bank Board will have power to make such an arrangement. It is a very important point and as I have no wish to delay the passage of the measure, I suggest that, in the absence of the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> should give to the Opposition an assurance that he will bring the matter before the Government. The second point I wish to make is this : The establishment of a mortgage department is a very important step. For some time, I have considered that it is not desirable that the constitution of the board should be such that all of its members are residents of New South Wales and Victoria. I do not blame the present Government for that representation, because the fault lies equally with previous administrations. Under the present proposal for long-term loans to people in outback and isolated areas, it is of the utmost importance that these matters should be considered by menwith experience of the conditions in States such as Queensland and Western Australia. In making future appointments to the board, will the Government consider the wisdom of selecting men with wide experience in those States? </para>

I desire that he shall not pay interest on the whole of his debt while he has money lying idle in his current account. I should like the Commonwealth Bank to encourage clients of the mortgage department to have a current account with the Commonwealth Bank, but under the bill no such encouragement is given. The borrower may deal with any bank he likes. It is a safer investment, from the point of view of the Commonwealth Bank, for the whole of the transactions of a farmer to be carried out through the local branch of the bank. </para>

                <para>In <inline font-style="italic">Tonking's</inline> case, the actual amount of compensation to which the plaintiff was untitled was a minor issue, so far at least as the court was concerned. The main issue was a general question of constitutional law - whether a grower had a right to have his just compensation assessed by a court, and not exclusively by the authorities (the Minister acting on the recommendation of the board) which were at that time prescribed by the regulations. The main issue was decided in favour of the grower. The High Court held that the Constitution gave the grower the right of access to the court. The court, therefore, had itself to proceed to assess the compensation to which the plaintiff was entitled. At the trial of the original action, no evidence had been given <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> to the basis upon which growers were being compensated <inline font-style="italic">de facto'</inline> under the regulations. In consequence o,f this, the court held that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonking</inline> was entitled to the net proceeds of sale (which in this particular case were identifiable) of the actual fruit he had produced. But members of the court emphasize the fact that additional evidence might possibly have Icd them to assess the compensation altogether differently. It is wrong to assume that <inline font-style="italic">Tonking's</inline> case lays down a final and irrevocable rule as to the method of assessing compensation for products  compulsorily  acquired and pooled. </para>
                <para>The court did say in <inline font-style="italic">Tonking's</inline> case that the grower is entitled to the full value of his fruit; that this alone would be the "just terms " for which the Constitution provides. But to translate these general propositions into pounds, shillings and pence is a task that cannot finally or satisfactorily be accomplished unless account is taken of the aims, methods and results of the acquisition by the Commonwealth of the commodity concerned. Each scheme depends  upon  its own organization and methods of compensation. Without going into detail, I observe that, in considering the " full value " of a commodity that has been acquired, a clear distinction must be dram, between what may be called the " individual " and the " mass " acquisition of property. Where the Commonwealth acquires a particular building or piece of equipment, the acquisition generally leaves the market undisturbed. But the very object of a "mass" acquisition is to deal with a threatened shortage or a threatened glut, to create an altogether new, fair and stable market, and to prevent profiteering on the one hand or the collapse of an industry on the other. "Joist terms " in such circumstances cannot be fixed merely by endeavouring to ascertain what price a grower would have obtained for his commodity in an open market. Very often the market has been disturbed, or even destroyed, by the exigencies of war. </para>
                <para class="block">Wheat. </para>
                <para>The matter that calls for particular mention is the position of what is called " quota " wheat - a grower's first 3,000 bushels - for which a price of 4s. a bushel is guaranteed. 1 do not think there is anything whatever in the judgments in the <inline font-style="italic">Tonking</inline> case which throws doubt' on this arrangement. Doubt must rest, I think, on an entire misconception about the facts. They are these: An advance of 4s. a bushel is paid on the quota wheat. On the residue, an advance of 2s. only is paid, but, as sales take place, further advances will be made. In making payments from the pool, the necessary adjustments are made for variations in the quality of the wheat supplied. Additional payments are made to the actual grower concerned, in respect of the small quantity sold aspremium wheat. For sub-standard wheat, deductions are made from the amounts payable to the grower concerned. The vital point is that the wheat pool (which, by the way, includes the proceeds of the flour tax) will in any event pay in respect of all wheat, both quota and surplus wheat alike, the net proceeds of realization neither more nor less. If the selling price of wheat is insufficient to repay the full 4s. advance on the quota wheat, the difference will be made up from general revenue. Surplus wheat will therefore not have to subsidize quota wheat. On the other hand, if the price rose so high as to exceed the guaranteed price plus costs of handling, quota wheat would not have to subsidize surplus wheat. The net proceeds of realization would still be paid by the pool to the grower. </para>
                <para class="block">Blue Peas. </para>
                <para>In most cases of general acquisition, the industry has been faced with a substantial export surplus, for which the war has closed the customary market overseas. Acquisition has been resorted to in order to avert the disorganization and collapse arising from a glut on the home market. Field peas, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hays</inline> referred, are an instance of exactly the opposite process, the acquisition of a commodity in short supply. The local demand, especially for army purposes, has rapidly expanded. The crop is small - too small, indeed, to meet in full Australia's wartime needs. Acquisition was resorted to in order to ensure supplies for service needs, and to regulate the marketing of any surplus available for civilian use. Price-control alone would have prevented profiteering, but would not have secured the other important objectives. The terms ofacquisition -15s. a bushel to thegrower- were fixed by the Commonwealth Prices  Commissioner. </para>
                <para>A court is not necessarily bound to hold that aprice fixed by the Prices Commissioner willconstitutejust terms of acquisition. </para>
                <para>But the appropriate administrative authority has taken the view that this particular price was just. The price before the war was certainly not more than 8s. a bushel. Growers themselves know that the price now fixed is both reasonable and payable. They could have got higher prices, no doubt, in an uncontrolled market; the merchants could certainly have got higher prices. Buyers, it is known, had to pay up to 30s. a bushel in the year before the acquisition took place. It is not to be assumed that the Constitution makes the Commonwealth powerless to check profiteering in a case where considerations of defence make it necessary to acquire a commodity that is in short supply. " Just terms " are not necessarily synonymous with yetting the very utmost that competition can squeeze out of the necessities of the nation in time of war. </para>
                <para>Other Commodities. </para>
                <para>The commodities I have mentioned may be taken as typical of the mass or general acquisitions put into operation in order either to rectify the ill effects of shortages in war conditions or to avert the consequences of over-supply. There are, however, a number of other commodities in which the Commonwealth has not itself acquired and marketed a whole crop, but has obtained large supplies for service purposes, under contracts with processors whose own supplies are controlled by the Commonwealth, at prices fixed by the Prices Commissioner. Tomatoes and citrus fruits belong to this class of commodities. I do not wish now to repeat or amplify the statement I made to the House on this class of transactions as recently as the 26th February. </para>
                <para class="block">Conclusion. </para>
                <para>The principles upon which the Commonwealth has acted in carrying out plans for the " mass " acquisition of commodities have been laid down by successive governments representing all parties in Australia and have been supported in each case by representatives of the industry concerned. The position arising from the High Court's decision as to the damages awarded in the apple and pear case may have to be clarified in subsequent proceedings. Apparently the decision lays down no mechanical rule of universal application in the ascertainment of just terms of acquisition. It may well he inapplicable to other circumstances and other commodities. </para>

Therefore, the Minister's action in describing my remarks as "a violent and completely unwarranted attack" on that official is completely unjustified. I repeat that this official has granted permits for the transport of racehorses and greyhounds to race and dog meetings. In another instance, he has permitted the use of a motor hearse on an 80-mile return trip, when a motor hearse was available in the town where the funeral took place. I stated plain facts. Further, when I was discussing this matter with the Minister he said to me, "Any one can get up on a stump and draw a crowd by making a lot of complaints ". I assure the Minister that I do not indulge in that practice to which, apparently, he has become accustomed in Queensland. I repeat my offer to accompany any officer whom the Minister might appoint to investigate the complaints I have made, and substantiate every allegation. Indeed, I consider that my remarks concerning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> were very mild. At many race meetings in Tasmania, one can count up to 150 cars, none of which is fitted with a gas-producer. Much more petrol, rubber and man-power can be saved in that State. The Minister also stated, " This gentleman has the confidence of the community of Tasmania ". I should soon disabuse the Minister of that view if I were to read the numerous telegrams which I have received since I made my remarks on the 10th March. The Minister also said that this official was performing his duties in an honorary capacity. The Minister overlooks the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> receives a salary of £2,000 a year from the Tasmanian Government. The Minister has launched a violent attack upon me. I can give many instances to show that this official is breaking the regulations which he has been appointed to administer. Those regulations have been made by the Prime Minister as Minister for Defence, and, consequently, they must be necessary. </para>

                        <para>- It hurts me very much to have to bring this matter forward in this way; but the Minister's reply to me has been featured in the press of Tasmania, which has played it up as an attack by a Minister upon one of his colleagues. Should the press fail to publish my reply, I shall have it printed and circulated. I repeat that I have proof of every allegation which I have made in this chamber against this official. I can show that, in many instances, this man has flouted the regulations he has been appointed to administer, and has given preferential treatment to certain sections of the community. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators opposite have so misrepresented the views which I have expressed with regard to the functions of the Commonwealth Bank that I take this opportunity to make my position <inline font-style="italic">xd.</inline> the matter quite clear. I have never said that the Commonwealth Bank should advance money interest free to all and sundry. I have said that it should advance money interest free to the Commonwealth Government The Commonwealth Bank is the people's hank, and the Government represents the people. There would be no sense in the Government paying interest on some service which it rendered to itself. However, honorable senators opposite have ridiculed the views I have expressed, and have attributed to mc statements which I have not made. Paragraph 504 of the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems states clearly that the bank can lend interest-free money to the Government. I should not he perturbed if the Commonwealth Bank charged the Government interest, because all the profits of the bank revert to the Government. </para>
