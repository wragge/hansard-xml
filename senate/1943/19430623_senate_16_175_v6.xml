                (Queensland -
            </para>
            <para>Minister for the Interior). - It is with very deep regret that I inform honorable senators of the death in Sydney on the 14th June of the Honorable John McNeill, a former member of the House of Representatives and Minister of the Crown. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNeill</inline> was first elected in 1922 to the House of Representatives as member for Wannon. He was defeated at the 1925 elections, but was re-elected in 1929, after which he was again defeated in 1931. During his final term he was appointed Minister for Health and Repatriation, holding office from the 3rd March, 1931, until the resignation of the Government on the6th January, 1932.  His  public service included, in addition to his parliamentary activities, membership of the Trade Unions Advisory Panel, on which he was the representative of the Australian Workers Union, and as a member of the Central Wool Committee. As general  president  of the Australian Workers Union and secretary of the New South Wales branch,he was an important figure in the industrial life of Australia, to which he devoted many years of untiring service. </para>
            <para>The passing of John McNeill makes one more break in a long line of Australians who have been truly remarkable in the development of this country. It seems to me almost impossible to realize that John McNeill has gone from us for ever. Not many months ago he was here inCanberra consulting with Cabinet Ministers on important matters of public interest. It is difficult for me to remember a time when I did not have fairly close associations with John McNeill&#39;s many activities. As honorable senators well remember, we had in this chamber for many years as Leader of the Opposition and as a member of the Government, . a great mate of John McNeill&#39;s in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes.</inline> Between John Barnes and John McNeill and others, but between those two particularly, there was a wonderful bond not only of friendship, but of similarity of ideas and ideals which lasted throughout their lives. In my connexion with industrial and labour work in Queensland, as well as in this Parliament, the counsel of John McNeill and John Barnes was of very great value. &#91;We have our differences in our daily lives and in our political alliances, but what I said just now is undeniably true, namely, that this kind of man is slowly but surely passing from us. Modern times do not develop the type. Consequently, I feel that in paying this tribute to John McNeill&#39;s work we honour, not only his memory, but also ourselves and all that has been done in the struggle to develop this country. Having passed through similar experiences, I know something of the struggle that these men endured in order to improve the conditions of their fellows. I remember the time when I stood reverently at some distance from these &#39;brave old pioneers and admired the way in which they risked everything that life held, although it did not hold much for them in those days. Men like John McNeill risked much in what they honestly and sincerely believed was for the benefit of their fellows. Without any of the advantages of a superior education, and certainly without any of the advantages of wealth, these men carved their rugged way to places of honour in the annals of this country. And so it is that this afternoon I feel more than usually moved because it has fallen to my lot to submit this motion. I extend my personal sympathy to those he has left behind. I am proud indeed to be able to tell the Senate that, at the instigation of the Prime Minister, who also knew John McNeill well, the deceased gentleman was granted a State funeral. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNeill.</inline>
                He was indeed a very fine man, and the Labour party will have great difficulty in filling the place that he occupied as leader of a great industrial union. I extend my sympathy to his widow and family at this sad time.

                has said, he helped to build the great union of which he was  president  - a union that serves those who are engaged in the hardest class of labour. The Australian Workers Union was the first union to organize what may be described as the unskilled workers, particularly the unskilled rural workers, in this country. It is, as
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline>
                stated, one of the biggest unions in this country, if not in the world. The late
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNeill</inline>
                was a good father, a capable politician, a trusted industrial leader, and an exemplary citizen. As has been stated, he always strove for industrial peace, and he succeeded in a great measure. As the Leader of the Senate has said, John McNeill, together with John Barnes. E. W. Grayndler and others, fought hard in the days before arbitration to improve the position of the workers of this country, cheerfully accepting all the risks associated with their activities. Australia is the poorer for the passing of John McNeill. I join with other speakers in expressing sympathy with his family in this time of sorrow.

                (New South Wales). - It is with feelings of the deepest grief that I rise to support a motion -relating to the death of one whom I knew well for more than 40 years. Poor old John McNeill has gone, as has also his former mate, Jack Barnes; and I extend to his family my sincere sympathy. Many years have passed since I first came to know John McNeill. He and I were among the few who had tickets testifying to our association with the new Labour party in 1893. At my home at 95 St. Thomasstreet, Clovelly, there is evidence of our association in those early days. I well remember the time when the station owners of the Eden-Monaro district went to John McNeill for advice, which he freely gave to them. I was associated also with the late John Barnes in the mines at Broken Hill before I became associated with John McNeill in clipping wool from sheep. I regard John McNeill .and John Barnes as two of Australia&#39;s greatest men. Now both of them have gone, and I am grieved. . I extend my sincere sympathy to the widow of my late friend, and also to his brother-in-law, Jim Scullin, a former Prime Minister. I desire to record in

                my sense of loss at the passing of one of the greatest men that Australia has produced. Rest in peace, John McNeill.

    <title>OPPOSITION MEMBERS ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTS TO SABOTAGE WAR LOAN</title>

                <para>That Opposition members in the Federal Parliament, and particularly U.A.P. members of the National Service Group, had tried to embarrass the Government by sabotaging the recent war loan was proved by the fact that, since the loan was oversubscribed, nothing further had been heard front them about alleged inflation, said the Postmaster-General and Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> at a public meeting; in the Leven Theatre, Ulverstone, last night. &#34;Less than a week before the loan closed,&#34; said <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley,</inline> &#34; a mayor and returned soldier in South Australia publicly accused three leading members of the National Service Group of the U.A.P. in South Australia of sabotaging the loan by publicly stating, at the same time that the Government was asking for public money for the prosecution of the war, that inflation would result from the Government loan appeals and high taxation.&#34; </para>
                <para>This, I think, calls for some comment. The accusation could emanate only from political bias ; it was uncalled for and unnecessary, and it also was untrue. In connexion with the flotation of that loan, the Government asked all political parties to assist, and many meetings were addressed by Opposition members, the subject-matter being solely the necessity of the loan and the duty of the public to subscribe. </para>
                <para>These meetings were called for that specific purpose. On the 14th April my colleagues and I were invited to speak at Kapunda on politics generally; at the eleventh hour we were asked to allow an appeal to be made on behalf of the loan. We realized that people generally were getting genuinely alarmed at the apathy of the public. Not only government supporters, but all those with a full realization of their responsibility as citizens regarded the position as serious. So we gladly acquiesced, and were only too pleased to endorse the remarks of speakers in the time allotted to us - approximately five minutes each - by the mayor of the town, who presided. </para>
                <para>Our meeting was entirely political, and each speaker was very forcible in his denunciation of the present Administration, its bungling in handling the food position, its biased attitude in the allocation of man-power, its inability to control the numerous hold-ups in the coalmining industry and on the waterfront, and also its handling of finance, with its attendant dangers of inflation. But in support of the war loan we were unanimous in our appeal for contributions. </para>
                <para>The facts of the case are that the selected  speaker  for the appeal was in the audience during our meeting, and was apparently annoyed at our criticism of Government policy. On his return to the city, at a press interview, he drew his conclusions not from our remarks on the war loan, but statements made on general policy. However, the whole matter regarding the accusation was proved to be without foundation, as can be substantiated by reference to the South Australian press of the 16th and 17th April. Personally, I had made appeals to the public both before and after the date of this meeting, so can hardly be accused of opposing it. </para>

He had had a telephone conversation with the State War Loan organizer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. F. Lewis ) , but in that he had referred only to being disappointed with the response of the meeting. &#34; It had been said that I rebuked the three federal members, but if I did it had a general application to all federal members and had no reference to anything said that night &#34;, he added. &#34;What I said was that the present apathy and complacency of the Australian people towards the present loan was due to lack of confidence in the present Australian Parliament. I added that while the Parliament, which was elected by the people, continued on party lines to the detriment of the war effort instead of diverting the whole of its energies to the main issue at stake - the winning of the war - it could not expect anything else on the part of the people but complacency. At the same time, I appealed to overlook party bickerings and to support the present loan.&#34;</inline></para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan has referred to the last war loan. According to a report in yesterday&#39;s press the Government&#39;s estimated expenditure of &#163;540,000,00,0 for the current financial year will be exceeded by &#163;20,000,000. As the result of the action of the private banks in placing all of their so-called surplus deposits with the Commonwealth Bank, one would think that the Government would not need to raise another public loan for some considerable time. The newspapers reported that these deposits exceed &#163;100,000,000, and that these funds would be used to finance the war. That is a fallacy. The reason why the private banks have those deposits is because business men are selling out their stocks, and have no avenue for ordinary private investment. Many depositors who have had overdrafts with the private banks for years past, now have a credit balance; and the private banks have decided to lend this credit to the Commonwealth Government at a certain rate of interest. On previous occasions in this chamber I have endeavoured to find out the amount of surplus deposits in the private banks. I know now. </para>

                        <para>So far in the war period it appears that the major part of the U.S. Government&#39;s deficit has been financed by bank credit. </para>

                        <para>Treasury Department figures, i.t is said, indicate that 62 per cent, of the increase in the national debt, direct and guaranteed, during the 12 months ended November 30, 1942. was taken by commercial banks. </para>

                        <para>The remaining 13 per cent, was absorbed by others - that is by the general investing public, including corporations and individuals. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators, perhaps, will recall the great victory loan which was floated in the United States of America during the last war. It has since been disclosed that only 5 per cent, of that great loan was subscribed by the American people. The other 95 per cent, was subscribed by Wall-street in the usual way by sending cheques to the Treasury.

                        <para>It will be seen from the foregoing that the private banks of U.S. (the Federal Reserve Banks are also private concerns) are taking advantage of America&#39;s pre-occupation with the war to obtain a debt stranglehold over the na.tion. </para>

                    <para>Many people in the United States of America, like many people in this country, think that the Federal Reserve Bank is a government bank; but, like the Bank of England, it is a private institution, -which provides credit. In this country, the private hanks combined hold only  &#163;15,000,000  in notes and silver and copper, and even that does not belong to the banks because it represents deposits. I repeat that the private banks do not lend money at all, but simply create credit against their deposits. This latest idea of placing surplus funds held by private banks with the Commonwealth Bank came from Britain. That racket was carried on in that country during the last war.

Indeed, no money is transferred from the private banks to the Treasury, but only cheques. It is a wonder to me why honorable senators opposite do not endeavour to check up on what I am saying.

                    <para>The quotation I have just made appeared recently in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> In the same paper, I read a report that the private banks, in transferring their surplus deposits to the Commonwealth Bank had acted patriotically with the desire of helping the Government, because the private banks could have lent that money out at interest at the rate of  5  per cent, or  6  per cent. That is another banker&#39;s lie, because that is not actually money. The transfer of those deposits to the Commonwealth Bank is of no advantage whatever to Australia. They cannot be used for financing the war. The private banks have been told that they cannot buy war bonds, and must not advance money to private individuals to enable them to purchase war bonds. I know that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has now given consent to the private banks to buy war bonds, and they are doing so. </para>

                        <para>No doubt .the public is hoarding more money than usual. The greater the feeling of insecurity, the more people hoard - of everything. </para>
                        <para>But the disappearance of so many millions of the Note Issue is probably explained by the fact that more people are carrying notes around with them. It&#39;s a long time since Tom, Dick and Harry enjoyed the inarticulate pleasure of having five or six pounds in the wallet, if it doesn&#39;t actually give them a sense of power ( ! ) , it certainly relieves them of that feeling of penurious indigence (i.e., &#34; broke &#34; ! ) which haunted them for years in the depression. What is NOT emphasized in the Press announcements about the Note Issue is that, of the &#163;137,000,000 issued to date, &#163;47,000,000 are held in reserve by the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>We have been told by honorable senators opposite that the note issue has  increased  from  &#163;47,000,000  to  &#163;137,000,000  since the outbreak of the war, but they have not told us that the private banks hold the bulk of that amount. Why should not the Commonwealth Bank increase the note issue? Otherwise, how can industry pay the wages of those thousands of people who are now earning wages for the first time in their lives. The Government of the day, regardless of its political colour, would be obliged to increase the note issue in order to meet this want. Ninety-nine per cent, of the world&#39;s business is done on credit, but the only interests who can create credit are the private banks. We are told that the Commonwealth Bank is now issuing credit; but why is it not issuing that credit to the Government free of interest? Under the old private banking system, the private banks could cash their treasury-bills, and these were funded in the national debt. We commenced this war with a national debt of &#163;1,200,000,000, and obviously that debt will be greatly increased before the war ends. It is time that honorable senators opposite asked themselves where these millions are coming from. I get tired of pointing out the facts. However, not one honorable senator on the other side has yet declared that what I have said on this matter is incorrect. I shall continue to deal with the matter as I have been doing in the past until honorable senators are prepared to listen to the truth, and act accordingly. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators opposite have complained of a report of a statement by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(&#39;Senator Ashley),</inline> which appeared in the Tasmanian press. That statement dealt with the action of certain honorable senators opposite with regard to the recent loan. I point out that at the time that report was first published no objection was taken to it by any supporter of honorable senators opposite. Not even the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beck),</inline> who is the secretary of the National Service group, protested. That statement appeared a considerable time before the Postmaster-General addressed the meeting at Ulverstone to which honorable senators opposite have referred. This attempt on the part of supporters of the Opposition in this Parliament to sabotage our last loan prompts me to bring to the notice of the Government other acts of sabotage which agents of the Opposition are perpetrating. I appeal to the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping to ensure that an adequate supply of tinned plate is released at &#62;an early date for the manufacture of all classes of tin  ware.  Country storekeepers have been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of saucepans, billycans, pots and kettles to meet the demand. When they lodge an order with the wholesaler, he replies: &#34;I am sorry that I cannot fulfil your order. The goods are unobtainable because of the policy of a certain gentleman named Dedman, who does not understand his job.&#34;  The  wholesaler who wrote that letter to a retailer did not even have the decency to apply to the Department of Supply and Shipping for the release of these goods, or inform it of the shortage. That is the other part of the story. When other representations were made, that wholesaler resented what he described as &#34; this interference &#34;. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In the cities, people are able to get supplies of kitchen utensils, but the shortage in the country is acute. For example, a miner has to take his tea in a billycan. If he cannot get a billycan, he cannot make tea. The Government is urging people in the country districts to produce more vegetables, but they have no saucepans in which to cook such foods. This position is brought about largely because some storekeepers and wholesalers are deliberately sabotaging the Department of Supply and Snipping. They blame the department for lack of supplies, although they do not lodge orders with the department for the release of these utensils. The department in Tasmania has already made arrangements for the manufacture of saucepans, pots, kettles and billycans; all that it requires is the release of tinned plate by the Department of Supply and Shipping. I express the hope that when the utensils become available, the department will see that nothing is supplied to the wholesaler who wrote the letter mentioned. Honorable senators opposite frequently accuse the workers of sabotage. The instance which I have cited is an excellent example of another kind of sabotage. Some storekeepers are the agents of the United Australia party, and take a delight in informing customers that lack of supplies is due to governmental action. </para>

                                does not like this exposure of the sabotage that is being committed by his agents. Although some goods are definitely unobtainable for reasons beyond the control of the Government, the agents of the United Australia party blame the Department for &#34;War Organization of Industry. &#34;Who gives those agents their instructions, I do not know. They will not even apply to the department for release of supplies. Honorable senators opposite have complained from time to time that the Labour party is taking advantage of the war to implement its domestic policy. I hope that the Government will move more rapidly in that direction by wiping out these saboteurs who are causing the general public such great inconvenience. I know some of them. They have attended meetings of the United Australia party in. Launceston and have subscribed &#163;40 and &#163;60 to party funds for the purpose of defeating me at the next general elections. They will be sadly disappointed. I hope that the Government will take immediate action to relieve the shortage of cooking utensils in the country districts of Tasmania, particularly in the far west, where transport is difficult. Unless something is done immediately the position will become desperate.

Every honorable senator knows that a degree of inflation is inevitable in war-time, and has occurred in every belligerent country. Taxation is one method of controlling it. Immediately the Third Liberty Loan closed, the Commonwealth Government placed a ceiling on prices in order to control inflation. That action aroused protests from honorable senators opposite, who represent vested interests, that the fixation of ceiling prices would reduce profits. Immediately the Government makes an effort to control inflation honorable senators opposite take up the cudgels on behalf of the exploiters and the profiteers. The paragraph continued - </para>

                            <para>- My record will compare favorably with his. &#39; The people of Australia gave the lie to that statement, because the loan was successfully filled. Shortly afterwards, another member of the Opposition, the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> declared that the Third Liberty Loan was not a &#34; people&#39;s loan &#34;. </para>

                    <para>Only last Friday, in Sydney, I had an investigation made with regard to loans recently floated under the direction of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and those raised under the regime of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> and the present Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden). Mr. Spender&#39;s</inline> recent statement with regard to loans is merely another attempt to sabotage the Government&#39;s financial standing. Had the honorable member been honest enough to mention the number of contributions of amounts up to &#163;100 which were made, for example, to the first three loans raised in 1940, and the two &#163;100,000,000 loans raised by the Labour Government in 1942 and 1943, the public would have been able to appraise the political significance of his criticism. Admittedly, he referred to the fact that financial institutions such as life assurance companies had made large contributions. There is nothing secret about the figures. They have all been published, and the details which I have before me are most illuminating. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spender</inline> was Treasurer in 1940, loans for &#163;18,000,000 and &#163;20,000,000 were raised, and of the total number of subscribers to the first of those loans 47.65 per cent, contributed amounts of &#163;100 or less, which represented 2.43 per cent, of the total sum raised. In the second loan, subscribers of sums up to &#163;100 represented 56 per cent, of the total number contributing, and their subscriptions represented 5.6 per cent, of the total amount. The third loan of 1940, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden</inline> was Treasurer, was for &#163;28,000,000, and of 21,830 subscribers in this case 46.5 per cent, were small subscribers who contributed up to &#163;100 each, representing 2.37 per cent. The lie is given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spender&#39;s</inline> statement that recent loans were not people&#39;s loans by the fact that the percentage of subscribers of sums up to &#163;100 had increased from 47 per cent., 56 per cent, and 46 per cent, in* 1940, to 88 per cent, and 90 per cent, for the last two loans raised by the Labour Government. In the &#163;100,000,000 Austerity Loan raised last year by th present Treasurer, 88 per cent, of the subscribers contributed amounts up to &#163;100, their total contribution representing 14 per cent, of the over-subscribed total. The loan in March this year attracted 384,131 subscribers who contributed up to &#163;100, this figure being 90 per cent, of the total number of subscribers and 10 per cent, of the total amount. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spender&#39;s</inline> political outburst can be judged when it is viewed with the background of attempts to sabotage the Third Liberty Loan. In view of the report in the South Australian press and other newspapers bearing on the matter, I stand by all that I have said, and I intend to repeat it on the public platform at every opportunity. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan and I have helped the Government by responding to every request made to us for assistance in appealing for contributions to war loans. I had the privilege of speaking on this subject in conjunction with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> and I also had an opportunity to make an appeal to the people through the national broadcasting network. It is deplorable that Ministers should rely on reports entirely and refrain from making true statements from those reports. The Mayor of Kapunda, according to a report published in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser,</inline> denied the statement attributed to him. As far as I am concerned, I appealed to the best of my ability for public support of the loan. I drew attention to the point taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> by way of interjection that it was regrettable that out of 3,000,000 income-earners in this country only 10 per cent. had contributed to the loan. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes),</inline> speaking in support of the loan, said that the people of Kapunda who contributed to it would help to retard inflation. For the Postmaster-General to travel over Australia and use the money of the taxpayers to tell the people that members of the Opposition had said the very opposite is to be guilty of a lie in keeping with that of the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> with regard to &#34; the Brisbane line &#34;. </para>
