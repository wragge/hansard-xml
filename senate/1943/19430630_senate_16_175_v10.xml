                    <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave -</inline> I desire to make a personal explanation. The statement made in the Senate yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> that I am now engaged in courtmartialling members of the 9th Division of the Australian Imperial Force is untrue. I am not engaged in courtmartialling any men. I have never been either the  president  or a member of a court martial. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> has seen fit to make sneering reference to my service overseas, I desire to place on record the facts of the case. I enlisted as a gunner in the 2nd/7th Australian Field Regiment early in June, 1940. I was promoted to the ranks of lance-bombardier, bombardier and lance-sergeant, and embarked for the Middle East in November, 1940. I disembarked in the Middle East in December, 1940, and after further training moved with my regiment to the western desert where I served until November, 1941, when I was seconded to Headquarters, Australian Imperial Force, Middle East. I remained with the Australian Imperial Force Head-quarters until my return to Australia in March, 1943. At no time have I ever suggested or implied that I was in the battle of El Alamein. I was, however, in a position to know the disgust of the men at being pulled out at the final stage of the battle. It appears obvious that the honorable senator has manufactured these falsehoods in an endeavour to reflect upon my character and injure me politically. </para>

                            <para>- It has been the invariable practice of the Treasury to publish particulars of subscriptions to loans only where the subscriber has given consent to publication. Since the commencement of the war, the Commonwealth Bank has adopted the policy of not supplying information of this nature, and has intimated that it still desires to maintain this policy unless at any time special circumstances make it desirable to alter it. </para>

                        <para>- When I obtained leave last evening to continue my remarks, I was dealing with the attitude of the Labour party, both as a government and as an opposition, to the defence of this country. I expressed astonishment at the flood of patriotism which appeared to have come over that party, and I wondered whether the people of Australia would regard the change of view as a death-bed repentance because of a desire to flee from the wrath to come, or as a sincere conviction. However, the electors will have an opportunity to decide that question for themselves within, the next few weeks. During this debate honorable senators opposite have repeatedly alleged that the Menzies and Fadden Governments left Australia defenceless. I cannot believe that they really believe their own statements in that respect. At all events, I am certain that all thinking people will judge those statements to bo gross exaggerations. During the regime of those Governments, we were not as prepared, perhaps, as we should have been; but the reason for that fact is to be found largely in the attitude adopted by honorable senators opposite towards the defence proposals of those Governments. It cannot be said that either the Menzies or the Fadden Government was isolationist in outlook. Both realized their responsibilities towards our Allies, and were prepared to assist our Allies in any sphere which strategic considerations dictated. They realized that the Mother Country, for instance, was greatly in need of supplies which we could make available, because I need hardly remind honorable senators of the tragedy of Dunkirk, and the immense quantities of war mlaterial which the British forces were obliged to abandon when they evacuated northern France. Following that tragedy, previous governments realized Great Britain's urgent need for supplies of war material which we had on hand, and they did not hesitate to make as much as possible of that material available to the Mother Country in its hour of need. That is the principal reason why this country was not as prepared as it might have been when Japan entered the war. It is clear that the present Government has not shown the same degree of appreciation of the help being rendered by our Allies as did the Menzies and Fadden Governments. </para>

                        MCLACHLAN That is so ; and the people will give their  answer within a few weeks. This Government, in its arrogance, has lost its sense of proportion. It does not seem to realize that our strength numerically is infinitesimal compared with that of the United Nations. The population of the United Nations is approximately 700,000,000 compared with our population of 7,000,000, that is, in the ratio of 100 to 1. Therefore, it should behove this Government to be wary about endeavouring to dictate the policy of the United Nations, or what they should do for us. Several honorable senators who have taken part in this debate have referred to the visits overseas by the Minister for External Affairs

The Minister for External Affairs declared at a meeting of social credit supporters in Sydney that although lie did not know what they were talking about they were right; and, in assessing the value of that statement, we must ' remember that the Minister was formerly a judge of the High Court, and, therefore, would not make such statements without due consideration. That statement is in print to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I say that the Minister for the Army should, know more about our defences than any other Minister. Therefore, in the event of the Prime Minister being unable to undertake such a mission, that Minister, and not the Minister for External Affairs, should have been sent. But why was that Minister sent overseas in preference to the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Army ? I shall give the reason. The Prime Minister was too astute to go abroad and leave his Cabinet behind him. Probably, if he could have taken all his Ministers with him he would have undertaken the mission. However, I believe that the Prime Minister was not too sure that if he left these shores he would remain Prime Minister. That was why the Minister for External Affairs was sent. He took with him a retinue of officers, including his secretary and publicity officer, in order that we should be kept well informed of what he was doing while he was overseas. "We have been kept well informed at least of what he has tried to do. He has tried to rectify a mistake which he made on his previous visit abroad, from which we did not see any results until about eight months after he returned, when the Mother Country, very graciously, made available to this country a squadron of Spitfires for the protection of our northern shores. When some of us expressed our pleasure at the arrival of these aircraft, we were told, " That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> went to Great Britain, for " ; but we did not know anything about it until the Spitfires arrived here, some eight months later. Apparently, the right honorable gentleman is making no mistake on this occasion. He has taken a publicity officer with him, and we are informed regularly of what he is doing so that no matter what comes along after he returns, he will be able to say, "Yes, that is what I got for you ". </para>

                    <para>This Government was extremely lucky when it assumed office. It found the affairs of the nation in good order. The ground work of our defence programme had been carried out, and our finances were in a wonderful condition. Now, when an honorable senator on this side of the chamber happens to mention the word " inflation ", some honorable senators opposite become highly indignant, as if it were horrible to think of such a thing; but the position as I see it is this : All governments make mistakes, and in most cases these mistakes can be rectified by succeeding administrations, but when a government wrecks the financial institutions of a country, that is a mistake which it i3 extremely difficult to remedy; yet that is what this Government is doing to-day. When it came in to power, the value of treasury-bills amounted to less than £2,000,000; to-day that figure has risen to. approximately £300,000,000. That is not the worst : This Government is using the printing press to turn out £1 notes in very much the same way as a butcher uses a sausage machine. When this Administration came to power, our note issue amounted to approximately £47,000,000, whereas to-day it is between <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> 37,000,000 and £138,000,000- an increase of about £90,000,000. In addition, it is not necessary for me to emphasize that the face value of the money we possess is not a real indication of our wealth. When the Fadden Government went out of office, in effect, a £1 note could be purchased for 21s.; to-day, that figure has risen to 29s. 3d., and is still rising. It is also true that the new notes issued are not in the hands of the banks, where they should be and usually are, but in the pockets of the people. That is a serious position. While I agree that it is impossible to pay for this war as we go along, at least we should pay as much as we can now. 'Great Britain is working on those lines. At the end of this financial year, Great Britain will have provided 50 per cent, of its war expenditure out of revenue, whereas we shall have provided only 16 per cent. Although it is unavoidable that a certain degree of inflation will occur in times like the present, we are getting close to the border line, and that unless action be taken to curb the present trend, disastrous results may follow. </para>
                    <para>In the course of this debate there has been much talk of rationing, primary production, and " the Brisbane line ". In regard to rationing, although I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice,</inline> who said that it was impossible to administer such a huge organization without creating some anomalies, the anomalies are far too numerous. The Rationing Commission is composed of three gentlemen, only ore of whom has had any commercial experience. That gentleman is the  chairman  of the commission, and his business experience is very limited. One can hardly expect a man whose life has been spent endeavouring to buy articles for ls. and sell them for 2s. 6d. to have a very strong grip on commercial affairs. The original decision of the commission in regard to lay-,by goods was ridiculous. Even one member of the commission agreed with that, but obviously a man who sells nothing over 2s. 6d. would not do much lay-by trade and could not be expected to know much about it. The decision was particularly hard on young women who were preparing to set up housekeeping. I know of one case in which a woman was preparing to make the last payment shortly after the date of the announcement of the new rationing; yet the shopkeepers concerned bad the audacity to ask her for 80 coupons for the goods which she had purchased for her "glory box " over the last six months. As one member of the Commission was in Great Britain and the dispute over lay-by goods was referred to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> who not only is the biggest man in the Cabinet physically, but also is a bigger man mentally than many of his fellow Ministers. The Minister settled the question in a very business-like manner, and I am sure that the people of this country are grateful to him for what he did in that regard. </para>
                    <para>It is obvious that the attitude of this Government towards the primary producers has changed considerably during the last month or two, due, of course, to the fact that an election is approaching. In season and out of season we on this side of the chamber endeavoured to secure a further advance on the 1941-42 wheat crop; but we were told repeatedly that nothing further would be paid on that crop. However, as soon as an election loomed, an additional 3d. a bushel was paid. Some time ago the Government destroyed the dairying industry by absolutely depleting it of man-power, and many of our finest breeders, finding that they could not proceed, got rid of their cattle. We had a shortage of men, and the Government started to regiment the industry. Then it turned around and said, "We will make this all right by giving the dairying industry a subsidy of £2,000,000 ". The dairymen did ' not take this too kindly, but an election was looming and up went the subsidy from £2,000,000 to £6,500,000. But this was twelve months too late, because the damage was done. </para>

A dissolution should have been announced on the day on which two members of the Parliament scrapped their election pledges, subordinated them for their own benefit, and voted with what to-day is the Government. We have been going on for the last eighteen months with a government  in  power entirely dependent on two men who could simply ask for what they wanted, and they got it. </para>

                        <para>. -  I have heard many debates, but have never heard the political propaganda machine worked to the degree that it has been worked during this debate. In fact, as my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> suggests, the machine has been worked overtime. The shock troops who led the attack - .Senators McBride, Wilson and Spicer - have by their contributions lowered the prestige of this chamber and the standard of debate. That is .characteristic of the Opposition. I raise no objection to their  attempt to create a favorable impression upon the people of Australia when there is an election in the offing. If in their wisdom they decide that the best method of propaganda is criticism and vilification of the Government, and a recital of their own activities or misdeeds when in office, I have no complaint to make. But I emphasize that, whether in criticism of the Government or in their recital of the activities of the United Australia party or United County party governments of the past, it is essential that their remarks should have a factual background. As I proceed, I propose to furnish some conclusive evidence of the utter disregard for the truth which has characterized the contributions of Opposition senators to the debate. Inaccuracy has not been their only feature. There has not been one utterance by honorable senators opposite in regard to major problems con fronting the country at present. They have made no suggestions for the successful prosecution of the war, which should be the first consideration of this National Parliament. We have heard the Prime Minister and the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> vilified and condemned to the utmost by gentlemen sitting opposite, whose major object in this Parliament seems to be to utter carping criticism and to parade their own patriotism at every opportunity. I remember last year when, with characteristic realism, the present Prime Minister made his appeal to the United States of America, and the criticism by members of the Opposition. Other honorable . senators also remember the campaign that was started when the Prime Minister appealed to that country for help. The campaign was started in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. It was noticeable that it did not blossom in either Queensland or Western Australia, those States not being regarded as fertile ground upon which to inaugurate such a campaign. In those States the people realized the dangers that would beset them in the event of further encroachment of the Japanese southwards. Honorable senators should reflect for a few moments and carry their minds back to the middle of 1941. It will be easy for them to refresh their minds with regard to that period, because it was about the time when the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> returned from Great Britain. At that time the Menzies Government was being whipped into action by the press of Australia. It had been challenged by the press as a result of its ineptitude and. inefficiency. So pronounced was its inefficiency that its own friends had turned upon it. It was criticized by the press as a government of bewilderment and confusion. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan say that other honorable senators had seen something in print about the Minister for External Affairs, but it had not been produced. I have something before me in print, and I intend to read it. It is an extract from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of Wednesday, the 2nd July, 1941. The caption is " Overlapping and Confusion " and the article states - </para>

I do not say that he intentionally endeavoured to mislead the Senate, but I do say that in his desire to gain a political advantage, his enthusiasm overcame his judgment. The honorable senator said that it had been estimated that, as a result of industrial stoppages, 2.000,000 tons of coal had been lost in 1942. The figures mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> are typical of the kind of propaganda used by opponents of the Government during the last three or four months. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> said that the loss of production of coal in 1942, as the result of strikes and hold-ups, was 2,000,000 tons. </para>

                            <para>- I want to be fair, and I am sure that when the honorable senator sees that he ha3 made a mistake he will be man enough to admit it. He said that the loss of 2,000,000 tons of coal in 1942 was due to strikes and holdups. He did not attribute any of that, loss at all to absenteeism. In that year the number of man-days lost in the industry was 177,566. I want the honorable senator to relate that figure to the loss of production of 2,000,000 tons which he cited, and then, let us look at the corresponding figures for 1940 when the Menzies government was in office. In  that year the number of man-days lost in the coal-mining industry was 1,364,310. On the basis of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride's</inline> statement that 2,000,000 tons was lost in 1942. when. the number of man-days lost was 177,566, the loss of production of coal in 1940 would be 15,200,000 tons. That little calculation, which I invite honorable senators opposite to check, shows how fantastic is the figure given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride.</inline> It forces one to the conclusion that his statement is ridiculous. </para>

                            <para>- It is almost impossible to compute with any degree of accuracy the loss of production of coal. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> as a former Minister for Supply will agree with me on that point. However, the figures I have just given have been supplied to me by the Department of Supply and Shipping. I have simply used them as a means of testing the accuracy of the figure of 2,000,000 tons loss of production cited by the honorable senator. I have already said that, in 1940, when the Menzies government was in office, 1,364,310 mandays were lost in the industry whilst in 1941 275,605 man-days were lost, and last year 177,565 man-days were lost. At the same time, our total coal production last year was nearly 15,000,000 tons which is a record for this country, the quantities of coal produced during the last four years being 13,535,142 tons in 1939, 11,73 6,682 tons in 1940, 14,212,450 tons in 1941, and 14,971,893 tons in 1942. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member for Kooyong, who was then. Prime Minister, visited the coalfields and pleaded with the 10,000 nien who were on strike to go hack to work. He did not suggest then that the strikers should be put into the Army, although he had the power to put them there. He also had the opportunity to put them in gaol, but he did not suggest that they should be put in gaol. On the contrary, he pleaded with them to go back to work. Yet, to-day, honorable senators opposite, including those who were members of the Menzies government, criticize this Government for failing to deal with strikers in the drastic fashion they now suggest. I also point out that in giving figures dealing with the loss of production of coal, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> did not make any allowance whatever for loss due to stoppages owing to faults in the mines. Eoi' purposes of propaganda he merely lumped all losses together regardless of their causes. </para>

                    <para>When speaking last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham</inline> referred to the increases of postal rates and charges by the Postmaster-General's Department, and I interjected that such increases were made as a war measure. No Government instrumentality should continue to make huge profits as have been made by the Postmaster-General's Department in the past, because any profits above a reasonable amount should either be expended in improving the particular service to the public, or should be used to offset a reduction of its charges. However, every honorable senator knows that the last increases of charges by the Postmaster-General's Department were made primarily as a means of spreading additional taxes fairly over the community as a whole. Honorable senators opposite will also admit that the increases of taxes imposed by this Government are exactly the same as those which the Fadden government proposed to impose when it was defeated. That should clear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham's</inline> mind some of the fears which he expressed in regard to the imposition of additional taxes for postal purposes. </para>

                        claimed that employees at non-official post offices would be forced to join a union before they could enjoy the increased payments recently announced, but I can assure the honorable senator that that will not be necessary. In any case, the organization of which these employees would be members is not affiliated with the Labour party in any way, so that no benefit to the Labour party would accrue if they did join.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham</inline>
                        claimed also that previous governments had granted increased emoluments to employees of non-official post offices; but any one who understands the working of these institutions knows  that as business increases so small increases of allowances are granted. I point out that the previous scale of allowances paid to non-official postmasters took effect on the 1st July, 1927. That scale introduced the system of payment on a work value unit basis. It was subsequently amended from time to time to increase the unit value of particular transactions, and to incorporate in the scale new classes of business or work. An availability allowance to increase rate of payment at small offices was introduced in 1938 and, at the same time, the monetary value of the unit was increased. The estimated additional cost of these innovations was £41,000 a year. The scale adopted as from the 1st July, 1942, embraced some important modifications. These included a revision of the unit appraisement of the work value of transactions in light of present day conditions; an increase of the monetary value of the work unit; provision for the variation of the monetary value of the work unit according to the rise and fall of the cost of living; provision for payment at a minimum rate of £272 a year, where the work is of such volume as to necessitate constant attention during office hours - owing to subsequent cost of living variations, the minimum payment for full-time service offices is now at the rate of £290 a year; increased payment for attention to traffic after normal office hours; payment by the department at full-time service offices for subordinate staff necessary in the. light of the volume of business transacted ; an increase of the allowance at small offices for provision of office accommodation; an increase of the availability allowance at small offices; payment for attendance on public holidays; a special allowance for morse telegraphic qualifications; and the granting of three weeks' recreation leave annually to postmasters at full-time service offices where they personally give full-time attendance. The additional payment to non-official postmasters, as a result of the application of the present scale, amounted to £258,000 a year. Following cost of living increases, that figure has now considerably increased. The total payments to non-official postmasters during the forthcoming financial year is estimated at £1,221,000.

                    <para>So much has 'been said in the course of this debate about strikes that I draw attention to the following report which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> on the 3rd July, 1941 : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The opening of Parliament during which the terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies's</inline> prospectus for total war effort were to be given legislative enforcement is to end this week. The only measure arising out of the Prime Minister's programme which has been passed by Parliament has been an act increasing the number of Cabinet Ministers from twelve to nineteen. </para>
                        <para>It may be recalled that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies's</inline> national broadcast contained more promises than that. There were phrases which still remain in the memory for their note of resolute and urgent action. Among them this - " The time has passed for simply protesting against strikes and lock-outs in war or allied industries. We propose to prohibit them." </para>
                        <para>Yesterday the Government announced that it would not proceed with legislation to prohibit strikes. Some days ago it abandoned the proposal to give the Commonwealth Industrial Tribunals unfettered jurisdiction to award preference to unionists. The retreat has been conducted with all the proper parliamentary procedure. The Leader of the Opposition made a speech which so convinced the Prime Minister by its eloquence and logic that, on the spot, he withdrew the Government's proposals.No mention was made of the private negotiations at which the political bargain had already been struck. </para>
                        <para>The legislative part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies's</inline> programme has thus faded away, leaving nothing but a host of new government appointments. What of the new administrative policy? Phrases of the Prime Minister's broadcast again return to mind. "It is clear that our national organization must become one primarily for war. War industries must no longer stand for what we can carve out of civil industry and civil industry must become what we can afford to the total organization of a country which is at war . . . the work of munitions construction is handicapped by the shortage of plant and labour. We still have too many civil industries which make the things they like and could be better engaged in making munitions. More men and plant are essential for war purposes. . . . It is my belief that this year 1941 will determine whether we shall lose or win the war ". </para>
                        <para>Yesterday the" Prime Minister replied to anxious doubts as to whether the transfer of workers from non-essential civil industries to war industries is being organized to prevent a distressing lag of employment.  His  reply was startling. It amounted to an assurance that there is no need to worry, because no such transfer is being made- at least not for the purpose of providing workers for munitions. For the consolation of any who think that the Government might act with undue sense of urgency <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> explained that the new Minister for War Organization of </para>
                        <para class="block">Industry (presumably after he lias discovered what his particular functions are) "will not not take any steps in a reckless fashion. He will not act without great thought ". </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> is one of the men who, honorable senators opposite claim, laid the foundations of our war effort! Those are the men on the opposite side of the chamber who complain - and this applies not only to their leaders but also to their rank and file members - on behalf of people who to-day are grumbling because they are short of a few mantles in some country section, or short of butter or some other commodity. They do this without considering what Australia is doing in regard to assisting Great Britain in the war effort. I ask those who complain of and make representations in regard to rationing, and even those who stand up here and say that they plead for the small business man, to take a much wider view. They moan and shed crocodile tears for the small business man. but those members of the Opposition who represent vested interests in Australia care not a tinker's curse for the .small business men or the workers. I read to the Senate this afternoon evidence which showed that when they were in power they were shackled by the fetters of vested interests. They could not move, or they were afraid to  move, because they were placed in this chamber to look after vested interests. The manufacturers and monopolists of this country are the parties that they represent. They stand up in their places here and moan over the small 'business man and the harm that is being done to him. Whatever they blame the Government for, the Government has endeavoured to play its part so far as the war ig concerned. I made reference a little while ago to what occurred in the middle of 1941. I should like to lake honorable senators hack to the early part of last year, and compare the condition of this country then with what it is now. That was the period after the fall of Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite did not show it when they supported a campaign against the Prime Minister. I remember how, after the fall of Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies, one met the same atmosphere of gloom and despondency in the cities, the country towns, or the rural areas, and invariably the question was asked, "How. long are we going to last? " There is a different feeling in Australia to-day. There is a complacency which is not justified, and which allows honorable senators opposite to complain about small men being pushed out of business because some one has been squeezed in the war effort. The Government is endeavouring to see that every one in this country plays his part in regard to the Avar. There is too much complacency when a man complains that S oz. of butter a week is not enough for him. People in Great Britain have to live on 2 oz. of butter a week. No consideration is given here to that fact, and no comparison is made between the conditions here and in Great Britain. Any body who complains of the rationing in this country should first of all consider some of the disabilities and hardships that our forces are enduring in defending Australia. I have met many men who have returned from the Middle East and New Guinea. Some of them have told me that they did not even have bread for two months. Yet there are people who grumble and growl because they say that half a pound of butter a week ig not sufficient for them. I say frankly that, whatever restrictions have been imposed by the present Government, and whatever inconveniences have been caused to the Australian people, they are insignificant in comparison with the sacrifices and hardships that have been endured by our soldiers, airmen and sailors in defending Australia. </para>

I feel under a certain degree of disadvantage in following the Minister, because it is apparent that he has driven nearly all his supporters out of the chamber, and it is difficult to talk to a party which is represented in the chamber by only four senators.

He referred to a speech delivered by the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> in Sydney on the 3rd December, 1942.

Criticism of the Opposition has been offered by honorable senators opposite because of the fact that, when war broke out, this country, in common with the democracies in other parts of the world, was not so prepared as it should have been to resist the Axis partners, who had devoted the whole of their efforts and money to t3ie building up of armaments, although that involved enslaving and starving their people. Great Britain and its dominions, the United States of America and other democracies did not desire to enslave their people by taking part in- the mad race for armaments, and it will be a sorry day for our Empire if, after the war, the manufacture of armaments is continued at the present pace. We should not utilize the whole of our resources for armament production. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has been untiring in his efforts to secure a restriction of armament production throughout the world. It appeared for a time that the work of the League of Nations would be successful, but, unfortunately, the nations did not act towards one another as we hoped they would have done, and the Axis countries alone were prepared for this war. It was hoped that the example set bv Great Britain, the United States of America and certain other countries disarmament would have been followed throughout the world, so that further wars could be avoided. </para><para>When this war broke out, it was recognized that a definite challenge had once more been issued to democracy, and particularly to the British Empire, which is the keystone of democracy throughout the world. When it was eventually realized that the efforts of Great Britain and the other democracies to keep the peace were of no avail, the governments of the day commenced the construction of ships, aeroplanes and various armaments, but it is of no use for the present Government to say now what previous governments should have done, because the circumstances before the war were, of course, entirely different from those now prevailing. The people of this country would not have tolerated the enormous burden of taxes which have now been imposed for the building of armaments, because our desire at that time was to secure peace and goodwill among all nations. Honorable senators opposite cannot truthfully say that the defences of Australia have been neglected by past governments. The men who were selected by previous administrations at the outbreak of the war to lead our fighting services and to take control of the production of munitions and aeroplanes are the same as those in control to-day. The leaders of industry who four years ago were roundly condemned by honorable senators opposite because they were said to represent vested interests have been allowed by the present Government to continue in positions of authority, because it is recognized that they are the most suitable men to direct war production. All parties agree that the war must be prosecuted with the utmost vigour and determination and that the people generally must work, pay and make heavy sacrifices until democracy is again free. At the request of the former Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and senior members of the Labour party, the Advisory War Council was, for good or for ill, established for the purpose of creating a joint partnership in the carrying on of the war effort. That council was deliberately established by the Menzies Government at the request of the then Opposition, in the hope that it would eventually provide a bridge towards the formation of a national government. That council was set up after the Prime Minister of the day had, time after time, offered the hand of friendship to the then Leader of the Opposition with a view to the formation of a national government. When that offer was declined, the Opposition replied, " We are willing to meet you to this extent, that we shall gladly cooperate with you on the Advisory War Council ". If the Menzies or the Fadden Governments failed with respect to the war effort a similar charge could be laid against the Labour government, because the Labour party had as many representatives on the Advisory War Council as did the government of the day. It had access to all of the war plana and all of the operationsbeing undertaken by the fighting services. It knew how many men were being called up. It had access to the munitions programme and it was consulted with regard to financial problems. It saw the budget in advance. Its representatives met with the government regularly, week after week, but they uttered not one word in protest against what was being done by the Menzies and Fadden Governments. I agree with the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley),</inline> who said that those governments did not fail entirely because of the efforts of the Opposition. They failed partly because of the traitorous action of two men who had been entrusted to follow a certain line in politics. One of those men voted against the government because he could not get into the Cabinet, and the other, who has a most weird outlook on political life, was liable to vote any way at any time. After the change of government the Advisory War Council was continued. The same offer of partnership as had previously been made to the Labour party was extended by the Curtin Government to the Opposition. At the first party meeting of the Opposition following the change of government, the invitation was readily accepted, and since then representatives of the Opposition have met regularly with other members of the Advisory War Council. Consequently, if any success can be claimed by the Government, the Opposition claims its share, because it has acted on the council as equal partners with, the Government. Honorable senators know that during recent months I have not favoured the retention of Opposition members on the council. My attitude changed because of the action of the Government in regard to the bill for the extension of the area in which the Militia could serve. Instead of giving to its partners on the Advisory War Council access to the information that was available to the Government, the Prime Minister took secret plans for the conduct of the war to a meeting of trade unionists who had no responsibility to the people. In my opinion it was then time for every decent member of the Opposition to retire from the Advisory War Council. The Prime Minister's action was a gross betrayal of responsibility: he placed members of a trade union congress above the elected representatives of the people. </para><para>I shall not deal at length with what has been referred to as " the Brisbane line ", but which is in reality the Brisbane lie. Had it not been for the fact that there had been an election for the Greater Brisbane City Council and other municipalities in Queensland, which resulted in the complete rout of the Labour forces in that State, nothing would have been heard of " the Brisbane line ". Honorable senators know that at the elections to which I have referred the mayor and alder-men representing the Citizens Reform party were opposed bitterly by Labour candidates. Labour staked its reputation on the result of the election, but when the poll was declared the present Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Chandler, was shown to have a majority of 56,000 over the whole of the Labour and Independent candidates opposed to him. A wave of anti-Labour opinion swept throughout Queensland, and supporters of the Labour party became alarmed. They saw the prospect of the loss of at least three seats in the House of Representatives at the forthcoming federal elections, and, in addition, the loss of three Senate seats. They realized that the present Leader of the Senate, who has adorned this chamber for several years, was about to end his career as a senator. They wanted to stop the drift, and they wondered how it could be done. Eventually, they hatched the Brisbane lie which is now known as " the Brisbane line ". The action of a Minister of the Crown in discussing matters of strategy - particularly a Minister who is not a member of the War Cabinet - is something new in Australian politics. It is clear that " the Brisbane line" story was either manufactured by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> or was deliberately given to him. However, I shall not deal further with that matter, because it is to be the subject of investigation by a royal commission. However little I may have admired the Minister for Labour and National 'Service for his actions, I admire less his colleagues, who remained quiet for three or four months and made no attempt to repudiate his utterances, but yet, when the Minister was exposed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> in the House of Representatives, were ready, like a pack of dingoes, to turn on him. The Prime Minister has equal responsibilities with every other member of the party for what has taken place, because the right honorable gentleman was prepared to take any political advantage that might accrue from the utterances of his colleague. </para><interjection>

The Leader of the Opposition wrote to the Prime Minister and asked him to give the facts to the public. But what did the Prime Minister do ?

Never before in the history of this country has a Prime Minister been known, when challenged on a matter of policy, to name an individual general as the author of a particular strategic plan, or to make a point of the fact that that particular general was appointed by another government. "What did it matter who appointed General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Iven</inline> Mackay Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces? Why was it necessary to state that fact? If the Prime Minister desired to be honest in this matter, could he not have said that the military advisers to the Government had submitted certain plans ? Why was it necessary to brand this gallant soldier as the author of this plan? If the Prime Minister had no intention of branding General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Iven</inline> Mackay in that way, why did he find it necessary to rush into print the next day to say that he was not going to allow General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Iven</inline> Mackay to be made the football of party politics? Every soldier who occupies a high position in  His  Majesty's Forces is called upon from time to time to make certain strategic plans for the government. In the strategic planning of the defences of this country, there are, perhaps, a hundred different plans designed to meet a great variety of eventualities. For instance, certain areas might have to be evacuated, or it might not be possible to defend certain areas. Had we been faced with the entire might of Japan, we know that with so small a population, unaided by any other of our Allies, we could not repel the invader from every part of Australia even if we placed every man and woman in the country under arms. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The necessity for assisting the industry in that way would not have arisen had the Government handled the man-power position properly. The Government allowed the industry to be bled white of labour, and to be reduced to chaotic conditions before it took any steps to help it. Even now, it has linked the payment of that subsidy with the application of an industrial award to the industry which will mean that the bulk of the subsidy will be a " good thing " for the Australian Workers Union. During the last twelve months, members of this Parliament in both chambers have warned the Government of the dangers confronting the dairying industry. We know that dairy herds have been slaughtered for beef simply because the dairyman could not obtain assistance on his farm. Not only persons engaged in business on their own account, but also business men who are endeavouring to carry out war contracts, complain that they are being asked for so many returns by different departments that their businesses have been reduced to chaos. The Government is deliberately following that policy because it desires to prove that private enterprise is a failure. It is deliberately placing every possible obstacle in the way of those engaged in business solely for the purpose of proving that State ownership is better than private enterprise. This Government has failed miserably to check rising prices. One of the first acts of the Menzies Administration - and it was done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> himself - was to appoint a Prices Commissioner to ensure that the inordinate increase of the cost of living which occurred in this country during the last war would not occur again. During the first eighteen months or two years of this war, the increase of the cost of living in Australia was less than in any other country of the British Empire, including even Great Britain itself. But what is the position to-day? Since this Government can]e into office, because of its reckless inflationary policy and wasteful expenditure, costs are rising to such a degree that the housewife is now faced with a very serious problem in balancing her household budget. It is all very well for honorable senators opposite to quote statistics and say that this item or that item has risen by only a small percentage. Most honorable senators are family men like myself, and I suggest to them that they should do the family shopping on a Saturday morning as I sometimes do. and they would know just what a difficult problem has been created for Australian housewives owing to rising costs during the past twelve months. A comparison of family household expenditure now with what it was just prior to the advent of the present Government - an administration which claims to be the friend of the under-dog and the poor man - shows that the cost of almost every domestic commodity has risen beyond all reason. For instance, compare what we have to pay the greengrocer to-day for a cauliflower or a cabbage with what these vegetables cost in 1941. These are the matters upon which the people of this country will judge honorable senators opposite at the elections. They will want an explanation of the confidence trick that has been put over them in regard to increased wages. What is the use of pretending that people are benefiting by increased wages, when the increases are more than offset by the higher cost of living and the heavier taxes imposed by this Government, despite its promise that no additional impositions would be placed upon the lower incomes? Another question that the people of this country will ask honorable senators opposite is why the Curtin Government sold itself to the militant trade unionists of this country, and withdrew the ban of illegality upon the Communist party. I point out that when that ban was lifted the Government immediately gave the Communist party licences to issue newspapers in four capital cities, but when an application was made for newsprint for these publications, it was referred to the newsprint pool. </para>

                    <para>I shall refer to the attitude of the Government and of government servants to non-unionists .in this country. I am not prepared to condemn people who do not join unions any more than I would condemn those who do. It is a matter entirely for themselves. After all, we are fighting for freedom and the right of every individual to make his own decision in regard to such matters. We on this side of the chamber do not believe in the right of the bludgeon as apparently certain honorable senators opposite do. What is the position of many non-unionists in this country at present? At the outbreak of war with the Japanese, when it became imperative to speed up war production, the Prime Minister and other Ministers rightly appealed to the people to offer their services for work in munitions factories. Many people who, in normal circumstances, would not be prepared to do such work, listened to the appeal and, wishing to play their part in the war effort, accepted jobs in factories rather than stay at home. Immediately they commenced work, the screw was put on them. First of all there was a demand that they should join unions. When the appeal was made to these people there was no mention of joining unions and paying union dues, part of which goes to the Labour party funds. They were merely asked to come to the aid of Australia by working in vital industries; but what was the result? Ten women in a Sydney factory announced recently that they were not prepared to join a union unless that union gave two undertakings; first, that it would carry on uninterrupted production for the war effort, and, secondly, that it would obey the awards of the Arbitration Court which are the laws of the land. Was that an unreasonable request? I should think it would be to the credit of any one joining a union to seek such an assurance, but what happened? The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> sent " Jock " Garden along to handle the trouble. Without wishing to give an advertisement to the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> I suggest to honorable senators that they should see a cartoon published in that journal showing " Jock " Garden, stripped to the waist, and with bulging muscles, saying, "I will fight the best woman among you ". When " Jock " Garden interviewed these women who were anxious to do their war job, he asked what the trouble was, and was informed that they would not join a union unless the assurances which I. have mentioned were given. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden</inline> became a little angry at that stage, and told them that if they did not go back to work he would find them some other jobs to do where they would be up to their necks in dirt. I admit that subsequently he denied using the expression, but looking at the incident in a quite unbiased manner, I think I would prefer to accept the version of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Cassidy,</inline> who was one of the non-unionists concerned, of what occurred. When this matter was being discussed, at about the same time, in the Legislative Council of New South Wales, one honorable gentleman, who was, I think, a Minister of the Crown of that State, referred to those women who did not join the union, and to non-unionists generally, as " loathsome toads ". That is the term he applied to people who had come forward at the request of the Labour Prime Minister, left their homes and gone to work in the factories from early in the morning until late at night if necessary, doing any sort of work that was given to them. Do honorable senators opposite think that the people of this country will stand for such Gestapo methods on the part of this or any other Government ? </para>

                    <para>I wish to refer to the way in which the Government has been handling the censorship. One thing which we, as a government, laid down when the censorship was established was that there should be no such thing as political censorship. There should be no political interference with the censorship, which should be used only for purposes of national security. I have here extracts from articles which appeared in two British newspapers, criticizing the Australian censorship. Have we reached a stage at which the censorship as such must not be criticized at all? Is the Government too frightened? </para><interjection>

                    <para>AUSTRALIAN CENSORS CAN'T TAKE IT!</para>
   
               <para class="block">A .fortnight ago <inline font-style="italic">World's Press News</inline> published a straightforward account by Noel Monks, thu war correspondent of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail,</inline> of his experiences in Australia with the political and military censorship now operating there. This pointed out that the Australian censorship was actuated by motives other than security, that it had political angles, and that the Australian Government was concerned to hide the fact that a censorship existed at all, inasmuch as correspondents were at no time allowed in any way to suggest that their messages were subjected to censorship. </para>
                <para>Monks wound up by saying that he came back with the considered conviction, after eight years' experience as a war reporter, that the Australian censorship was the worst he had ever encountered, being below the standard adopted by the Abyssinians even, in their war, and that, on the contrary, the British censorship was the best in the world for efficiency and balanced judgment. </para>
                <para>A full summary of Monks' important statement was cabled to Australia by the Australian Associated Press, as well ' as to New Zealand. </para>
                <para>Inquiries made in Australia by <inline font-style="italic">World's Press News</inline> show that Australia has lived up to the reputation given it by Noel Monks. The Australian political censorship killed Noel Monks' story. Not a word of the revelations he made of the standard of political and military control ruling in that country has been allowed to appear in print. </para>
                <para>This shows in illuminating fashion that while Australia is prepared to "give it" in criticism of British censorship she is not prepared to " take it " in relation to her own actions. </para>
                <para>The summary of Monks' interview forwarded to Now Zealand was published in that country. </para>
                <para>The implications of Australia's action are very far-reaching. It proves the truth of the charges made by Monks and makes suspect news emanating from Australia because a censorship that is partisan and secret inspires no confidence - there is nothing to distinguish it from Axis methods. </para>
                <para>Australia, with other parts of the Empire, is fighting Axis totalitarianism and restrictive policies, .but employs them in her own regime ! The attitude seems wholly inexplicable and regrettable, and is certain to boomerang against Australia's own long term interests. </para>
                <para>It is perhaps not insignificant to recall in this connection that Great  Britain  found it advisable recently to dispatch to Australia a highly placed executive of the Ministry of Information, .John do la  Valette,  formerly in the Ear East. The reason for this, it' is understood, was associated with securing a better presentation of vital news about the war to the Australian public - which, in plain language, means overcoming some angles of the mentality of censors and their political rulers, as well as liberalising newspaper treatment. The experience now reported would seem to emphasise the desirability of that educational process being accelerated. </para>

                    <para>The interview, together with that in another trade journal, was cabled to Australia by the London offices of the Australian news agencies, but the messages never reached the offices in Australia. Service messages were sent advising the Australian officers that the messages had been sent, but replies were received in London that the messages had not arrived. </para>
                    <para>They were not released by the censorship. </para>
                    <para>This in itself is striking evidence of the dictatorial powers of the Australian censorship. </para>
                    <para>Obviously the messages could not have been hold up for security reasons, as they would never have passed the censorship here. </para>

                            <para>- The greatest piece of impudence is exposed in the article from which I have been quoting. I remind honorable senators that only a few months ago a statement was made, I think during the progress of the war loan campaign, or just before it, by the Prime Minister, the Commander-in-Chief, and the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> regarding the great concentration of Japanese troops right around the islands north of Australia. I had no reason to doubt that that concentration existed, and I do not doubt for a moment that there was some ground for making the statement. It was said that it was estimated that 200,000 of the enemy were scattered along the fringe of islands to the north of Australia, ready to invade this country. The people naturally accepted that statement, yet only a few weeks later, when the general  elections were looming on the horizon, we were told that all danger of invasion of this country had passed. That is welcome news, but members of the Advisory War Council have said, that nothing has happened to justify this sudden change of view. </para>

                            <para>- The statement has been made by honorable senators on this side of the chamber who are members of the council that to the best of their knowledge no change has taken place that would justify the assertion that, the danger of invasion has passed. I hope that an optimistic view is justified, but, if the outlook is not so bright as has been pictured, the statement is most serious. Every effort must still be .put forward by everybody in this country until Australia is out of danger. Some people are inclined to be complacent, and nothing is  more calculated to induce complacency tuan over-optimistic statements. </para>

He is reported in the press as having said that he had knowledge that a portion of Queensland was to be abandoned, and that provision was to be made for defence for only a certain distance up the north coast. He said that he knew all of the circumstances. The Leader of the Senate might well ascertain if there has been a leakage of information in this instance, because I am anxious to know where

                            I was amazed to read (24/6/43) the article headed " Schoolboy breaks law by running neighbors' messages." What next will we have to face? This notice affects me greatly as a neighbor's boy of .12 used to collect my messages when he went for his mother's, for which I gave him 1/0 a week. Now his mother has stopped him. We live more than a mile from the station and the nearest shopping centre and being in ill-health I was grateful for this service. We have two young children (eldest two years and four mouths) and I am soon to have another child. My husband is in the A.I..F. (returned from oversea). If he had let me buy a small car and spend our money in comforts instead of investing it in war loans I could have faced this extra burden.

At first, tire Minister for War Organization of Industry said that men's suits should not include a. waist-coat, and that cuffs were not to be placed on trousers, but later he changed his mind. Then the Prime Minister said, that race-goers could attend race meetings on only three Saturdays a month. The service man who was able to visit the city on leave was unfortunate if his leave coincided with a raceless Saturday. So also was the munitions worker who had put in a heavy week's work in a. factory. Had the restriction in any way assisted the war effort, the position would be different, but there is no evidence that it has had that effect. I would rather see men on leave spend their time at the races than in some other ways, so long as the holding of a race meeting did not interfere with the country's war effort. I have no objection to the complete abandonment of midweek races, but I think that people should be entitled to some enjoyment at weekends. </para><para>I hope that it will not be long before the present Government, which has practised on the people its socialistic policy and economic doctrines, will soon be sent to the place where  it  belongs, and that a government which will restore to the people that freedom which the present Government has taken from them will be placed in power. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - It is said that condemned men can afford to be frank, and as I stand in the position of a condemned man, with sentence postponed until the 30th June, 1944, when some others now  in  this chamber will join me, I propose to offer a few observations, a.nd to place under the microscope, as it were, the effect that this Parliament has had on  the  public mind, and the reaction of the people to its activities during the last couple of years. At times I fear for parliamentary life in this country. I fear because we have not addressed ourselves to those problems which should have exercised the whole of our efforts and intelligence. A little less than three years ago a parliament was elected which has brought the system of parliamentary government into a measure of disrepute, ft is our bounden duty to restore the prestige of the parliamentary institution. In a little less than three years, Australia has had three Prime Ministers and three distinct governments, each endeavouring to control the country according to its own ideas, and each with indifferent  Success.  There is only one thing concerning which we have been united, and upon which every party, to the best of its ability, has concentrated, namely, loyalty to Australia's Allies in the effort to win the war. But what has happened to parliamentary government in the meantime? As a parliamentarian who has devoted his life to advancing parliamentary government in  this  country, I sometimes shudder when I think of the subservience of Parliament  to  outside organizations. I have seen a Prime Minister, whose responsibility is te the Parliament, which is the highest institution in the land, go to an outside body which is not responsible to the people for permission to do what he believed ought to have been done. In this country Parliament should be supreme, yet the present Prime Minister bowed his knee to an outside organization. In reality ' he crawled ; he was craven when he solicited from a body which was not representative of the people power to do what he conceived to be right. What greater blow could be struck at the parliamentary institution than that? After the last election, when two men who were supposed to support the government then in office failed to do so, a national government should have been formed, or, failing that, an appeal should have been made immediately to the people in order to clear the position. However, there did not emerge an individual with that greatness of mind which has characterized the leader of our kinsmen in the Old Country, who said, " We are for freedom. We are for liberty. We will have a man who will lead us to freedom and liberty - a man who will win the war for us." Compare their magnificent spirit with the paltry spirit which has been displayed in this country. One cannot help feeling that what has happened has detracted from the respect which this Parliament should command from the populace. For some time I have seen deterioration setting in. If, as I believe, we can judge the mind of the people by the various political groups which have been formed recently, we can see that this Parliament does not stand high in public esteem. We have two or three great machines for bringing men into the Parliament - and for passing them out from time to time - but there is setting in a doubt in the minds of the people as to the efficacy of the highest tribunal in the land, namely, the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. If honorable senators wish to know how Parliament is regarded by the populace to-day, they have only to ask their own followers, or, indeed, almost any individual whom they may meet. Should they do so, they will be told, in effect, by many of them that the Parliament at Canberra is something almost to be spat upon. </para>

                                may be more at home in a place governed by Rafferty's rules than in a properly conducted assembly such as we have inherited from our forebears, and such as I hope we shall maintain. The greatest blow that has ever been struck at this Parliament was struck during recent  months, when the Prime Minister approached an outside organization and asked for permission to do what he undoubtedly believed he should do. It is time that some one acted to remove from office the gang which has bowed the  knee  to an outside organization.

                            <para>- That is true.. What happened next? We saw a spectacle that must shock us. I am afraid that my friends opposite may say that the parties now in opposition were to blame. There might have been a lack of courage on their part, but there was undoubtedly opposition by the party which now sits on the treasury bench to giving to the defence of this country the foremost place in its policy. We cajoled ourselves into believing that something was to be gained by adhering to the League of Nations. We hoped that by supporting that institution a new era of peace would dawn, but we failed to face realities. For a time we embraced a doctrine which we thought was in the interests of mankind, but which eventually proved disastrous to ourselves and to our Allies, because while, in accordance with that policy, we disarmed, those who are now our enemies armed themselves to the teeth. During the years immediately prior to the war, we witnessed a deterioration in the outlook of the Parliament, in its failure to recognize that another great war was upon us, and its failure to take those steps that should have been taken. The modest efforts which were then made by the Lyons Government to recognize realities were denounced by supporters of the Government now in office as warmongering. Parliament on the whole must take the responsibility for the nakedness of this country so far as its defence at the outbreak of war is concerned. To suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies, Mr. Fadden,</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> and their Governments and supporters failed to do their duty to this country is to accuse them of betraying Australia. Now, to-day we can admit that after the war fell upon us they did their duty as they saw it. Each government that has been in office since the outbreak of war has evoked every possible power to arm and defend the country, and to help our Allies and the Mother Country in its hour of need. To say less of any of the leaders of those governments is to charge them with being traitors to the allied cause. We are in the war. Whilst governments which honorable senators on this side supported rather shrank from the ordeal of doing their duty to the country prior to the war, how was the small effort which they did make accepted by honorable senators opposite? They endeavoured to instil into the people fears about conscription. They represented conscription as something that should not be introduced. Thefirst duty of a citizen is to defend his country. Where and when that duty can best be carried out is a matter for decision by those in charge of military operations. Another deterioration, .which has become most marked during the regime of this Government is its attempt to interfere with judicial tribunals. I refer particularly to the Arbitration Court. This Government has passed regulation after regulation which in the long run can tend only to subvert the authority of the court. We know that the court already has great difficulty in preserving a proper balance, having regard to the tribunals which are appointed under various regulations, and the setting up of all sorts of committees and persons to determine wages and conditions of employment. For many years honorable senators opposite fought for the principle of industrial arbitration. To-day, by their very actions, they are subverting the Arbitration Court, and, ultimately, will bring about a state of chaos so far as our arbitration laws are concerned. </para>

                    <para>This Government, on assuming office over eighteen months ago, established a cabinet consisting of nineteen Ministers. How have they administered the affairs of the country ? Have they kept control of the public purse? Have they done anything to prevent waste from occurring? They have spent their time in trying to keep their feet on the slippery slopes of party politics. They have devoted their energies to political propaganda rather than to  the administration  of their departments. They have given to outsiders entire control over the expenditure of millions of pounds. What will the taxpayers who- are sweating blood to-day, and the worker who must put his tax stamps on his weekly wage sheet, think of such looseness of administration. To-day, without ministerial approval, sums up to £50,000 or £60,000 can be spent on adventurous experiments. The influence of industrial leaders outside this Parliament should be restricted, and ministerial approval should be insisted upon in respect of the expenditure of sums over a certain amount. When the history of this war comes to be written it will make a sad story indeed. Ministers have not devoted the whole of their efforts to the prevention of extravagance. They have devoted their efforts mainly to propaganda, and the making of specious speeches, with the object of putting the best case forward in the interests of their party. Very soon they will be obliged to give an answer to the people of this country for their failure to support a proper policy of defence. They will also be obliged to explain their grovelling to an outside organization. They will be asked to explain their legislation by regulation which, if it continues, will absolutely subvert the jurisdiction of the Arbitration. Court. What has this Government done with regard to national insurance? The National Health and Pensions Insurance Act, enacted by the Lyons Government, was based on sound principles. It was an honest measure; but it was abandoned by a government of which I was formerly a Minister. To-day, many people believe that that abandonment was forced by members of the present Government, who have now seen the writing on the wall, and have come along and said, "We will establish another insurance fund ". They propose to establish it on unsound lines. They propose to establish a trust fund under conditions which will allow a needy treasurer to transfer the whole of the fund to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Any director of an insurance company would be imprisoned if he acted along similar lines. The fund which the Government proposes to set up offers no better security for the beneficiaries than the old-age pension or the widows' pensions, because a government which finds itself in necessitous circumstances will be able to repeat what we have seen happen in the past when a government of the same political colour as that opposite wa3 obliged to reduce the rate of old age pensions. The inauguration of a scheme of national insurance is a sacred duty which this country owes not only to the people who would benefit under such a scheme, but also to itself. When one sees such a scheme planned in a loose manner, one can only come to the conclusion that there is politics behind it, and that it will not give to the people that security that they would have if the scheme were on a contributory basis and they had to contribute 6d. or ls. a week to the fund. Apparently this Government intends to wipe out entirely the great friendly societies of this country, with their 500,000 or 600,000 adherents. Those organizations are to be thrown into the discard - organizations which understand this business from end to end and could be of tremendous assistance. Instead, a bureaucracy is to be created. We are to have a new department, of some sort. Quite recently there came into this House a green-covered booklet showing the personnel of the huge number of government departments, boards, commissions, and committees which are now in existence. On top of this already vast network of authorities, there is to be imposed a new department, the National Insurance Department, it is to be called, despite the fact that the scheme is not really an insurance scheme at all, but depends upon the will of Parliament and upon the revenues of the Government. I contend that the scheme should be on a true insurance basis, so that the benefits would be ensured to the contributor just as they are at present in the case of friendly societies. I believe also that the existing friendly society organizations should be used to the fullest possible degree in the administration of any national insurance scheme. </para>
                    <para>There is one important matter about which I should like to say a word or two. Objections are being raised in many circles to the working of overtime.  Lt  is claimed that overtime is injurious to the individual and of no benefit to the body politic; yet we find that it is worked most extensively to-day - " worked " in more than one sense of the word. I admit that the great majority of the workers of this country are willing to do their best and to turn out a fair day's work; but there are others who are unwilling to do their utmost except at the penalty rates provided for overtime. There is no doubt that in time of war, overtime is an inducement to workers to go slow during ordinary hours. Something will have to be done in regard to it. Either it must be paid for at ordinary rates or it must be more strictly supervised. Up to the present, there has been a marked lack of control in that regard. </para>
                    <para>There has been a great deal of criticism in regard to the handling of primary industries by the present Government. I say to this chamber, and I shall continue to say it so long as the present state of affairs exists, that this country must look to its primary industries if its future is to be worth anything at all. The Government of this country has subscribed to the Atlantic Charter, which envisages a return to a certain measure of free trade in order that the peace of the world shall be preserved. Is that great charter to be merely an empty gesture to mankind? Is it something to be spurned when the war is over? I think not. I trust that we shall make a genuine effort to save civilization from another calamity such as the one through which we are passing. I have heard it suggested that the Atlantic Charter is a mere gesture. If that be so, then it is time that we were overcome by our enemies. Personally, I feel disposed to take the charter at its face value. It is signed by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> who, I am sure, believes earnestly that something must be done. What does the charter spell for this country? It means that Australian primary industries must build up such secondary industries as can be carried. There are many secondary industries which we can carry to-day, such as the iron and steel industry; but unless we safeguard our primary industries we shall perish. With a population of only 7,000,000 people and a productive capacity which is very small indeed compared with that of larger nations, we must face the future as realists. The most dangerous thing we can do would be to let any of our primary industries down. Apparently realizing the important part that our primary industries will play in post-war reconstruction, the Government already has taken certain stop-gap measures in regard to some of them, notably the dairying industry, but intensive planning for the future must be undertaken now. I do not fear that the wheat industry will suffer very much in the immediate postwar period. In fact it may enjoy a period of great prosperity, but ultimately we shall reach the stage when China, the greatest producer of wheat in the world, and Russia, the second greatest producer, will again be in full production. We must establish in this country industries that will depend for their development upon our primary products such .as wheat, wool, iron and so on, otherwise we shall have a very thin time indeed. When one looks at the condition of many of our primary industries today, one can only come to the conclusion that some of our controlling authorities are far astray. It is popularly supposed that curtailment of production is a good thing; I contend that it is not good, either in theory or in practice. It is the greatest fallacy that has ever been accepted by mankind. Whether it is by men working with their hands in the factories, or by men on the farm, all production, after all is said and done. is really the wealth of the country. To reduce that wealth is to injure the body politic as a whole and the individual in the body politic indirectly. Therefore, all this reduction of production, in any shape or form, and even this control of production by the Government, is injurious. </para>

                            <para>- Is there such a thing as private monopolies in this country? I am afraid that the Minister is letting his metaphysical mind run riot. Private monopolies so called have been the most beneficial agencies that Australia has ever had. -What better instance could there be than the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which I suppose honorable senators opposite will call a monopoly? That company has really saved Australia. It is exporting to-day at a price that would surprise them. They cannot point to anything  governmentallycontrolled  that would compare with private industry in well-developed management, experience, wisdom, and the power to produce things. When one travels over this country as I travelled a little while ugo, and sees the people of Melbourne short of barley, one wonders what is wrong. The domestic life of the country is impaired by the shortage of barley, yet on Yorke Peninsula, in South Australia., millions of bags of barley are stacked. The weevils are just beginning to show their appreciation of its quality, and unless something is done soon in that direction there will be a considerable loss of a most valuable food product. That sort of thing is going on all round us. One glaring example i3 the wastage of good apples. Hundreds of soldiers are camped near the orchards, yet the apples are rotting on the ground, being dug in, or eaten by pigs. Surely there is in authority some one who is big enough, and not always  thinking of the political side of things, to detail an officer to give the necessary instructions to the commanding officers of military camps so that the men may go out and assist the growers of apples and oranges to gather and market their products. In the cities hundreds nf people are rounded up and bluffed by the man-power authorities, and sent all over the place, yet a very simple order from the Government to the military authorities would solve a great part of the problem. I am sure they would be only too glad to let the troops from the various camps assist the primary producers in their perplexities and difficulties, in areas like Renmark, Mildura and other producing centres, and in States like Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria, where the bulk of the apples and oranges are grown. I have no interest to serve other than Australia's interest, but this ha3 been a calamitous government, which has reduced the status of Parliament. Therefore, let us go forth on to the hustings and try to instil in the minds of the people the confidence which they should have in their parliamentary institutions. Let us tell them that we believe in Australia, and that we are not here simply to sling mud at one another or to grovel in the gutter. Let us assure them that we are not going to traduce military officers or divulge military secrets; those are the practices of others, and should not characterize the members of deliberative assemblies such as this chamber and the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan remarked in the early part of his speech that the Government was in a mess. That remains to be seen.  His  colleagues in their speeches were, guilty of what he described in his closing remarks as slinging mud. If any mudslinging  has gone on it was done by honorable senators opposite during the early part of this debate. They may think that that sort of propaganda is the way to win an election, but I believe that it is the other way round, and that they will lose by it. If they stoop below garbage tins to get dirt to throw at a government which has been doing a wonderful job, they will find that they are only injuring themselves. The remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> and other Opposition speakers were shameful, particularly in a time of war, and with conditions existing in Australia as they are to-day. If honorable senators opposite do not make all that sort of stuff up. themselves, they must get it from some of their leaders elsewhere. I am satisfied that they do not mean what they say, and it is very noticeable that those who are the most bitter are those who do not go before the people on this occasion. I should not think so much of it if it came from those who go before the electors within the next few months, but honorable senators on this side form the great majority of those who are due to retire. I ask honorable senators opposite to throw their minds back to the last general elections. If they look up <inline font-style="italic">Han.sard</inline> of those days they will find that we never threw dirt at them as they are throwing it at the present Government. We never spoke on the eve of that election as they are doing now. A great deal of mud has been slung at the Labour party, particularly in the House of Representatives, concerning " Eddie " Ward. Some of the remarks that have been made in this chamber against him have been such that the honorable senators who made them must have got them from under a garbage tin, and that is the place that they come from. Any man who speaks in that way about a Minister who tries to do his duty by his country, as the Minister for Labour and National Service has done, can have no higher origin. What the honorable senator said was simply political scandal. The debate in this chamber has shown that honorable senators on the other side are simply kith and kin of members of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, who spoke on the motion of want of confidence. The worst abuse has usually come from members of the House of Representatives, and it has been remarked time after time that honorable senators never behave so badly as the members of the other House, but the statements made during this debate have been worse than those made in the other House. </para>

                    <para>I wish to refer to my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> Before he went to the war I had a good opinion of him, although he crossed swords with me several times. I find now that he is like many others who <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> overseas and come back with different opinions. He has been away for most of the time this Government has been in power, and he knew nothing of its actions, yet when he returned he spoke of it as badly as any one could speakabout any government. That is true of his speech last night in this chamber. He has somersaulted. Something has gone wrong with him. He said that the soldiers were dissatisfied with the Government, but I have relatives who have been to the war, and they have told me that when the soldiers knew that " Jack " Curtin had been made Prime Minister they cheered and cheered all along the lines. That is a fact which honorable senators opposite cannot deny. Iwas surprised at the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> and I do not believe that he really meant what he said.  His  attitude to the Government was altogether different before he went to the war. Some Australians, after going abroad, return to Australia with swollen heads. One who will not do that is the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> Honorable senators opposite would be glad to have a few Cur tins and Evatts on their side of the chamber. Nobody has done so much for Australia in a few weeks as has the Minister for External Affairs. I take off my hat to him, and so will the. people of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> referred to what the Government should do for returned members of the fighting services. He said that no man should be discharged until employment had been found for him. I remind him that, when speaking on the Appropriation Bill in September, 1942, I made a similar statement. I said that every man should remain on the Army pay-roll until he was provided with a job. </para>

                        <para>There was a great need, said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> to build houses to make up for the shortage already existing before the war, but made more acute on account of the war-time necessity to restrict building operations. These homes must be built at a price which will bring them within the income of the average worker. This work will have to be undertaken in the country as well as in the city. </para>

                    <para>The honorable senator also referred to housing. We are told that there is a shortage of 250,000 houses in Australia. We shall have to build 50,000 houses a year for five years, and they could be erected at a cost of £800 each. As it is necessary for Australia to have a population of 20,000,000 in order to make this country safe, houses will have to be provided for all who need them, and this would give work to tradesmen of various kinds. </para>

                            <para>- During the terms of the Menzies and Fadden Governments not a single dwelling was built by those Governments. A house should be erected for every couple who desire to marry, and in order to encourage marriages they should be advanced a lump sum to be repaid over a period of years, varying in accordance with the increase of family responsibilities. As this country needs a population of 20,000,000 people, that is one way to get it. Such a housing scheme would provide work for hundreds of thousands of men from the fellers of the trees to the carpenters, bricklayers and others who would be engaged in the actual construction of the buildings. </para>

                    <para>The debate on this bill indicates that the forthcoming election campaign will be a dirty fight. There has been so much mud slung at the Government that it would appear that instead of a dignified election campaign it will be a case of " clogs on and gloves off ". However, there need be no fear that there will be any dirty fighting in Western Australia; the people of that State do not believe in such things. Earlier to-day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> indulged in an outburst of abuse against the Government. Metaphorically speaking, he tore the Government to pieces. The honorable senator does not know what is happening in the State that he assists to represent, because instead of residing in that State, he resides in Sydney. In the United States of America a senator must live in his electorate. Western Australian senators would not he affected by any such rule in this country; and when the Senate rises it will not be long before they are all on their way back to their own State. </para>

Honorable senators opposite are annoyed because the Labour party has not agreed to participate in a national government; but how could members of the Opposition work in harmony with any one else when they cannot agree among themselves? It is difficult to say how many parties are represented by honorable senators opposite. I do not blame the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> for trying to retain the leadership of the United Australia party.  Lt  was for a similar reason that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> recently moved a motion of want of confidence in the Government; he does not wish to be robbed of his position. The Leader of the Opposition in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> also is in a similar position, and that is why a short time ago he charged the Labour party with being under the domination of the " red " element in the party. According to the honorable senator, the Prime Minister had not the courage, the power, or the desire, to oppose that element, but sits back quietly and does nothing. Such remarks do not tend to create that unity which is a vital necessity in the nation at the present time. It is interesting to find the old stalking horse of a national government being put through its paces. How could any one agree with an honorable senator who has filled so many positions as the Leader of the Opposition has occupied ? When he was in Western Australia some time ago a leading newspaper in that State, the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian Worker</inline> pointed out that during his eight years in the Senate, he had filled the following positions: - Member of the first Australian War Cabinet, Minister for Trade and Customs, Minister for Commerce, Minister for Supply and Development, Minister for Repatriation, Postmaster-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- There are more vehicles running on producer-gas in Western Australia than in any other State. The Opposition also attacked the Scully plan for the control of the wheat industry, but that plan has won universal approval among wheat-growers, which is more than can be said of any plan introduced by previous governments, yet the Opposition claims to be the farmer's friend. The present Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> also got a better price for wool than has been obtained previously. Compared with previous years, the return from 1,000 bags of wheat last season represented an increase of £220 to each farmer. He also received 2d. per lb. more for his wool. Previous governments were not interested in helping the primary producers. The Labour party is the true friend of the farmer. I could never understand why the primary producers should support the United Australia party; if they supported the Labour party they would do better for themselves and all concerned. Many farmers in Western Australia frankly admit that they have obtained greater benefits under a Labour government than from any other government. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators opposite continue to repeat the parrot-cry of inflation, and the danger of utilizing national credit to finance the war, but I say that if the parties opposite get into power they will impose heavier taxes on the people instead of using national credit. </para>
                    <para>The issue which will be before the electors within a few weeks will be whether they will entrust the solution of post-war problems to those who have consistently advocated reforms which are now universally acclaimed, or to those who were blind to a similar opportunity after the last war, when anti-Labour governments bred a depression. The people do not want a repetition of those times, and so they will support the Labour party. I believe that the suffering during that period was more severe in the eastern States than in Western Australia, but the people of this country will not again submit to such conditions. Instead of providing full employment for the people after the last war, an antiLabour administration handed Australia over to an imported " big four " of financiers who fashioned a policy which resulted in thousands of employees being thrown out of work. The nation was handed over to the private banks. We do not want that to occur again. </para>

The present Prime Minister and his Government have acted in the interests of the whole of the people of Australia. The proposal to evacuate Geraldton did not take into account the inability of the nation to transport the evacuees or to find accommodation for them elsewhere. I am indeed thankful that the Prime Minister has been able to say that Western Australia is now safer than it was a short time ago. He made that statement on information supplied to him from military head-quarters. Although this matter may not greatly concern honorable senators personally, it does affect their wives and children who are happier than they were twelve months ago. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clothier</inline> that we should endeavour to keep the debate as clean as possible. Like him, I deplore dirty insinuations, inferences, half-truths and untruths. For that reason I deplore what transpired in this chamber last night, when an honorable senator levelled charges against another honorable senator who is serving in this war. It was a most pitiable and wretched display, and it hurt me greatly. The statement made last night was similar to a statement made about three years ago when that honorable senator charged his colonel and other officers, including the adjutant, and subalterns in the 18th Australian Battalion of the old Australian Imperial Force with having been cashiered and dismissed from the service for cowardice. That statement was utterly untrue; but it was ventilated in this chamber. An attack like that which was made last night by one honorable senator upon another is very deplorable and dirty. "We live in an island continent, and, in the main, we are inclined to look inwards instead of outwards. Australia is off the beaten track,  and I think that Australians who have not travelled or lived in other countries are inclined to get the idea that Australia is the only " pebble on the beach ". Therefore, it is very interesting, and sometimes illuminating, to get the other fellow's point of view. I recall that about thirteen years ago, when I had a little job of work to do in Canberra, I spent an afternoon in the company of two gentlemen from Japan. They were educated men who were out here on business. I had met them previously in Melbourne. I took them into the House of Representatives, and they were intensely interested in the proceedings. They stayed there for about two and a half hours that afternoon. Afterwards, I took them to see some of the showplaces in Canberra. Later, when we were having refreshments, one of them said .to me, " How is it that you have so many coolies in your parliament?" I replied, " Coolies ? We have no coolies in Australia." And he rejoined, " Oh, yes, you have. I saw quite a number of them this afternoon in the parliament." I was rather incensed at that remark, but that was his point of view. That was the way he summed us up, although he was not very nattering. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>We have heard much talk in this chamber about who is to blame for this and who is to blame for that. I think that we ourselves had much to do with the Jap coming into the war when he did. For many years we had been encouraging Japanese aggression. Labour had abolished compulsory military training. We had cut down our defence pre-  parations  to the bone. Even after the outbreak of this war, there were men in this country who were utterly opposed to the raising of the Australian Imperial Force, or to sending any troops overseas. They were bitterly opposed to raising forces compulsorily for training in their own country. Would not such an attitude give an astute, war-like people like the Japanese the idea that a great many people in this country were decadent, and that when Australia was put to the test in battle we would not fight? It is a poor dog that will not fight for its own bone; and Australians are not lacking in pugnacity, or courage. But to ask men, however brave and tough they may be, to enter battle without proper training and preparation is a crime. We had another spectacle. Our compulsorily raised troops were not to go outside the territories of Australia. I have in my hand an issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Johannesburg Star</inline> dated the 6th February. As 1 said earlier, it is interesting to get the other fellow's point of view, and with that object in mind I propose to quote from this paper, which expresses the view of a great many people in our sister dominion. The Union of South Africa has many problems, such as the racial and language problems, which we have been spared; and about 40 years ago Britons and Dutchmen were fighting for supremacy in that country. On the 5th February of this year the Prime Minister of South Africa, Field Marshal Smuts, moved in the South African Parliament a motion known as the " Outside Africa motion ". That motion was passed, and the report in the newspaper mentioned on that debate is headed, " Senate Passes Outside Africa Motion. Little Opposition to Sending Troops Overseas." The motion was passed in the Senate of the Union of South Africa by 21 votes to 6. In the same issue of that newspaper, a leading article which attracted my attention, gives a good line on what the people of that dominion are thinking. This article is entitled, "Australia's Tied Hands ". When the Senate of the Union of South Africa was considering that motion to provide that their troops, if necessary, could go outside the continent of Africa, or, in short, go wherever they were needed, we in Australia had passed the very pitiful measure known as the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Bill. The leading article to which I refer reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Because of his insistence upon remaining Prime Minister in a Labour administration, rather than appeal to the country for a mandate as head of a National Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> is sponsoring a measure in the Australian Parliament which threatens to produce the extraordinary anomaly of American troops fighting to defend Australia in territory in which the Commonwealth Government will not allow its own compulsorily recruited Militia to fight. The American Expeditionary Force is compulsorily recruited on a selective basis. It is liable for service in any theatre of war, and its members are already fighting in Europe, Africa, India and China, as well as the South-West Pacific. If the Australian Militia Bill is passed, Commonwealth troops fighting side by side with the Americans may be withdrawn immediately the combined forces have thrust the enemy beyond a very limited arc. </para>
                        <para>This situation, which is hardly likely to ensure a sympathetic hearing in the United States for repeated Australian appeals for further aid, is entirely political in origin and results from the vigorous use of unexpected power by a minority. A strong isolationist element developed in the Australian Labour Party after the end of the last war. Whether that element actually dominates the party at present is uncertain, but it is 'obviously sufficiently powerful to extract concessions from a Prime Minister whose record does not suggest that he is in sympathy with the policy he is now pursuing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cur'tin's</inline> Government has only a narrow majority. It must be accepted as representative of a slender margin of Australian public opinion, but as the whole of the Labour Party is not isolationist, it would be unfair to accuse the entire Australian .people of willingness to allow others to do their fighting for them, if that fighting takes place more than a few hundred miles from the Australian mainland. </para>
                        <para>There is a marked inconsistency in this demand for a narrow limit to be set on the liability for service abroad and the attitude adopted by Australian spokesmen before the outbreak of war with Japan. Up to a little over a year ago, it was claimed in most vigorous terms that Malaya was the Commonwealth's first line of defence. Singapore was not a remote outpost, but the key to the whole Australian position. It had to be held at all costs, and more than 20,000 Australian troops were sent to help in the task of holding it. They were supremely confident and their principal complaint in the months preceding the Japanese attack arose from boredom. The full story of the disaster which resulted when the blow did fall is not yet known, but there is abundant evidence that the loss of Singapore was a tremendous shock not only to Australian security, but to Australian pride. A vital point in the defensive system had been lost and between 17,000 and 18,000 Australians had fallen into the hands of the enemy. </para>
                        <para>There followed a brief period in which Java was substituted for Malaya as the Commonwealth's extreme frontier. When that country, and later Timor and islands still nearer to the Australian mainland were overrun, there developed a deep sense of grievance among many people in Australia. The country had contributed generously to the common cause. Expeditionary forces had been sent to the Middle as well as the Par East, and the only reward was a direct threat of invasion, a situation infinitely more perilous than anything previously known in the nation's history. The feeling that Australia had been let down was exploited by the isolationist element in the Labour Party, and Australian troops still outside the Commonwealth were recalled to their homeland. The argument was heard that Britain had failed Australia in not providing forces powerful enough to hold the outposts of Java and Malaya, therefore the obvious course for Australia was to withdraw within her own borders and think only of herself. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin's</inline> failure to issue a conclusive challenge to the proponents of this view is responsible for his present dilemma, and the only solution of the problem is a belated acceptance of the need for including party politics among the luxuries that must go into the discard when the enemy is at the gates. </para>

                    <para>That article gives us some idea of the repercussions abroad of events that happen in this country. As I said earlier, we are inclined to be somewhat self-centred and a little insular in our outlook. We are an island continent. I quote that report te show honorable senators the different view that is held by some people in regard to matters that are happening in this country and their repercussions. </para>
                    <para>There has been quite a lot of criticism of this Government; there was a tremendous volume of criticism of the shortlived Fadden  Administration,  although it seems to me that to blame the Fadden Government for anything that has happened is rather rough, in view of the fact that it held office for only four or five weeks; and there was considerable criticism of the Menzies Government, some of which was deserved and some undeserved. However, I understand that post  mortems  are always smelly affairs, and I do not wish to hold one now. Instead, I shall touch on a few matters which I consider to be of real interest. On my travels I carry with me a little red notebook, in which I record little incidents that I do not wish to forget, or which I consider to be of outstanding importance. </para>

I am extremely pleased that before long this Government will have to account for its sins to the people, because I can assure honorable senators opposite that for some time now the cry has been going up, " How long 0 Lord, how long?" Any one who stops to think must entertain some very serious thoughts and fears about the future of this country under the present Administration. It has been, from the outset, a fluke government, and ever since it came into  office  - I shall not say into power, because that would be a misnomer - it has been kept alive on sufferance by one sportsman- who, I have no doubt, is of the firm opinion that he is the finest person into which the Almighty ever put breath. Incidentally, 1 point out that as soon as any government is born it begins to die, just as human beings, from the moment of their birth are moving towards their death. No matter how good a government may be, or how long it may reign, it is a dying government. Throughout the entire term of office of this Administration there has been political turmoil and favouritism, backing and filling at the behests of the unions, kow-towing to communists and law-breaking strikers, and concessions to political clamour, even when the country's industrial and economic safety have been jeopardized thereby. We have seen the deplorable spectacle of the Prime Minister going to the trade union organization of this country - an outside junta - before making decisions. Particularly was that the case on the most important question of sending our soldiers outside the borders of Australia. There have been innumerable cases in which the interests of service men have had to take second place to the utter selfishness of undisciplined wharf labourers and other unionists, especially in the great State of New South Wales. I can see only ruin if a government of this type is permitted to carry on in this reckless way. In many ways, it is squandering the Commonwealth's inheritance; the inheritance of great principles of freedom of enterprise, private enterprise, freedom of speech and action, and the right to decide how one will work, for whom one will work, and the volume of work that one will do. There are many people in this country, even to-day, who would like to be able to choose just how they will work, for whom they will work, and the amount of work that they will do. Then there is our inheritance of British justice, which also is in grave danger. No right thinking person, who has read the daily newspapers during the last few weeks, has not had that in his mind constantly. It is a most serious and wicked thing. The rights of minorities, which, after all, have rights as well as majorities, are held in utter contempt, unless, of course, those minorities happen to be strongly organized or truculent bodies. Another doctrine that has been preached by members of this Government is that of class hatred - as if there could be class hatred in a country such as Australia, in which more than 90 per cent, of the inhabitants are workers. Class hatred and industrial friction are being generated by the larrikin element in the Cabinet. </para>

                    <para>I should like to know from honorable senators opposite if the attacks upon and interference with industry and finance are to continue. That is a question which has to be answered and which in the forthcoming campaign will be a matter of the first importance. There is grave danger in a political policy which discourages greater production per man and per unit of cost, because when we are through with this wretched business of war there is going to' be a lot of licking of wounds. It is a tremendous problem which will take the combined wisdom of the leading men of all the nations. I suggest that, if the Atlantic Charter means anything, we shall have to compete for trade with other countries. In this country some have been so long engaged, particularly on the union side, in trying to reduce output when working for private bosses that some unionists now seem to use the same tactics in government factories with very disastrous results. </para>

Unless we can increase production there will not be much chance after the war of a successful export trade, because we cannot continually export at a loss. I believe and I think it is true that living standards depend on the volume of our production more than anything else, and that comes down to the output of the individual. A go-slow policy is fatal. </para>

                            <para>- It is not an old tune but a fact. We shall not get the best results until we have achieved unity of parties and cut out all this nonsense. Under the stress of war the utter fallacy of Labour economics has been quickly revealed. No government in this country has ever had greater powers than this Government has under the National Security Act. By virtue of the defence powers, and its war powers generally, it can do almost anything. Yet with the greatest powers ever wielded by any  Australian  government, .it has failed to produce anything but a costly, cumbersome and inflationary war effort that threatens the economic stability of the Commonwealth. The fun of it all is that private enterprise has had to come to the rescue time and time again. Ministerial misrepresentation has been flagrant. </para>

                    <para>To-day we saw a film which was sheer propaganda. The first film shown was a very good one, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The second was nothing but propaganda of a low kind, making use of the men who went overseas and fought, suffered and died, although if this Government had had any voice in it no man would have gone overseas, and there would have been no Australian Imperial Force. To trade on it, as is done in the stuff that we saw to-day, is getting down pretty low. We have heard talk <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> of a 100 per cent, war effort, but does anybody in this chamber believe that Australia up till now has made a 100 per cent, war effort, when we have had nothing but hold-ups and continual strikes? There are too many friends of Hitler in this country. Any man or woman who strikes during war is aiding Hitler, and is Hitler's friend. But this has gone on, and these perpetual strikes, particularly in the coalmines, lead me to think that there is more behind this unrest than mere dissatisfaction with conditions. I suggest that it is the bounden duty of the Government to rout out these sinister figures that may be in the background and are causing this trouble. Let us know who they are, and deal with them for what they are. There will be no remedy until Australia has a government courageous enough to tackle this strike sedition drastically. If it is not tackled, it will persist to the benefit of our enemies. </para>
                    <para>We have in this country three armies. We have the civil population, and we have our servicemen, and the third army that we have has been growing by leaps and bounds ever since the war started. The Government is building up a tremendous bureaucracy in the shape of commissions, boards, committees and controllers of all sorts. We must of course have plans, and we must have control in time of war, but I am afraid that this system and these people will become so well dug in and entrenched that, when hostilities cease, we shall find ourselves absolutely shackled and chained, and discover that we have lost the very thing for which we have been fighting. </para>

                        <para>. - It would be well at this stage to deal with first things first. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> has, like other members of the Opposition, used the old cries of strikes, compulsory unionism and suchlike things in an endeavour to criticize this Government. He has advocated a national government, which has been dealt with over and over again in this Parliament. He has referred to Great Britain and its national government but, despite the fact that Canada has been cited extensively in this debate, and that New Zealand and the good deeds of its Labour Government have been referred to, he and his colleagues have failed to mention the fact that there are no national governments in those two countries. I should like the electors to ask themselves what would be the possibility of a contented parliament or an efficient government in this country, after the display that -we have seen this week in our National Parliament. "We have seen some of the most tragic affairs in the history of this Parliament, and I shall refer to them before I sit down. Last night we heard over the air, and this morning we read in the press, an indictment of the Prime Minister of Australia by the Bight Honorable William Morris Hughes. Every Prime Minister in the United Nations, even including M. Stalin, has been commended by the other side for the work he has done in the war, but the Australian Prime Minister has been forgotten. If a national government were formed it would include, I take it, the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and it would surely include the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and also the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> I assume that that would be part of the composition of any national government. </para>

When the National Service Group was formed it comprised, I understand, seventeen members of the Opposition. It was apparent that the United Australia party and the United Country party had been split into fragments, yet the parties opposite ask the Labour party to form a national government. What did that outstanding figure in Australian political history, the right honorable member for North Sydney, say about a former Prime Minister under whom he had served as a Minister ? </para>

The Menzies and Fadden governments were in office for over two years, but did they then speak about the necessity for one army? Not at all.

Yet the Opposition invites honorable senators on this side of the chamber to join a national government. I hope that there will be no attempt by the Opposition to make political capital out of the fact that the Labour party- has declined to be associated with such a government. It has been in office for twenty months, although it relies upon the support of two independents, who support it because they know that it is doing a good job. For the first two years of the war the present Government and its supporters were in opposition, but we were told last night that we were responsible for Australia's unpreparedness for war. I remind the present Opposition that for the last 25 years anti-Labour governments have been in office almost continuously, and therefore, the blame for Australia's unpreparedness for war at the outbreak of hostilities cannot be laid at the door of the Labour party. The indictment should be levelled against those who were in power prior to the war and during its early stages. I remind the Opposition that when it was in power it reduced the soldiers' pay from 8s. to 5s. a day, thus repudiating a promise made to them. I refer honorable senators- to the following report in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 16th November, 1939, page 1201, of a statement made by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron).</inline> He did not take part in the campaign to obtain recruits. He said that he did not favour voluntary service but believed in conscription. He has always adhered to his convictions and I give him credit for doing so. The report reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">After members of Parliament had called for recruits the pay was reduced from 8s. to 5s. a day. </para>
                    <para>I now intend to refer to the pay of members of the Services as compared with members of the Civil Constructional Corps. The statement that ?12 a week has been paid to a " billy boy" is absurd. The rates of pay of members of the 'Civil Constructional Corps are fixed by Judge O'Mara. During the first two years of the war we had the spectacle of organizations being established for the purpose of collecting funds for the support of the dependants of the men overseas. I am glad to say that that state of affairs has been abolished. In September, 1939, a private was paid ?4 4s. per week; a corporal ?5 12s. and a sergeant ?5 19s. Those amounts are calculated on the basis of 5s. a day for a private, 2s. deferred pay, 33. for a wife, ls. for the first child and ls. for the second child, a total of 12s. a day. On the 26th September, 1941, on the same basis a private received ?4 lis. a week, a corporal ?5 19s. and a sergeant ?6 6s. When the Curtin Government took office on the 7th November, 1941, the rates of pay on the same basis were ?5 12s. a week for a private, ?7 for a corporal and ?7 7s. for a sergeant. But on the 8th August, 1942, those rates were increased to ?6 6s. for a private, ?7 14s. for a corporal and ?8 ls. for a sergeant. Those amounts are free of income tax. The Government has remitted to the men and women in the fighting services income tax to the amount of ?21,000,000. Let us see how their pay compares with that of members of the Civil Constructional Corps. A single man working in that Corps receives ?5 10s. a week. After paying taxes amounting to 17s. a week, his net wage is ?4 3s. a week. A man with a wife and without children receives the same gross payment, but his taxes amount to only 10s. a week, so that his net earnings are ?5 a week. Should he have a child also, his income after paying a tax of 5s. 3d. a week, amounts to ?5 4s. 9d. a week. A man with a wife and two children receives ?5 15s. a week, from which 3s. tax is deducted, leaving him with ?5 12s. It is clear from those figures that a private soldier who, in addition to his pay, receives his keep and his clothing, is not in so unfavorable position as the honorable senator would have us believe. </para>

                    <para class="block">Government came into office Western Australia was undefended. There was a time when there was a shortage of 9,000 rifles in that .State. It is useless to have men to defend a country if they have no weapons with which to defend it. </para>
                    <para>Many statements have been made about the food supplies in this country. It has been stated that Australia has not fulfilled its promises to the United Kingdom, but that is not correct. Speaking recently to a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> Lord Woolton, British Minister for Food, said that Australia had not failed to keep its promises to the British Ministry of Food. That disposes of the charge that the Curtin Government has not met Australia's obligations to Great Britain, and I hope that the last has now been heard of a canard which can only bring discredit to Australia in the eyes of the world and adversely affect this country in the post-war period, when markets for our produce must be found. If I had to choose between the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> and the statement of Lord Woolton, I should prefer to accept the latter. There have been many difficulties in maintaining adequate supplies of foodstuffs, particularly in relation to obtaining the necessary machinery. In addition to providing its fighting services with necessary foodstuffs, Australia has contracted to feed the members of allied forces in the South-West Pacific Area. The difficulties have been similar to those which confronted a previous government in connexion with machine tools in the early stages of the war. No government can control nature, and, should droughts come, or pests cause damage, the government of the day should not be asked to accept the blame. I claim that the present Government has a wonderful achievement to its credit in maintaining food supplies for our own fighting services, the allied services, civilian needs, and in sending food to the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>The supply of towels (Terry type) for the services as well as for civilians is dependent on the production of the four towel weaving mills in Australia. Towels for civilian usage have for some time past been in acute short supply for the reason that service demands have been heavy and therefore the available quantities for civilians have been restricted. Drastic rationing of towels prevails in the United Kingdom and supplies are not available for export. </para>

                    <para>I have tried to indicate the difficulties confronting the Government, and to make it clear that restrictions have been imposed on the people not because of any desire on the part of the Government but because the country's needs demanded them. If the Government had not been prepared to impose these restrictions the Government would have failed in its duty and the Opposition would have been the first to complain. One member of the Cabinet has been singled out for special attack. I refer to the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> who has done a difficult job well. He is the pivot on which the regimentation of the commodities which I have mentioned depends, and when I find that he has been selected for special criticism it is natural to trace that criticism to its source. I find that it emanates from those controlling the banking institutions of this country because the present Government took steps to prevent them from doing what they did during the last war. Honorable senators will recall that a royal commission disclosed that the banks then made profits of 15 or 16 per cent. Because the present Government would not allow them to repeat that performance, and issued regulations requiring them to divert certain of their assets to the Commonwealth Bank, those interested in private banks were displeased. I have no doubt that in the forthcoming election campaign the private banks and other financial institutions will do their utmost to defeat the Government. </para>

                    <para>What Nationalisation Would Mean. </para>
                    <para>MELBOURNE, Monday.- Nationalisation of banking meant destruction of the existing successful system of trading banks without evidence of thought as to how, if at all, it could be replaced, the  chairman  of Associated Banks of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> J. McConnan, said in an address to the Constitutional Club to-day. </para>
                    <para>There was only one reason why a political element desired to nationalise trading banks, he said. These politicians wanted for their own purposes control of the people's money - the ?450,000,000 at present in the care of the banking system. </para>
                    <para>Control of people's money would be a big Btep towards achievement of the first plank of the Labour platform, " socialisation of the means of production, distribution, and exchange ". That step towards complete socialisation and regimentation of the individual was the mecca of all good Communists, and also of Fascists. </para>

                        <para>With all this in mind, I had come to the conclusion that something definite must be done by the banks, but I was forestalled at a recent meeting of the banks by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McConnan</inline> (National Bank) making the same proposition.  His  idea is that something in the nature of an expanded " Sound Finance League " with a properly equipped staff including a competent publicist and an economist of note should be heavily subsidised by the banks. This body would publish articles and broadcast them through the Press everywhere, by radio, etc. It would enter into any controversy - newspaper or otherwise, and by extensive propaganda, endeavour to educate public opinion on sound lines. The idea is that it should be purely in the national interests - our selfish interest is interlocked with this. </para>

The cost may be between ?20.000 and ?30,000 a year, or even more, but spread among the banks that is nothing if it means our survival as independent trading banks and the education of the electors on lines which we think are right. The money will be well spent. </para>

                    <para>When vested interests decide to get rid of a government that will not fall into line with them, they pick out for attack those Ministers who have had the most unpopular work to do. The Minister for War Organization of Industry is being singled out for attack by these institutions because he has had an unpopular job. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McConnan</inline> this campaign on the part of the banks has already commenced, and they are prepared to spend ?30,000 or more in order to defeat this Government. Under the regulations to which I refer the associated banks have diverted to the Commonwealth Bank surplus deposits totalling ?104,000,000. On that sum the associated banks will draw interest at the rate of 15s. per cent. The transfer of those deposits is in itself evidence of what would have happened had these regulations not been implemented. A position similar to that which arose in the last war would have recurred. The private banks would now be building up a superstructure of credit, and declaring dividends of 15 or 16 per cent, as they did during the last war. Incidentally, I point out that since the date on which the regulations came into force, the primary producers of this country have deposited up to £33,000,000 with, the private banks. I have endeavoured to present a picture with respect to rationing. I am aware of the complaints that are made in that respect, but it cannot be said that any individual in the community is suffering under the scheme for the rationing of butter. I pay a tribute to the women in our capital cities who voluntarily give their services daily in canteens providing for the welfare of soldiers on leave. </para>
                    <para>I am able to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham</inline> that some time ago I took up the matter to which he referred with respect to the dispute between the Australian Wheat Board and the bulk-handling authority. That is primarily a matter for the board. However, I have had a look at the agreement. It provides that disputes be referred to an arbitrator. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> offered to secure the services of a judge of the Supreme Court of the State to arbitrate in this particular dispute, but the bulk-handling authority would not agree to that. However, the agreement provides that a local solicitor, or legal man, may be appointed to act as arbitrator, and I understand that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has again offered to refer the matter to arbitration. I am not aware of the views of both parties on that proposal. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham</inline> will admit that I am as anxious as he is to see that a fair deal is meted out to Western Australian wheat-growers in this matter. </para>

                        <para>.- To say that I am disappointed with the debate on the bill is to put my view very mildly indeed. I know, as honorable senators generally know, that on the first reading of a bill which the Senate may not amend, honorable senators may speak upon almost any subject. That opportunity has been fully exploited during this di bate. The Government is very anxious that the bill be passed as soon as possible. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">I promised the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> that we would conclude our consideration of it about this hour. However, that does not now seem to be possible, because other honorable senators wish to speak after me. I shall not detain the Senate for very long, but, as Leader of the Senate, it is essential that I make certain remarks. </para>
                    <para>First. there is the general election for which all arrangements are now in train. Honorable senators opposite have suggested that we should not have an election while we are at war. The fact of the matter is that the Commonwealth Constitution provides that we must have a general election every three years, and we cannot alter the Constitution without carrying such a proposal at a referendum. Admittedly, the Constitution contains a proviso which enables the Commonwealth Government to apply to the Imperial Government to interfere in our affairs in order to give us the opportunity to carry on without an election beyond the ordinary term of the Parliament. However, no real Australian would suggest that we should take advantage of that proviso. We are quite competent to order our own affairs. We enjoy equal status with every other member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators opposite have repeatedly urged that we should agree to the formation of a national government. I have no intention of dealing at length with that suggestion. The unedifying spectacle which, has been witnessed in this chamber during the last two days makes it for ever impossible for the Labour party to participate in the formation of a national government. I say with respect to honorable senators opposite, that the Labour party, the Labour movement and this Government have always tried, at any rate, to be clean and honest; and in any association with honorable senators opposite in the formation of a national government we should be obliged obviously to abandon the pleasant outlook we have always cherished. Honorable senators opposite have said that the workers of this country have refused to subscribe to war loans. With all the class hatred and bitterness of which they are capable, they have said repeatedly that the workers of this country are slackers so far as war loans are  concerned. The very opposite is the truth. It is true that only a limited number of people have subscribed to war loans, and that very few members of the working class are included in that number. It is the mortgage banks, the pastoral companies, the great life assurance companies that invest  large  amounts in Commonwealth loans. Where do those organizations get their money from ? The two first-mentioned classes wring it out of the primary producers, whilst the great insurance companies get their money from the workers of this country, who, because they have never had economic security, have been obliged to keep themselves poor in order to pay life assurance premiums so that when they die they will avoid a pauper's funeral. But despite the fact that honorable senators opposite have never given the workers a chance of reasonable security, they twit the workers because they do not appear in the list of persons who subscribe £1,000 and over to war loan's. Who buys the majority of war savings certificates ? Not the wealthy people, or the great institutions, but the working class men and women. I resent the slander cast by honorable senators opposite on the class to which I belong. </para>
                    <para>Throughout this debate honorable senators opposite have magnified the things that really do not matter. I am sure that every one of us is proud of the manner .in which the men and women of Great Britain stood up to the worst days of the blitz. We are proud of the way they " took " it, and of the fact that they never squealed. When their homes were bombed at night, they were out the next day cleaning up the wreckage and serving in emergency forces. Are Australians less able to "take" it? I have been astounded and ashamed to hear honorable senators opposite complain that they cannot purchase mantles for Aladdin lamps, or cannot buy chocolates in the quantities that they would like, or cannot obtain enough butter, sugar, tea or' clothing; and that they have had to take the cuffs off their trousers,, and have had to make other sacrifices so small that any one would be ashamed to mention them in a time of war, when, as now, we are confronted with the great task of keeping the Japanese out of this country. Australia is the most favoured country in the world. With the exception of the men who have made the supreme sacrifice, and relatives who have suffered the agony of losing their loved ones, no one in this country has yet really suffered because of the war. Are we such a nation of squealers, cowards, and Quislings that we cannot bear such insignificant irritations as a shortage of mantles for Aladdin lamps, when the people from whom we sprung took the blitz and never complained. I say now, and I hope to have sufficient strength of voice left to say it throughout the length and breadth of this land in the next few weeks, that honorable senators opposite have shown their assessment of the value of Australian men and women by charging them with being cowards, Quislings and squealers. I shall have no hesitation in letting the people of this country know the valuation that is placed upon them. It is a foul slander of the people of this country, and on their behalf, I resent it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> smirks and smiles. He can afford to do that, and so can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> and certain other honorable senators opposite who have participated in this debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> inherited economic security, yet he has the audacity to come into this chamber and say that the Government of which I am a member and which is under the able leadership of that great man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Curtin, has let Australia down. Another member of the Opposition said that we on this side of the chamber put the interests of unionists before those of members of our fighting services. I ask honorable senators who are the members of our fighting services? At least 75 per cent, of them, if not more, are union supporters, and they have been fighting in every theatre of war. They left unions to enlist, yet they are slandered by honorable senators opposite who sneer at unionism and everything that it portends. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> made a remark which I think, upon reflection, he probably will regret for the rest of his life. If he has that innate decency of manhood which previously I gave him credit for, he certainly will regret it. The honorable senator asked, " Are members of this Government any less clever than the Germans ? ". All I can say is that I, for one, do not want to be as damnably clever as the Germans. In his love of fascism and all that it stands for, the honorable senator apparently forgot himself and declared himself on the side of clever Germany. " Are members of this Government", he asked, "less clever than the Germans? ". We may not be as clever as the Germans, but at least we do not stand for the purges, the wholesale massacre of Jews and the making of bonfires of great libraries containing books which civilized people wish to read, that have occurred in Germany, neither do we teach our people that there is nothing in life but war and preparation for war. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> that if he indulges in a little introspection in the quiet of his own home, he will apologize, to himself at least, for what he has said. </para>
                    <para>In his desire to discredit this Government, even by picking out small unworthy items, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham</inline> said something about an awful crime committed somewhere along the East-West railway in that railway employees at Tarcoola had galvanized fences around their homes. Any honorable senator who  knows that line will recall the type of homes that the men who do the great job out there, and their womenfolk, occupy. [, as Minister for the Interior, have control of the Commonwealth railways and this is the answer to the honorable senator's allegations: The fences in question were put up at a time when there was no embargo upon the use of galvanized iron ; they are cheaper to erect than timber fences both from the point of view of material and labour, and maintenance costs are negligible; they are white-ant proof in country in which timber fences must be renewed frequently because of the depredations of that pest; and they are very serviceable in drifting sand country such as that in the districts concerned. </para>
                    <para>All that this debate has produced has been a series of discreditable indications of how the Opposition intends to fight the forthcoming elections. One of my colleagues from Western Australia washed his hands completely of such tactics, and said that in Western Australia the Labour party would not fight on those lines. I say that in Queensland also we shall not fight on those lines. Honorable senators opposite can have those tactics all on their own and derive whatever satisfaction they can from them. If the disgraceful exhibition that we have seen in thi3 chamber during the last 48 hours is an indication, as obviously it is, of the tactics which our opponents intend to adopt in the election campaign, I am absolutely certain of a victory for the clean fighting Labour party. It is obvious that no party in either chamber has a sufficient majority to enable it to carry on the government of this country and attend to the great job of preventing the invasion of our land by the Japanese. There is only one authority that can make a stable government, and that is the people to whom an appeal will shortly be made. The proper issue upon which that appeal should be based is the question : " In your opinion, is the present Government, or some other government that you can envisage, capable of making the best war effort?" I have no fear of what the answer will be, if the issue be clearly stated to the people. There is no country in the world that has made a better response to the call of patriotism than Australia, and there are few countries among the Allied Nations who have achieved anything like the war effort that we have made in this country. </para>

                    <para>In regard to what our men have accomplished on the battle-front, this Government has no complaint. We know what our fighting men have done. We know, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> knows, although he is rather diffident about admitting it, how our fighting men and women responded to the call of their country. We know how they have not quivered, quavered or quarrelled. We know that they do not ask any questions in the trenches as to what religion a man adheres to, or what his political views are. We know that they answered the call as fighting men and women, and have done a wonderful job. I point out, however, that in order to keep our men in the field and fighting, there had to be in this war, as never before in the history of Australia, another army, the great industrial army; the army behind the Army; the army that keeps the fighting men and women able to fight on; the army which supplies the guns, tanks, equipment, cooking utensils, food, and so on, which are so necessary if we are to win battles. Industrial workers of this country answered the call as bravely as did their brothers and sisters, husbands and sweethearts in the fighting forces. Honorable senators can see in the King's Hall of Parliament House an. exhibition of photographs depicting the magnificent constructional work that has been carried out in this country by the Allied Works Council. The activities of the council are under the control of my department, and I know well that a modern miracle has been achieved by this organization which was called into being by the Prime Minister of this country only twelve months ago last February. I. am proud of our Prime Minister, as honorable senators opposite should be, instead of slandering him as they have done for the past 48 hours. Every member of the Opposition who has spoken in this debate has made accusations against the right honorable gentleman. He has been accused of lying, misrepresentation, and of going to an authority to which he had no right to go merely because it did not hold its meetings in a bank parlour, and he has even been accused of treachery, but it was the right honorable John Curtin, Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, who was able to stand proudly in the House of Representatives only a few short days ago, and say to the people of this great Commonwealth : " The battle of Australia has been won as surely as the br.tt.le of Britain was won." I was prouder than ever of my leader when he said that. But even that is all wrong in the eyes of the Opposition. When the Prime Minister told the story of the imminent danger of invasion threatening this country he was accused by honorable senators opposite and by their prototypes in the country, of merely making inflammatory statements in order to get the war loan successfully floated. When he made the opposite statement, knowing that the danger of immediate invasion was past, honorable senators opposite said that he had no right to say such a thing, because it might make people unduly complacent. I have been ashamed and astounded at the complacency in the ranks of the Opposition during this debate. There is complacency when they know that the only thing that matters is to keep the Japanese out of this and other allied countries. We set out to do it when we became the Government, and without a party majority in the House of Representatives and a minority in this chamber we have been carrying on for the last twenty months. That is a political miracle, and the work that we have done is both a military and industrial miracle. So far as I am concerned I am going to stake my political future on the work which has been done for the protection of this wonderful Commonwealth of ours by the Labour Government since it came into office in October, 1941. </para>

                        <para>. - in <inline font-style="italic">reply</inline> - As the Minister in charge of the bill I wish to make one or two comments upon what has been said during this debate. I agree with my leader that not much has emanated from it, but this is an occasion on which honorable senators have the right to say almost anything they like. I remember also that we are on the eve of an election, and, therefore, it is understandable that honorable senators should want to dress their political window. I suggest, however, that some of the statements made have not been helpful to the Parliament or to the honorable senators who have made them. I wish to emphasize that although a great deal of capital has been made by Opposition members out of the industrial position in Australia, and strikes have been continually referred to, measures for the repression of strikes have not been suggested. I tell the Opposition that in their regime they too had strikes, as this Government has had them, but if we take the industrial workers of Australia as a whole, with their vastly augmented numbers, and the fact that they have worked exceedingly long hours, the industrial loss of time in this country is amazingly small. 'Great Britain has its coal troubles and finds them equally as difficult to solve as we find ours. So has America, and other parts of the world. The obvious fact remains that, although the waterfront has had trouble to some extent, it has had less trouble than it had for a number of years previously. In' one week, to my knowledge, since we have been a Government, there has been trouble on the waterfront, but frankly, I would forgive the men in that particular job for anything at all. The Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> will remember the part he took with me in the big dispute in Melbourne years ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> and other Victorians will also remember what occurred at that time. We know that the life led by those men was nothing short of horrible. They had to stand out in the open with not even a shed to shelter them, waiting sometimes for many days for a ship. They had a rough time. There was a dispute recently owing to their system of work. It is true that soldiers are working on the waterfront but if all the waterside workers worked the soldiers would still be working there because of the enormous number of ships arriving. The American Army does most of the unloading of its own ships, but if ships bringing lend-lease goods continue arriving in big numbers our ports will be crowded, and it will be a big job to provide sufficient man-power to carry on the work on the waterfront. It can be truly said that the other great sections of industry in this country have done and are doing a phenomenal job. That applies among others to the railway men of Australia. The men in the employ of the Queensland railways are working up to 90 hours a week, and the same applies to the employees in Victorian and other State railways, owing to the abnormal amount of traffic that has been forced on to the land transport system. Prior to the war 90 per cent, of the commerce of Australia was sea-borne. Nearly 30 per cent, of that must go by rail to-day. That body of men is doing a tremendous job. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> great number of munitions workers, men and women, have been working for a long time in shifts of twelve hours, which is a very long shift. If we had to work shifts from nine o'clock at night until nine o'clock in the morning for a month on end on the same repetition work, doing the same deadly monotonous task, we would be very frayed at the end of the month and certainly not in the humour that we would be in if we worked fewer hours. The position generally is excellent from the industrial aspect. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The allusions to one army are too late. That is all over. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> surely does not suggest that he is going to recruit another 100,000 men for the Army. He knows that the man-power of this country is practically depleted and that the food supply for Australia and for our Allies is going to be a tremendous problem. It is a case of manpower again. Does he suggest that further enlistments of men can be made for the military forces? With his military knowledge he knows that that is not possible. There is no trouble at all arising from the fact that we have an Australian Imperial Force and a Citizen Military Force in this country. These men have merged and are being used in whatever zones the High Command directs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> utterance was a particularly unfortunate one. He gave no credit to the Government for anything. When I was an Opposition member I supported the war effort of the last Government, as I support the war effort of this Government. When a government has carried on as this Government has done under every possible difficulty, with the entry of Japan into the war and the added burdens thrown on to the Government thereby, it is only fair that it should be given credit for what it has done, even if an election is pending. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> commenced his speech with a complete indictment of the Government, but I suggest that it is not supported by any corroborative evidence at all. He said, " The Government has destroyed the good name of Australia ". I say that the good name of Australia was never higher than it is at the; moment, so that that charge is not supported. He also said, " It has let down our fighting men ". I suggest that that was an incorrect statement to make. Our fighting men have been reinforced as far as the man-power of this country will allow. Every possible thing has been done for them in the way of increased emoluments, and a more liberalized repatriation scheme, possibly with the highest rates in the world. Every member of this Parliament and every person in the community is ready to give whatever he can for the benefit of the soldiers, who are doing a tremendous job. Obviously, therefore, that statement also is not correct. The honorable senator has also condemned strikes and absenteeism. He said that strikes were prevalent, that we issued certain regulations and did not enforce them. When he is older he will find that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> said, bodies of men cannot be dragooned. In fairness to the waterside workers, to whom he made such a rough reference, I suggest that they have worked under a certain system for forty years. The Government of the day through the Stevedoring Commission said that for an obvious and sound reason they were to report for duty. Certain men in the union were sheltering from an Army call-up, and they were told to be there on the Monday morning when the new system was to be introduced. This was not wise, and caused tremendous irritation, but a man on a war job has to stick to his post all the time, and 99 per cent, of the people of Australia have been doing so. As long as the world lasts there will be men who are discontented, whatever job they are in. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> also said that the Government had interfered with the administration of justice. Where has it done so? He did not give one instance.' The Women's' Employment Board, whether the honorable senator admits it or not, is handling an aspect of industrialism that has never previously been touched in the history of this country. </para>

                            <para>- I do not admit that. Certain men were working under the Allied Works Council. They were leaders of a union, and through some stupid  boneheadedness  they were actually arrested in their beds at 3 o'clock in the morning. If the law provides that what they did is an offence, I have no comment to make, but they should have been proceeded against by summons and not made martyrs of as was done by a certain department. Following on that, the Minister for S*upply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> who was Acting Attorney-General, was not satisfied with the reason for which these men were arrested. The honorable senator surely does not want me to say anything more about it. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the sort. It was because it would not be wise to proceed with the prosecutions, for reasons that I might let the honorable senator know privately. I am not prepared to give them here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> also said that the Government has bungled the man-power problem. He should know that the members of the Ministry do not call up men. The High Command lays down the strategy of the war in conference with the Prime Minister and certain members of the War Cabinet. The High Command says that it wants so many men to do a certain operation, and it is then mandatory on the Ministry to see that the necessary number of men are called up. Men have been called up from the land. I have objected to that both as a senator and as a Minister. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> knows, a tremendous number of crops in the Western District of Victoria were wasted for lack of man-power to harvest them. There was no escape from that. Men had to be found, and the potatoes had to remain in the ground. To say that the Government has bungled manpower is a political misstatement which should not have been made. </para>

                            <para>- For the very obvious reason that we want the machinery of industry to run smoothly. It is necessary to have men who can handle the workers properly. The great majority are men who do a very good job, and it was wise to protect them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> also says that the Government has muddled commerce and industry. He should know that in wartime commerce has to be controlled, and that any Government, whether from his side or this side, must undertake the task. He knows that we had to ban exports, that we must tell the people that they cannot have what they had in peace-time, and that we had to ration certain goods. We limited the manufacture and sale of beer and tobacco and rationed tea, sugar and clothing because they were all in short supply. Butter now has had to be included. If he thinks that he is not getting enough butter, I think he is. He is getting more than I would let him have if I were the determining authority. He cannot say that half a pound a head is too little. The only complaints I have received are from men in engine crews on long runs who are away from home for a week and from the men in bush sawmills. Their cases will probably have to be looked into, but outside of them no relief will be given in that matter at all. I remind Senators Spicer and Foll that the Labour party has as much appreciation of its obligations to Great Britain as has any other party in this Parliament. That is why the Government is going on, whether the electors like it or not, with the commitment entered into by the last Government and by this Government to send to the Old Country as much meat, butter and cheese as we can. In order to provide that supply for Great Britain, the people cannot have as much as formerly. Obviously, therefore, we did not muddle that matter. </para>

                        said that we deprived the people of homes. Imagine a man of his capacity saying in the National Parliament that this Government deprived the people of homes, when he belongs to a party which in 1928 put through a Commonwealth Housing Bill appropriating £20,000,000 for homes and then shamelessly used it as a bait during three elections, but never built one home. He cannot expect this Government, in the middle of a war, to build homes when he knows that we have no man-power and no materials. If we had had them this Government would have built them, knowing as we all do that one of the most dreadful things in this country is the lack of housing and the shameless exploitation of the people by means of high rents for houses, rooms and flats. I am amazed at some of the statements that have been made.
                    </para><para>Comments have been made regarding the visit of the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> to the United States of America, but I consider that he has done an excellent job.  His  appeal to America does not imply disparagement of the war efforts of Great Britain. The Government and its followers fully realize that Britain, which has been suffering the blitz of hell for years, could not be expected to give to Australia all the help that it needs at this period of the war. We know that Britain had a tremendous aggregation of troops, aeroplanes and guns for the inevitable day when a second front had to he opened in Europe. The Labour Government did not ask for the aid of the United States of America until the position of Australia became desperate. The Minister reached a good understanding with the United States of America and secured improvements to the lend-lease arrangements. He has done remarkably well and the large number of American troops now in this theatre of war has been a big factor in turning the tide in our favour in ' the South- West Pacific Area. To-day's issue of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun Pictorial</inline> contains an interesting article from London, entitled " Evatt's speech hailed as voice of Empire ". It states - </para><quote>
                        <para>LONDON, Monday, AAP. - " There is the strength and vigour of Young Empire in the voice of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> ", says the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Express,</inline> commenting on the Australian Minister's broadcast address last night. " Australians themselves set the pattern for victory. In New Guinea, they won a campaign, which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> rightly calls one of the epics of the war. " The Allies are lighting, two wars as one. Reverses inflicted on either Germans or Japanese have an instant bearing on the fortunes of the other." </para>
                        <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Herald,</inline> in a leading article, said that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> had a wonderful story to tell, and pointed out that even at the time of her direct danger Australia was contributing powerfully to the Allied war effort. </para>
                        <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Sketch</inline> said : " Accustomed for two wars to spring to the aid of the Motherland, Australia found herself calling for aid to the parent country. It was a reversal of fortune which shook the dominion, but never shook her faith in the Empire." "No public man on the Australian side has done more to restore the old cordiality to Anglo-Australian relations than <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,"</inline> says theStar, in a leading article. "  His  fine broadcast surely sets the seal on the task he began a year ago, when the Japanese peril had led to a situation jeopardizing Australia's ties with the United Kingdom. Between them,Mr. Churchill and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> have removed a danger to Empire unity. " <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> also told a thrilling and moving talc of stemming the Japanese tide in the South-West Pacific. New Guinea will rank beside Gallipoli, Tobruk and El Alamein among Australia's great battle honours. " To-day we salute Australia. We realize that in halting the Far Eastern foe her comparatively tiny forces performed a feat of arms comparable with ours of 1940. In turn, each of us stood almost alone against a racing tide of barbarism, and won through against colossal odds." </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">I have referred to that article in reply to the indiscreet remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan. The present Government has  been in office for about a year and nine months. It came into power, not as the result of the last general elections, but because the Opposition failed to manage its own affairs. Its leader, the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> has always had my respect. He is one of the biggest men that the Opposition has produced. He was doing a good job as Prime Minister, but the Opposition could not manage its own team, and the Labour party had to take over the control of the affairs of the nation. I have no comment to make regarding the internal strife of the parties forming the Opposition, but I am glad to be able to say that, despite the heavy responsibility which the nineteen Ministers in the Curtin Government have had to carry owing to the war, not one dispute has occurred among them throughout their period of office. The fact that the general elections are imminent will not induce me to enter into a bitter tirade of abuse of my political opponents. I am not particularly interested in " the Brisbane line ". I am not stupid enough to imagine that the Menzies and the Fadden governments did not include some capable men. I say in all fairness to those governments that they had to put huge national works in hand and bring about tremendous changes in industry. That work was continued by the present Government, but the circumstances demanded an even greater effort by the present Government and greater sacrifices have had to be asked of the people. I believe that when the electors are consulted as to whether the Labour Government has acted in the best interests of the people, they will give a true verdict. </para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative. </para><para>Bill read a first time. </para><para>Second Reading. </para><continue><talk.start>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to give approval to a reciprocity agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand with regard to invalid and old-age pensions. This subject has been discussed by the Governments of both countries from time to time since 1913. In that year the respective Prime Ministers reached an agreement, as a result of which the Government of New Zealand enacted the Old-age Pensions Reciprocity Act of New Zealand, but the Commonwealth Government failed to proceed with the matter. The subject was again considered in 1938, but no finality was reached. The Government recently reviewed this matter at the request of the Prime Minister of New Zealand, and it was decided to introduce legislation simultaneously into the Parliaments of both countries to give effect to reciprocity. </para>
                    <para>The bill authorizes the execution of a reciprocity agreement, in the form contained in the schedule, between the Commonwealth in respect of its invalid and old-age pensions on the one hand and the Dominion of New Zealand in respect of its age and invalids' benefit on the other hand. It provides that where a person resident in Australia applies for a Commonwealth invalid or old-age pension his residence in New Zealand will be regarded as residence in Australia. It also provides that a person resident in Australia who became permanently incapacitated for work or blind whilst residing in New Zealand, will be regarded, for the purposes of the Invalid and Oldage Pensions Act, as having become permanently incapacitated or blind in Australia. No person will be qualified to receive a pension under the bill unless that person is qualified therefor under the more restrictive conditions of the laws of either the Commonwealth of Australia or the Dominion of New Zealand, whether as to residence or otherwise. The rate of pension granted in any case shall not exceed the maximum rate of pension payable under the law of the country which provides the lower maximum rate. Provision is also made for the removal of the existing disqualification from pension benefits in Australia of aboriginal natives of New Zealand who are resident in Australia and are otherwise qualified to receive the pension. The agreement between the two countries may be terminated by the Government of either country upon six months' notice being given. The Government of New Zealand has always been in favour of reciprocity, and for many years Australians resident in that Dominion have been given certain benefits which have been denied by the Commonwealth to New Zealanders living in Australia. With the closer ties between the two countries resulting from the present war and the exchange of official representatives, the Government believes that the time is opportune to take a practical step in ' establishing reciprocity in regard to pensions in the interest of persons otherwise eligible who change their place of residence. I am confident that the Government will have the support of all honorable senators in giving a speedy passage to this bill. </para>

                            <para>. - I ask the Senate to oppose the motion. The Opposition has endeavoured to meet the convenience of the Government, but it desires that the motion on the business-paper in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham</inline> under the heading " General Business " shall be dealt with to-night. Moreover, I understand that some urgent tariff bills will reach the Senate in about twenty minutes and that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> wishes those measures to be passed to-night, as this is the last day of the financial year. As Leader of the Opposition, I have agreed to support the passages of those bills at this sitting. I suggest that the motion be withdrawn so that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Latham</inline> may proceed with the notice of motion standing in his name. Otherwise, the Opposition will be compelled to oppose it. </para>

                    <para class="block">We have been informed through the press that differential treatment in respect of travelling allowance is meted out to officers of the Public Service who travel on official duty. If that be so, some instruction must have been issued to heads of the departments, because the payments are made on their authority. I understand that an officer who is a member of an approved organization receives £1 8s. a week travelling allowance in excess of the amount paid to officers who are not members of such an organization. I cannot understand how these differential payments can be calculated, because they are purely in respect of out-of-pocket expenses. It would appear that, whilst one officer may be paid £1 8s. a week too much, another officer may be paid £1 8s. a week too little. This payment is not a part of ordinary salary, but is made available to cover out-of-pocket expenses. An important principle is at stake in this matter, and the Senate has a perfect right to the information for which I ask. With the House of Representatives, this chamber, on behalf of the people, authorizes Government expenditure, and it is our prerogative to ascertain how that money is expended. I was rather surprised when the Minister treated my motion as being not formal. </para>

                            <para>- But to-morrow night will perhaps be too late, because I understand that the Senate will finish its business some time to-morrow. Therefore I ask that these papers be laid onthe table. The Government has no right to say to an officer who is despatched on public business that he will be paid £1 8s. a week less than the expenditure he incurs in out-of-pocket expenses while he is engaged on that job. I am hopeful of getting support from honorable senators opposite on this matter, because it is not a party political matter so far as I am concerned. I want to know under whose authority this provision is being implemented. Surely, the departmental heads have not held a meeting and decided upon this discrimination in the payment of out-of-pocket expenses to public servants. The Government has a moral obligation to the Senate to explain the reason for the provision, and to indicate under whose instructions it was issued. I hope that the Leader of the Senate has come prepared to deal with my motion, and will lay the papers upon the table to-night. </para>

The excise duties are of great importance in maintaining revenue for the prosecution of the war, and the revenue would be seriously affected if the continued operation of the duties was not assured. The proposals which this bill seeks to validate are the Excise Tariff Proposals introduced into the House of Representatives on the 5 th and the 25th March, the 2nd September, 1942, and the 28th January, 1943. </para>

                                <para>Concerning foodstuffs - (a) The Commonwealth has mobilized the capacity of local Queensland industries in order to meet requirements as far as possible. Queensland meat canneries are being utilized to the full and organized to work the longest possible hours not only during the normal canning season, but in months in which they would be usually closed down; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> the whole of the normal needs of the civilian population in jam are being made available this year. Action has been taken to stimulate production so that quantities will actually reach civilian traders. Substantial releases of canned fruits have been arranged; (o) the Commonwealth Director of Rail Transport was recently sent to Queensland to ensure the transport difficulties which have hindered the transport of foodstuffs throughout the State will be eliminated; (d)  an emergency supply scheme has been adopted and is in operation. This is locally administered by a committee at Brisbane working under the aegis of the Queensland State Government. This committee reports weekly to the Commonwealth Controller of Emergency Supplies of outstanding orders placed with merchants in southern States so that the latter may endeavour to remove all difficulties in the way of the fulfilment of orders. Chief amongst these difficulties has been the obtaining of shipping space. As the orders were on a " merchant-to-merchant " basis they have in the past suffered in competition against defence and other government cargoes of highdegree priority. The policy has now been introduced of allotting for emergency supplies oi foodstuffs space on all vessels sailing te Queensland ports from the south and this space is allocated by the Controller of Emergency Supplies amongst shippers of foodstuffs. In collaboration with the Commonwealth Food Council and in co-operation with the Department of Supply and Shipping the Controller of Emergency Supplies has now secured for Queensland definite quotas of foodstuffs which have, from time to time, been placed under Commonwealth governmental control because of their being in short supply, e.g., canned fruits, dried vine fruits, prunes, biscuits, &amp;c. Queensland has been granted quotas of these foodstuffs in excess of those allotted to the other States in recognition of her special difficulties. The Commonwealth is taking special care to ensure by constant liaison with manufacturers and the sponsoring of shipping space that regular supplies of infants' foods and condensed, as well as powdered, milks are consigned to Queensland. &lt; A large reserve of Commonwealth-owned powdered milk has been established in north Queensland and this has already been drawn upon to relieve shortages caused by demands on local fresh milk supplies by Allied troops. </para>

                    <para>. -  To-day the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> made a statement in regard to mail contractors, some of whom it was alleged were charging exorbitant rates. That brings to notice the method that is employed to deliver mails to people in the outback areas of this country. For many years past, it has been the custom of the Postal Department to call for tenders for the carrying of mails. This is a matter that I have taken up with previous governments on several occasions. At present many contractors carrying on mail services are being paid a ridiculously low remuneration, which makes it impossible for them to meet the cost of even petrol and tyres. I know that it will be claimed that the contracts are competitive, and a*e let to the lowest tenderer ; but there is another side to the story, and that is the service that is given to outback settlers. I believe that in order to give an efficient mail service, the contractor should receive an adequate return. I know of one mail contractor who travels  500  miles a week, for an annual payment of  £100  which has to cover the cost of running a  3-ton  lorry. Prior to the present contractor undertaking the job, the contract had been let for as low as  £50  a year or approximately id. a mile. Obviously it would be impossible for any one to make a reasonable profit out of such a contract. In  1922, 1923  and  1924,  the same contract carried a remuneration of  £1,500  a year, for the simple reason that the service was solely a mail service and the contractor was not dependent upon other sources of income. It may be that in some of the cases in which it is claimed exorbitant prices are being asked, the return represents only 6d. or 9d. a mile, which is not a payable proposition for a man with a 2  I  or 3 ton lorry. The time has come when the Postal Department should review this method of delivering mails, and should pay to mail contractors a sum adequate to ensure to the contractor a reasonable living wage, after meeting the cost of running his lorry. If that were done, the country people would get a better and cheaper service, because a contractor who takes a mail contract at a ridiculously low figure must feel that he has to make up the difference between his contract price and a living price by  mean3  of his charges on the goods that he delivers on his mail route. Under present conditions, instead of being a mail delivery, as it should be, leaving on time and running to time, and a credit to the department, the service simply becomes a goods service which is carrying mail matter. The department should take a broader view of the subject. When I have approached it previously I have been told that contracts are let to the lowest tenderer. I maintain that it is the duty of the department to pay a fair contract price, and also its duty to ensure that good equipment is provided by the contractor and that he carries mail matter and other small goods, but operates purely as a mail contractor and gets his remuneration from the department without having to depend upon the people in the district paying higher charges on the goods that he is delivering. I shall be glad if the Postmaster-General will give the matter his attention and see whether something cannot be done on the lines that I have suggested. </para>

He did not go with the division into battle, but he went to the prisoners in the camp and asked them to go into action. He said that they got the sick men to go to El Alamein, but he did not go. Then he returned to Australia, and on the 3rd March, 1943, he informed the Prime Minister that he felt that it was his duty to refuse to leave Australia with the Empire Parliamentary Delegation, as he thought he ought to remain in Australia with his unit. That unit is now somewhere in North Australia and the major is at the Victoria Barracks. I say that he is a member of the court-martial panel. </para>

I remind him that it is not in the best interests of the Army for him to attack the Government and forget what he himself is doing. He has used hi3 political position for the purpose of rapid promotion in the Army. He has remained, at head-quarters and been promoted from lance-sergeant to major. He said that it was his duty to be with his unit in Australia, but he remained at the Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, whilst his unit went away to do its job. I should never have mentioned the matter had not the honorable senator in effect brought the boys of the gallant 9th Division into this Parliament, and dragged them and their blood through the mud of this chamber. It ill-becomes a man, because he is a senator and has to face the people, to disparage not only those who returned but also those who did not return from war service overseas. He says that this Government brought them back. I remind him that in to-day's issue of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> appears a leading article which concurs in what I say.

                <para class="block">The honorable senator has a lot to learn. If he can only be elected by trying to make political capital out of the boys of the 9th Division who were fighting while he was at head-quarters, and out of their wives, mothers and sweethearts, it is a poor lookout. Those boys went into that terrific battle which we witnessed on the screen in a Canberra picture theatre today, and the honorable senator told us that this Government gave instructions for the division to return to Australia when they were on the point of going in for the kill and collecting the prisoners. He should be the last person in the world to utter such words to the discredit of any government.  His  remarks were an insult to the people of Australia. The honorable senator knows that the Government brought back the gallant boys of the 9th Division because their services were required in addition to the services of the American forces in order to defend Australia. The men were brought back on a' military recommendation. These men did not travel in the deck cabins of a troopship, in comfort, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> did; they had to travel below decks. The honorable senator has said that he was not a member of a court martial. If he had a spark of decency in him, he would also say to the Melbourne press, " What I said on Monday, is not what I said on Wednesday ". He should say clearly how long he was with his unit in the Middle East. He should also say that he was not at El Alamein during the time the troops there were proceeding to battle. </para>

                    has made some remarks about a statement I made some time ago that certain officers had been cashiered ; but he did not have the decency to remind the Senate that I amended my statement, after I had learned that no officers were cashiered in the 1914-18 war. I then said that they were asked to resign.

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> has made some remarks concerning payments to Queensland mail contractors. I agree with some of the sentiments he expressed. He has suggested that a course different from that adopted by the Government should be followed, though he has not suggested what should be done. Surely, the Senate will agree that the competitive method is the only proper one on which to base contracts. Tenders are invited and contracts are let after consideration of the tenders received. The honorable senator has suggested that the Postmaster-General's Department should operate a special mail service on routes followed by existing carrying services. . Surely, this is not the time to duplicate services in that way. I stand by the statement that I made in the Senate last week: that certain mail contracts which have been let on new tenders are now costing the department 100 per cent, more than they cost formerly. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper,</inline> also, that in consequence of increases of the cost of living and of operating expenses generally, particularly in relation to petrol and tyres, adjustments have been made in the rates applicable to current contracts. The department has treated the mail contractors fairly, and adjustments have been made from time to time, in cases where it has been shown that owing to increased costs the contracts are not payable. I am prepared to reconsider the matter, but in a Parliament about to be dissolved it would not be right for me to review the conditions of mail contracts. Much investigation would be needed before a change could be made. </para>

                <para>During the last twelve months there has been a significant change in Tasmania's position, in relation to Australia's war-time industrial effort, and the State is now moving to a stage where all its economic resources will be fully directed to maximum war production. However, some of the recommendations of the committee still require further action. The respective departments have been advised of the Government's decisions on these matters and arrangements have been made to ensure that they will be implemented without delay. These matters include - </para>
                <para class="block">The appointment of a full-time officer to the Tasmanian Board of Area Management to act as liaison officer with the Victorian Board of Area Management. </para>
                <para class="block">The issue of a general departmental direction that, where war work can be done as efficiently in Tasmania as on the mainland, Tasmania should be given special opportunities to do the work so that her labour supplies can be fully employed within the State. </para>
                <para class="block">Consideration of the potential importance of the fishing industry in the post-war period. </para>
                <para class="block">The matter of the establishment of the aluminium ingot industry in Australia has received the attention of the Government in an active manner. A survey of the Australian resources of bauxite has been completed, supplies sufficient in quantity and suitable in quality are available, and inquiries have been made overseas regarding plant and equipment necessary for the establishment of the industry. The power position has also been investigated, and plans had been prepared for the establishment of this industry on a worthwhile scale in Tasmania. The matter had reached the state of final consideration by the Government, but in view of the present political situation it has not been possible to reach a decision nor to proceed with the presentation of a bill to Parliament. In outlining for the information of honorable senators the position in relation to many matters raised by the Tasmanian War Industries Committee, I have not been able to set out all the action taken by, or under consideration of, the Government to meet the committee's recommendations. I think that it will be agreed, however, that the committee's investigations have been of singular value both to Tasmania and to the Commonwealth in furthering the economic war effort of that State. </para>
                <para>I should like also to inform honorable senators that the Government has approved the setting up of a Tasmanian Industry Expansion Commission on similar lines to the Western Australian Industry Expansion Commission. The terms of reference of the commission will be - </para>

                    <item label="(1)">
                        <para>To advise the Commonwealth Government on measures necessary to ensure the fullest and most effective use of Tasmania's industrial resources for war purposes. </para>

                </list>
                <para>Although, as will be seen from the terms of reference, the commission will be primarily an advisory body, it will, in  practice, take an active part in promoting the maximumuse of the capacity of Tasmania in meeting war requirements. It will pursue investigations, offer advice, and make recommendations independently of normal departmental procedure, on specific matters relating to the war effort where Commonwealth action is called for, and, in its examination of such measures, the commission will take into consideration the ultimate effect of such action upon the Tasmanian economy as a whole. The personnel of the commission will be: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> H. Ferguson, chartered accountant, Hobart,  chairman,  with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> Meredith, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Reynolds and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. K.</inline> J. Binns as members. A further member is still to be appointed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Meredith</inline> is ex-general manager of the Electrolytic Zinc Company and is now acting as business administrator in the Ministry of Munitions, Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reynolds</inline> is the chief commerce officer of the Department of Agriculture, Hobart, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Binns</inline> is the investigation and statistical officer of the State Treasury. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reynolds</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Binns</inline> are the nominees of the State Government. </para>
