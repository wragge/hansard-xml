            <para>- Will the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform the Senate what action the Government proposes to take with regard to Werribeebeef? When I moved for the disallowance of regulations promulgated with regard to the disposal of that beef, certain figures submitted by me were questioned. The Department of Commerce and Agriculture has now issued a statement by its own officers showing that, of. 335 carcasses inspected between the 18th and the 28th August, 203 were rejected because of beef measles ; of 183 examined between the 24th August and the 4th September, 109 were rejected; of 93 examined between the 5th and the 11th September, 65 were rejected; and of 100 examined between the 12th and the 18th September, 73 were rejected. Has the department refused to permit the export of Werribeebeef to our troops overseas, and has permission been granted for its sale on the local market for human consumption? </para>

            <para>The difficulty in the dry cleaning industry in Queensland is due largely to the short supply of dry cleaning chemical solvents, without which it is not possible to meet normal demands for dry cleaning. I understand that the Department of War Organization of Industry is at present investigating means of increasing supplies of such solvents or of finding substitutes for them. The only war-time restriction relating to dry cleaning facilities are those imposed by the Department of War Organization of Industry, which I understand preclude dry cleaning establishments from accepting for cleaning such items as evening wear and other non-utility clothes. This restriction applies equally to all States. </para>

If I had time to give details of the damage, honorable senators might think that 1 was describing damage done by German or Japanese invaders rather than by Australians in Australian territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coath</inline> is an Army veteran who has since retired from the dockyard police and is unfit for further service.

          <para>On perusing the copy of the letter of the secretary of your department I find it difficult to understand the attitude assumed. During the last war, in European theatres, the means adopted to meet such claims worked quickly and equitably. </para>
          <para>Your secretary writes, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia, &#34;</inline> The reports Show beyond doubt that acts of gross vandalism were committed, and almost certainly by Army personnel &#34;.

          <para>I refer to my letter to you of the 16th June in reply to your letter of the 12th June which enclosed correspondence from the State secretary, Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen&#39;s Imperial League of Australia (Western Australian branch), Anzac House, Perth, regarding damage to property owned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> J. Coath, East Rockingham. </para>
          <para>I regret that I am unable to alter the view expressed in the letter of the 17th May from the secretary of my department to the general secretary of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen&#39;s Imperial League of Australia, but nothing in that letter would prevent the claimants, if they so desire, from submitting their claim to the  Deputy  Assistant Director of Hirings, Swan Barracks, Perth, for determination under National Security (Hirings Administration ) Regulations. </para>
          <para>Special political and diplomatic considerations apply to claims arising out of the criminal nets of individual soldiers against the residents of an Allied foreign country during the occupation of that country by our military forces engaged in actual military operations and it may be that in some areas in France during the last war certain claims were adjusted without reference to legal liability. </para>

          <para>It cannot be said that these items were taken by troops acting in the course of their duty, and War Cabinet has made it very clear that the Commonwealth will not be responsible for irresponsible acts of troops or for theft or looting by individual members of the Army.

        <quote>
          <para>Interpretations of the law given on Tuesday by the Compensation Board in disallowing claims for compensation by civilians against the Army focus attention on what appears to bc a gross injustice. In one case the applicant claimed that the damage was done in part when troops were being marched through his property on manoeuvres and picked fruit as they went through. The facts do not seem to hu disputed, but according to the military authorities &#34; the Army can only accept liability for loss or damage caused by actual training and manoeuvres of troops, and cannot accept liability for loss or damage caused by the irresponsible acts of individual soldiers &#34;. If this means that the Army does not accept responsibility for thefts or destruction of property by soldiers even while they are supposed to be under direct military control and discipline then Australian citizens seem likely to fare worse at the hands of their own Government than French civilians fared at the hands of British forces in the last war. </para>
          <para>The board, after careful perusal  of  the regulations, expressed itself as satisfied that &#34; there is nowhere&#39; any justification for the suggestion that the Minister f::r the Army is made responsible for the vandalism of individual members of the forces where such vandalism has not been committed under the instructions of a responsible officer &#34;. Since it is scarcely to be imagined that any &#34;responsible&#34; Australian officer would ever instruct his men to commit &#34; vandalism &#34; on Australian soil the prospect of Australian  property  owners being able to establish reasonable claims for compensation for depredations by soldiers at present seems hopeless. It is understood there would be no legal difficulty about payment of compensation if Western Australia were classed as an operational area because this would have the effect of removing the matter from the civil authorities (working under inadequate National Security Regulations) and placing it with the military, working under the provisions of the Defence Act. As this is not an operational area it seems that if the rights of civilians are to be protected amended National Security Regulations should be issued giving the Compensation  Board  power which it now lacks to award compensation in nil meritorious cases. The War  Damage  Insurance Fund, with millions of pounds at its disposal, is an obvious source from which compensation of this nature could be drawn. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>The attitude adopted by the .Department of the Army in this matter is against all principles of common justice. I have had some experience in dealing with damage to property during war-time. In cases in  which  an investigation showed that the damage was caused by certain individuals those individuals were made to pay. Whilst cases in which the defaulter was not discovered a levy was made upon all members of the unit camped in the vicinity. </para>

          <para>- Yes. That method proved to be effective, particularly because it, instilled in troops a proper regard for the property of civilians in the area in which they happened to be camped. However, the very fact that an incident of this kind should occur at all in this country is a grave reflection upon not only the discipline of the troops, but also the command. I think that the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser),</inline> who represents the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> in this chamber, is familiar with the details of the case I have mentioned. I am sure that honorable senators will join with me in expressing the hope that the Minister for the Army will alter his policy in order to afford protection to the public in cases of this kind. </para>

          <para>.- The statement just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> is, I think, one of the gravest that could possibly be made in a deliberative assembly against the administration of a department. It is most scandalous, first, that such an incident could occur, and, secondly, that excuses should be offered by the department for not taking appropriate action in the matter. However, the Minister representing the Minister for the Army does not, even seem to think that the honorable  senator&#39;s representations are worth replying to. If that is to be the normal course of procedure in this chamber, and if the policy just outlined in the correspondence of the Department of the Army is to remain its permanent policy, all I can say is that the people of Australia can expect to hear of other cases, of grave injustices which they &#34;ill abhor. The facts that an injury has been done to an individual, and that the Army authorities refuse to give him any compensation, are apart altogether from party political considerations. The Minister representing the Minister for the Army has not denied the case made out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett.</inline> Yet he has not attempted to reply to the honorable senator. He has not even intimated that, should the information given by the honorable senator prove upon investigation to be correct, steps will be  taken to compensate the injured party. The Minister simply ignored the honorable senator&#39;s representations. I submit that if  the facts are as stated, this particular individual should be compensated. The Minister might at least give an assurance that the matter will be investigated, and if the statements are true, this man, an Australian citizen in fairly poor circumstances, will receive justice from the Government, if not from the Department of the Army. </para>

          <para>.- I draw attention to the regulations regarding service pensions. The parliamentary committee which did such good work in suggesting amendments to the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Act recently, did not recommend any change in the position of service pensions. No direct evidence was taken as to how the regulations framed five years ago affected this  class  of pensioner. These &#34; burnt out &#34; ex-service men, of whom there are about 9,000, including 66 from this war, have since formed an association. I was invited to attend one of its meetings in Melbourne. Their main grievance was that, they were not allowed to earn more than 12s. 6d. a week without forfeiting the maximum weekly allowance of 27s. The same provision applies in respect of the invalid and old-age pensions. These men contend that they should be allowed to earn whatever they can, in order to bring their pension and earnings up to the basic wage. &#34;With this I agree; indeed, the same provision should apply to invalid and old-age pensioners. It would not affect Government expenditure. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I was also asked to draw attention to the granting from the 1st October last of a pension of 15s. a week to wives of invalid pensioners. If! economic conditions warrant, such a grant in the case of invalid civilian pensioners, there is justification for an addition to the wives of invalid ex-servicemen. It is true that the wives of invalid ex-servicemen now receive a small allowance which brings the total income of man and wife up to &#163;2 9s. a week; but that is not sufficient for a man who has served his country so well. Two of the 66 service pensioners in this war asked me this question, &#34; Are we to continue to exist for the rest of our lives on 27s. a week, plus the 12s. 6d. which we are allowed to earn? Our average age is probably under 30 &#34;. There is only one answer to that query, which, I venture to say,  every honorable senator will endorse, and that is that these regulations must be reviewed. </para>
        <para>The subject of medical attention also was brought to my notice. It is true that some pensioners with tuberculosis receive medical treatment. Not all of our 9,000 service pensioners would need help in this direction, but many exservicemen who are not receiving such pensions are suffering other disabilities. We hear a deal of talk about social and hospital benefits for all sections of the community. Why not make a start now to put that policy into effect, and&#39; give the ex-servicemen free medical treatment? The cost to the Repatriation Department could :be transferred to the Social Services Department. It would be merely a book entry. This lip service to the splendid work &#39;done by men in the fighting services would be more appreciated if a sailor, soldier or airman knew that, should he become unemployable through war service, he would be guaranteed a service pension, with medical treatment. I ask the Minister to cause steps to be taken to improve the lot of service pensioners. </para>

            <para>- I do not  a3k  the Government to bind itself to abolish it. I merely want an undertaking that the department will not continue its unreasonable attitude of the last year or two. Its demands for returns and licences in regard to ordinary commodities from the United Kingdom have become a laughing stock. .1 have recently seen some forms to be filled in, which it would take  ti  Philadelphia lawyer, let alone an ordinary trader, to puzzle out. I know that it is not the desire of the Trade and Customs Department, or of the Government, to cause any more inconvenience to the general public than can possibly be helped. They want the business to go through as smoothly and easily as possible, consistent with the proper carrying out of war duties and the successful prosecution of the  Avar.  Many of these things are quite necessary and cannot be helped, but there is a feeling that many officers, . especially in the Import Procurement Department, are treating traders in an unnecessarily severe way. Possibly, most of the trouble is due to the fact that the department had to take in a large number of new officers who had not been trained in the particular jobs to which they were assigned, and therefore had to learn their new duties. Some of them have picked up the habit of being very dictatorial in their approach to the trading community. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to give quiet advice to the head of his department, or to some of his officers, to the effect that there is a good deal of quite legitimate resentment at some of the operations of the Import Procurement Department, not so much as regards its refusals as its delays. Months some- &#39; times elapse before traders are given a yea or nay as to whether or not they can obtain stuff. If they could be told straight out that it could or could not be got, the people who do the importing could satisfy their customers, but when the matter is left in the air for months on end without their knowing whether or not they are going to get the stuff, the Minister can understand that ill feeling arises between those who do the importing and those who do the selling. Will the Minister give a word of advice to this particular branch of his department that  it is quite unnecessary to be rough with the ordinary trader? He is just an ordinary decent fellow who wants to carry on his business in the ordinary way, and he should not be treated as a criminal or semi-criminal. The Minister should tell his departmental heads in that particular branch that a considerable amount of delay which takes place there is causing great inconvenience outside. Much of it is probably inevitable, but much more is avoidable. I shall be satisfied if the Minister promises me to keep his eye on these matters and not allow the department to run away with the idea that it has absolute power, which it is going to exercise willy-nilly, convenient or inconvenient. A great deal of dissatisfaction exists now. Some of the things that have been told to me indicate that certain officers are not in sympathy at all with the trading public, and evidently have not been trained in the department. They have been brought in from outside and have no particular knowledge of the matters with which they have to deal. The main cause of the trouble is the centralization of everything in Sydney. Not enough power is given to officers in other States to deal with matters which they are quite competent to settle. In a big business community, with many things coming in, it is necessary to have a responsible officer on the spot with power to say &#34; yes &#34; or &#34; no &#34; immediately. Otherwise, matters cannot go on smoothly. Under the present arrangement, every little tin-pot thing has to be referred to the head office in Sydney and the delays and inconveniences that arise are very distressing to the trading community. I urge the Minister to see if these troubles cannot be removed and the burdens eased, particularly by reducing the number of forms which traders have to fill in. </para>

          <para>.- The facts axe generally as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has outlined. There have been some complaints of delay, and centralization does, to a certain extent, create a bottle-neck, which has had my personal attention in the last year. I am always prepared to hear complaints of that nature, hut I can frankly say that I do not get many of them. If I receive a complaint I am prepared to meet any group in regard to it, and have generally succeeded in ironing out the trouble. The Department of Import Procurement had had colossal jobs thrown on to it, in many cases without warning. On one occasion there came into our ports overnight 191,000 tons of refugee cargo in 63 British, American and Dutch ships. All this had to be requisitioned by us and taken over, stored, sorted and sold to the services and civilians. We had to take over all the possible stores that we could get and arrangements had to be made with the owners in Britain, America and Holland. The work of the department is colossal, and has to be done by a staff which has been hastily thrown together and which ordinarily is doing a magnificent job. The volume of overtime is immense, but is inescapable, as we still require 300 more men, whom we cannot get under the present man-power conditions. We cannot put any man on to this kind of work. Those appointed must possess some clerical knowledge and ought, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> suggests, to have the art of handling people. There are in every department officers who are not regular civil servants and who have not been educated up to the standard which we think they ought to reach. However, I will confer with the head of my department about the questions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has raised. I see him three or four times a week and will consult him as to whether we can speed up the business, and also get rid of some of the unnecessary clerical work which may have been placed on the outside trading community. </para>

          <para>. -  There is an acute shortage of labour in Western Australia, and &#39; some time ago we set up an authority which is perhaps a little different from what obtains in other parts of the Commonwealth. The rural labour position in Western Australia is more acute than in any other State. Labour is particularly inadequate for such important priority crops as flax, hay and potatoes. Expedients adopted in other States to secure seasonal labour will not, it is considered, meet the position in Western. Australia. To overcome the difficulty it waa decided that a labour corps of enemy aliens, under the joint control of the Western Australian Departments of Forests and Agriculture, should be formed. This corps would be employed half-time on agricultural pursuits, and farmers would have to pay for the labour at normal rates. In accordance with the recommendation contained in a Cabinet submission, provision is necessary to cover the cost of supervision, transport and equipment, which is estimated to amount to &#163;2,000. As the corps will be required to work only half-time on agricultural pursuits, this figure represents half the total co.=t of the overhead in connexion with the scheme, the other half being met by the Western Australian Government. </para>

          <para>. -  In the course of the Commonwealth drive to step up agricultural production, it has become very apparent that, in the present man-power position, machinery must be available to agriculture to a greater extent, if efforts are to bc successful. Several urgent food production projects in approved areas necessitate the setting up of machinery pools for the use of farm groups. Such machinery as soil preparation units, seedsowers, cultivators, navy bean harvesters and all crop harvesters, mechanized with tractor power, would be included in the pools and available for the use of farmers on an approved basis. District controls will be set up under the war agricultural committee organizations to supervise the farming out of this machinery on a rental basis. This item is dealt with by a production executive decision. In addition to that manufactured in Australia I understand that we &#39;have had to import machinery, because of the necessity of getting as much of it as soon as possible. </para>

At present it is impossible to get fat sheep into cold stores. After all, when a grower has stock in fat condition, the cheapest &#34; food &#34; that he can give to it is ice. The Government should not only make available more of the existing cold-storage accommodation, but also should construct new stores to take the slaughtered fat stock of this country before the season ends in the autumn. One honorable senator said yesterday that Australia has  125,000,000  sheep; the only place for excess stock is in. the cold stores. In Victoria, only dressed fat lambs can be put into the cold stores, despite the fact that there is any amount of space available. Action should be taken now to provide for the post-war period. </para>

However, all  possible precautions are being taken, and in fact, this matter will be discussed at a conference of State Ministers for Health and medical officers to be held next month. </para>

          <para>. - Owing to the acute shortage of man-power, it became necessary for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to organize the services of rural workers for harvesting operations in order that they would be employed to the best advantage. The position in regard to transport and accommodation is greatly altered from that prevailing under pre-war conditions, when rural workers generally provided their own transport and camping equipment. The depleted rural labour force has now to be supplemented from volunteer labour, the Women&#39;s Land Army and other sources, and to ensure that this class of labour is forthcoming it is necessary for this department to see that adequate accommodation is provided and transport facilities are available. The above is covered by Cabinet Minute <inline font-style="italic">No.</inline> 1 of 1943, dated the 6th January, 1943, which provides for a total expenditure of &#163;25,000 for the twelve months ending the 31st October, 1943. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>.- The proposed vote of &#163;670,000 in Division 157 to the apple and pear industry represents a huge increase over the expenditure last year of &#163;33,252. Is it expected that the loss on the acquisition scheme will be that much greater than it was last year, and if so does that mean that again this year Tasmanian apples will not be marketed on the mainland, and that apples and pears from Western Australia will not find their way to the eastern States, where there is a steady market for them? Must the Apple and Pear Board continue to make the people pay ls. a lb. for apples when that fruit goes to waste in Tasmania and, to a certain degree, in Western Australia also? Something should be done to see that apples which are grown in abundance in certain States are made available at reasonable prices to the people in. the more thickly populated States. I know that the Minister will say that the present position is due to shipping difficulties. Housewives and others read repeatedly in the press that apples are plentiful in Tasmania, but I know that there is a considerable quantity of cargo space available between Tasmania and the mainland. Tasmanian apples should be marketed in the eastern &#39;States at at least half the price the people are compelled to pay for them. It is shameful that they are required to pay ls. per lb. for fruit which, before the war, was sold at 2d. or 3d. per lb. The growers thought at that time that they were fairly well paid for their product. The difficulties experienced in marketing apples should be overcome, because fruit is an article of diet that the people need. What will be the position of the Tasmanian applegrowers after the war when they will desire to resume their former export trade ? While their apples are now going to waste I have no doubt that their industry is on the downward grade and I suppose that, to a certain degree, their orchards are being neglected, but at the same time the people of Australia are crying out for apples at a reasonable price. If there were a scarcity of that fruit, of course the people would have to do without it, but as we have a superabundance of apples a plentiful supply should be made available to the public. This is a most serious matter, particularly to the people living in the eastern States. If the Minister could be instrumental in supplying them with fruit at a reasonable price he would justify his appointment to the Cabinet. </para>

          <para>. - I am surprised at the extraordinary statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> in view of the fact that the Government of which he was a member inaugurated the apple and pear acquisition scheme. When the present Government took office, the loss experienced in that venture amounted to &#163;1,600,000, but that has been reduced to about &#163;600,000 or &#163;700,000. Even if transport facilities were readily available for the carriage of fruit from. Tasmania to the mainland, it would not be easy to market i! at reasonable prices. If the Government again took over the whole of the apple crop from the growers, and met the transport and marketing costs, it would be necessary to reimburse the fund for any loss sustained. More fruit has been received from Tasmania and Western Australia this year than in any previous year. The difficulties relate not only to shipping, but also to man-power and fruit containers. A great deal of fruit is being preserved by the solid pack method, and much is being dehydrated. Although the acquisition scheme now applies only to Tasmania and Western Australia, apples are dearer to-day than when the apple crops in all of the States were acquired. Fresh fruit cannot be stored on wharfs indefinitely. Sometimes fruit awaiting shipment has to be left lying on the wharfs because the shipping space is required for cargoes with higher priorities. The proposed vote on the Estimates this year in respect of the apple and pear acquisition scheme is the same as that of last year, but the actual expenditure will depend upon the assessment of the crop. The Government has done everything possible to preserve the apple and pear industry. Millions of pounds is involved in the export trade in apples, and the&#39; Government has tried to help the industry by fixing the price of the fruit. </para>

          <para>.- Probably the most important food requirement is wheat. When in opposition, honorable senators on the Government benches objected to the restrictions imposed on the production of wheat; but they now support those restrictions. The estimated wheat crop this year will be only 80,000,000 bushels. Of that quantity, it is expected that 65,000,000 will be consumed in Australia, leaving only 15,000,000 bushels available for export. As the Government has sold a considerable quantity of wheat, the quantity carried over cannot be large. In view of the shortage of superphosphates and the lack of man-power on farms, it is possible that next year we shall not have sufficient wheat even for our own requirements. In the light of that possibility it is a criminal act to restrict the production of wheat. The policy of licensing farms is both childish and wrong. If production must be restricted, then instead of licensing farms the Government should license farmers. As an instance of the foolishness of the policy which has been followed, I mention that my son, who has been in the Army since the beginning of the war, gave instructions to sow a certain paddock with wheat. After the wheat was up a licence to grow wheat in the paddock was refused, and he was told that he was lucky that he was not fined &#163;500 for sowing wheat on an unlicensed farm. Had he known in advance that that paddock would not be licensed to grow wheat, he would have sown it with oats. Eoi- the wheat grown in that paddock he was paid only 2s. a bushel. Actually, he fed most of it to pigs rather than accept that price. If the Government insists on restricting the acreage sown with wheat, farmers should not he forced to sow wheat in certain paddocks, but many farmers are fallowing laud to-day which I am confident will not be licensed because it has not previously been sown with wheat. Such a policy is wrong. Those men are not exceeding the area allotted to them. I hope that common sense will prevail in this matter and that if the policy of restricting acreage is insisted upon farmers, instead of farms, will be licensed. I disagree with the policy &#34;now in operation, and urge that farmers should be allowed to produce as much wheat as they can. If they are to get only 4s. a bushel for the first 3,000 bushels, and must accept market price for the balance, if will not matter a great deal if some surplus wheat is produced. There are millions of starving people in other countries who would bc glad of it. A different policy is followed in the various States. For instance, in Western Australia farmers ave paid not to grow wheat, whereas in Victoria farms are licensed. </para>

          <para>. - Reference has been made to the apple and pear industry. Is it not a fact that the extra 5-J-d. a unit paid to the growers of apples since the present Government came into office accounts for a considerable proportion of the proposed increased expenditure? Growers in Tasmania are better off than they were previously, and, moreover, not so many apples are allowed to rot in that State as in previous years because of the provision of dehydration plants. Honorable senators have referred to .the shortage of apples in some of the mainland States, but they seem not to realize the difficulties associated with shipping apples from Tasmania. Had not Victoria drawn out of the acquisition scheme the position would not have been so- bad as honorable senators opposite have represented it to be. Some honor- able senators opposite would like to see the apple and pear industry thrown to the wolves. </para>

          <para>. - The Commonwealth has acquired wheat grown in Australia in each season since the war commenced. Payments to growers have been based on. the return from the pools concerned, and the Commonwealth Bank has financed advances on this basis. Advances by the bank have, therefore, been on a business basis, with assets held to cover the full amount of the indebtedness. With the introduction of the wheat quota plan, payments to growers for a quota of 3,000 bushels have been at the rate of 4s. a bushel. It is realized that this will involve a loss to the Commonwealth as the full amount payable at sidings plus the expenses of the pool concerned will exceed the proceeds from the sale of the wheat acquired. In respect of the surplus wheat not covered by quota payments there will not be any loss. The present provision is required to cover the- anticipated </para>

          <para>.- The present cost of importing cornsacks has increased in comparison with the figures prevailing last year. As part of the Government&#39;s price stabilization policy, the payment of a subsidy to enable sales of cornsacks to be made at, last year&#39;s prices has been approved. The importation of cornsacks is handled by the Australian Wheat Board, which in turn retails them to primary producers. The average cost of importation is 15s. 2^-d. per dozen sacks, whilst the retail price prevailing last year was 12s. 4&#163;d. per dozen sacks. It is proposed to fix the price to users during the 1943-44 season at this latter figure which entails an estimated subsidy payment of &#163;2S1,000. </para>

          <para>. - &#39;The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> should be given the earnest, attention of the Government. This year  we  have seen how nature controls production, but some governments seem to think that they can control nature. That is a great mistake. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> pointed out, the estimated wheat crop this year will be only 80,000,000 bushels, of which 65,000,000  will  be consumed  in  Australia. Should we again have a lessened natural production we may be in the position of not. having sufficient wheat to meet our own future needs. That has happened before, and wheat has had to be imported from the United States of America. The shortage is due almost entirely to the muddling in connexion with man-power. It would not have been necessary to provide any subsidy whatever to the dairying industry had the industry been handled in anything like a businesslike manner. The industry&#39;s difficulties arise solely from the fact that it has been depleted of man-power. In such circumstances dairy herds became useless because owners could not find the labour  required to make them profitable. The attitude of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. .Scully)</inline> in handling this matter reminds me of the story told of the city girl who visited her cousins in the country and for the first time saw cows being milked. Nest morning, when she was asked if she would like a glass of milk she declined, because she had seen the milk obtained from a dirty cow, whereas, at home in the city, she obtained her milk from a nice clean billy-can. Apparently, the Minister believes that milk merely comes out of billy-cans. No subsidy will bring dead cows back to life. I hope that the Government will give careful consideration to the representations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> and agree to license farmers instead of farms. We have reached the stage when we should allow farmers to grow as much wheat as they possibly can. If it were now placed on the overseas market it would bring as much as 6s. or 7s. a bushel. The day will again come when we shall have an open market for wheat, and as it is possible to keep wheat in good condition in storage, fanners should be given more freedom to produce than is the case at present. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has dealt fully with the position in the apple industry.  His  remarks show that in that industry also more freedom of action should be allowed to producers. </para>

In answer to a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> to-day we were informed that the wage prescribed for milkers is &#163;5 12s. 6d. a week. I do not care how much employees receive so long as the farmer himself is enabled to pay the wages awarded, and to make a fair living for himself and his family. However, a milker can milk only sixteen cows morning and evening, and on that basis the farmer cannot afford to pay the present award wage. </para>

            <para>- I have asked the Government on several previous occasions to clarify the position of share-farmers under the award, but the Government, apparently, cannot interpret its own regulations, with the result that the dairy-farmer and the share-farmer do not know where they stand. According to an opinion given by the SolicitorGeneral in Victoria a share-farmer must be paid a minimum of &#163;5 12s. 6d. a week, and should he earn less than the award prescribed he cannot contract himself out of the award. Therefore, he can claim from the owner of the farm the difference between the award rate and his actual earnings. Under those conditions it is obvious that many farmers will be ruined, particularly in a bad season when the share-farmer does not. make the basic wage. I contend that the Government should have permitted  an  increase of the price of butter. I urge the Government to review the subsidy to the industry in order to ensure that justice will be done to farmers as well as employees and share-farmers. </para>

          <para>. - Approval was recently given for the setting up of a Tasmanian industry expansion commission on lines similar to the Western Australian Industry Expansion Commission, the terms of reference of the commission being: First, to advise the Commonwealth Government on measures necessary to ensure the fullest and most effective use of Tasmania&#39;s industrial resources for war purposes; secondly, to serve in Tasmania as a Commonwealth advisory authority, cooperating with the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, and with State authorities in planning Tasmania&#39;s participation in post-war economic reconstruction; and, thirdly, to submit to the Commonwealth specific proposals for such industrial and related developments as are necessary for these purposes. It was proposed that the commission should consist of three nominees of the Commonwealth Government, and two nominees of the State Government, the  chairman  to be one of the Commonwealth nominees. In view of several developments, however, the establishment of the commission has been held over for the time being, and it has been proposed that the Department of Post-war Reconstruction and State Government departments and instrumentalities should collaborate directly with each other. </para>

          <para>. - In Division 204 we are asked to vote the sum of &#163;44,000 as Australia&#39;s contribution for the ensuing year to the League of Nations Secretariat. I should like to know whether the league is still functioning, and, if so, where are its headquarters situated, and what work is occupying its attention. In spite of all the fond hopes which we placed in the league after the last war, many of us believing that it would be the means of settling international disputes, it is largely the fault of that body that we are again at war. Last year, we voted &#163;34,000 for this purpose, and our actual expenditure was &#163;39,001. I should like to know what value we- expect to receive for this proposed vote for this year of &#163;44,000. I have studied the work of the league very closely. To come down to tintacks, it can be said that our belief in collective security and the idea that we should with others be the world&#39;s policemen, without even a baton or a gun, has proved to be our downfall. Our faith in that idea has brought us to our present pass. .The proposed vote is comparatively large, when we remember that for many years dozens of nations who are nominally members of the league did not pay their contributions but &#34; poled &#34; on the other nations, particularly Great Britain and the Dominions, who paid their dues. </para>

          <para>. -  The league is still functioning at its headquarters at Geneva, whilst branches have been established at Princeton University, United States of America, and the McGill University, Montreal. The work of the league comes under the following main headings : Publications of works on current economic events and tendencies is divided between Geneva and Princeton. Work in connexion with post-war economic problems is being carried out at Princeton. The league assists in two ways in combating the spread of epidemics: First, there is the epidemiological service whereby information regarding the incidence of epidemics is made available to all countries; secondly, the work in biological standardization is of proved value. Studies are being conducted with a view to improving general standards of health after the war. Work along other lines, including the control of drug traffic, is continuing. The International Labour Office is now functioning at Montreal. Other work concerns the registration of treaties and minorities, and that of the Mandates Commission and the International Court. The Supervisory Commission of the league meets at regular intervals, and is responsible, for the security and adoption of the league&#39;s budget. The commission points out that the league expresses in its three main institutions the aspirations towards peace, social justice and the observance of international law, and in the mast difficult circumstances is continuing work of great value to mankind. </para>

          <para>. - The proposed vote in respect of scientific and industrial research provides for an increase of staff of nearly 300, the vote in respect of investigations being more than &#163;100,000 greater than last year&#39;s appropriation. I should like details of the work being carried out in this field. &#34;What scientific and industrial research is being done with respect to certain stock diseases which to-day are destroying our flocks and herds? I refer particularly to Entero-toxaemia. which, I think, was first noticed in Western Australia, where it became most severe. To-day, that disease is prevalent in Victoria. So far as I know, no advance has been made in the efforts to stem the ravages of that disease. I have learned from departmental officers that the position is becoming very bad in the United States of America, where a high death-rate among sheep as well as lambs .is reported as the result of this disease. Some experts place their faith in inoculation. I have no faith in that method, because I have seen experiments carried out&#39;in my district by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research which proved to be inconclusive. I also hope that our research workers will devote more attention in the future to animal nutrition. </para>

Adding the amounts for Division 219 - Repatriation, Miscellaneous, and Division 220 - Maintenance Services, the total vote for the Department of Repatriation is &#163;940,000. I wish to say something regarding the organization and staff of the commission.. _ Before doing so, I should like to revert to my original comments on this year&#39;s Estimates with regard to the Department of the Army. Neither the Minister in charge of the hill nor the Minister representing that department has made any comment at all on a matter which I consider to be of  the  greatest importance to the  individual  as well as to the community. I know  that  it is the custom, when matters  are  brought up by members of Parliament, for their remarks to receive some sort of courteous attention. </para>
        <para>On this occasion I want to deal with the Repatriation Commission which, if not now, at  any  rate in  the  near future, will have a very large responsibility to meet in connexion with the community. On the 29th June last I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation a series of questions relating to the composition and functions of the Repatriation Commission. These questions are comprehensive in their character and will, with the answers, be found set out on pages 113-114 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> No. 16, issued on the 7th of this month. They are too long to repeat now. My inquiry was prompted by an uneasy feeling that, in view of the magnitude of the task ahead of it, the commission might be caught unequipped and unprepared, to meet it. </para>
        <para>I do not, at this stage, propose to review the whole field of repatriation, or the major problem - -rehabilitation, but rather to draw attention to those factors which, in my opinion, require immediate attention. In the first place, I want to express, as a result of knowledge and experience, my confidence in the capacity and zeal of the members of the board of commissioners. Nevertheless, I have the impression that they are being over-worked and find themselves, at the moment, tied down to the performance of routine matters that might well he relegated to others. At this stage there must be a volume of preparatory work and planning to be performed. These should not be delayed, and as the Minister for Repatriation has not yet thought fit to make the extra appointments to the board authorized  by  Parliament, I can see the future gravely prejudiced. It must, too, be borne in mind that whilst the commissioners plan and authorize in the terms of their powers, it is the  deputy  commissioners in the States who have to execute and who will have direct contact with the men and women discharged from the forces. Inevitably, new policies will be instituted, and I would like to be confident that that fact is known and appreciated, by the State deputies so that they may organize staffs, provide means and accommodation, and arrange institutions to meet increased and varied demands. </para>
        <para>I need not remind honorable senators that the numbers to be dealt with, in prospect, are double those of the last  great war, and, whilst casualties may not be greater - and so far that is suggested - other factors of complexity will arise demanding study and action. For these reasons I am led to suggest that one or more of the commissioners should visit the States for the purpose of inspecting preparatory measures and plans taken and made, instructing staffs, and, where necessary, arranging consultations with civic and other authorities. This cannot conveniently he done unless extra commissioners are appointed at an early date. Such appointments should be conferred upon men of known administrative capacity who also understand the basic structure of society, have human understanding, and, in addition, a personal knowledge of war and war atmosphere gained by active association with one of the services. </para>
        <para>I would recommend, too, the recall to the chairmanship of the commission of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norman</inline> Mighell, a man of marked capacity. </para>

            <para>- I cannot understand the mentality of the Minister for Health and Social Services, nor am I concerned with it at the moment. Hitherto the medical staff of the commission has been recruited and maintained in a haphazard fashion, and, whilst some excellent men have been secured, little encouragement or opportunity has been extended to them to broaden their clinical knowledge or even consultation within the staff itself. Indeed, there has been, in the departmental methods, a tendency- to convert them into clerks associated with records. This naturally has given rise to dissatisfaction, which has been expressed in various ways, and has led, amongst other things, to the institution of expensive and, in some measure, unsatisfactory appeal tribunals, which, with a properly organized, highly trained and zealous staff, rarely would be necessary. I do not blame the Government for the existing conditions. In my opinion, the commission is an excellent body, but its functions could be improved and that is why I am making these suggestions. We must proceed by evolution. I am informed that to-day, after a lapse of 2S years, no fewer than 29,000 veterans of the war of 1914-18 are still under treatment by the commission. The number of medical officers on the commission&#39;s staff is 62. Nobody knows when this war will end, or even the number of men and .women who ultimately will be involved in it. Therefore, the field for conjecture is immense, and now is the time to institute and organize a medical service which, by reason of its extensive experience in medicine, surgery, hygiene and institutional management, will constitute a valuable and major adjunct to any national health service. The conditions attached to appointments to that service should be such as to attract the best men and women available. A start could be made now by calling for applications from service personnel and establishing a nucleus. As a further preparatory measure, I suggest that a plan prescribing the functions, organizations and conditions of appointment to such a service should be the work of a committee composed of the medical chiefs of the Navy, Army and Air Force, aided and strengthened by two civil representatives. In the matters with which I have been dealing, I have a great personal interest of long: standing, and I trust that what I have said to-day will be given the fullest consideration by the Government. T foresee in the work of the Repatriation Commission something which, if it be done properly, will be of extraordinary benefit to the nation as well as to those unfortunate men and women who have to seek medical treatment as a result of their war service. </para>

            <para>- In my opinion, under no conditions should that be the case. That may be the Army method but it certainly is not mine. For instance, let us suppose that an Army unit is stationed in a certain locality and that several individuals of that unit steal some fowls from a nearby farm. Surely the honorable senator would not suggest that the entire unit should be punished for the misdeeds of the few. There are many cases of that kind. I know the whole history of the case to which the honorable senator has referred. The Army authorities claim that they occupied only part of the building concerned and were not responsible for the damage done by service personnel. In regard to these matters our position in this country is rather difficult, inasmuch as conditions operating during the last war were vastly different from those that are being experienced now. Responsible officers have been appointed to investigate looting that has occurred in Darwin and in the territories under the control of the Commonwealth by our own service personnel. </para>

The net weight of originating air mail correspondence conveyed by internal services in 1942-43 showed such a tremendous increase over the previous two years that it is still not possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy what will be the position in 1943-44. The estimate which has been given is based on an average of the mail carried during the four&#34; months, March to June, 1943. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">I</inline>should like some information also in regard to inland mail services. In the past, the practice has been to let contracts for these services, and I know that in some oases contractors have undertaken services covering as many as 400 miles a week, for only &#163;50 a year. That has been done in order to secure priority to run on certain country roads and carry parcels, with the result that the mail services suffered. I suggest to the Postmaster-General the advisability of paying for these inland services a remuneration sufficient to enable the contractor to concentrate upon his job of currying mail without, also running a package and parcel delivery. I suggest also that the department should investigate the possibility of converting some long-distance inland services to airmail services after the war. There are many mail runs in the back country of from 100 to 300 miles, and a light aeroplane could probably do them as cheaply as, and more efficiently, certainly more quickly, than they are done to-day by motor lorries and motor cars. </para>

I am not surprised that the vote was not expended, if the entertainment of visitors comes under the control of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> seeing that he is a cold-water fanatic; and a nonsmoker. &#34;Who were the visitors entertained last year, and in what way were they entertained?

          <para>. - The sum of &#163;2,S00 is proposed to be voted for rabbit and dingo extermination, I suppose that that expenditure applies only to the Australian Capital Territory. The Government should consider the extermination of dingoes on a national scale, and should pay a uniform bonus throughout the Commonwealth for the destruction of this pest. The menace has become serious, because heavy losses are being experienced by stock-owners throughout Australia as the result of the ravages of the dingo. At present the problem is approached in a haphazard manner. Some local governing bodies pay 10s. for each dingo killed, whilst others pay 15s. The Government should make a determined drive against the pest. </para>

Even if the Government intended to do so, it has no power to act on the lines suggested by the honorable senator, because the matter is under the control of the State authorities. The Government of Queensland spends large sum? on the extermination of dingoes and rabbits.

          <para>.- Petty thieving and vandalism have not increased recently in the territory. An examination of the crime sheets for the year ended the 30th September, 1942. shows that the total crimes reported in the territory, including petty thieving, was 413. The cases of vandalism reported to the police during that period numbered 49. The crimes reported, including petty thieving, for the year ended the 30th September, 1943, totalled 368, and the number of cases in which vandalism was reported was 2S. Of the total number of 368 cases of crime reported for the year ended the 30th September last, 165 related to thefts of bicycles. Of the total of 413 cases of crimes reported for the year ended the 30th September, 1942, 209 concerned thefts of bicycles. </para>

            <para>- I refer to the practice of walking over lawns, which cost thousands of pounds to maintain, to such a degree that eventually they are destroyed. That is a common fault of the residents of Canberra, and members of Parliament are no exception to the rule. Canberra is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, yet, despite our efforts to preserve its reputation as a garden city, the residents, unfortunately, do their best, in many instances, to destroy its beauty. Only recently I had to take severe action because private persons had been cutting the blossoms from trees and shrubs without regard to the damaging effect of their action. I had to appoint rangers in order to prevent the practice. The children of well-to-do residents have been found destroying electric light globes in the street lamps and the parents arc indifferent to the fact that they should prevent their children from doing it. Cases of that kind are probed from the psychological angle, and we often find that the delinquents come from homes from which one would expect different behaviour. </para>

          <para class="block">Details of the proposed expenditure will be found on pages 298-308 of the printed Estimates. In accordance with the desire of the Government to divert all resources of materials and man-power to war purposes, expenditure on civil works has now been reduced to the minimum necessary to meet essential and urgent requirements. The estimate of &#163;845,000 for civil aviation works make provision for electrical and other equipment and works at civil aerodromes which are now being used extensively by the Allied forces. The amount of &#163;3,242,000 required for postal works is also mainly dictated by war conditions and the urgent demands of the service departments and war industries. The total expenditure on postal works for 1942-43 was &#163;2,903,000. An amount of &#163;150,000 is included for hospitals and other institutions for the Repatriation Department. The cost of military hospitals is charged to Army votes. Because of man-power difficulties there has been a considerable curtailment of expenditure on civil works in the territories of the Commonwealth. The amount&#39; of &#163;118,000 which has been included for the Northern Territory provides mainly for the completion of essential works which are now mostly required for military purposes. The estimates of the Australian Capital Territory provide only for urgent works which are within the capacity of available resources. The proposed appropriation of &#163;4,870,000 does not include works for defence and war services, as separate provision for this expenditure is made under war votes. Any details required regarding specific works will be supplied to honorable senators by Ministers in the committee stage. </para>

          <para class="block">The main purpose of the bill is to provide for the issue of national savings stamps in. connexion with the raising of Commonwealth war loans. It has been found that the most convenient method for wage-earners to subscribe to loans by instalments is by means of deductions from periodical payments of wages. Where employees are continuously engaged on the one payroll, this presents no difficulty and deductions are made regularly until payment for bonds has been completed. There are, however, numbers of people whose employment is constantly changing, and in these cases deductions from salary is not practicable. In order to provide for these subscribers and also for those who wish to set aside small amounts as they become available, it has been decided to introduce the 5s. national savings stamp. Folders will be provided to contain 40 stamps, the face value of which will amount to &#163;10. These may be accepted in payment for treasury bonds. Alternatively, stamps to the face value of &#163;2. or multiples thereof, may be accepted in payment of instalments for bonds. National savings stamps may be paid to the credit of depositors&#39; accounts with all savings banks. The banks will, in turn, exchange the stamps for war loan securities. The stamps will be on sale at all savings banks, money order post offices and such other selling points as may be decided from time to time. This measure makes provision for the protection of war savings stamps and national savings stamps against forgery and uttering similar to that given to treasury-bills under the relative provision of the Treasury Bills Act. </para>

They even mentioned dates, and expressed the view that we should meet at least every month. Now, however,  that they have complete control, they have altered their attitude, and propose to adjourn Parliament to a day of which members are to be notified. </para>

        <para>Apart from that, it is apparent to every one inside and outside Parliament that the people expect it to meet as frequently as it possibly can, because, in spite of what happened recently, they have grave doubts whether the Government will be able to carry on successfully if it has an uninterrupted period of three months free from interference. Ministers, I think, are aware of their own limitations. They should know that they are not absolutely infallible, and should welcome the fact that honorable senators on this side are prepared every now and then to tell diem the right way to go. In order that we may have a full opportunity to do so, and to assist the Government in every possible way, Parliament should be called together at fairly frequent intervals. This motion is not up to the usual form of the late Leader of the Senate. He would have said, &#34; We shall meet even if the heavens fall&#34;; or &#34;We shall not meet if the heavens fall &#34;. I should like the Minister to be a little more definite^ and to say to senators on this side, is particular, and to the country generally: &#34; We are not going to adjourn Parliament any longer than is necessary to enable us to prepare our legislation, and will consult the Houses within the next month or two about the difficult problems with which we have to deal &#34;. </para>

          <para>.- As I did not have an opportunity to speak on the budget, I desire to bring to the notice of the Government the contents of a letter which I have received from a friend of mine in the Australian Imperial Force - a major serving in the northern part of Australia. He suggests that members of Parliament representing all political parties should visit the Northern Territory and other battle .areas to see exactly what is going on there. He complains that in the Australian Army there are three different sections. The first, he says, is the &#34;administration  society comprising the men who returned from the Middle East, and who hardly condescend to talk to those who through no fault of their own, have not served in the Middle East. He himself has been on the active strength of the Army for six years, but he says that the majority of promotions go to the men who have been to the Middle East,  I  whether they ares qualified or not. According to him the men from the Middle East hardly condescend to talk to members of the Militia, or to those who, through no fault of their own, have not had the opportunity to serve overseas. He himself was anxious to go overseas when the war began, but was retained in Australia on account of the special nature of the work that he is doing, and so was not given the opportunity to serve abroad. He says that the &#34; administration society &#34; will hardly mix with the Militia, although some of the Militia have seen as much service as have those from the Middle East. Members of Parliament should have the necessary facilities provided for them to go through the battle areas, the camps up north, and the different Australian Imperial Force stations, so that they may see for themselves what the position is. I hope that the Government will agree to provide those who are willing to go with travelling facilities to enable them to mix with the men and explain the difficulties under which the Government and the country are working. Such a party would do very good work, especially if it were composed of members of all parties. </para>

          <para>. - As I did not have an opportunity to speak on the budget, I wish to refer to two matters. One relates to a question which I asked the Minister some days ago about officers above the rank of sergeant in the Volunteer Defence Corps not being allowed to drive a motor car. These men would like the privilege of driving themselves, and it is considered also that in Tasmania alone at least twenty men could be released for some other occupation if this permission were given. If a member of the Volunteer Defence Corps of the rank of warrant-officer or higher is now caught by one of their transport inspectors driving a motor car, he is courtmartialled. There should he nothing to prevent these men from driving motor cars themselves when they have to go from one place to another on military duty. They are quite agreeable to do it. In one particular camp three motor cars are available, but the officers are not allowed to drive themselves. They have to get men to do about six hours driving a week for them. I hope that the Minister will take notice of what I have said, and thus save expenditure, and also release about twenty men in Tasmania alone for other work. </para>

        <para>Recently I asked the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> which department controls the Civil Constructional Corps, on what date <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Summers</inline> was appointed in Tasmania, and the number of men transferred from Tasmania to the mainland. Since the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Summers</inline> the number is less than 300. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Summers</inline> has been in Tasmania for almost six months, and no doubt he is receiving a substantial salary.  His  offices are of a high standard, and it is evident that the rental of them would not be low. They are situated in the heart of a capital city. He has a staff to assist him and the use of a motor car. No doubt, he has other work to do besides his Civil Constructional Corps activities, but a statement on the matter should be made by the Minister for the Interior in order to clear the atmosphere. I do not wish to he critical. No doubt the expenses that are being incurred are perfectly justified, but there is an impression abroad that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Summers</inline> is engaged solely upon Civil Constructional Corps work. </para>
        <para>I hope that Cabinet will reach an early decision in regard to the future of the Commonwealth Powers Bill. Unless the Commonwealth Parliament be given sufficient power to deal fully with all phases of post-war reconstruction, when the war is over conditions in this country will be chaotic. At present we have in operation elaborate systems of control over the price and marketing of many essentia&#93; commodities, particularly primary products, but that control depends entirely upon national security regulations, which will become invalid when the war ends. The Commonwealth will he unable to pursue&#39; an effective policy of industrial decentralization unless it be given increased power, and wider authority will be required also to deal adequately with social and industrial legislation. For the information of honorable senators, I shall cite an example of the state of affairs which exists to-day and which must be remedied. For a long while, coal-miners in Tasmania who, in the past three years, have worked conscientiously, and with very little absenteeism and few stoppages, have been endeavouring to secure the passage through the Tasmanian Parliament of pensions legislation. A bill meeting their approval was passed by the Legislative Assembly, but when it reached the Legislative Council it was subjected to a vicious attack led by one member of that legislature who represented the interests of the mine-owners. The result was that the measure was rejected. That sort of thing is happening also in the other States. If a referendum is to be held upon the subject of granting wider powers to the Commonwealth Parliament, I suggest to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> that the questions to be submitted to the people should include one relating to the abolition of the State Legislative Councils. Alternatively, the constitutions of the States should be amended to provide that -the Legislative Councils shall be elected by full adult franchise. We in this country tend to pride ourselves upon our democratic institutions, but in this respect at least we are undemocratic because State Legislative Councils are elected by only one section of the people, and that section is a very small minority indeed. The result is that any liberal legislation which may be introduced and passed by the Legislative Assemblies is almost certain to be rejected by the higher legislatures. Generally speaking, the Legislative Councils are composed of gentlemen who were old even at the time of their election, and whose ideas are 50 years behind the times. </para>
        <para>If we hope to make any progress at all, an attempt must be made to alter the outlook of the States towards the Commonwealth Powers Bill. I urge that a referendum on this matter be taken at an early date and that it include a question relating to the future of State Legislative Councils. </para>

          <para>The &#34;  Fuzzy-Wuzzy  angels &#34; have been victims of shabby treatment and will require a comprehensive plan of social betterment. It has taken this war to make many people realize that the &#34;  Fuzzy-Wuzzy  angels &#34; are worthy charges of the Commonwealth. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>The Minister&#39;s charge of shabby treatment is quite unfounded, and is a gross libel on that great man, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hubert</inline> Murray, who was administrator of Papua for many years. Our treatment of the native races in Papua has been humane and just, and is a bright spot in Australian history. The same thing applies to the administration of our mandated territories, and I suggest to the Minister for Transport and External Territories that he might profitably devote some time to reading the many illuminating annual reports prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hubert</inline> Murray, and by the administrators of the mandated territories, and forwarded to the League of Nations in Geneva. The Minister&#39;s statement is also a libel on the work of many hundreds of brave yoting Australians who have given their lives succouring the natives of our mandated territories, and to the many hundreds of others who have ruined their health performing medical and mission work in those areas. I repeat that to say that the natives of Papua, or of any territories over which we have a mandate, have been treated shabbily is a libellous statement which could emanate only as the result of ignorance. The Minister would do well to read some of the many interesting publications that are to be found in the Library on the work that has been accomplished amongst the New Guinea natives. I refer particularly to books by authors such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jack</inline> Hydes, whom we had the privilege of meeting here in Canberra some years ago, and who gave his life to their service. If the Minister will only visit the external territories he will see for himself that his statement is quite inaccurate and unfounded. </para>

          <para>. -I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the state of the federal members&#39; rooms at Perth. With the membership of the Labour party at its present strength, the arrangement of the accommodation is entirely unsuitable. Consideration must also be given to the fact that Western Australia now has a woman member of the Senate. When one travels round other cities of the Commonwealth and sees the provision that has been made for members of the Commonwealth Parliament, one is inclined to believe that the Western Australians are being left out in the cold. There are two large rooms which could easily be altered. The remaining accommodation is small and I have had the unfortunate experience of endeavouring to give confidential interviews to people in the presence of several other honorable senators. In these circumstances, people hesitate to speak frankly. Actually, the building is one of the finest in the Commonwealth but the office accommodation for federal members is quite inadequate. The cost of re-arranging the accommodation would not be very great. </para>
