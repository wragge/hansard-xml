<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 31 August 1985 of Sir Macfarlane Burnet O.M., A.K., K.B.E., places on record its recognition and esteem for his meritorious public service and unique contribution to medical science, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and the members of his family.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, in both Houses of Parliament we customarily offer condolence motions on the deaths of political colleagues and have only rarely moved motions of condolence for distinguished Australians who have not joined the Parliament. Such motions have been passed for Dame Nellie Melba and for Sir John Monash, and it is my privilege today to propose that the Senate pass a similar motion for Sir Macfarlane Burnet.</PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about Sir Macfarlane Burnet we are dealing with an Australian with a large and ambitious vision. His great work has made life safer and better for generations of people in this country and around the world. His career was distinguished by intellectual brilliance, by unswerving diligence and dedication and by a determination to push forward the boundaries of medicine and science. The range of Sir Macfarlane's work was daunting. He moved from one field to another, innovating and making improvements in every field he addressed. Today we remember especially his pioneering work in the study of viruses, including the investigation of influenza and the examination of polio, Murray River encephalitis and smallpox-like viruses. Sir Macfarlane's peers fully recognised his unique talents. He was a Nobel Prize winner; he won the Copley Medal; he won a royal medal from the Royal Society of London; he was President of the Australian Academy of Science; and he was knighted. These honours were all due and proper recognition for outstanding service.</PARA>
<PARA> It is proper that we should honour Sir Macfarlane Burnet, as Australia is fortunate indeed to have enjoyed the benefits of his research, his teaching, his guidance and his experience. We have lost one of our most intelligent countrymen. We cannot make up for that loss but we can indicate to his widow and family, his colleagues and the scientific community both in Australia and overseas that we respect, honour and commemorate what he did for all Australians and the world beyond.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition wishes to associate itself with the motion which has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) and supports the words of commendation which he has spoken in support of that motion. We are acknowledging a man who made an extraordinary contribution to Australia. He was the first Australian living and working in this country to be awarded a Nobel Prize and the Opposition believes that it is appropriate that he should receive this mark of respect from the national Parliament. On behalf of the Opposition I express sympathy to his widow and his children. If I may add a personal note, I express sympathy to his son Ian who worked in Papua New Guinea when I was there and with whom I spent a good deal of time. The Opposition supports this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Party of Australia wishes to be associated with this motion of condolence. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, has said, seldom do we move a motion of condolence in this chamber for people other than members of parliament, but such was the stature of Sir Macfarlane Burnet that we have done so today. He was a great man in many aspects, a man who stood astride the pages of modern history. Australia is really a small country, but men of the calibre of Sir Macfarlane Burnet have given us international standing. His work has been recognised around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He was a man from humble beginnings. I think it was only last Sunday on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Science Show that a complete program was devoted to an interview with him. He gave a great discourse on his work and his humble upbringing. One was able, in no small way, to ferret out the great contribution he had made to medical science, not only in Australia but to the world in general.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with deep sorrow that I rise to support this motion of condolence. I cannot pretend to speak on behalf of the several medical graduates in this chamber- no doubt they will speak for themselves-but it is fair to say that each one of us, on our journey through medical training, was able to study the books written by Mac Burnet, to be taught the wisdom he gave to the world, and to share the pleasure that an Australian medical scientist achieved such eminence and was, in fact, our first home grown Nobel Laureate. His work on immunology and on viruses opened up a new era for the world. Much of what is possible today in the field of immunology stems from the work which Mac Burnet did overseas and in Australia. He was not only a scientist, he was a medical scientist. He was the father and the path-blazer of a great trail of Australian medical scientists, who continue to do great honour to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be inappropriate, in this motion of condolence, if we did not mention the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne over which Mac Burnet presided for so many years and which he led to such a great and pre-eminent place in Australian medical research. Many people will have heard the words of Sir Gustav Nossal, who I suppose has the best of both worlds-a Sydney education and a Melbourne appointment. Sir Gustav Nossal paid his own tribute to the life and work of Mac Burnet in a very eloquent way:</PARA>
<PARA> He has shaped and led medical research not only in this country but for much of the world. His life was one of glorious achievement and his heritage is one which belongs to all the world.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Watsonia Army Barracks contains electronic communication facilities, operated by Australian and American personnel, that gives the United States the ability to pin-point Soviet nuclear submarines, hidden in the Oceans.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. This would make it possible for U.S. killer-submarines to destroy all Soviet nuclear submarines, while the U.S. nuclear submarines launch their missiles in a `first strike' attack.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Finance aware that some banks, including the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, are effectively charging higher housing interest rates by imposing or increasing service or administrative charges in order to sidestep the 13.5 per cent ceiling on home interest rates? Can the Minister say what the Government intends to do about this mechanism, which amounts to no less than a de facto deregulation of housing interest rates? Further, will the Minister give an assurance that the Government will neither abolish the ceiling of 13.5 per cent on home loan interest rates nor permit banking institutions to achieve effective abolition of the ceiling by the use of service fees or other similar devices?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was aware that some banks, at least, had imposed loan service charges. Specifically, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank have imposed a service charge of about $25 for a home loan. The increase in the rate of interest for a $30,000 home loan at that rate of charge is just over 0.08 per cent, so it represents a minuscule increase in the interest rate. The Government's general view is that interest rates are a matter for the commercial judgment of financial institutions, but it has retained the ceiling on housing loan bank interest rates of 13.5 per cent. Some financial institutions-one, at least-are presently charging the maximum rate of 13.5 per cent. Others charge rates which vary down to 12.5 per cent. The increase-the de facto increase, if one likes-in interest rates, due to a $25 home loan charge, as I have already said, is a minuscule increase to whatever rate of interest a particular financial institution is charging. There are no Government proposals either to change or to abolish the ceiling. I stress again that with the exception of one or two financial institutions the ceiling is not operative. However, the Government will keep under review the home loan service charge to ensure that it is not used as a surrogate interest rate increase. A fee of $25, which I am advised is the approximate fee charged by the ANZ Bank and the Commonwealth Bank, does not seem to be unreasonable as a service charge for a loan.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Specifically, those criticisms dealt with the reintegration into the Public Service of officers returning after they had worked for a period with members of the House of Representatives or senators. The reintegration process is designed to ensure that such people are not disadvantaged in their subsequent Public Service careers. It also ensures that they cannot be subject to any political interference.</PARA>

To date six cases have been considered by the Committee, three of which served a period working for Ministers, one for a Government back bench member of parliament and two for Opposition senators. The public complaints about the reintegration process have begun only since the return to the Australian Public Service of a staff member who was previously attached to the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, even though there were previous cases involving staff of Liberal senators, the subsequent Public Service levels of whom were determined by the Reintegration Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Robertson is astute, as usual, in asking a question about a very important matter to which I answer that manufacturing industry investment was certainly shaky in the early part of the economic recovery but there is now cause for a more optimistic outlook. Total new fixed capital expenditure in real terms was around 4 per cent in 1984-85-a marked pick up from recent years-and is estimated to be a little higher this financial year. Manufacturing, in particular, has had a marked rise in investment and for the June quarter 1985 over the June quarter 1984 manufacturing investment rose by 23 per cent. Intentions over the coming year seem to indicate a better figure than that, so the recovery is definitely beginning to filter into manufacturing investment in a positive way. Taken with recent encouraging figures on manufacturing production and productivity, there is room, as I said, for cautious optimism. Naturally, much depends on the state of the economy generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Government can say, again with a cautious degree of pride and achievement, that the growth rates which have been sustained since this Government was elected to office and which will continue in the forthcoming year, give cause for optimism.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Foreman asked me about the generosity of the repatriation system which has been in operation, of course, since World War I. It is perfectly true that the repatriation system is the most generous in the world. There should be a bipartisan view on maintaining that degree of generosity. For example, the Government allocates between two and 20 times as much of its Budget to spending on veterans as any other comparable country. The Government spends between three and 20 times as much on each surviving veteran and it pays between one and a half and six times as many compensatory payments, that is, disability and war widows' pensions, per thousand surviving veterans. That, of course, is a commitment which has been continued over the years by respective governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, Senator Foreman asked me a question in respect of the economic rationalists, or the dries as they are now called, who seem to be predominant in the Liberal Party. I suppose the problem of whether policies enunciated by sections of the new element in the Liberal Party will be implemented will need to be examined by the veteran community. For example, it appears that Mr Howard is on record as saying that the Ministry should be reduced from 27 Ministers to 23. Therefore, one is entitled to pose the question whether the Department of Veterans' Affairs might be abolished if such a proposal to reduce the number of ministries eventuated.</PARA>
<PARA> We know, of course, that Mr Howard is committed very strongly to reducing the deficit. If he were to reduce the deficit by some $2 billion it would mean, on a pro rata basis, that my Department would be required to make cuts in excess of $100m. As we have heard from Senator Messner and other spokespersons for the Opposition parties, the Opposition intends to abolish the assets test. That would cost my Department another $40m. We are looking down the barrel at likely cuts of $140m should a new dry, Tory-type government come to office, by some mischance, in 1988.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer announced generous changes to the secondary assistance scheme which pays an allowance to students from low income families to enable them to complete the last two years of schooling. The maximum level of that allowance will be lifted from $23 to $35 a week in 1986. That is the first step in the Government's plan to increase these allowances until they are equivalent to the unemployment benefit for the same age group. As Senator Morris's question suggests, it is important that all students eligible for this dramatically increased assistance are informed of this. Consequently, through my Department of Education I have made a number of arrangements which I hope will ensure that young people who may be considering the possibility of staying on at school, but may be worried about their financial support, will be aware of what is offered to them and will be able to get the assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Immediately after the Budget my Department distributed 3,500 sets of explanatory statements, including detailed statements on the increases in allowances and benefits to the media, government and non-government education authorities, teacher and parent organisations and many other interest groups. Currently, the Department is preparing additional publicity material including a detailed information booklet, publicity brochures and posters. These will be distributed to all secondary schools and to all interest groups and education authorities to ensure that as many students as possible are able to benefit from the increased allowances.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the SAS application form will be distributed to all secondary schools and an information card will be distributed to people in receipt of family allowance benefits for children turning 16, because at 16 years of age the students will become eligible for SAS depending upon income tests. This method of publicising schemes through the family allowance payment has proved effective in the past. I have written to the Minister for Finance seeking additional funds to publicise the SAS benefits further through advertisements. The Department will also continue to publicise the SAS through metropolitan and provincial media and by sending representatives to attend career nights, meetings of school guidance officers and other people who have regular contact with students and their parents. In conclusion, if any members from either side of the Senate are interested in having access to this publicity material to advise constituents, they are very welcome to seek it from the Department.</PARA>

I ask: Is it a fact that Transport Workers Union members are striking because they refuse to accept a decision of the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to the effect that drivers and supervisors within the Public Service have already received wage increases in accordance with their due and that no case has been made out for any further pay adjustment? Is it a fact that the only way in which the Government can effectively tackle industrial blackmail by its own employees, such as that now taking place and the bans applied to revenue collections earlier this year, is for it to restore the Fraser Government's 1977 Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act? Is it not a fact that the Government is simply powerless to restore proper public services in these circumstances and must resort to pathetic ministerial bleatings for the union to stop it? Finally, I ask: Will the Government reinstate the CE(EP) Act or are its hands tied by the recently renegotiated sweetheart deal it did with the unions, otherwise known as the prices and incomes accord?</PARA></TALK.START>

I will refer the rest of the question to the Minister for Territories and endeavour to obtain an answer for Senator Lewis, insofar as it requires an answer in relation to matters of fact. The question was embellished at the end by a fair slab of rhetoric about such matters as the restoration of the 1977 Fraser Government legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a question which the Opposition keeps asking. `How else are you to control these people?' asks Senator Lewis. I remind Senator Lewis again that whether he likes it or not-he will not like it and he is going to cop it in the next minute or two-the level of industrial disputation in this country is at its lowest for 17 years. It was at its highest in the last decade in 1982 under the Fraser Government. The Fraser Government introduced the legislation which Senator Lewis, flushed with the success of his survival on the front bench, now raises in this Parliament as the path for the future of the Liberal Party of Australia in opposition-interminably in opposition, I am afraid. Senator Lewis goes back to 1977 and talks about this legislation as some model which will solve all the problems. It did not solve any of the problems when the Opposition was last in government. Senator Chaney knows that it did not because it did not help him much in his dispute. The record of the Opposition when in government in respect of these matters was abysmal. This Government has, over two years, articulated a different approach to those questions. It has achieved results by that different process. The only person who does not seem to understand it is Senator Lewis. God help the people of Canberra with the new Howard spokesman on Territories in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was a clearing house for curriculum studies relating to changes in secondary education to keep more young people in the system and to prepare them better for the work force. I understand that the reason for the finishing of that project had nothing to do with the Government's decision to stretch the PEP funds over two years but, rather, was a decision of the Australian National University, which had been host of this project, not to continue it. I have been pursuing the matter but I understand that the ANU, which of course is an autonomous institution, no longer wishes to be involved in this project. I should add that I have raised with my Department the possibility of the Department taking over the clearing house functions.

Those calls, ironically, are most frequently made by people who simultaneously advance proposals to increase expenditure. I have in mind principally, of course, the most prominent members of the Opposition. Specifically, I note that a resolution which was passed at the Liberal Party Federal Council meeting, which I think was held in July, called for a cut in expenditure of 4 per cent as a proportion of gross domestic product, which on last year's outlays is more than $8 billion. I am ever alert for, of course, and eager to receive helpful suggestions about how government expenditure might be cut without seriously affecting the quality of life in Australia or the economic growth that we have been enjoying over the last few years, ever since the previous Government was ignominiously dismissed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that that Liberal Party Federal Council resolution was supported by the then Leader and then Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party-and, as far as I am aware, by all members of the Liberal Party except perhaps Steele Hall, Mr Macphee and a few dozen other people-I wrote to Mr Howard on 1 August, drawing his attention to that point and asking whether he would care to nominate a list of cuts totalling $8 billion from last year's outlays which I would then consider or put to the Expenditure Review Committee and the Cabinet. I am still waiting for a reply.</PARA>

I am still waiting for a reply to that letter. Although Mr Howard has publicly condemned others who say that expenditure should be cut without specifying where it should be cut, I still have not received any reply to the Press statement or the letter which I wrote. Since Senator Messner has done nothing to offend the Sydney Stock Exchange, and he is now the shadow Minister for Finance, I will also send a copy to him and invite his suggestions as to how $8 billion may be cut from outlays.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I can answer off the top of my head whether it is feasible in the physical, mechanical sense, although an obvious implication is that there would be a huge influx of students into institutions. So, prima facie, it would appear that it is not possible, even in the physical, mechanical sense, to do what the present Leader of the Opposition suggested. However, based on the assumption that the cost of providing this tuition for that number of people was the same as the average cost of providing tuition in technical and further education colleges at present, I can tell Senator Jones and anybody else who is interested that the Opposition Leader's proposal would cost $600m a year in additional outlays if the unemployed were to spend two and a half days a week, or 50 per cent of a full time course, at a TAFE college. If they were to do it at a college of advanced education or university the cost would be appreciably higher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is just another example of ill-considered ideological prescriptions for vast increases in government spending in a wild and scattergun manner. By contrast, the Government does recognise the importance of youth education and training to develop skills for young people which will benefit them and society as a whole. That recognition was embodied in the youth policy announced by the Prime Minister on Budget night. So the contrast between the two parties on this question is that, whereas the Opposition Leader shoots from the hip in a wild commitment for a minimum additional $600m of expenditure, the Government planned in a rational and disciplined way.</PARA>
<PARA> If I may offer a little more gratuitous advice to Senator Messner, who, according to Senator Rae, by grace of the Sydney Stock Exchange has replaced him as the Opposition spokesman for Finance, I suggest that he try to restrain his Leader from his propensity for irresponsible spending proposals lest he lumber the Liberal Party Opposition with yet another prospective $10 billion deficit.</PARA>

<PARA> Dr and Mrs Williamson were kidnapped near Quetta in Baluchistan, Pakistan, on 18 May. Dr Williamson, who is a hydrologist, is employed by an Australian company on contract to the World Bank. He was working in Baluchistan and living in Quetta when the couple were abducted. The Williamsons were originally abducted by members of the Sasooli tribe living in an area straddling the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. In exchange for the couple's freedom, the release from prison of a Sasooli tribal leader was initially demanded. Since then the situation surrounding the kidnapping has become confused and it now seems possible that the Williamsons are no longer being held by the Sasoolis. Information of relevance is hard to acquire and almost impossible to check. It does appear, however, that the Williamsons are being held inside Afghanistan.</PARA>
<PARA> Primary carriage of efforts to locate the Williamsons and secure their release, unharmed, has of course been with the Government of Pakistan, which has pursued its responsibilities with diligence. Australian officials have kept closely in touch with the Pakistanis, and to that end, an officer of the Embassy in Islamabad has visited Quetta on a regular basis since the kidnapping. Information has also been sought from a number of other sources. Additionally, the Government has officially sought the consular assistance of the governments of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, as well as the assistance of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the World Bank. Friendly governments with representatives in Afghanistan have been asked for their help but no hard information has yet resulted from these approaches. Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs have kept in daily contact with Dr and Mrs Williamson's families in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA> I am extremely concerned, as is the Foreign Minister, that, after almost four months, we appear to be no closer to a resolution of this matter than we were before.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just conscious of the length of the answer; I am not trying to do anything else. Senator Sanders asked a number of questions of me on 21 August but they can be summarised into two: Firstly, whether the Government was aware that GEOSAT satellite tests would collect gravitational data to improve the accuracy of Trident II submarine launched ballistic missiles? Secondly, was the Government aware that the GEOSAT satellite is being funded by the Trident II project? As I indicated, my answer to the first question remains unchanged but my second answer requires correction. As to the first question I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the Geosat validation flight series that has just concluded is not directly related to any missile tests . . . The Government certainly does not deny that there is a wide range of uses, civil and military, for Geosat data but . . . our co-operation is provided on the understanding that that data will provide benefit for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In my answer I indicated what some of those benefits would be. I reiterate that all data from the GEOSAT validation tests is available to the Australian Government. I should further add in this respect that after giving the answer my attention was drawn to the DMS Market Intelligence Report material on GEOSAT which appears to have been the basis for Senator Sanders's question and which has also been the basis for a good deal of media speculation. DMS market intelligence report on GEOSAT is, however, deficient in that it portrays the sole mission of data collection as relating to the improved accuracy of SLBMs. It ignores the many military and civilian purposes for which GEOSAT data is collected. It is also the case that the DMS report is not quite up to date on funding arrangements. I will come back to that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Pentagon has described GEOSAT derived geodesy data as having broad civil and military application and only indirect application to programs such as the Trident II program. As Dr Ball of the Australian National University recently said of the P-3 validation flights, the relationship with the United States nuclear programs is so marginal that there is no reason for public concern. My answer to the second question requires correction. I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The GEOSAT program . . . is not connected to the Trident program funding.</PARA>
<PARA>That aspect of my answer was incorrect in that it referred to what will be practised from October this year but it did not address earlier arrangements. As I have mentioned, under the 1985-86 financial year Budget request, which was submitted to the United States Congress in January this year, for the next four financial years from 1 October 1985 the GEOSAT program will be funded under the Defence Meteorological Satellite program-DMSP. This arrangement will be in keeping with the broad multifaceted nature of GEOSAT's function. That, of course, is the explanation of why I misled the Senate in giving my previous answer. I was confusing the future with the past. As a matter of budgetary convenience the previous practice was that the United States Navy requested and received funds for the GEOSAT program as a Trident II Budget line item. I regret that my previous answer on funding arrangements related to the Budget request currently before Congress and did not address the preceding funding arrangements.</PARA>

The tests are definitely connected in terms of gathering data to improve the accuracy of the Trident II missiles and, as such, using the bases in Australia to further these tests and to further the accuracy of the Trident II goes against the pledge of the Hawke Government not to allow Australian bases to be used in this manner.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The personal explanation concerns question No. 412 on the Notice Paper which has been brought to my attention. That question, by Senator Bolkus, mentions my name in a context which purports to suggest a possible misuse of the community employment project scheme. I wish to clarify my position in this matter and to acquaint the Senate with the facts relating to this question as the question contains several inaccuracies. Paragraph (2) of the question asks:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is Senator D. Vigor a member of the Board of the Directors of ACE Television.</PARA>
<PARA>I am indeed a director of Adelaide Community and Educational Television. I am proud to be its current Vice-President. I was Foundation Chairman in 1978 of the organisation which grew into Adelaide Community and Educational Television Inc and I am totally committed to its aim of bringing public television to Adelaide. Paragraph (1) of the question asks:</PARA>
<PARA> Was a Mr Donald Chisholm employed under a Community Employment Project (CEP) grant to work for ACE Television in South Australia; if so, and in view of the fact that Mr Chisholm receives both the unemployment benefit as well as income from his two small businesses in South Australia, how can this person qualify for a CEP grant.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Chisholm was employed from 7 May 1984 to 6 May 1985 by ACE Television under a CEP grant. Mr Chisholm qualified for the CEP employment by being registered with a Commonwealth Employment Service office for a fixed period, as required by law, prior to commencing employment with a CEP grant. The information suggesting that Mr Chisholm received remuneration from any other source during his employment with ACE Television is, to the best of my knowledge, false. Mr Chisholm, I understand, was a director of two small businesses in that period. He was not an employee, nor did he receive any directors' fees. ACE Television was well pleased with his services. Paragraph (3) of the question asks:</PARA>
<PARA> Is Donald Chisholm also a member of the Board of Directors of ACE Television.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Chisholm was an interim director and an inaugural director of ACE Television but resigned before taking up the 12 months employment with that association. Mr Chisholm has continued to work for ACE Television in a voluntary capacity since May 1985. He is not currently a director of ACE Television. In the interests of saving public money and in light of the answer I gave to Senator Bolkus's question, I hope that he will withdraw this misleading question from the Notice Paper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All around Australia today people are complaining about interest rates-high interest rates that are getting higher every day. High interest rates are affecting people's decisions to buy cars and other big ticket items such as furniture. Most of all, and most importantly, high interest rates are affecting people's decisions-their wishes, hopes and dreams-to buy their own home. These people are asking: `Why are interest rates rising'? We are being assured every day by Mr Keating and Mr Hawke that the economy of Australia is getting better. On 21 December last year in the course of the election campaign Mr Hawke assured the Australian people as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the outlook for interest rates is as bright as it has been for more than a decade.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, `bright' is the operative word. Taking that statement in the proper way we should have assumed that interest rates would rise, which is what they have done. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>the best is still ahead of us. Australia and Australians will, during 1985, reap the interest rates rewards that are flowing from the successful policies of the past 20 months. We've ploughed the field and sown the seeds. In the very near future, we will harvest the crop.</PARA>
<PARA>Some crop, the people of Australia are saying! Why have these interest rates risen in the way they have? Of course, the answer is very simple. It is just as it was outlined in an Age article on 31 August 1985 by Robert Garran.</PARA>
<PARA> He said that the rate at which interest rates are rising is due to a deliberate policy of this Federal Government. The reasons for this are varied and numerous, and I will come to some of those points a little later. In general terms, the differences and the problems arise because of the Hawke Labor Government's mishandling of the economy and its negotiations with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Why has the Government been forced into a corner on these issues? The simple reason is that it has failed to grasp the nettle on the question of wages. I quote Robert Garran, who said in the Age:</PARA>
<PARA> If, despite its war of words, the ACTU and its members accept a decision by the Arbitration Commission to discount wages, the outlook should improve. But this is most likely to be achieved because of some kind of deal with the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say, most significantly:</PARA>
<PARA> The danger then would be that the money and currency markets may decide the deal is as bad as a full wage rise would have been.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that sums up precisely the situation with regard to the latest pact with the ACTU. Just how bad is the deal? Less than two weeks ago Mr Keating gave an unequivocal assurance that the Government would argue before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for a full discounting for the price effects of the devaluation. Then Mr Keating announced the Government's most recent cave-in. According to the deal done between the Hawke Government and the trade union bosses, there will be no discounting of wages for devaluation in September 1985-no discounting whatsoever. Instead, the Government has agreed to a 2 per cent discounting in the March 1986 national wage case-something that is yet to be decided in terms of what inflation rate may then apply.</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the 2 per cent discounting factor will cover the period until March 1986, but it will apply even if the price effects of the devaluation are greater than 2 per cent. So the Government has locked itself into that arrangement to discount wages by 2 per cent even if the devaluation effect is greater. It is no wonder that the money markets are very nervous about this Government's actions. It is true that the Government significantly underestimated the likely effects of the depreciation early this year. There is no reason to believe that it will get its estimate right next time.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also true that the Hawke Government has conceded the ACTU's highly dubious 4 per cent productivity claim. It has merely subtracted one per cent from the claim to allow a future claim for 3 per cent. In other words, the Government is pepared to give the ACTU only 3 per cent. I suppose we should be happy about that. This productivity deal has the appearance of being nothing more than a disguised pay increase in addition to indexation, which, of course, is the basis of the accord.</PARA>
<PARA> The Confederation of Australian Industry, which was excluded from any discussions between the ACTU and the Government on these important issues, has produced figures that demonstrate that between March 1983 and March 1985 productivity growth in this country was negative. According to the CAI, the entire growth in output has been more than matched by the growth in the number of hours worked. Mr Keating's statement on the ACTU pact in no way challenges or answers that assertion. It is pretty clear that the employers think this deal is bad. It is also clear that the consequences of it for the Australian people will be just as bad. This is, of course, quite beside the further point that emerged from the pact with the ACTU that in September 1986 a tax cut of some $2 billion will be given. I am sure that Senator Walsh, if he were to tell the truth, would be very upset at that kind of announcement, notwithstanding the fact that he may support tax cuts in general, when such a decision is taken so far from the actual events, without knowing the figures and without even having any possible budget against which to assess that cut.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pointed out that we are not opposed to tax cuts at all. What we are complaining about is the fact that the Government is promising these things without any possible understanding of how they might affect its Budget. These things were all pointed out in the Australian Financial Review of 12 April this year and have been the subject of debate in this chamber at another time. The Financial Review stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hawke's basic credibility problem with all this-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the problem of negotiating wages-</PARA>
<PARA>is that he is negotiating about wage rises that are in addition to full indexation. He is not specifically addressing the question of discounting indexation for the effect of the currency devaluation but debating the ACTU on its own ground-about extras and on-costs that were never a part of the accord anyway.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hawke is at sea because even a serious argument about possible additions to full indexation is rightly inimical to financial markets. The balance is so fine between full indexation of wages and inflation that confusion about where the Government stands must inevitably lead to fears in the markets, as Mr Hawke is finding.</PARA>
<PARA>That comment, of course, is just as relevant in today's market situation as it was on 12 April this year. The article from which I have just quoted speaks of markets. Indeed, the overseas money markets are demonstrating that there is again a very serious lack of confidence in the Australian dollar, which fell to about 66c this morning on the New York market. In recent times we have seen utter chaos in the domestic money market. The prime interest rate has now reached 18.5 per cent and the interest rate for home loans is now 13.5 per cent, having risen from 11.5 per cent. But what of real interest rates? Here lies the very important and significant problem for this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. There are major reasons why all this has been happening but the fact that our Australian dollar is falling in value is having very significant inflationary effects in the economy. The Government has attempted-attempted only-to do something about that by negotiating with the ACTU. The effect of wage indexation and the accord will, of course, only lead to further inflation through the feeding in of the inflationary effects of the falling dollar. Yet all the Government can do is cave in to trade union pressures and do deals at midnight in hotel rooms to make arrangements with the ACTU. The employers, the other half of the equation, are left out in the cold. Is it any wonder that the Australian dollar today is down to 66c in New York?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. Senator Cook may be interested to hear a few facts about it. We all understand that the problem of the falling dollar and its inflationary effects stem from the real difficulties that this economy suffers because of a lack of competitiveness, because of the high cost of labour in this country and the effects upon the ability of this country's exporters to sell on world markets. This has led to a very significant rise in the deficit on our current account and the balance of payments. Let me cite the increasing balances which have occurred during the Hawke Labor Government's term of office. The deficit on current account in 1982-83 was $6.3 billion. In 1983-84 it rose to $7.4 billion. This year it is $10.1 billion. That has to be found by the importing of capital. Because of that rising effect, the Government is being forced to allow borrowings to be made. That means that interest rates in this country, by deliberate Government policy, have to be kept high-higher than the rates applicable overseas-in order to attract money to this country to pay for the growing deficit that is entirely in the responsible hands of the Hawke Labor Government. Those figures demonstrate that for three years we have nearly doubled our deficit on current account and, as a result, we are being forced to borrow more and more overseas to cover it. Those are the facts and that is the reason we are seeing interest rates rise at the rate we are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those who are concerned about the effect of all of this on our growing overseas debt, let me cite a few figures. In 1983, the year in which the Hawke Labor Government came to power, our total gross debt overseas was $36.4 billion. It has now risen, in 1985, to $68.4 billion. As a proportion of gross domestic product, it has risen from 22 per cent to 33 per cent. An increase of 50 per cent in just three years has occurred under the Hawke Labor Government. Is it any wonder we are seeing an increasing loss of faith overseas?</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of servicing the debts that we are accumulating as a result of these policies is very interesting. The repayments in the first year of office of the Hawke Labor Government, in 1983, were $6.6 billion. They are now $11.5 billion a year. As a proportion of exports, those servicing payments have risen from 11.1 per cent in 1983 to 14.4 per cent. These are the facts and these are the reasons why this Government is being forced to drive up interest rates in order to protect its own situation and to protect a falling Australian dollar. It can only lead to a viciouscircle with increased interest rates in order to protect further the Australian dollar. As it falls, so it will generate further inflation through this Government wage indexation system and its pact with the ACTU, and continue to drive the cost of money higher and higher.</PARA>
<PARA> The outlook is very bad for individuals. Some people in this country are finding it hard to borrow money for their homes. Instead of borrowing $40,000 over a period of, say, 20 years to buy a house, banks are being forced, because of the rising cost of money, to increase the term of those loans and many people are having to take on a 29-year loan. They will be paying off the loan further and further into the future. Mr Keating says that this Government is a `can do' government. It sure is. It is just giving in to what the unions demand. All of us on this side know that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh can tell us all about that when he has his opportunity. What is Mr Keating really trying to say to us? In effect, of course, he is only kidding. All he is doing is ensuring that, through his control over interest rates and the method in which he is operating, fewer and fewer people will get housing loans. He is not protecting people. Interest rates will continue to rise and the value of the dollar will fall. The wage decision and the lack of confidence which exists will add to that. We will have a higher deficit on our current account overseas. Our money supply target, which is now in the order of 20 per cent, has blown out substantially. We have a rising overseas deficit, debts and servicing requirement. That adds up to a very sorry picture of the administration of this country's economy by the Hawke Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me try to sum up all of this. The disastrous wage pact with the ACTU focuses all attention on that chief area of concern in economic affairs. That piece of madness has now created a new round of loss of confidence in this Government both in this country and overseas. This comes hard on the heels of the MX missile crisis, confusion over ANZUS, the refusal to acknowledge, firstly, the wage problem arising from the devaluing dollar, the cosmetic expenditure cuts in May and, of course, all the other political factors which are around at the moment. It is just another land-mine in the mine-field labelled the accord into which this Government has stumbled. Indeed, it resembles a game of blind man's bluff, with the Government being pushed around from one union pillar to another trying to find some kind of settlement. Indeed, these accommodations with the trade union movement which follow one upon the other are just examples of giving in at the first available opportunities. Keating has waved his paper of surrender at the Australian people, proclaiming not peace in our time, but peace at any price. The consequences of this are disastrous. Australians do not deserve this gang of union puppets to run their country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there are any remaining doubts about the Bourbons of the Liberal Party of Australia having learned nothing and forgotten nothing, Senator Messner should have removed them. The day after the agreement to continue the accord for another two years was announced, the Melbourne Age economic columnists, Terry McCrann and Kenneth Davidson, agreed that that was the best news the Australian economy had had for a long time-the continuation of the accord and the agreement to discount wages by 2 per cent in the March 1986 case. I think neither of them would be offended if I described them as coming from almost the two extreme ends of the spectrum of economic thought in Australia. They are somewhere close to the extreme ends of the spectrum, anyway. I thought that if McCrann and Davidson can agree about any single policy, just about any sane person ought to agree with it. Unfortunately, we have just had demonstrated to us that that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has already delivered two years of economic growth approaching 5 per cent. During that same time the inflation rate was almost halved. We are entering our third year of 5 per cent economic growth, something that has not happened in Australia since the early 1950s.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said `approaching 5 per cent'. We have created more jobs in 27 months than the Fraser Administration created in 87 months. The central economic policy underpinning that spectacular achievement is, as I have always said, an effective wages policy-in this case the accord. During that same period, and because of the accord and the high rates of economic growth, the real labour unit cost has fallen to a level lower than it has been at any time since 1970-71. In the short time this Government has been in office the real labour unit costs have fallen by 7 per cent. Central to all that has been the success of the incomes policy known in Australia as the accord.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can remember lecturing the Liberal Party when we were in opposition about the vastly superior economic performance of a number of other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. They were countries such as Austria, West Germany, the Netherlands and Japan-that is not an exhaustive list-which throughout the difficult economic decade of the 1970s had maintained economic growth rates high enough to keep unemployment at levels only marginally above the full employment levels of the 1960s, and which had successfully controlled inflation, usually keeping it down to the order of 2 or 3 per cent per annum. I drew Liberal members' attention to the fact that the common denominator in all those countries which through the 1970s had an economic record vastly superior to that of Australia, whether formally enshrined in legislation or not, was the existence of an effective wages policy. The Liberals failed to learn then; they have failed still. I regard it as impertinent that the people who presided over the worst depression Australia has seen since the 1930s, who gave us the highest interest rates in history, who gave us double digit inflation and double digit unemployment at the same time-something no previous government had done-and who destroyed 250,000 jobs in their last disastrous year of office should now seek to criticise the foundation stone of this Government's highly successful economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA> In opposition and in government all the responsible people in the Labor Party have made it very clear that the continuation of the accord is central to sustained high rates of economic growth and acceptable levels of inflation. We have a wages policy. The Opposition says that it has a wages policy. Its policy is to deregulate. There really is no acceptable alternative but to have a wages policy or to deregulate. The Opposition is noted for contradictions in economic policy in a number of areas, but there is no greater contradiction than in its attitude to wages policy, both in government and in opposition. In May 1981 the then Treasurer, who is now the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, presided over the demolition of centralised wages fixing. He said in May 1981: `We will let market forces determine the level of wages in Australia', and market forces did precisely that. Wages went up 13 per cent in the next year and 14 per cent in the year after. That was the consequence. One does not have to speculate or theorise. The empirical evidence shows that following the deregulation of the labour market, or the abandonment of a wages policy in May 1981, we had the greatest wages explosion Australia had seen for almost a decade. Eighteen months later, confronted with the disastrous consequences of its ideology, the Fraser Government then swung to the other extreme and imposed a wages freeze-the most centralised and rigidly regulated wage system that anybody can conceive.</PARA>
<PARA> The contradictions are still here. On the one hand we are urged by Senator Messner and others that we must have full discounting. On the other hand we are told we should have a free market for labour. It is a matter for wide-eyed conjecture as to how one achieves full discounting in a deregulated market. The only way discounting can be achieved is through a centralised wage fixing system and an effective incomes policy. I would have thought that it would have been obvious even to the shadow Minister for Finance, who was installed in his position by courtesy of the Sydney Stock Exchange club, which decided last week that as well as getting even with Andrew Peacock it would get even with Senator Peter Rae because of what he had done to it while a member of various Senate committees. It insisted that Senator Rae be dumped from the front bench, and he has been replaced by Senator Messner.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what Senator Rae said. I have the transcript here and I will show it to Senator Messner if he likes. I would have thought it would have been apparent even to Senator Messner, or even to the discredited former Treasurer, that there is no way in which one can achieve wage discounting outside of a regulated and centralised wage fixing system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principles of discounting and of a free market for labour are mutually exclusive. It is true, as Senator Messner has said, that interest rates are, by historical standards, high. They are, however, significantly lower than they were during the last disastrous year of the previous Government. I draw Senator Messner's attention to the fact that in April 1982 rates on commercial 90-day bills were 22.5 per cent. In June 1982 on two-year Commonwealth bonds they were 16.5 per cent and at the same time on 15-year Commonwealth bonds they were also 16.5 per cent. Although high at present, they are significantly lower than those figures which I have cited. There is another significant difference. At that time-that is, in the last days of the Fraser Government-people were borrowing money to remain solvent. They were virtually borrowing money in order to be able to eat. People or businesses are borrowing money now to invest, and the latter is a far more healthy situation, obviously, than the former. The essential difference is that under this Government growth is high, extraordinarily high by Australian standards. Largely because of that high growth and the demand for funds, interest rates are also high. At the end of the previous Government's period in office interest rates were even higher but growth was negative.</PARA>
<PARA> In spite of that record and the history of what has occurred in Australia and overseas, members of the Opposition, ideologically blinded as they are, still insist on deregulation and still condemn the prices and incomes accord, which has delivered this country the highest sustained rate of economic growth, accompanied by low inflation, that it has seen since the early 1950s. They have learnt nothing from their experience when they actually deregulated wages. In 1981 they said: `We will let the market sort it out'. That policy produced a wages explosion. There was a 27 per cent increase in wages in just two years. Simultaneously, it produced the highest level of industrial disputation seen for many years. A figure approaching four million working days was lost in the last year of the Liberal Government, a figure which has now fallen by some 65 per cent. For all that, members of the Opposition have still learnt nothing. Their blind ideological prejudices lead them to assert that the very same policies which produced disaster when they were in government-they produced the highest level of unemployment which we have seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s, simultaneously producing double-digit inflation and the highest interest rates in history, which destroyed 250,000 jobs in just 12 months-be resurrected in order to wreak similar damage to that which they had wreaked previously.</PARA>
<PARA> There are times when, I suppose, to be fair, one ought to acknowledge that the present Leader of the Opposition is an honest man. When speaking at the National Press Club a couple of weeks ago, for example, he said that the industrial relations front would become an economic battleground over the next five to 10 years. That statement should send a chill down the spine of every responsible Australian. We should feel a chill that this man, who is now the Federal Leader of the Opposition, should propose and welcome a policy which he himself forecast would make industrial relations an economic battleground over the next five to 10 years. For example, I would have thought that Mr Howard's proposal to introduce policies which he not only says but also knows will have that effect would send a chill down Senator Siddons's spine. What the last year or 18 months of the Fraser Government produced under Mr Howard's wages policy-that is, almost four million working days lost because of industrial disputes in a 12-month period-is, by Mr Howard's own admission, what we can expect as normality if he should become Prime Minister and if his policies were to be actually adopted.</PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the frustrations of the Liberal Party, that policies which it assiduously ignored in opposition and intellectual arguments to which it refused to listen in opposition have now been applied and have been demonstrably so successful. I can understand it being somewhat frustrated by that and I can forgive it for that frustration. However, I find it very much harder to forgive the continual campaign of sabotage which the Opposition has engaged in ever since it has been in opposition. By sabotage I mean its continual attempts to talk down the value of the Australian dollar-attempts which in fact pre-date the 1983 Federal election-and to talk up interest rates. Perhaps a measure of the desperation of the more perceptive members of the Opposition is the realisation that the only chance they have of getting back into government while the high and sustained rates of economic growth, underpinned by the accord, continue to improve the general living standards of Australians and continue to give the unemployed at least some hope of obtaining employment-hope that they did not have before-is to seek desperately for prescriptions which might threaten that stability and growth. I can understand it but, naturally, I cannot forgive it.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner in opening his speech referred to sowing the seeds and harvesting the crop. I think he was quoting the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) although I am not sure why he did so. The seeds were sown by this Government in the weeks before it assumed office. The seed which was sown was an agreement with the Australian Council of Trade Unions for an effective wages policy. Australia has been progressively harvesting the crop ever since. It has been doing so in the form of 400,000 additional jobs, two years and a prospective third year of real economic growth rates approaching 5 per cent, inflation coming down to almost half the level that prevailed when we came to office and interest rates which, though high by historical standards, are still significantly lower than those which prevailed at the time that the last Government went out of office. Perhaps most importantly of all, upward pressures are being exerted on interest rates because of the high rates of growth and the private demand for investment funds as distinct from the high interest rates which prevailed in the closing desperate months of the previous Government when people, and business in particular, were trying to borrow money to remain solvent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Messner's contribution to this debate would have been far more convincing if he had spent some of the time available to him on outlining and detailing an alternative approach to what the Government has done. He failed to do that. He spent most of his time pointing out our problems with our balance of payments and he failed to show what connection the Government's wages policy has with high interest rates or the balance of payments. At least I did not gather the connection if Senator Messner argued it. The Opposition is not spelling out details of an alternative approach and that, I believe, is essential if it is to be an effective opposition in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one essential flaw with the Government's negotiations with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and it is this: Direct negotiations with the ACTU take no account of the interests of employer organisations or-this is most important-small business. So the Government must get in place a wages policy which takes account of those vital interests and vital concerns in the community. However, having said that, I believe that the Government's deal with the ACTU will not greatly affect interest rates. Given the circumstances relating to industrial relations in this country, certainly in terms of practical politics, we have at the moment the best deal that we could have hoped for. In fact, we have a better deal than I thought was possible a few days ago. This deal gives us the opportunity for steady economic growth over the next two to three years without strong inflationary pressures and without opportunistic demands on wages by powerful trade unions. If the Government introduces some imaginative, stimulatory policies when it announces its tax reform package, we can hope for the underlying assumption on which the Government based its Budget, namely, a 4 1/2 per cent growth rate. Provided some additional stimulatory factor is announced soon, we may achieve the 4 1/2 per cent growth rate that has been predicated.</PARA>
<PARA> For the record I think it is worth while to spell out the elements of the deal between the ACTU and the Government. Firstly, there is to be no discounting of the 3.8 per cent consumer price index increase for the March and June quarters, but there will be a 2 per cent discount of the CPI claim in April 1986. This discount will absorb most, if not all, of the inflationary effects of the devaluation.</PARA>
<PARA> The second important point is that tax cuts of approximately $5 for those on average weekly earnings will apply from September 1986 to compensate for the 2 per cent discounting of the April 1986 wage increase. The ACTU has agreed to cut the 4 per cent productivity claim to 3 per cent and that will be taken as superannuation benefits to be phased in over a three-year period. These measures will stop the inflationary effects of the devaluation being locked into the accord and they will give us the prospect of a steady growth rate in the Australian economy. So to that degree at least the Government is to be congratulated. It has pulled off a deal that nobody thought was possible. Speaking for members of my Party, we did not think it was possible two weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA> The concern of the Liberal Party of Australia that the wages deal will affect interest rates is essentially a red herring. The Liberal Party paints the scenario that any wage increase will frighten off overseas investors and if that happens we will have to have very high interest rates to attract overseas money to the country. I suggest that the quickest way to frighten away overseas money is to have a period of uncertainty about wage demands in this country. The worst thing an overseas investor can face is the unknown. At least now investors have a firm program for the next two or three years.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that. Overseas investors now know what they can expect. In the early 1980s there was a wages explosion which occurred when the Fraser Government was in power. The only solution that was available at that time was to allow very high interest rates and to put the squeeze on the economy in an attempt to contain wage demands by unions which were running wild and out of control at that time. As I think Senator Messner pointed out, it is necessary for us at the moment to have high interest rates if we are to attract the funds that are necessary to balance our current trading account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We need to attract foreign money if we are to support our barely floating Australian dollar. Why have we got into this precarious position: It is because the scenario of the 1980s has not worked. The then Government said that it was going to apply massive investments from the mineral boom to resources development in this country and that those projects were going to earn their keep, earn foreign exchange and pay the interest bill incurred at that time. These investments in energy resources and mineral development in our country are not earning the foreign exchange that was predicted and of course we now have to keep our interest rates at some eight per cent above those that apply in Japan, the United States of America or Western Europe generally. The fact of the matter is that there is no easy solution to the problem we are in. Any Australian government would have its back to the wall.</PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary for us to weave a way out of the precarious situation that we are in and there is only one way that can be done. Firstly I think it is important that all Australians realise that we are in a precarious position, that we have got to put our hands to the wheel, as it were and steel our reserves of effort to earn foreign exchange. There is no other fundamental solution. Government policy, above all else, should be directed to that one objective. We have to look at the areas available in our community and our economy that give the best prospect for earning foreign currency and then direct resources into those areas.</PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that the Government's approach has one essential flaw. It has frozen out small business and has frozen out employer organisations in the wage fixing process. I want to put an alternative scenario to the Government and to the Liberal Party-a scenario which, as far as I am aware, is in stark contrast to the approach that Mr Howard is advocating right now. The Democrats believe in centralised wage fixing. We believe that workers should be allowed the bottom line of minimum award conditions that can be set and should be set by a centralised wage fixing system. In addition to that, we believe that there should be new legislation introduced that will allow collective agreements to be negotiated directly on conditions to apply for specific industries.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is optimistic in the extreme to believe that conditions for places as far afield as Darwin, Hobart, Perth and Sydney can be established by a centralised wage fixing body. Of course there are local conditions. Of course there are the interests of small business which cannot always meet the conditions that apply across the country as the best common denominator. The only way that this great anomaly in our centralised wage fixing system can be addressed is to allow legislation that will give the parties concerned, if they so wish, the opportunity to negotiate on specific conditions above a minimum set by our centralised wage fixing system.</PARA>

I could quote many references in the Press where the Liberal Party has said just that. As I heard the Leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Howard, say the other day, youth wages will be reduced by direct negotiations. He said that they would negotiate with small industries, small companies, to get wages down to the level which small business could afford. If that is not reducing what is already established as the law of this country-the wages and conditions under which people in industry operate-I do not know what is. If that is not Liberal Party policy, I suggest that the quicker it makes that clear to the public at large the better off the Liberal Party will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without a doubt there has to be an opportunity for direct negotiation on special conditions applying to special industries in special geographically located areas of this large continent. It is very necessary, before that can happen, that we put in place legislation which will allow such agreements to be legally enforceable. At present they are not. We can negotiate until we are blue in the face; we can write down on paper any agreement we like. Such an agreement at this moment is not legally enforceable. We are suggesting, as we set out in great detail in our collective agreements legislation, the Industrial Democracy Bill, that there is a need for a new legislative framework that will allow employers, unions and individual groups of employees to negotiate legally binding agreements which are quite separate and distinct from provisions in the conciliation and arbitration legislation. We suggest that this should be based on the corporations power under the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> However, in the meantime the prices and incomes accord is vital. We see it as a very substantial achievement of the Government. Trading wage discounting for tax cuts avoids the danger of locking the inflationary effects of devaluation into the wage fixing system. It is the most we could expect from the Labor Government and it is certainly preferable to the confrontationist course which I believe the policies of the Liberal Party would inevitably lead to. I believe that neither the approach of the Government nor, as I understand it, the approach of the Liberal Party is satisfactory. Certainly, the confrontationist approach is not satisfactory. We have to develop an environment of co-operation and not confrontation in relation to wage fixing in this country. This environment can be established only if we embrace the principles of industrial democracy which I set out in the Bill I introduced two weeks ago in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA> The disastrous consequences of the Government's wages pact with the Australian Council of Trade Unions for interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has brought forward the matter of public importance to highlight the great damage the Government's cowardly and continual kowtowing to the trade union movement is doing to this nation. Before turning to that matter I shall mention a couple of comments made, first of all, by Senator Walsh, and then by Senator Siddons. Senator Walsh talked about the economic growth in this country in the last two years and the reduction in the rate of inflation. In effect he praised the Government and gave it credit for those results. Let us look at some of the facts. Certainly, inflation is down compared with that of two years ago but it is not down relative to the inflation rate in other countries around the world. We have an inflation rate which is almost twice that of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. That figure above the OECD average is higher than that occurring during the years of the previous Government. Our balance of payments deficit proportionately is the largest of all countries in the Western world. In the last 12 months our currency has depreciated by more than any other currency in the OECD and, despite what Senator Walsh said, our interest rates in real terms are the highest of any country in the Western world and are higher than they have been in this country for 50 years. I will come back to that later.</PARA>
<PARA> So much for some of the `facts' that Senator Walsh produced. It is true that economic growth as measured by the gross domestic product figures has been higher in the last two years. It has been good. Senator Walsh omitted the reasons for this, which have been spelled out by Opposition spokesmen over the last couple of years. They have also been acknowledged by people such as Senator Walsh's predecessor as Minister for Finance, Mr Dawkins. He acknowledged honestly last year when he was Minister for Finance that the recovery in the economy since the Australian Labor Party came to office was due essentially to three factors: First, the breaking of the drought in 1983, secondly, the recovery overseas and, thirdly, the wages freeze that the previous Government-and the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard-introduced in 1982 which laid the framework for much of the recovery that has since occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh also omitted to mention that,although one of the reasons for the difficulty that the Australian economy faced in the late 1970s and the early 1980s was that it was part of a worldwide recession, the problem went deeper than that for Australia. We were still living through the problems of the 1970s, not just those occasioned by the Whitlam Government but, more importantly, the problems occasioned by the actions of the Australian Council of Trade Unions throughout the 1970s when it was led by the now Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. The chickens came home to roost in the late 1970s and 1980s. Those chickens were hatched by the ACTU and, primarily, by the now Prime Minister, the then ACTU President, Mr Hawke. So much for some of the things that Senator Walsh said.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Siddons made some interesting comments. I am not sure that I followed him too well because in one sentence he was castigating the Opposition for not having a policy and in the next sentence he was proposing policies which were, and are, those of the Opposition. I agree with Senator Siddons that there are no easy solutions to the problems that we in Australia face today. But there are some things we can do. First, we have to make ourselves competitive as a nation. The only way to do that is to act more responsibly and to realise that we are going broke following the Government's policy course at the moment. We cannot afford the policies that are being undertaken. That is the essential reason why we have difficulties and for the lack of competitiveness that we now face.</PARA>
<PARA> What do we do about this problem? As a government we would do several things. We would take a responsible and tough attitude to government spending because if we did not the problem would continue to compound. Therefore, we take a tough approach to taxation, which flows from the Government's spending approach. We will see later in the month what proposals the Government will be putting forward. They will put more and more burdens on the taxpayer, particularly the productive sector of the economy and the small business sector, through capital gains tax and other forms of tax on business. These are the sorts of things that we have to avoid doing if we want to make this country grow and make it competitive. We have to take a firm hand on monetary policy. In the last 18 months, monetary policy has blown out. It is out of hand. Monetary targeting has been abandoned by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) because it all got too hard and he and the Government were not prepared to take the tough decisions that are necessary to have a proper monetary policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The final thing that we have to do-Senator Siddons alluded to it but did not seem prepared to come all the way with the Opposition-is to break the yoke of regulation of the labour market. We have to make the labour market more flexible. We have to do the sorts of things that Senator Siddons suggested and talk about and develop the sorts of policies that have been Opposition policies for the last 12 months or more. We have to make agreements that are legally enforceable. I agree with Senator Siddons, but he is not saying anything new. He is reiterating the policies of my Party. So much for some of the things that have already been said.</PARA>
<PARA> I now come back to the matter of public importance. Our wording of the matter of public importance is framed in terms of the effect of the wages deal on interest rates. I will concentrate my remarks on that point, but the Opposition could just as validly have worded this matter of public importance to highlight the disastrous consequences that the Government's capitulation to the ACTU last week will have on inflation, economic growth, employment, our balance of payments and the value of our dollar. It is not possible to separate these different elements. They are all closely interwoven.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the content of the deal struck last week between the Government and the ACTU, a deal which is breathtaking in its arrogance. It circumvents the authority of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It pre-empts the outcome of the present wage case and subsequent wage cases when the Commission might have had other ideas, ideas which it was created and paid to have, about possible ways to proceed. All those were pre-empted by the deal last week between the Government and the ACTU which gives full wage indexation in the current national wage case without any discounting for the depreciation of the Australian dollar.</PARA>
<PARA> There is to be a 2 per cent discounting-and that is questionable when one looks at the fine print-in the April 1986 wage case. In exchange for this so-called sacrifice by the unions there is to be a compensatory tax cut in September 1986 and support for the ACTU's productivity claim, though reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent, in the form of compulsory superannuation by all employers. There will be unspecified tax reform. We will wait until later in the month for that. Additional price restraints will be imposed on businesses because the Treasurer and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, say that profits are now back to the level of the early 1970s, and that is as high as they ought to go. This ignores completely the fact that the profitability of the corporate sector in the 1970s was far lower than in the 1950s and the 1960s which were the decades that really saw growth in this country. Yet that is written into the agreement that Mr Keating and Mr Willis released last week. So there will be a tougher approach to business and acceptance of a union proposal for a capital goods investment strategy. I understand that that proposal is quite contrary to the views of the Government and, in particular, its Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button. Above all that, there has been the granting at long last of the Australian Council of Trade Unions' dream of full superannuation, regardless of the cost to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> That is an extraordinarily generous package. It gives the unions, as I said, one of their more cherished objectives-full national superannuation. It gives a permanent tax cut to compensate for a temporary deferral of part of a wage increase. It is an extraordinarily generous package for the unions, but what sort of a package is it for Australia? For Australia it is an extra- ordinarily bitter package because it virtually guarantees an acceleration in inflation, further depreciation of the dollar, a slowing in economic growth and a reduction, if not an actual downturn, in employment growth. The Hawke Government, through its agreement last week with the ACTU, has once again become an accessory to the crime of job destruction. Of course, the package guarantees what is the main subject of this matter of public importance; that is, a further hike in interest rates in Australia and their maintenance at and increase beyond the highest levels for 50 years. Our interest rates, when adjusted for inflation, are the highest since the Great Depression. They have been at record levels since earlier this year. They have increased further in recent days and they are now, as a result of the wages deal, destined to go to new record heights over the months ahead.</PARA>
<PARA> Who is it that gets hurt by high interest rates? The people who get hurt by high interest rates are the individuals, ordinary Australians, particularly those on lower and middle incomes who have to borrow funds to purchase the things they want in life-not the luxuries of life but the necessities and the semi-necessities. They are the people who are hurt by high interest rates. They are the people who have struggled for years to try to buy homes and who are now finding homes put out of their reach and who, if they want to buy a car or the essentials of life, have to borrow money for it as they cannot otherwise afford to pay for it. Individuals, including home buyers, are the people who are hurt by the policies of this Government leading to this high interest rate structure.</PARA>
<PARA> The other group in the community which is most hurt is small business. Large business can generally, in one way or another, live with high interest rates because, important though they may be, they are a less significant element for it in its total operations. It is the small businessman who runs his business on overdrafts and who never or rarely has enough capital to be on the right side of the ledger in cash terms who will be the sufferer and is the sufferer under this high interest rate regime into which we have got ourselves. The reason we are in this regime, as I have said, is the gross economic mismanagement of this Government over the past 2 1/2 years. The Government cannot wash its hands of the interest rates issue. It has compounded any upward influences on rates. It has done so blatantly, deliberately and decisively and it has also done it in defiance of its own statements. Surely we all remember that during the last election campaign both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said that interest rates would fall in 1985.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to this matter of public importance, I note with interest the competition on the other side of the House to see who can sound the driest. I have listened as speaker after speaker has risen to show us that he is part of the new dry Liberal Party. I can understand the fairly desperate search of Opposition members for a new identity, a new philosophy, because no matter how much camouflage is used to cloud the reality the members of the Liberal Party who sit opposite are the people who failed Australia from 1975 to 1983. They are the same tired people and they have the same failed policies. If given a chance, they will fail again. The Liberal Party, bereft of talent and ideas, has hit a brick wall. That has never been more evident than it is to those of us who have had today to sit and listen to what amounts to a defence of a period in Australian history that will go down as one of our worst economic recessions; that is, the period of the Fraser Government during which the new Liberal leader, John Howard, was Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not really have to imagine what Australia would be like if it were led by John Howard because all Australians had an opportunity in those years to see the theory in practice. Their verdict, after they had looked at it in practice, was that the Liberal Party should be thrown out of office. Its irrelevance in serious economic debate suggests that by now it has become an anachronism. While John Howard was Treasurer we had the worst recession in 50 years. That can be contrasted with the economic performance of this Government. Its economic policies have been right. Since taking office it has pursued a set of cohesive economic policies which have borne fruit quickly. The fiscal, monetary, wages and industrial relations policies that we have undertaken have ensured a significant transformation in the economy, an economy finally based on growth rather than an economy based on contraction and riddled with double-digit unemployment and inflation, as was the case during the Liberal Party's years on the treasury bench.</PARA>
<PARA> Crucial to the Government's overall economic success, crucial to its strategy, has been the implementation of a cohesive and workable wages and incomes policy. What killed off the recoveries of the 1970s was the boom, inflation and bust cycle. We had it too often. When any slight recovery occurred, fuelled by the sort of inflation that we saw under the Howard regime, we saw the gains of the recovery quickly disappear. They were quickly frittered away. In many instances uncontrolled wage increases caused by the lack of a clear wages policy were the major contributors to inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government realises that if that cycle is to be broken in the 1980s, if we are to maintain long periods of growth and stability, there have to be adequate wage control measures married with wage moderation. The Government has been able to achieve that through the wages and incomes policy, the cornerstone of which is the accord with the trade union movement, that historic accord which over the last couple of years has done Australia proud. The accord has been successful both in moderating wage increases within affordable limits and in achieving Australia's remarkable economic growth, a growth that has placed it at the very front of all the member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development during the last 12 months. It will certainly remain in that place in the next 12 months when growth might well outstrip the projections that have been announced in the Budget. Already figures show that it is quite possible that growth will go higher than 5 per cent. The major plank of the accord in achieving this has been the policy of wage indexation whereby movements in wages are linked to movements in prices.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the success of that policy under the Australian Labor Party. Average weekly earnings grew by less than 5 per cent in 1983-84 and less than 6 1/2 per cent in 1984-85, so the rate of growth in average weekly earnings that was inherited by the Hawke Government when it took office has already been halved. What is more, we now have the lowest level of industrial disruption and strike activity for 17 years. Industrial disputation will remain at these record low levels. In the 12 months to May 1985 we had a 65 per cent reduction in strikes, in days lost. When Howard caused a wages explosion he also caused industrial chaos. Already under Labor, in the first 2 1/2 years of the Hawke Government, that has been changed.</PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, when one looks at those things that are supposed to motivate those opposite, we look, firstly, at real unit labour costs. We see that today the level of real unit costs is well below that of the late 1960s and the early 1970s. Since Labor came to office there has been a 7 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs. The 2 per cent discounting of wage claims will give rise to a further reduction in real unit labour costs. I note that that point was not taken up by the Opposition in this debate. There has been no discussion whatsoever on unit labour costs. The reason for this is that the Opposition just cannot handle the reality of the statistics, that is, the economic indicators by which the people will be able to judge just who governs them better.</PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that we should look at is profit share. Again, the Liberal Party has had to stop talking about profit share, which is dear to the hearts of members of the Liberal Party. Profit share crashed under Howard and Fraser when bankruptcy rates went up. Under us it has not been the bankruptcy rate that has gone up; it has been profit share. It is as high as it was in the late 1960s. Since the trough under the previous Government, profit share has gone up 5 percentage points. It has gone up 5 percentage points since we took office. Surely that is an indication of the Government's successful wages policy. It is a policy that has been successful in putting 400,000 Australians in work already. The level of inflation has fallen from 11 1/2 per cent to 6 1/2 per cent. The recent wage agreement can, I think, ensure two more years of wage restraint; two more years of growth, and two more years of increased employment levels.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the agreement itself. It delivers a 2 per cent discount to wage indexation adjustments in the April wage case. There will be a delay in the implementation of the productivity case, with the benefits to be restricted to a 3 per cent wage equivalent to be provided over two years in the form of superannuation benefits, the least expensive form to employees of increased remuneration. There will be a tax cut in September 1986. On the other side of the coin there is, therefore, an ongoing commitment to agreed wage fixing principles for another two years which will ensure that our economic recovery can continue unhindered by excessive wage increases. The agreement will ensure that the beneficial effects of the recent devaluation will not be thrown away. They will not be wasted. It will ensure that inflation and interest rates will not be fuelled by a reckless wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us contrast that with the record of the Fraser Government with John Howard as Treasurer-that is, the Liberal-National Party rule. If one looks at those last desperate years when things were going badly, when they were out of control, one sees that John Howard and his cohorts desperately changed policy week after week trying to find some way to solve their problems. All they were able to achieve, by attempting for a while the abandonment of centralised wage fixing, was a massive wage explosion. In fact, the last 27 months of that Government saw wages increase by 28 per cent. In 1980-81 they went up 13 per cent; in 1981-82, 14 per cent and in 1982-83, another 13 per cent. That is what the abandonment of central wage fixing can do. If it is tried again the same thing will occur. I note that this new dry look with which we are being assailed today is often presented-I note that in Senator Short's contribution it was done rather badly-in the name of small business. It is said: `We will abandon central wage fixing and, therefore, we will fix up all the problems of small business'.</PARA>
<PARA> The reality is exactly the opposite. Small business would be crushed. How can small employers seriously expect to bargain with strong and big unions? All that will happen, if it is tried again in Australia, is what happened when it was tried previously under John Howard. The big unions will win big increases from big business and those big increases will flow to small business, crushing and crippling it. To those small businessmen who worry about this Government, they should look only at the level of bankruptcy and at how the rate soared under John Howard's reign of the economy in Australia. The bankruptcy rate went up by hundreds of per cent in a few years. That is what will happen if centralised wage fixing is abandoned and if the benefits of the accord, which was won by hard bargaining between the Government and the Auatralian Council of Trade Unions, are ever wasted.</PARA>
<PARA> Not only are we able to save small business from the problems of a wages explosion but also we can contrast the record of industrial disputation. When one smashes the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission system and the present wage fixing system, one finishes up smashing business. Inevitably, part of that breakup, part of that problem, will be an enormous growth in the level of strikes and industrial disputation. It happened before. The problem is being solved under this Government. Obviously we will never have a system where strikes do not occur any more, but all Australians must have noted in the past two and a half years how the level of disputation has gone down. If one opts for confrontation in the industrial relations field, one gets strikes. When strikes occur it is not only big business that gets hurt but also small business, which desperately awaits supplies, suffers. It is small business which will bear the brunt if yet another doomed Liberal Party attack is mounted on the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA> The trade union movement is not perfect. Only a couple of weeks ago in this place I made a speech in which I strongly attacked one union, the Builders Labourers Federation. I will do that again if a trade union behaves in the same irresponsible manner. But when the ACTU and the Government can get together and give Australian workers an increase in their wages that Australia can afford, give Australian employers the certainty of being able to plan for a period of growth, growth that will not be hindered by unchecked wages growth by way of another wages explosion, and make absolutely certain that we will not have to put up with another period of strikes and disputation which will cripple our economy, all that small business has to do is look at the alternative. It will not need to look for very long to realise that what happened under Fraser and Howard can happen again. The only hope that it will not happen again is for the Australian people to stick to the Hawke Government, a government that has delivered on the economy and will continue to do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate of two basic facts. Firstly, last week's sweetheart deal between the Hawke Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions can only fuel wage inflation and, therefore, increase inflationary expectations. Secondly, the inevitable consequence of this will be a further rise in interest rates to the detriment of home buyers, small business and primary producers. I found it quite amazing, yet interesting, that Senator Richardson could spend nearly a third of his allocated time talking about the Liberal Party and our Leader, John Howard. Obviously he was rather short of things to say about his Government's record in relation to the matter of public importance which is before us but, of course, that is understandable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite amazing that Senator Richardson should be worried about our concern for small business when this country is confronted by big government that leapt into bed with big unions and big business. I think it is quite amazing that no one on the Government side has yet spoken on the subject matter of this matter of public importance, which covers the disastrous consequences for interest rates of the wages push by the ACTU. It will be very interesting to see whether the Government's final speaker will cover this area or whether he will continue to pursue the angle of industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government cannot avoid the fact that it has retreated from its original pledge to ensure that the effect of devaluation of the Australian dollar would be discounted in future wage rises because it is placing a higher value on its tradeoff with the ACTU than on the general welfare of the Australian people. This Australian Labor Party Government will cause this country to suffer some inevitable consequences of its gutless decisions. I would like to detail some of those. The Government's failure to achieve full discounting will erode the benefit devaluation has given us-the competitive advantage it gives to our struggling export industries. When we look at the dispute at the Mudginberri abattoir it is obvious that this Government really does not care too much about the export industries either. This display of weakness will only cause the international financial community to pass further judgment on the state of the Australian economy. The next such display of collective horse sense, unwelcome as it might be for the Hawke Government, could see the value of the Australian dollar fall to something like 50c against the United States dollar. In order to retain investment funds within Australia interest rates will have to rise further.</PARA>
<PARA> This situation is in addition to the purely domestic consequences of the retreat from discounting. The Hawke Government refuses to acknowledge that the whole pattern of across the board wage increases, which by their very nature ignore the capacities of individual industries or, for that matter, employers to pay, will result in cost rises being passed on to the consumer. This, in turn, will boost both the consumer price index and, equally importantly, the expectation of continued high inflation that pushes up interest rates. No doubt the Hawke Government, like any socialist government in economic difficulties, would like to ignore these economic facts. However, no government as yet has learned to repeal the law of supply and demand.</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government would have us believe that the accord is of inestimable value to Australia and that its preservation is worth a few nasty economic consequences. This celebrated accord, however, is nothing more than a trade off between a Labor government and one sectional interest, the members of which happen to be its political paymasters. This is acknowledged by Peter Dawkins and Richard Bandy when writing in the Australian Economic Review for the second quarter of 1985 regarding the wages policy of the accord. They support the contention of the Federal Liberal Party that other interest groups-farmers, small business, the self-employed, the jobless and the smaller States-will have their rights trampled on. The sum total of the equation is that the Australian people lose out with them. Dawkins and Bandy state:</PARA>
<PARA> The basis of the accord is the power of the unions. On this issue the leaders of the ACTU are quite explicit. They see it as broadening their influence into other areas of society than simply wages and conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA>Put simply, this means that the accord is not a device to protect the living standards of employees but a vehicle for aggrandisement of trade unions and those who run them. Only a few weeks ago the Hawke Government was warning us about the inflationary consequences of wage rises without discounting. That is interesting, and I would like to quote some of the things the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said as recently as 31 July. He was reported as saying that Australia faced an inflation rate of 8 per cent or more in the next year. He also admitted that this would be double the inflation rate of our major trading partners. Mr Hawke equally understands the connection between inflation and interest rates. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have heard it said that inflation to the economist is as sex to the novelist: Both are associated with a rising rate of interest.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer (Mr Keating) in presenting the Budget last month admitted a rise in the Consumer Price Index of 8 per cent this year and a worse inflation rate than that of our trading partners. Both then and at the National Press Club on 21 August he affirmed the commitment of the Hawke Government to full discounting. I wonder what has happened. Last week, however, we were told that there will be no discounting in the September wage case and 2 per cent discounting next March. Well, that is a slight turnaround, is it not? The Treasurer is left with voicing a pious hope that this cave-in `will have virtually the same beneficial effect on inflation outcome'. At the same time the ACTU has had another win over this spineless Government. It has been conceded 3 per cent of its 4 per cent productivity claim-a claim that will, of course, be visited on productive and marginal enterprises alike. Clearly, in any so-called compromise the Government is making the concessions, but the Australian community foots the bill both in job losses and particularly in higher interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA> We need to look carefully at what is happening to real interest rates under this Government. My colleague Senator Messner covered much of this in his address, but I think some of it bears repeating. In March 1983, when this Government took office, the real interest rate-the difference between the interest rate and the rate of inflation-was 1.4 per cent. Last July, only just over two years later, real interest rates stood at 6 per cent even though nominal interest rates were much the same. Australia's real interest rates are the highest in the Western world. A survey of 26 July which appeared in the Australian gave us a real interest rate that was 2 per cent higher than the rates in Britain, Japan and the United States and double those of France and West Germany. The Commonwealth Bank in June stated that real interest rates were at their highest level for a century and that `interest rates would continue to embody a premium based on higher inflationary expectations'.</PARA>
<PARA> Professor John Hewson of the University of New South Wales predicted last month that unless wage and monetary policy changed drastically there was no chance of interest rates easing. The bond rate would be running at 14 per cent by the end of this year. The subsequent capitulation by the Hawke Government will make that prediction even more certain. These rises in interest rates have occurred before the full inflationary effect of devaluation has made itself felt. It is inevitable, therefore, that the impact of interest rates on the Australian community, especially home owners, will increase. No honourable senator should delude himself or herself that home buyers can be insulated from this general rise in interest rates. Home loan rates are already on the rise. Maintaining ceilings on home loan interest rates cannot in the longer term protect the mass of home buyers. As interest rates in other areas continue to rise there will simply be fewer funds for home buyers and available funds will be rationed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is exactly right. This is all part of what this Government sees as redistributing wealth across the board. We believe in creating wealth. This Government believes quite firmly in redistributing wealth. No actions by any government in regulating the home loan sector will prevent Australia's home buyers from suffering from this Government's weakness. Not only has this ALP Government failed to put the interests of ordinary Australians above its political imperatives but also the ACTU has betrayed the very people it purports to represent. The leaders of the ACTU cannot grasp the fact that the workers whom they want to protect from discounting are in many cases home buyers who will suffer from the high interest rates spawned by wage inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, we should not be surprised. The ACTU, in blindly seeking to maintain real wages at all costs, has given no thought to workers in marginal enterprises who stood to lose their jobs in consequence. The whole philosophy of the ACTU and those who stand in this place and apologise for it is to elevate the powers of unions and worry less about the real welfare of unionists, let alone other Australians. That was made sadly clear to all of us once again during the Mudginberri abattoir dispute when Mr Crean went on the record as saying that the so-called rights of individuals were of less account than the collective rights of institutions-powerful, greedy unions who trample on their own members as much as the general community.</PARA>
<PARA> What the ACTU is out to preserve is not social justice but privilege. Bill Kelty told the Socialist Forum that the accord had provided Australian unionists with benefits unmatched anywhere else in the world. We might dispute whether unionists benefit in the long run, but we can agree that the union movement in Australia secured a uniquely privileged deal through the accord. By surrendering control of economic policy to the ACTU, this ALP socialist Government has condemned Australians to increasing interest rates. Ultimately, however, the Government will be forced to respond to the inflation unleashed by its deal with the ACTU. Its response will have to be a tight monetary policy, again keeping high real interest rates. How ironic that the ACTU bosses who attack the principle of monetarism should by their actions and in collusion with this Labor Government inflict the most negative consequences of monetarism on their own members. I should be very interested to hear what this Government has to say on this subject in preference to that of the industrial relations which it has pursued this afternoon.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not surprising, as I rise to conclude this debate on behalf of the Government, to see the three speakers for the Opposition cloistered together in a fortress mentality on the back bench. That is where they belong. Their arguments have been as effective as their position in the chamber suggests they should be. After all, this was billed to be the first major economic debate by the new dry, or as some of us would say arid, Opposition. It has been the first debate led by the nine billion dollar man, Mr Howard. We shall hear a lot more about the nine billion dollar man as this debate finalises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not surprising, given the leadership change in the Liberal Party and the new dry image, that this debate should be ideological in character. What we have heard this afternoon has been a treatise on the theories of the Opposition. It is cause for thought indeed that, rather than have conducted this debate this afternoon, the Senate could have been considering estimates of government appropriations. Then at least the Opposition, committed to small government, could have scrutinised government estimates in order to see whether there was any fat in government Budgets. Opposition members could have done some real work. But they have not. They have chosen ideology so that they can waffle and, by choosing waffle, they have demonstrated how negative and bankrupt they are in terms of real work, real commitment and real results.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government welcomes this debate. It is a government of achievement compared to an  opposition of dismal failure. It is a government characterised by Paul Keating at the historic Press conference announcing the accord mark 2 as a can-do government, a government that confronts the problems, grapples with the issues, pays attention to the real information and comes up with workable solutions which enable economic growth, fuller employment and low inflation. This Government can be compared with the record of the Opposition as a can't-do opposition. The people of Australia cannot be fooled by rhetoric; they cannot be fooled by the painting of winsome scenarios of what might be in a perfect nineteenth century free market economy of small business-something that is not like the real Australian scenario. People cannot be fooled by those pipedreams. They pay attention to performance and results, and they know when their own well-being is being served. That is happening and has happened over the last two and a half years of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> In the numerous speeches I have given over that time on matters of public importance in this chamber, I have concentrated on referring the Opposition to the scoreboard. I have run through all the indicator points of how the Opposition did and how the present Government did. It must be a tiresome diatribe and no one on the other side has ever listened. But it is important to note yet again in this context that we halved inflation. We increased employment and lowered unemployment. When the Opposition was in government unemployment rapidly increased and the prospect of jobs for Australians became a bad dream. We have succeeded in achieving economic growth for Australia, thus not only putting people in employment but also opening up opportunities for advancement and promotion.</PARA>
<PARA> We have had a period of near 5 per cent economic growth end on end, contrasted to negative economic growth when the Opposition was in government. Given now that the new dry Opposition has proclaimed that its objective is to make industrial relations the centrepiece of its whole strategy, the record on the scoreboard shows that during the Fraser years industrial disputation in this country was, unfortunately, at record levels. During the Hawke years it is at a 17-year low and that cannot be easily set aside. Quite apart from the recitation of economic statistics, the truth is that this is a better country to live in; there is more harmony, more order, a greater sense of security, industrial peace and economic achievement. Australians know that. They not only see it in their hip pockets but also feel it as the current mood.</PARA>
<PARA> Commentators have constantly remarked upon the change. It is important to say that the Opposition now believes that there is a real choice between the parties. I am glad there is, because the people of Australia have now had the sheep's clothing removed from the wolf's back. Once they see the snarling face of the wolf that wants to plunge this country back into economic chaos, high unemployment, high inflation and massive industrial disputation, they will opt for the Government of security, sustained growth and industrial peace.</PARA>
<PARA> Our approach, contrasted to that of the Opposition, has been aimed at opting for an incomes policy to economic management. Opposition members, now proclaimed as latter day founders of the free market, adopt an approach of free marketeering that is constrained because, after all, they are a coalition by the dead hand of the agrarian socialists in the National Party. One will watch with fascination over the next few years as the internal contradiction between the demands for subsidies and support which the National Party has made its forte conflicts with the so-called deregulative approach of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA> Incomes policies of the sort to which this Government is committed are noted empirically by every study on this subject that has been published to achieve low inflation, low unemployment, high levels of growth, a better sense of security and welfare for the people of countries which adopt those policies, a good level of private investment and social and industrial innovation. They are the hallmarks of the sorts of policies we are applying. Importantly, they provide a framework and setting in which external shocks and the effects they give to economies can be minimised, worked through and resolved collectively without unleashing internal turmoil which will cause the negative effects of those external shocks to be exacerbated. The incomes policy approach enables problem solving of the can-do type that Paul Keating talked about. It also enables governments to take bold initiatives which guarantee that those initiatives once taken can succeed. Let me cite an example from the last Hawke Government. It was that Government that floated the Australian dollar. It was that Government that deregulated the financial markets-things that the now latter-day free marketeers claim they would have done but, when they had the opportunity, did not do. We did those things. We opened bank licences for Australia and we introduced 16 new banks to bring some real competition into the financial market.</PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental contradiction put by Opposition members in this matter of public importance this afternoon is that they are now, by virtue of the rise in interest rates, saying they will intervene in the free financial markets which we have created and of which they refused to take advantage when they had the opportunity. It is a direct contradiction in their policy. They have not come out and said it, but that is the alternative that they impute by the stand they have taken. The only thing that has been said by the Opposition of a positive nature has been that the deficit should have been lower. Senator Messner, the new found financial spokesman for the Opposition, led in this debate by saying that the deficit should be lower. I hark back to this place just three weeks ago, to Budget day 1985, when the now Leader of the Liberal Party, John Howard, challenged the Government to produce a Budget with a deficit of $5 billion. Three weeks ago, as history will record, the deficit came in at $4.9 billion, Senator Messner now says that the deficit is too large. Already, we see that the papering over of the cracks given the new leadership change is beginning to crack open again. We now see the shadow Finance Minister directly at odds by claiming that the deficit that Mr Howard supported, which is higher than the one we brought in, is too high.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1986-87 Budget will be very interesting. I remind Senator Messner that we now have accord mark 2. It enables us to overcome the negative effects to the economy of the devaluation of the Australian dollar by guaranteeing that we can hold the accord together with a tax-wages trade-off and with a superannuation scheme which will generate funds for investment and expansion and take pressure off the capital and financial markets in this country by making available in a short order a pool of funds of the order of about $3 billion for investment, growth and the opening of new job opportunities. That will happen in the periods which Senator Messner forecasts as gloomy times. They will not be. We have now set the seal for an economic performance that will be unmatched in Australian history. They are bold words, but let me remind the Senate that Australia is now in a situation of economic recovery. In a labour market at a time of economic recovery when there are shortages of various classifications of skill, the bargaining power of key workers or general workers increases vis-a-vis the bargaining power of employers. We are now moving towards that situation. If it were in a free market situation, that bargaining power would make the wages explosion of the last few years of the Fraser Government look like child's play.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a period of 27 months during the last years of the Fraser Government wages exploded to the tune of 28 per cent over the figures for the previous 27 months. In the same period of our Government, wages have gone up by 12 per cent. Honourable senators should bear in mind that the 28 per cent explosion in wages occurred during a period of contraction and recession. What we have been able to do in a period of growth is to hold down wages as a component cost, to reduce the unit cost of labour and to enable the shares of gross domestic product going to wages, and going to profits, to be exchanged in order to guarantee what we have seen as being the return of record profits to industry and business in Australia. That is what has happened. But we are, as I say, in a period of on-going sustained growth when certain shortages of key classifications and skills are showing up in the labour market. If it were deregulated at this point the explosion of 28 per cent that the Liberals experienced would, as I said, be a pipe-dream. The figure would be much higher than that. The accord-importantly, the accord mark 2-will enable wages to be constrained voluntarily, with no loss of purchasing power to wage and salary earners and at no further on-cost to employers. At the key moment of economic growth at which we need to have in place a contract between the Government and the union movement, we have succeeded in cementing one which will enable to continue those shares which I have talked about and the growth that we have forecast.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the scenario for the future. Let us turn to the situation that occurred in the past. The matter of public importance that we are discussing is meant to focus on interest rates. As the Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, in leading for the Government, said, he is affronted and offended by the fact that the Opposition should talk to us and lecture us about interest rates. Let us look at its record. In mid-1982 the rates for commercial bills on 90-day acceptance stood at 19.5 per cent. That was one of the interest rates which applied during the time of the previous Government. Two-year Commonwealth bonds were offered at a rate of 16.5 per cent and 15-year Commonwealth bonds were offered at 16.5 per cent. Those interest rates were much higher than those which are being enjoyed in Australia at present, as a result of the policies of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we would be wrong if we did not recognise that there are pressures on interest rates. That happens to be a feature of economic growth. With expansion and growth there is competition for the available funds in the market place. That is what is occurring in Australia at the moment. The character of the push for borrowings is that we are experiencing an expanding economy and there is competition for funds for expansion and job creation and to pick up market opportunities. Let us compare that situation with that which applied in the dying years of the Fraser Government, when interest rates were being pushed up as people borrowed in order to try to save their businesses and to prevent their doors from closing. If honourable senators opposite want to argue that point, let them look at the number of bankruptcies which occurred then compared with present figures.</PARA>
<PARA> We are enjoying a period of economic growth. The people who might be paying higher interest rates at least still have confidence in these guarantees. Their income and their next wage rise are guaranteed to be tied to prices and will be guaranteed by a cut in taxes. Their job security is guaranteed by an expanding economy and increasing employment levels. Their promotion opportunities in the business that they operate or in which they work is also guaranteed as the economy expands and diversifies. It is a vastly different economic setting to the one which Opposition senators have talked about.</PARA>
<PARA> As well, this Government has taken several steps that ought to be noted in this debate, such as the limitation on global borrowing and an agreement between the States which guarantees that gross public sector borrowing will be reduced to 5.6 per cent of GDP, a fall of 1.5 per cent this year. The global borrowing limits have reduced government competition in the market place to that extent. As well, our lower deficit has reduced government competition for funds. The position that we have arrived at by way of the accord is that now it can be guaranteed that the wages and salaries of wage and salary earners will not lose their purchasing power. On that basis there will not be any wages breakout. On that basis there will be an ability by companies to plan expansion, knowing what their future costs will be. There will be an economic environment conducive to providing lower interest rates and lower inflation. There will be greater stability and greater confidence in the economy. In those circumstances it will be steady as she goes, more of the same end-on-end growth, lower unemployment and constant levels of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> We predict that, in the Budget which Senator Messner talked about, inflation will be reduced to the 6 per cent to 7 per cent mark and ultimately will return to the 5 per cent level, a level that the Government of which Senator Messner was a part, under Malcolm Fraser, never achieved. The basic and fundamental fact is that the scoreboard results determine the end of the game, and the scoreboard in terms of our performance compared with that of the Opposition is one of security, growth and confidence in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Attorney-General aware that services provided by the Marriage Guidance Council in the Northern Territory are currently limited by its budget of only $77,000 per annum, which means that it is only able to operate one office in Darwin, to serve the whole Territory; if so:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) will the Attorney-General outline what prop- osals, if any, the Government has to extend the services offered by the Marriage Guidance Council to those who live in rural and outback areas, in view of the difficulty this poses for people who live hundreds of miles from Darwin, if they wish to use the service; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) if the Government has no proposals to extend the Council's facilities, why not.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney- General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is assumed that the amount of $77,000 referred to is the grant initially made available to the Marriage Guidance Council of the Northern Territory Inc., for the 1984-85 year which represented a 26 per cent increase over the 1983-84 grant level (The Council lodged an application for a supplementary grant of $13,240 and an additional grant of $10,000 has since been made. This amount together with the financial assistance of $77,000 already given represents over 88 per cent of the agency's revised budgeted expenditure of $98,805 for the year).</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b) The extension of services into other parts of the Territory is a matter for consideration by the Council itself which is an independent autonomous body. Any application for financial assistance received from the Council for the purpose would be considered on its merits having in mind the viability of the proposal including the likely public use of the service, and in the light of the Government's budgetary strategy at the time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator Ryan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) I am unaware of any evidence suggesting that such activities involve a highly organised national ring or are widespread in all States. Nor does there appear to be a highly organised national ring involved in the collection and smuggling out of Australia of viable eggs. Illegal collection of eggs does, however, occur and is of concern.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Illegal collection of birds eggs, for whatever purpose, poses a potential danger to endangered birds for a combination of reasons. Removing eggs directly affects the ability of the species to maintain itself. However, the methods of egg collectors can have a more far-reaching effect. Parent birds may abandon any remaining eggs and collectors may also destroy the nesting site in their efforts to obtain the eggs. The practice sometimes followed is to cut trees down to obtain access to eggs. Loss of nesting sites can pose a significant threat to the survival of some species.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The collection and possession of eggs of endangered birds is governed by legislation in each State and Territory. Officers of the State and Territory nature conservation agencies, and in some instances State police, are responsible for enforcing this legislation. The export from Australia of such items is governed by the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act which is administered by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Officers of the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police are inspectors under this Act. Since the Act came into effect on 1 May 1984, the penalties for illegally exporting or attempting or conspiring to illegally export native fauna or the products of native fauna are fines of up to $100,000 or imprisonment for up to 5 years for individuals, or fines of up to $200,000 for offences involving corporations.</PARA>
<PARA> It is inappropriate to provide details of the methods used by the agencies to combat these activities. However, the public, by reporting suspicious activities to their local nature conservation authority or police, have a significant role to play in controlling such activities.</PARA>
<PARA> At a national level, liaison and co-operation between State, Territory and Commonwealth agencies involved in this and related issues is being strengthened and measures are being developed to facilitate the transfer of information between these agencies. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is also establishing close contacts with its counterparts in countries that are participants in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The incident reported in the Courier Mail has resulted in 9 people being charged under the New South Wales legislation for collecting 33,000 eggs of protected or endangered birds. There is no evidence suggesting the egg collections were destined for overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA> On 11 September 1984, two American citizens were convicted under Western Australian legislation for illegally collecting 29 galah eggs (Cacatua roseicapilla) and 3 long-billed corella eggs (Cacatua tenuirostris). They were also convicted on charges relating to damage of nesting sites.</PARA>
<PARA> On 12 September 1984, two American citizens coming from Australia were intercepted by United States Customs as they entered the United States. They were found to be in possession of 27 cockatoo and hawk eggs. The prosecution is not yet finalised but the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has provided information to support prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA> On 5 January 1985, the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory seized 4,509 eggs of which approximately 2,500 have been identified as the eggs of native species. Prosecution on this matter is pending.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Will the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs take action to establish an office of the Department in Alice Springs, so that those who choose to make Central Australia their home can enjoy the same services as other Australians, in view of the large number of people of a variety of ethnic backgrounds who are settling in Alice Springs, and the remoteness, of the nearest office of the Department from Alice Springs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The Department maintains a Regional Office in Darwin which is responsible for dealing directly with the community in delivering post-arrival services and in handling matters such as family migration sponsorship, citizenship, extension of stay and authority to return. Visits to other centres and outlying areas in the Region are undertaken by staff of the Darwin Office.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, a Migrant Access Centre and Migrant Resource Centre are operated in Darwin. Both of these provide a range of services for the migrant community at large.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department regularly reviews both workloads and demands for services in outlying areas. Expenditure and staffing restraints require the careful examination of proposals to extend the existing office network to maximise the benefit to all clients of the Department. New offices are not established without clear justification on the basis of assessed need and taking into account cost/effectiveness considerations.</PARA>
<PARA>An office in Alice Springs is not considered to be justified at this time. The Department is, however, reviewing the frequency of visits to the area by Regional Office staff.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator Ryan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Aerial surveys of kangaroo habitat were undertaken over extensive areas of Australia during 1984. For those areas surveyed, populations of the Red, Eastern and Western Greys were estimated to be in excess of 10.7 million. Areas surveyed represent approximately 45 per cent of Australia and an estimate of total number of kangaroos would require extrapolation from that figure.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The population estimate for those areas surveyed has been derived from pooling survey data from a number of different sources. Estimates for which the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service was responsible were made public at the time quotas were set for 1985. Following agreement by the other organisations involved in survey work, their estimates were also made available publicly.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The senator may be referring to a recent article `The European Trade in Kangaroo Products' which appeared in Traffic Bulletin Vol. VI No. 5 of 21 January 1985. In this publication, ABS statistics were questioned on the basis of claims by Italian leather dealers. I am not aware of any substantiation of these claims.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) This question should be directed to the Minister responsible for the ABS.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. Controls on the commercial industry in State kangaroo management programs operate to control kangaroo products entering commercial trade. There is no evidence of a large illegal trade in kangaroo skins available to me. All exports require a permit under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 and permits are only issued for kangaroo products taken under approved management programs. Substantial penalties exist for illegal activity.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No. In setting quotas no account is taken of export orders.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government is aware of reports that the Armed Forces of the Philippines have used chemical weapons and napalm against Moro National Liberation Front forces in Mindanao. These allegations are being investigated by the Justice Committee of the Philippines National Assembly. The Committee has not yet concluded its inquiry but I understand that the initial investigation by the Committee did not uncover evidence of the use of napalm or chemical weapons. The Government is not aware of any other evidence to substantiate these claims.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is no evidence to suggest that Nomad aircraft have been used to release ordnance of any description. These aircraft, purchased commercially by the Philippines Air Force in 1975, are not fitted with mechanisms to operate any weapons.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Assistance relating to aircraft under the Defence Cooperation Program with the Philippines has been confined to developing a maintenance support system for the Nomad aircraft. A Nomad was used to ferry munitions and ground crew during counter-insurgency operations at the Carandangan complex, Lanao del Sur from 5-7 August 1984. A Nomad aircraft was later used for examination of the area as part of Philippine Air Force investigation of allegations that napalm and chemical weapons were used during the operations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government supports defence co-operation with regional countries to assist them to develop capabilities to counter external threats and deter the emergence of such threats. The small Philippines program, which has been conducted since 1972, reflects these aims and concentrates on activities which assist in the transfer of technical and managerial skills. The program does not imply, on the part of either Government, endorsement of any or all of the policies of the other.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government institutions and agencies that carry out experiments or fund research involving the use of animals are associated with the Health, Primary Industry, and Science Ministries. Relevant laboratories are located in all States as well as the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The responsibilities of my portfolio only extend to research involving animals conducted by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and this question should also be directed to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Primary Industry. However, no central compilation of animal experimentation is undertaken by the Government and there is no statement available of the number of medical and non-medical experiments conducted by Government agencies over the last ten years nor any breakdown of the purposes of these experiments and the animal species involved. Depending upon the viewpoint of the research worker, an experiment can extend over hours, months or years and there would need to be agreement on what constitutes an experiment before attempting such a compilation. I understand that the Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare is addressing the need for statistics on animal experiments to be collected on a uniform basis in the course of its present Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA> Most Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation research involving the use of animals is concerned with the control and prevention of animal diseases, improved animal husbandry, and the conservation and management of native and introduced fauna.</PARA>
<PARA> Details of species and numbers of animals used in experiments by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Divisions for the years 1981/82, 1982/83 and 1983/84 are given in Table 1. These figures do not include breeding stock nor animals held in reserve that have yet to be used for research purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> The statistics in Table 1 were compiled following the establishment within Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Divisions of Animal Experimentation Ethics Committees in accordance with the requirements of the NH&amp;RC/CSIRO AAC `Code of Pratice for the Care and Use of Animals for Experimental Purposes'. These Committees are required to maintain `appropriate and adequate records related to animal experimentation'. Earlier details of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's animal experimentation are widely scattered and their compilation would be difficult and the results misleading because of inconsistency in recording.</PARA>
<PARA> Table 2 gives the number of wildlife animals held by the Division of Wildlife and Rangelands Research at its Australian Capital Territory Laboratory. Most of the fauna held by the Division of Wildlife and Rangelands Research is run under semi-natural conditions.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honour- able senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. A 20 per cent margin of preference for locally produced goods is applied to Commonwealth purchases. Relevant import duties are taken into account on a notional basis. Preference does not apply to services purchased separately from goods since in the great majority of cases these services necessarily are performed within Australia. Where the 20 per cent general margin would result in an additional cost to the Commonwealth of $200 000 or more, Ministers have discretion over whether or not it should apply.</PARA>
<PARA> Ministers also review all purchases valued at over $100 000 where application of preference is insufficient to give the contract to a suitable offer of higher Australian content. A group of departments advise Ministers whether, in such cases, a margin of preference of more than 20 per cent is warranted. Factors considered are whether local sourcing would assist the development of competitive high technology industries with growth potential; would assist in establishing or maintaining defence-strategic capabilities; or would avoid significant additional disruption in severely depressed labour markets. Tenderers may be asked to provide additional information on these aspects. The maximum preference margin that may be awarded is 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Supplementing these preference margin arrangements, purchasing procedures also provide that Government specifications may not exclude suitable, or reasonably adaptable, Australian or New Zealand-made products; that alternative solutions offered by Australian manufacturers must be considered; that as far as practicable, ordering patterns must be scaled to the minimum economic order requirements of Australian industry; and that briefings be available to unsuccessful tenderers on the reasons why they failed to win orders.</PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements apply to purchases by all Commonwealth departments and most statutory authorities, however a small number of authorities are restricted by their enabling legislation from applying the preference arrangements in their entirety.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) With the exception of the Republic of Korea, all of the countries listed are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Details of purchasing policies of members were published by the OECD in its 1976 publication `Government Purchasing-Regulations and Procedures of OECD Member Countries'. Establishing what changes, if any, have taken place in these policies in the intervening period would require approaching each of the relevant countries concerned, since that information is not maintained by departments as a matter of course. More recently, information and comment on aspects of purchasing policies in some of the countries listed in the question (i.e. USA; Canada: UK; Sweden; Japan; France; Federal Republic of Germany) was included in the August 1984 report by the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) on Government Purchasing and Offset Policies in Industrial Innovation. I refer the honourable senator to these publications.</PARA>

<PARA> The Senator is referred to the IAC's previous publications, Trends in Assistance to Manufacturing (May 1980-an updated version of this publication will be released shortly) and Assistance to Australian Agriculture (1983), for detailed information on the derivation and interpretation of these measures. In particular, it must be emphasised that these measures only represent income transfers, primarily from consumers to other sections of the community-to factors of production, including employees who are also consumers-resulting from the assistance structure. As such, a number of important qualifications should be made:</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the manurfacturing sector, the CTE-which is the amount of income transferred as a result of consumers paying higher prices for both domestically produced goods and imports, through such measures as tariffs, import quotas and discriminatory domestic pricing arrangements for agricultural commodities-is a tax on all consumption, not only final consumption. That is, since some manufactured goods are used as inputs into other manufacturing processes the CTE estimates the tax on both manufactured final goods and the inputs used in the production of these final goods.</PARA>
<PARA> These transfer measures cannot be used to indicate the economic costs to the community of assistance. The economic costs of assistance are the efficiency losses that occur because resources are not allocated to their most productive uses and because consumption patterns are usually distorted relative to the patterns that would exist if there was no assistance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 May 1985 (Hansard, page 2070) Senator Puplick asked me, as Minister representing the Attorney-General, a question without notice relating to an Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision under the Freedom of Information Act 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General has provided me with the following additional information in answer to Senator Puplick's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to which Senator Puplick referred is Re Joyce E. Shewcroft and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (27 February 1985). The Tribunal considered the operation of section 24 of the Act which permits agencies and Ministers to refuse an applicant access to documents if giving access would substantially and unreasonably divert resources from other operations.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues before the Tribunal was whether the motive of the applicant could be taken into account in applying this provision. Contrary to the impression which the honourable senator has of the finding of the Tribunal, the Tribunal did not find that the request was made in order to embarass the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. On the contrary, the Tribunal found that the applicant had a genuine personal interest in the information in question and that access might also serve the public interest. Without holding that it was necessarily entitled to do so, the Tribunal took this into account in the applicant's favour but nevertheless still upheld the claim of the Corporation to refuse the request on the basis of section 24 of the Act. Since, to the extent to which the Tribunal took motive into account the applicant was favoured in reaching its decision, there was no occasion to consider an appeal.</PARA>
<PARA> In its Report on the Freedom of Information Bill 1978 and aspects of the Archives Bill 1978 (paragraph 8.1), the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs said: `The premise on which the whole Freedom of Information Bill is constructed is that access to information is a matter of right and not something which is dependent on a showing of interest or need to know in any particular case'. In introducing the Freedom of Information Bill 1978 in the Senate the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, said: `Access to information under the Bill will not depend on the person seeking access having to show a special interest in obtaining information. Lack of a special interest will not be a ground on which information can be withheld' (Hansard 9 June 1978, page 2689). In introducing the Freedom of Information Amendment Bill 1983 in the Senate on 2 June 1983 the Attorney-General, Senator Evans, did not refer to the question whether the motive of applicants is a matter to be taken into account by tribunals and courts.</PARA>
<PARA> Since there has been no decision of the Tribunal or of the Courts which is contrary to the principle in issue, the question of amending the Act as suggested by the Honourable Senator does not arise. There are cases in which the Tribunal has suggested that the Act should be applied in favour of persons having access to documents relating to their own affairs, but that is not regarded as being in breach of the principle referred to-see the 1983-1984 Annual Report by the Attorney-General on the Freedom of Information Act, paragraph 4.7.3. At the same time it should be noted that the motive of an applicant in seeking access to documents may be relevant to the question whether access should be given as an exercise of discretion even though the request might otherwise properly be refused under an exception or exemption in the Act. Moreover, it may also be relevant to the question of remission of charges payable under the Act.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The following social welfare payments paid by the Department of Social Security are neither income-tested nor taxed:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Family allowances.</PARA>

<PARA> (f) Incentive allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Remote area allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> Remote area allowance and incentive allowance are only available to those in receipt of an income-tested payment, but the allowances themselves are not subject to an income test or taxation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2)-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Family allowances were introduced in 1976 to replace the previous system of child endowment and tax rebates for children. Family allowances, like tax rebates, have the effect of increasing the effective tax threshold for families with eligible children. The major argument in favour of the allowances retaining their income-test free, tax-free status that is generally put is that, at any income level, families with children have a lower capacity to pay tax than individuals or similar families without children.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The means test for blind invalid pensioners was abolished in 1954, primarily in order to promote work incentives. Age and invalid pensions were exempted from income tax in 1941. Most basic social security payments again became taxable in 1976, the major exception being invalid pension (including invalid pension for the permanently blind) for those below age pension age. The main reason for this appears to be the argument that any decision to tax invalid pension would create undue disincentives for the disabled and the blind to seek and retain employment, given the special difficulties they experience in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to (e) Handicapped child's allowance, double orphan's pension and mobility allowance are paid in recognition of the special circumstances of recipients of these payments, and it has been the view of successive governments that income-testing and/or taxing such payments would be inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Incentive allowance is intended to eliminate any disincentive effect that the supplementary (rent) assistance income test has on earnings of sheltered workshop employees and it has therefore been considered inappropriate to income-test or tax the payment.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Remote area allowance provides broadly equivalent assistance to that available to taxpayers through the income tax Zone A rebate and is neither income-tested nor taxed in order to maintain this equivalence with the zone rebate.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Family allowances, handicapped child's allowance, double orphan's pension and the mobility, incentive and remote area allowances have been free of income tests and taxation since their introduction.</PARA>
<PARA> Invalid pension paid to the permanently blind has been exempt from tax since 1941 and free of income test since 1954.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The Agreement between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the application of safeguards in the Soviet Union was signed on 21 February 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Nuclear weapon states are under no obligation through their membership of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to accept IAEA safeguards on any or all of their nuclear facilities. Their safeguards agreements with the IAEA are consequently described as `voluntary offer' agreements, the scope of which is determined by the offering nuclear weapon state. The agreement between the Soviet Union and the IAEA specifies that `some of its peaceful nuclear facilities, namely several nuclear power stations and nuclear research reactors' will be placed under IAEA safeguards. Under the agreement the Soviet Union is to provide the IAEA with a list of facilities offered for the application of safeguards and the IAEA is to select facilities for safeguarding from the list. The details of the facilities offered and selected are not known.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Soviet Union has graphite-moderated reactors, but as indicated above it is not known whether such reactors are included in the voluntary offer.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am not sure what is meant by the honourable senator's suggestion that IAEA inspections are not to interfere with national sovereignty. When a state enters into a safeguards agreement with the IAEA that state necessarily accepts as legally binding the obligations contained in the agreement. The nature of these obligations depends on whether the particular state is a nuclear weapons state or a non-nuclear weapons state. In the case of a nuclear weapons state, where by definition the acquisition of nuclear weapons is not an issue, the obligations as to submission of nuclear facilities to IAEA inspections are as outlined in (1) (a) above. Non- nuclear weapons states parties to the NPT, which of course constitute the vast majority of states with which the IAEA has safeguards agreements, are obliged to place all of their nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards thereby providing an assurance that any nuclear material within that state is not diverted from peaceful uses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The National Capital Development Commission issued a letter of acceptance to the contractor on 25 June 1984. The actual removal of asbestos did not start until 18 October 1984 because it was necessary for the contractor to conduct a series of smoke tests to establish the integrity of the plastic screen to be used.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) All major asbestos removal is expected to be completed by August 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The most significant problem which faced the contractor was his ability to obtain and train a suitable workforce to effectively and efficiently complete the project. There has been a very high turnover of staff because the work is hard and very tedious. The fire which occurred on 8 March 1985 also caused significant delays to the project.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The current authorisation for the project is $1,600,547 and 7 days have been lost due to industrial delays.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment has provided the following answer to part 4 of the question:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There has been no industrial action by National Library staff related to the removal of asbestos from the building since the removal commenced.</PARA>
<PARA> Some disruption to the Library's services had been anticipated once a decision had been made to remove the asbestos. Although the Library took all steps possible to reduce inconvenience to users and staff, there have been delays in several services to users. From July 1984 to the end of May 1985 the Library has been evacuated on 14 afternoons and 8 evenings. The need to vacate floor 4 of the Library building while the asbestos is being removed has placed pressure on staff accommodation, limited conference facilities and limited reader services facilities. It has also necessitated the out-housing of approximately 3,000 sq. metres of library materials which has caused delays in providing access to these materials to the Library's clients.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's decision to review the arrangements for providing domiciliary nursing care to Department of Veterans' Affairs clients in Tasmania was made in the interest of reducing expenditure on these services. There was particular concern that, in 1982/83 for example, Tasmanian Branch expenditure on domiciliary nursing represented 11.6 per cent of national expenditure, despite Tasmania having only about 4 per cent of Department of Veterans' Affairs clients.</PARA>
<PARA> An investigation of cost control options was undertaken by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Following this investigation, the Government decided to end using fee-for-service providers and to provide services using Departmental employees.</PARA>
<PARA> This decision is presently under review following a request by the Tasmanian Minister for Health Services that the State be given the opportunity to consider the possibility of providing all the domiciliary nursing needs of my Department's entitled beneficiaries. Discussions are taking place between Commonwealth and State officials on this matter. Another option is also being investigated.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator Gietzelt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My attention has been drawn to Mr Smith's publication and I have noted his claims. On 1 March 1985 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure announced that it had decided to look into the issues raised by Mr Smith. A sub-committee chaired by Mrs Ros Kelly, MP, was formed for this purpose. In these circumstances, it is appropriate to refrain for the moment from giving detailed answers to questions on these subjects until the sub-committee has completed its task. However the following brief comment on the technical aspects of the question may be of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> Two broad categories of aircraft are recognised through international consensus. A maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 5,700kg represents the dividing line between the `small' and `transport' categories. Different standards of design, maintenance, crewing and general operating conditions apply to aircraft in each of these categories with the more stringent requirements applying to transport aircraft types. The Metro II has been certificated for operations in the `small' aircraft category. The Metro III has been designed and built to standards applicable to `small' aircraft (i.e. MTOW below 5,700kg) and it has not been certificated to operate at weights above 5,700kg in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The US regulatory authorities have permitted some aircraft types, including the Metro III, to operate at weights in excess of 12,500lbs although they are designed only to the standards for `small' aircraft. This departure from internationally accepted practice is allowed by the US authorities only in the case of aircraft that are designed and produced before certain specified dates.</PARA>
<PARA> Other countries are considering whether they also will allow the operation of `overweight' aircraft, and under what conditions. Present indications are that countries such as the U.K. and Canada have imposed or will impose certain safety related requirements that are additional to the requirements set by the U.S. authorities. At this time my Department believes that several countries besides USA may be operating Metro III aircraft of MTOW above 12,500lbs with special conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department's approach is similar to that of the U.K. and Canadian authorities. Action is well advanced, in consultation with the aviation industry, to introduce such a provision subject to certain safety related requirements being met.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty, the number of public broadcasting licences which will be granted over the next several years. The answer to the senator's question is dependent on a number of factors, ranging from the degree of public support that can be generated by groups interested in obtaining a public broadcasting licence, to the Department of Communications capacity to process relevant planning proposals, and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's ability to schedule and complete public enquiries into the grant of each licence.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Communications currently has registered 179 expressions of interest in new public broadcasting station licences, and has on hand 31 planning proposals for such services.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department of Communications does not gather or maintain data on the type or condition of technical equipment used by public broadcasting stat- ions. As the senator may be aware, the Department is primarily concerned with the adequacy of the signals radiated by licensees. Public Broadcasters make their own arrangements about the provision of technical equipment, and these arrangements vary markedly from station to station. Some licensees have constructed much of their own equipment, whilst others have acquired fully professional transmitter facilities. I suggest that the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia would be best placed to provide the information being sought.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Sales tax exemption on capital equipment purchases would certainly reduce outlays for public broadcasters.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The sixth round of the talks began in 1982 between the USSR and China and took place on 9-22 April in Moscow. At the conclusion of this round of talks both sides reaffirmed their readiness to expand contacts in the political, economic, scientific and cultural areas. There has in fact been significant growth in the relationship in the last few years, particularly in trade. There has been no progress, however, on the three conditions which China has established for the normalisation and development of political relations. Furthermore, China has made it quite clear that it does not contemplate a return to the close relationship which prevailed during the 1950s. These points were confirmed in statements by Hu Yaobang, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, during his recent visit to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Given the existence of such limits to a fundamental improvement in Sino-Soviet relations, andChina's clearly stated intention to pursue an independent foreign policy, it does not at present seem likely that the process of normalisation of Sino-Soviet relations will have a marked effect on the Western Alliance or on Australia. A reduction in tension between China and the Soviet Union, to the extent that it contributed to a general reduction of regional tensions, would be in accordance with Australia's interest.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is not possible to give a clear-cut or definitive answer to this question. It should be remembered that the most positive development to have occurred recently in East-West relations, the resumption of arms limitation talks between the US and the USSR, is the outcome of an agreement reached several months before Mr Gorbachev came to power. In general, Western countries have taken an attitude of cautious optimism to Mr Gorbachev's statement of willingness to reduce tensions, while noting that many of his specific proposals do not go beyond already familiar Soviet positions. It would therefore be premature to speak of a genuine softening of relations between East and West.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The first round of the bilateral arms control negotiations betweens the Soviet Union and the United States took place in Geneva from 12 March to 23 April. Both sides' accounts of the first round indicate that it was largely taken up with procedural matters and presentation of views. No substantive progress was to be expected at the first meeting of what both sides recognise will inevitably be a long, slow process.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Decisions about the curriculum of Queensland State high schools are matters for the Queensland Minister for Education.

I have however been advised that neither the Queensland Board of Secondary School Studies science syllabus for years 8-10 nor the Queensland biological science syllabus for years 11 and 12 requires the teaching of `creation' as such.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Article I of the 1971 Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Seabed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof (The Seabed Arms Control Treaty) states inter alia that:</PARA>
<PARA> The States Parties to this Treaty undertake not to emplant or emplace on the seabed and the ocean floor and in the subsoil thereof beyond the outer Limit of a seabed zone, as defined in Article II, any nuclear weapons or any other types of weapons of mass destruction as well as structures, launching installations or any other facilities specifically designed for storing, testing or using such weapons and</PARA>
<PARA> The States Parties to this Treaty undertake not to assist, encourage or induce any State to carry out activities referred to in paragraph 1 of this article and not to participate in any other way in such actions.</PARA>
<PARA> The States Parties to the Treaty have not interpreted Article I to have any application to the emplacement on the seabed of deep ocean transponders to monitor the impact in broad ocean areas of unarmed ballistic missiles during the tests of such delivery vehicles. A number of states have conducted test firings of unarmed ballistic missiles into broad ocean areas since the 1960s using such transponders to monitor impact. In this regard, the Final Declaration of the Second Review Conference of the Seabed Arms Control Treaty held in September 1983 stated, inter alia, that the review undertaken by the conference confirms that the obligations assumed under Article I of the Treaty have been faithfully observed by the States Parties. Australia, the United States, USSR and other States Parties endorsed this Declaration. On the basis of the foregoing, and State practice, the Government does not consider the placement of the transponders to be contrary to Article I. It will not therefore call upon the United States to remove the transponders nor will it refer the matter to the United Nations Security Council.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The problem of used car dealers breaking the law and selling `lemons' to consumers is not new and is certainly not limited to Victoria. Whilst there appears to be many media reports of such instances, it is not possible to state exactly the incidence of law-breaking amongst used car dealers. At the Commonwealth level the Trade Practices Commission has taken and will continue to take appropriate action under the Trade Practices Act 1974. As recently as 31 May 1985 the Commission successfully prosecuted a used car dealer in Queensland for displaying vehicles with altered odometer readings.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I agree there is a need to ensure that consumers are given adequate protection from unscrupulous traders throughout the Commonwealth. For this reason the Standing Committee of Consumers Affairs Ministers is working towards the introduction of uniform consumer protection legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Act 1974 provides protection for consumers from unfair business practices of corporations. Section 52 prohibits companies from engaging in conduct that is deceptive or misleading. The various paragraphs of section 53 of the Act prohibit companies from making false representations in relation to the standard, quality or grade of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA> Part V, Division 2 of the Act implies certain conditions and warranties in contracts for the supply of goods or services by a corporation to a consumer. Those provisions which are of particular relevance to used car buyers are:</PARA>
<PARA> section 69 (1)-the implied condition that the buyer will enjoy quiet possession of the goods;</PARA>
<PARA> section 70 (1)-the implied condition that goods will correspond to description;</PARA>
<PARA> section 71 (1)-the implied condition that goods supplied under a contract for the supply of goods are of merchantable quality;</PARA>
<PARA> section 71 (2)-the implied condition that goods are reasonably fit for the particular purpose for which they were acquired;</PARA>
<PARA> section 74-warranties in relation to the supply of services.</PARA>
<PARA> By virtue of section 68, these conditions and warranties cannot be excluded.</PARA>
<PARA> The rights which are conferred by Division 2 of Part V are private contractual rights which are enforceable through the State and Territory court systems.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is intending to introduce amendments to Parts V and VI of the Trade Practices Act to strengthen the existing protection offered to consumers and to provide a greater deterrent for offenders. I believe that, if the amendments are enacted, there will be adequate legislative protection for consumers at the Commonwealth level. There is legislation in the States to protect consumers from unfair conduct outside the area of Commonwealth power.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) In Australia's view the nuclear weapon states parties to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty have not met the expectations of the non-nuclear weapon states parties as regards the implementation of Article VI of the Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. Australia will be seeking an honest and balanced appraisal of the implementation of Article VI of the Treaty. In this regard we will argue for due recognition of the importance of the resumption of bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union in Geneva on nuclear and outer space issues. However, while registering our strong concern over the lack of substantive results since 1980 in regard to Article VI issues we will be seeking to avoid anything that will endanger the success of the Conference and the well-being of the NPT.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia's concerns about the implementation of Article VI have been expressed directly to the three powers in unequivocal terms. They also permeate our day to day discussions with the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union on disarmament issues and on the NPT. These concerns include the question of how the three depository powers intend to fulfil their obligations under Article VI. The resumption of the US/Soviet bilatetals in Geneva is a step in this direction. As is widely known Australia's persistent advocacy of immediate resumption of work towards a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, including direct representations to the three NPT depositary States, relates directly to our view of how progress would be made towards the implementation of Article VI. We intend to reiterate these views to the Review Conference.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) The decision by a majority of the High Court in Repatriation Commission v O'Brien in February this year required urgent legislative action.</PARA>

<PARA> Has the Minister representing the Minister for Communications had drawn to his attention the decision in the High Court of Australia which upheld an appeal by television stations against the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's perceived right to ensure that children's television programs fitted in with the guidelines as laid down by the Tribunal before those programs went to air? Is it a fact that the Government made great play of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal having that power to ensure the standards of programs for children on all Australian television stations? What action does the Government propose? Does it propose to introduce legislation to enable the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal legally to ensure that its program standards are observed before programs go to air?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> As stated in the second reading speech to the 1985 amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, it is the Government's intention to bring forward amendments to clarify and affirm the Tribunal's powers to make standards. Included in these amendments will be provisions to affirm the Tribunal's powers to determine program and advertising standards which embody both qualitative and quantitative rules and to preclassify children's programs designed for the under 14 age group.</PARA>

<PARA> Has the Minister for Education seen the Press report in today's edition of the Australian in relation to the Queensland Institute of Technology's participation in the Government's equity program? Can the Minister inform the Senate of further information in relation to the Institute? Are other programs envisaged for other higher education institutions?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Institute of Technology was one of 15 higher education institutions throughout Australia to have recently received a grant under the 1985 equity program. These projects are being funded from the $1m available in 1985 for the equity program in the higher education sector which is administered by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. It is a new program designed to try out approaches to improve the participation of people from disadvantaged groups in the community such as Aborigines, women, disabled persons, ethnic groups, young people from low income families and people living in outer metropolitan and rural areas in higher education. In the honourable senator's State of New South Wales the Commonwealth has provided $245 000 to support projects at Nepean CAE, Macarthur Institute of Higher Education (with Macquarie University and Nepean CAE), the New South Wales Institute of Technology and the University of Wollongong. Further details of all projects were provided in my press release of 14 March 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> The women in non-traditional professions scheme at the Queensland Institute of Technology is seeking to increase the participation of women in the Institute's engineering and surveying courses by:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) mounting an active recruitment campaign-including advertising, school liaison, seminars and orientation programs;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) introducing a preparatory bridging course-which will attempt to redress deficiencies in previous academic background through basic maths, science and engineering subjects; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) setting up arrangements including a study area exclusively for these students use, staffed by a woman engineer who will act as a tutor and co-ordinator of the program.</PARA>
<PARA> It is envisaged that the provisions of such support services will be concentrated most heavily in the first few semesters and that students in the program will move completely into the mainstream course by the end of their third semester.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is contributing $80 000 to the project in 1985. It is open to other institutions to provide similar assistance to groups of students from within the total recurrent funding provided by the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. I am aware of the claims made by the Australian Teachers Federation in the document `ATF Parliamentary Briefs' that specific spending on professional development of teachers has declined sharply since 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> Direct comparisons between figures for 1976 and 1985 are misleading as the programs to which the funds relate are not directly comparable. There have been major changes to the Schools Commission's teacher training and development programs during the years 1976-85.</PARA>
<PARA> A total of $27,032,000 was appropriated for expenditure on professional development activities conducted under the provisions of the Schools Commission's programs prior to 1 January 1976. These funds were provided for the following purposes:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Library training and associated teacher replacement or remuneration costs</PARA>
<PARA>$4,378,000</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Special education training courses and associated teacher replacement or remuneration costs</PARA>

<PARA> recurrent grants-$764,000</PARA>
<PARA> capital grants-$2,055,000</PARA>
<PARA>$2,819,000</PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 funds for library training were combined with funds provided through the Services and Development Program for general development activities and associated teacher replacement or remuneration. The total appropriation in 1976 provided through the Services and Development Program and through the Special Education Program was $18,226,000.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1977 funds for special education training were also incorporated into the grants provided through the Services and Development Program and the allocation totalled $18,595,500.</PARA>
<PARA> Between 1978 and 1979 funds for professional development were maintained approximately in real terms at 1977 levels.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1980 the Fraser Government imposed cuts on the Schools Commission's funds which resulted in reductions of 26 per cent over 1979 levels for the Services and Development Program to $15,237,000.</PARA>
<PARA> This program was renamed the `Professional Development Program' in 1982 and continued to provide general provisions for teachers, parents and members of the school community to take part in in-service activities. Funding levels were maintained at the reduced 1980 levels during the 1981-83 period.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the Hawke Government decided that for 1984 the general provisions of the Professional Development Program should be reduced from $17,438,000 (1983) to $10,812,000 with the introduction of the Computer Education Program and the Participation and Equity Program, each of which contain significant financial provisions for professional development. A total of $52,246,000 was provided for these two programs in 1984. The majority of Commonwealth funds provided in the Professional Development Program were to be used for the support and funding of activities rather than for teacher replacement.</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the Basic Learning in Primary Schools Program in 1985 which places special emphasis on in-service training has further increased the present Government's substantial support for professional development.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. I am aware of the claims made by the ATF that it would take an injection of $10,000,000 to restore spending levels to those of 1983. However, these claims take little account of the significant additional support for teacher development made available through the three major new programs introduced since the Government came to office. The decision to reduce direct funding to the Professional Development Program in 1984 was also based on the Government's belief that the primary responsibility for general professional development rests with the employing authorities and the teaching profession itself. The Government considers that Commonwealth funds should be applied to support Commonwealth objectives in education.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government stated in its Guidelines to the Schools Commission and the Tertiary Education Commission for 1984 that insufficient attention has been given to defining and co-ordinating the relative roles and funding responsibilities of the various parties involved in professional development. It has requested the Commonwealth Schools Commission and the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission to undertake jointly a major review of all aspects of teacher education. An Interim Report has been completed and is being distributed to all interest groups for comment. The Government has also requested the Commonwealth Schools Commission to undertake a review of its Professional Development Program as part of its general review of specific purpose programs.</PARA>
<PARA> To assist in its review tasks the Schools Commission commissioned a study by Dr Frank Coulter and Mr Lawrence Ingvarson. The report of this study, entitled `Professional Development and the Improvement of Schooling: Roles and Responsibilities', has been published by the Commission and distributed to the educational community for comment. The Schools Commission has received a response from the ATF to this report in which the points mentioned by Senator Jones are raised. These matters will be considered by the two education commissions in the context of the Joint Review of Teacher Education, and by the Commonwealth Schools Commission separately in its Specific Purpose Programs Review. The reports of these reviews will be finalised later this year and will then be given detailed consideration by the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Mr L. Greenham, the Vice President of the Blinded Soldiers of St Dunstan's, wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 28 October 1984 concerning his interpretation of recommendation 32 of the Advisory Committee on Repatriation Legislation Review relating to service pension eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The test for permanent unemployability at present applied is administratively the same as that for the invalid pension. The proposed change will give legislative authority to the practice.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The Advisory Committee outlined in some detail its recommendations on `qualifying service', the term proposed to replace `theatre of war', in recommendation 32 (i). It was not proposed that the principle of restricting the service pension to veterans who have incurred danger from the enemy be changed. Further support for this view can be found at paragraph 10.14 of the Advisory Committee's report where it said `There is a need to ensure that a person served where there was some danger from hostile forces before being eligible for the service pension'.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. Disability pension compensation for blindness resulting from service does not depend on whether the veteran was blinded in training or not.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. In 1955 means test ceiling limits were eliminated for age, invalid and disability pensioners receiving disability pension. At the same time the ceiling limits were eased but not eliminated for blind age invalid and service pensioners who also received disability pension. There was no change to the requirement for veterans to have theatre of war service before being eligible for service pension.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes. The rate of age or invalid pension for veterans may be reduced depending on the rate of disability pension received. Age or invalid pensioners with no disability pension are not subject to this limitation. These limitation provisions do not apply to veteran service pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes. That is the reason why standard disability compensation, at the Special Rate of $175.75 per week, is paid to all veterans blinded as the result of their service, whether this occurred in training or not.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The repatriation legislation will continue to provide disability compensation as outlined in the answer to Question 7. There will also be no change to the basic requirement that veterans must have experienced danger from hostile forces before being eligible for the service pension. This is in accordance with the recommendations of the Advisory Committee as explained in the answer to part (3) of the Question. There really is no anomaly. In the case quoted, the veteran does not have an entitlement to receive a service pension because he does not have the requisite service. Adequate compensation is available through the disability pension system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday 19 March 1985 (Hansard, page 385) Senator Reynolds asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can the Minister ensure that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board and management is advised that Queensland viewers, reliant on the remote area television service, are totally dissatisfied with the news and weather services as presented directed from Sydney? This means that these communities are totally out of touch with their State news and weather forecasts. Can the Minister ascertain why the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is failing to provide relevant news and weather services to these remote communities? Furthermore, can he advise when the ABC will adopt the Government's commitment to localism and provide appropriate services to local communities which, after all fund the Corporation?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised by the ABC that the Corporation is aware that a number of Queensland viewers are dissatisfied with the ABC's news and weather services. As a result of this, on 11 April 1985 senior ABC executives met with representatives, including Parliamentarians and rural industry groups, of regional Queensland areas to discuss the problems associated with the Remote Area Television Service (RATS) in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 April 1985, the ABC announced that it would be conducting a study into the viewing needs of its audience in Queensland regional areas. As part of this study, the ABC will also review the desirability of the Northern Territory continuing to receive the Sydney/Melbourne version of the ABC National. The RATS transmitters; in Queensland which service Darwin, Alice Springs, Katherine and Tennant Creek take this version instead of the Brisbane National in response to the Northern Territory's wishes. Consultations will be held with Federal Parliamentarians representing Queensland regional areas and the ABC Queensland Advisory Council when sufficient data, including costings, has been collected by the study group.</PARA>
<PARA> It is expected in the longer term that when the ABC converts to the use of the AUSSAT satellite system for program distribution, ABC RATS transmitters in Queensland will be fed directly from Brisbane. The programming will then be part of the Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite service (HACBSS) which will provide separate programs for south-eastern Australia, Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory and Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The ABC has responded to the Government's review into localism and subsequent report, `Localism in Australian Broadcasting' (the Oswin Report) which states:</PARA>
<PARA> `4.78 With regard to television studios in major provincial areas, the ABC submission to this Review indicated that it had re-evaluated this policy and decided on a phased withdrawal of the services provided in regional centres (Rockhampton and Townsville). The decision was based on the manner in which ABC television will be distributed once the domestic satellite is in operation (through capital city services and HACBSS, which will make ABC television available to the 300,000+ Australians who currently receive no television) and the difficulty of providing regional television services on a cost-effective basis.</PARA>
<PARA> 4.79 This approach is endorsed by the Review. The responsibilities of a national broadcaster to provide particular regional services on a permanent basis were more effectively undertaken through radio, for economic reasons and for the greater flexibility which that medium can provide-particularly when the second regional radio network is operational. As well, the priorities of a national broadcaster should place extensive regional television services well behind the provision of a service to remote areas which currently have no access to television. Furthermore, as recognised by the ABC in its submission, the expansion of regionally oriented and produced commercial television services through supplementary licences will further fulfil the programming needs of regional television audiences and complement the ABC's national service.</PARA>
<PARA> With this in mind, ABC Radio is expanding its services in Queensland with the development of the Second Regional Network. This will happen as soon as practicable after the Aussat satellite launch later this year. In north Queensland there will be a new radio studio at Mount Isa and upgraded studios in Cairns, Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton. This expansion, coupled with the extension of ABC-FM, will ensure that in the next few years regional listeners will have a choice of three ABC radio services.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Wednesday 22 May 1985 (Hansard, page 2355) Senator Jack Evans asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, a question without notice on a recommendation of the Hancock Committee for parties to be able to make their own arrangements for the prevention and settlement of disputes, and a supplementary question concerning the Australian Democrats Bill on collective agreements. In my reply, I undertook to seek further information from the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Minister has provided the following response:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hancock Report recommends an amendment to Part X of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which deals with industrial agreements. The amendment suggested is designed to enable parties to enter into an agreement by which they could resolve disputes through their own agreed processes of conciliation and arbitration. It is intended that such agreements would operate to exclude the effect of federal awards and any state prescriptions which would otherwise cover the area.</PARA>
<PARA> It was the committee's view that, if this recommendation was to be implemented, parties choosing to enter into `private' conciliation and arbitration agreements should use those agreed processes for regulation of their entire industrial relationships. The agreements, however, would be enforced through the provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of this recommendation will need to be carefully assessed by the Government and all concerned parties during the consultations which will take place regarding the Report.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee states that the proposes of opting out see significant benefits flowing from this approach-industrial relations benefits in terms of the greater commitment which is supposed to flow from agreements negotiated between the parties, and economic benefits from the greater flexibility for the parties to fix wages and conditions in the light of specific economic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> These perceived advantages will need to be carefully weighed against the anticipated effects on the predominant, formal system of conciliation and arbitration. The most significant disadvantage of such an approach would be the lack of any mechanism whereby public interest considerations could be brought to bear in determining wage outcomes in the informal system. A further related issue concerns the need to ensure that the wider wages policy is not destabilised by outcomes in the informal sector.</PARA>
<PARA> The advocates for opting out take the view that this would primarily lead to negotiated rates and conditions less than those provided by awards and tribunals. It is more likely however, that this course would be mainly pursued by unions and employers operating in the more profitable sectors with a higher capacity to pay. Should such agreements provoke claims for increases in the traditional sector based on equity and comparative wage justice arguments, there would be significant wage pressures which could ultimately destroy any wages policy and thereby have adverse, rather than favourable, effects on employment.</PARA>
<PARA> It may be that the viability of a dual system depends upon a number of critical pre-conditions involving acceptances by trade unions and employers that the two systems were effectively mutually exclusive. Other concerns would include ensuring that the opting out is voluntary and that exploitation would not occur rising from an imbalance of power between the parties. These factors obviously require very close and careful consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be noted that the alteration scheme can only apply, in a constitutional sense, to federally registered employer and employee organisations and in relation to an actual or impending interstate industrial dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, while the report recommends greater flexibility through these provisions, it also notes that the existing system already provides some flexibility in dealing with industries or firms facing economic difficulties affecting their capacity to pay. Thus it recomends, subject to certain constraints, the retention of the ability of the Commission to allow wage levels lower than would otherwise be prescribed as a means of protecting employment.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the supplementary question the answer is:</PARA>
<PARA> No. For the reasons outlined above, the Government would be concerned to ensure that any measures aimed at allowing parties to seek alternatives to the current conciliation and arbitration arrangements did not undermine the Government's wages policy. In addition to this consideration the Bill also gave rise to a number of constitutional and practical difficulties.</PARA>

Senator Reynolds also asked what rights the Federal Government had for the protection of confidentiality of Medicare documentation and whether action could be taken to have Medicare documents returned immediately. I undertook to seek further details from the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> My Department was not involved and had no knowledge of the raids carried out by the Queensland Police.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department has examined the legal position of the privacy of patients' medical records seized by the Queensland Police in the raids. The records seized are believed to be the doctors' own records of patients' clinical details and accounts. They are not the property of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> The powers of the Commonwealth concerning the privacy of patients' medical records are directed towards unauthorised release of information by officers of the Commonwealth. Those powers are not relevant to the seizure by the Queensland Police of doctors' records under search warrant in connection with alleged offences against State legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> I sincerely hope that the Queensland Government would ensure that patients' medical records receive the same high degree of security that they are given by Australian Federal Police procedures. Recent press reports seem to indicate that belated consideration has been given to store the records securely, following the outcry in the Queensland press.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this time the Metro III aircraft is restricted to a maximum take-off-weight (MTOW) of 5,700 kg (which is approximately 12,500 lbs). Two broad categories of aircraft are recognised through international consensus. A maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 5,700 kg represents the dividing line between the `small' and `transport' categories. Different standards of design, maintenance, crewing and general operating conditions apply to aircraft in each of these categories with the more stringent requirements applying to transport aircraft types. The Metro III has been designed and built to standards applicable to small aircraft, i.e. MTOW below 5,700 kg.</PARA>
<PARA> The US regulatory authorities have permitted some aircraft types, including the Metro III, to operate at weights in excess of 12,500 lbs although they are designed only to the standards for `small' aircraft. This departure from internationally accepted practice is allowed by the US authorities only in the case of aircraft that are designed and produced before certain specified dates.</PARA>
<PARA> Other countries are considering whether they also will allow the operation of `overweight' aircraft, and under what conditions. Present indications are that countries such as the UK and Canada have imposed or will impose certain safety related requirements that are additional to the requirements set by the US authorities. At this time my Department believes that several countries besides USA may be operating Metro III aircraft of MTOW above 12,500 lbs with special conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department's approach is similar to that the UK and Canadian authorities. Action is well advanced, in consultation with the aviation industry to introduce such a provision subject to certain safety related requirements being met.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A person living in a de facto relationship is a `married' person within the meaning of the Social Security Act. The maximum rate of unemployment benefit in respect of the person claiming is half the combined married rate. An equivalent amount is payable to that person in respect of his/her spouse if he/she is not in receipt of pension or benefit in their own right. Such additional payment for a spouse could be declined but the rate payable to the person would not be increased to that payable to a single person.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The question is more appropriately one for the Treasurer. However, he has advised me that, with effect from 1 July 1984, where a man and a woman live together as husband and wife on a bona fide domestic basis although they are not legally married to each other, entitlement to the income tax rebate for a dependent spouse will be determined on the same basis as if they were legally married to each other. Prior to 1 July 1984, the spouse rebate was only available in respect of a legally married spouse. In addition, special tax rebates were introduced at the same time to ensure that persons wholly or mainly dependent on social security, unemployment, sickness or special benefits do not have to pay income tax.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Were the monitored subscribers, referred to in (1) above, in advance or during the monitoring, notified and aware that their services were being monitored.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is the Minister aware that monitoring of a subscriber's service may occur over as long a period as 26 days and that such monitoring may take the form of broadcasting the subscribers' telephone conversations through a loudspeaker system.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) If Telecom operates with no published guidelines or set procedures for the monitoring of subscribers' services, will the Minister advise on whose authority such monitoring occurs.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Does the Minister plan to establish a set of guidelines for the use of Telecom when carrying out maintenance monitoring of subscribers' services; if so, would such guidelines include the prerequisite of Ministerial authorisation for any monitoring of a sustained nature.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the question, based on advice provided by the Australian Telecommunications Commission:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) to (5) Statistical information of the type sought is not maintained by Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications (Interception) Act is the relevant law in relation to the interception of telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA> The Act provides that interception does not apply for any act done by an officer of the Australian Telecommunications Commission in the course of his duties for or in connection with the installation of any line, apparatus or equipment used in the operation or maintenance of a telecommunications system.</PARA>
<PARA> With over 6 million telephone subscribers and a vast network to permit the interchange of national and international communications, Telecom staff need to have access to telephone circuits to ensure proper maintenance and operation of the service. Monitoring is normally only for a short duration and it would not be practicable to inform the subscriber concerned every time Telecom staff needed to check a line. A subscriber would also not be informed in cases where more lengthy monitoring is necessary, and it is essential to observe the performance of the service under typical conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> It would be operationally impracticable to develop guidelines and instructions that would cover the variety of cases which could arise where Telecom officers need to go across a line on which conversations may be proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that appropriate penalty clauses are contained in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act should there by any disclosure of information obtained in the performance of an officer's duties.</PARA>

<PARA>Local Health Hazards</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0304 A brief, describing the possible local health hazards is given at Annex A. Where appropriate, treatment is included as part of the brief, and the treatment for snake bite is detailed at Appendix 1 to Annex A.</PARA>
<PARA>Senior Medical Officer</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0305 A Senior Medical Officer (SMO) is to be appointed by Comd FF Med Svc and will be located at Dampier under commander of DEXDIR. Technical control of the SMO will be exercised by Comd FF Med Svc, through DMS 5MD. The SMO is responsible for:</PARA>
<PARA> a. regulation of evacuation and hospitalisation of all real casualties to civilian and Service medical facilities outside the AO,</PARA>
<PARA> b. regulation of evacuation of Control Organisation real casualties from their support medical facility to Det 1 Fd Hosp, Nickol Bay, Karratha or other medical facility within the AO,</PARA>
<PARA> c. liaision with and submission of requests for aeromedical evacuation to the Aeromedical Evacuation Co-ordinating Officer (AECOO), and</PARA>
<PARA> d. post exercise clearance and evacuation of patients from the AO to other medical facilities in the ASA.</PARA>
<PARA>Medical Support</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0306 Blue Force. The medical plan for BLUE Force will be prepared and promulgated by the BLUE Force Mounting Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0307 Orange Force. Medical treatment and hospitalisation of personnel serving with ORANGE Force will be the responsibility of the RMO, ORANGE Force. Real casualties requiring hospital treatment are to be evacuated to the Neutral Det at Nickol Bay, Karratha, wherever practicable.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0308 Neutral Exercise Control Organisation. Medical treatment of personnel serving with these organisations will be the responsibility of the SMO. Regimental Aid Posts (RAP) are to be established at Port Hedland and Dampier with C3O arrangements. In other areas, eg Derby and when RAP support is not available locally, personnel are to seek treatment from the local Area Medical Officer (AMO), as listed in Annex B. Real casualties requiring hospital treatment are to be evacuated to the Det at Nickol Bay Hospital, Karratha, or to other local hospitals, whichever is determined most appropriate by the SMO.</PARA>
<PARA>Casualty Evacuation</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0309 The normal means of evacuation will be by air. The details of casualty evacuation within BLUE Force, ORANGE Force and Neutral/Control Organisation will be determined and promulgated by the staff of the respective HQ. In general, evacuation of land casualties will be in accordance with single Service procedures eg MLW Vol 1 Pam 6.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0310 Urgent real casualties (priority 1 and 2 vide paragraph 1334 of MLW Vol 1 Pam No. 3) should be evacuated by air direct to the Det at Nickol Bay Hospital, Karratha, unless medical authority determines that evacuation to a local civilian facility is more appropriate. Aircraft involved in aeromedical evacuation are classed as neutral for the duration of the operation. Exercise aeromedical evacuation will remain BLUE for the duration of the operation.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0311 Patients requiring evacuation from Nickol Bay Hospital Karratha or local civil medical facility will be moved on and `as required and available' basis under arrangements made by the SMO through the Aeromedical Evacuation Co-ordinating Officer (AECOO).</PARA>
<PARA>Administration and Logistics</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0312 Medical Documentation. Unit medical records are not to be taken to the exercise area. Field medical cards are to be used for all casualties (real and exercise) until they are admitted to a medical facility.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0313 Spectacles. All persons attending the exercise who wear spectacles and have been issued with two pairs should take both pairs to the exercise area. Units should ensure that the current prescription for spectacles is available for those persons who have only one pair.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0314 Medical Stores. All units are to deploy with their normal scaling of medical stores. Local pharmacy stocks are not in high levels, particularly antivenenes, burns dressings and intravenous fluids. Medical facilities are to ensure sufficient stocks are held to treat all likely real casualties.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0315 Microbiological Screening. Western Australia has a virtual quarantine policy in action to prevent the occurence of large outbreaks of methicillin resistant staphyloccus aureus in its hospitals. Accordingly all medical and paramedical staff from interstate using the Nickol Bay Hospital, will need to be in possession of a recent negative throat swab prior to being allowed to work in wards. Patients who have been in interstate hospitals since 1 Sept 1982 will also need a throat swab-otherwise they are quarantined until a swab is done in the hospital in WA.</PARA>
<PARA>Command</PARA>

<PARA>EXTRACT 2</PARA>
<PARA>CHAPTER 9-PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING EXERCISE CASUALTIES AND PRISONERS OF WAR AND REINFORCEMENTS</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0901 Introduction. This chapter outlines procedures for handling exercise, as opposed to real, personal casualties, equipment casualties, and prisoners of war (PW) awarded by umpires to the BLUE and ORANGE Forces and for the handling of reinforcements.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0902 Exercise Personnel Casualties-Dead</PARA>
<PARA> a. BLUE Force. BLUE force is to be exercised in the procedures for the handling of dead casualties both of their own force and of the ORANGE Force. The handling of BLUE Force dead and enemy dead is to be in accordance with current SOP's. Notwithstanding, dead casualties will not be evacuated from the exercise area. The casualty will be processed by BLUE Force but handed over to the Control Organisation at the location of the mortuary (field or established), point of local internment or of evacuation, whichever is most appropriate. Exercise BLUE dead casualties will be held by the Control Organisation until passed back to BLUE Force in satisfaction of a personnel reinforcement demand.</PARA>
<PARA> b. ORANGE Force. ORANGE Force dead, not in the hands of BLUE Force are to remain with their unit. Subsequent participation in the exercise will be regulated by the Control Organisation to ensure exercise realism. ORANGE Force dead in BLUE Force hands are to be handled by BLUE Force in accordance with its SOPs, and subsequently handed over to the Control Organisation in a similar manner to BLUE casualties. The Control Organisation will return the casualty to ORANGE Force when appropriate, mindful of exercise realism and a reasonable Kamarian reinforcement capability.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0903 Exercise Personnel Casualties-Wounded</PARA>
<PARA> a. BLUE Force. BLUE Force is to be exercised in the handling of wounded and the evacuation of casualties. Casualties will not, however, be evacuated from the exercise area. BLUE Force casualties are to be evacuated in accordance with BLUE SOP to the appropriate medical facility determined by the umpire awarded medical condition of the casualty. Casualties, whose treatment can be effected by medical facilities organic to the force, should be held for the appropriate period and then returned to duty. Casualties determined as requiring hospitalisation are to be moved by the appropriate means to the Nickol Bay Hospital, Karratha. Casualties evacuted to this hospital will not be retained after admission procedures are complete but passed to the Control Organisation. The casualty will then be held by the Control Organisation until passed back to the BLUE Force in satisfaction of a reinforcement demand or in simulation of a patient discharged from hospital and returned to duty.</PARA>
<PARA> b. ORANGE Force. Orange Force wounded, not in the hands of BLUE Force, are to remain with their unit. Subsequent participation may require regulation by the Control Organisation in the interests of exercise realism. Wounded Orange Force PW should be handled in accordance with para 5.0905 but appropriate action must be taken by BLUE Force for the treatment of wounds. Orange PW wounded requiring hospitalisation are to be released to the Control Organisation at the Nickol Bay Hospital, Karratha after admission procedures are complete.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0904 Exercise Equipment Casualties</PARA>
<PARA> a. BLUE Force Casualties. Exercise equipment casualties will be awarded by umpires to BLUE Force to test equipment repair, recovery and replacement procedures. All casualties imposed by umpires are to incur action by BLUE to repair/replace the equipment as though the casualty were real. Where appropriate, time delay penalties will be imposed by umpires to simulate repair time. Equipment casualties requiring recovery are to be recovered to the appropriate point of repair and held there for the designated repair time. Where an equipment is `destroyed' and subsequently umpired as `beyond repair' it is to be handed over to the Control Organisation. Such equipment will be held by the Control Organisation until handed back to BLUE in satisfaction of a replacement demand. Exercise equipment casualties will not be evacuated from the exercise area.</PARA>
<PARA> b. ORANGE Force. Orange Force exercise equipment casualties are to remain in their unit. They are not to be used operationally however, until an umpire designated time period elapses.</PARA>
<PARA> c. Accounting Restrictions. Because of peacetime accounting restrictions, equipment casualties passing outside unit control are to be accompanied by an operator/unit representative.</PARA>
<PARA> d. Concept of Interface with BLUE Force. The Control Organisation is to provide as much realism as possible to BLUE Force in its evacuation/backloading of exercise casualties from the area of operations and the receipt of reinforcements and equipment replacements into the AO. To this end, ORANGE resources taken by BLUE Force will remain held by BLUE Force until such time as they would reasonably pass from the control of elements organic to the ODF ie. departure airfield or civilian hospital. Similarly, BLUE resources being returned to BLUE Force from the Control Organisation will be returned at a realistic location, ie. a personnel reinforcement may well be delivered to the nearest commercial airport coincident with the arrival of a domestic air service ex Perth, for the collection by BLUE Force.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0905 PW</PARA>
<PARA> a. BLUE Force Procedures. All Orange Force PW captured by the Blue Force are to be handled in accordance with BLUE Force SOP, including interrogation, recording and if necessary medical treatment. At the time when the backloading of the PW from the exercise area is appropriate, the PW is to be handed over to the Control Organisation who will arrange his return to the Orange Force. Released PW's are not to be held by the BLUE Force.</PARA>
<PARA> b. Orange Force Procedures. Orange Force PW procedures are not being exercised and it is not intended that prisoners be taken. If for any reason ORANGE Force becomes the custodian of BLUE Force personnel, such personnel will be returned to the BLUE LSC by the control organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> 5.0906 Control Organisation</PARA>
<PARA> a. EX(A) CON. Unless specifically advised to the contrary by HQ EXCON (FWD), EX(A) CON will represent to BLUE Force all military and civilian establishments and organisations outside the exercise area for the purpose of BLUE administration related to exercise (as opposed to real) personnel and equipment casualties and PW. This includes:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) NOTICAS,</PARA>
<PARA> (2) reinforcement demands,</PARA>
<PARA> (3) PW reporting,</PARA>
<PARA> (4) equipment replacement demands, and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) demands for repair parts.</PARA>

This work formed part of a contract for perimeter landscaping of the site and included the planting of native trees and shrubs, the installation of an irrigation system, drainage, retaining walls, etc.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Total cost of this perimeter landscaping package, including the carpark areas, was $117,481.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The landscaped areas were completed and handed over to the Department of Defence in November 1983, who in turn handed them over to the Australian Defence Force Academy.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No. As a result of experience on site during construction it was decided for traffic management reasons that some selective culling and some pruning should be undertaken to protect sight lines. This is not unusual where, as in this case, plantings are done early in order to provide a reasonably mature landscape on occupation. Culling at one of the carparks was carried out by the Academy in April/May 1985 and arrangements have been made to replant the area with lower growing species at an approximate cost of $3,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 May 1985 (Hansard, page 2493) Senator Archer asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade, the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Government see the United States farm export plan due to be introduced from 1 June 1985, which is aimed at being a retaliatory move to recapture markets taken by the European Economic Community, as producing a situation likely to present a real threat to Australia's rural exports?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> While understanding the frustrations which led to this Program, the Government is concerned about the effect which the US Export Enhancement Program may have on Australia's exports of particular agricultural commodities. These concerns have been transmitted to the President of the United States and taken up during Ministerial discussions with the US Secretaries for Agriculture and State. We have received assurances from the US Administration that the Program is targeted only against subsidised exporters and that Australia's interests will be taken into account in implementing the Program.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Program is to be carefully targeted at markets lost by the United States as a result of unfair subsidised competition, it will be difficult to contain the effects of the Program to the targeted markets. It would appear inevitable that the price of targeted commodities will be depressed and that competition will intensify when subsidised exporters are displaced from markets.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be monitoring implementation of the Program and will be maintaining close contact with the United States Government on the implications of the Program for Australia and our interest in particular markets.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the objectives of the Program is to pressure subsidising exporters to engage in negotiations for greater discipline on agricultural trading practices. Should the Program succeed in achieving this, it will have served a useful purpose.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator Grimes</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Costs incurred by applicants to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) are met in large part by my Department. Such costs in most cases relate to securing medical opinions and travelling to and from the Tribunal. Where my Department, or the SSAT, requests a medical report the Department will pay for the consultation and the preparation of the report. These, and necessary travel costs, are paid as part of the general administration of the Act under section seven. It does not pay the costs associated with the provision of medical reports commissioned independently by an applicant or the applicant's representatives as these are not incurred at the Department's request. Applicants to the SSAT are seldom legally represented. Thus the question of legal costs seldom arises. These principles are not affected if the Department concedes an appeal.</PARA>
<PARA> Where a department client appeals to the Administrative Tribunal (AAT) the client is more likely to incur legal expenses. In addition it may be necessary to spend some money to travel to the hearing. My Department pays all expenses associated with an applicant's consultation with a medical specialist nominated by the Department. If the matter goes to a hearing the Department will, where the applicant is unable to afford to do so, pay necessary travel and accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, in section 69, provides that legal and financial assistance may be granted by the Attorney-General in respect of an appeal. When he considers applications, section 69 requires that it would involve hardship to an applicant to refuse the application and that, in the circumstances, it is reasonable that assistance be granted. The Attorney-General's Department, I am informed, considers each case on its merits but uses, as a starting point in assessing hardship, the guidelines of the Australian Legal Aid Office for the grant of legal aid. It will, however, depart from these in an appropriate case. In considering the reasonableness of any grant of assistance regard is had primarily to the benefit which the applicant would gain by the grant, the degree of detriment which might flow from a refusal, and the merits of the applicant's case. The legal or financial assistance granted will apply to an applicant's legal costs and reasonable disbursements. Such disbursements include necessary medical and travel expenses. These may be covered in full but, where it appears that an applicant can afford it, a contribution may be required. The consession of a case does not affect the operation of this system.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 67 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 also provides that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may order that the fees and expenses of a witness summoned to appear before it are to be paid by the Commonwealth. This does not, of course, assist an applicant whose case is conceded prior to a hearing.</PARA>
<PARA> Reference should also be made to section 66 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 which applies to social security clients appealing in a Freedom of Information matter. That provision enables the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to make a recommendation to the Attorney-General that an applicant's costs be paid by the Commonwealth where the applicant is successful, or substantially successful, in his application. In a number of recent Freedom of Information cases the AAT has recommended that an applicant's costs be paid where the department or authority has conceded and supplied documents.</PARA>
<PARA> In all the circumstances there are no firm plans for change, although I understand that the Administrative Review Council is considering a reference on applicant's costs before administrative tribunals. The Government will, of course, consider any recommendations which the Administrative Review Council might make following its review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Minister for Primary Industry has been unable to identify the particular report in question. Nonetheless, he is aware of fishing industry concern over the impact of fuel price increases.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The fishing industry is recognised as one which is particularly vulnerable to the effects of fuel price increases because of the significance of fuel in its cost structure. Nonetheless, it is not possible for the Government to seek to fully protect industries from the effects of the Government's import parity pricing policy, which is an economically sound policy. Similarly, it is not unreasonable that all industries should share to some degree the burden of Government cut-backs, such as the recent change to the petroleum products freight subsidy scheme, which was necessitated by the need to achieve our broader economic objectives. Notwithstanding that change, however, assistance of around $800,000 is still expected to be provided to the fishing industry under the Scheme, of which about $700,000 is expected to go to the Northern Prawn Fishery.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Government recognises that recent fuel price increases have had a disproportionate effect on the fishing industry, particularly the Northern Prawn Fishery. The Government has therefore agreed to provide up to $9m over the next three years to facilitate adjustment and to improve the profitability of Australia's northern prawn fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA> This undertaking is an initial response to the report of the government/industry working group established to examine the impact of fuel price increases on the fishing industry. The Government is in the process of developing management plans for a number of our fisheries and, as part of this process, will keep industry conditions under close review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney- General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are no statutory provisions regulating these matters in the Australian Capital Territory. The House of Assembly currently has before it a draft Ordinance prepared in my Department which deals with the status of children born as a result of AID or IVF procedures. In the absence of statute, the basic position at common law is that a child born of a married woman is presumed to be a legitimate child of the marriage, but that presumption may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary. Pending the making of the Ordinance the position in the Australian Capital Territory is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b) Child born to a married woman as a result of AID procedures: Child born to a married woman as a result of IVF with donated sperm:</PARA>
<PARA> Although there is no express authority on the point, it is considered that the child would be presumed to be the child of the husband and legitimate unless the presumption is rebutted by evidence sufficient to displace the presumption.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Child born to a married woman as a result of IVF with her husband's sperm and donor ovum: Whether the child would be regarded as the legitimate child of the marriage would seem to depend on whether the courts would treat the child as the child of the ``genetic'' mother or the ``gestational'' mother. There is no authority on this point in Australian or English law. In the absence of proof that the child was born as a result of the use of IVF procedures involving donor ovum, it would seem that the child would be presumed to be the legitimate child of the marriage.</PARA>
<PARA> (2)-(a) and (b) Child born as a result of AID or IVF with donated sperm: In New South Wales, in the case of a child of a married woman, the status of the child is regulated by the Artificial Conception Act 1984 which provides, among other things, that if the husband consents to the procedure he is irrebuttably presumed to be the father. In that case, the child is legitimate. The position in Victoria is similar, under the Status of Children Act 1974 as amended by the Status of Children (Amendment) Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Child born to a married woman as a result of IVF with her husband's sperm and donor ovum: The New South Wales Artificial Conception Act 1984 does not deal with this situation. The position is presumably the same as in the Australian Capital Territory. In Victoria, the Status of Children Act 1974 as amended by the Status of Children (Amendment) Act 1984 provides that the married woman is irrebuttably presumed to be the mother of the child and the husband is irrebuttably presumed to be the father of the child, provided that the husband has consented to the procedure.

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is no legal prohibition against an Australian Vietnam veteran's common law case proceeding in a court at the same time as the Royal Commission is conducting its enquiries. It would, however, be possible for the parties to the court proceedings to agree to defer those proceedings pending the results of the Royal Commission. If one of the parties to the court proceedings sought deferral of those proceedings pending the outcome of the Royal Commission but the other party wished to proceed, the court's decision on deferral would be influenced on the one hand by the reason for the requested deferral and on the other hand by the prejudice which deferral would cause to the other party.</PARA>
<PARA> An application to the Australian Legal Aid Office (ALAO) for legal aid would be considered in the usual way having regard to the guidelines of the ALAO. The fact that the matter for which the aid was sought was under investigation by a Royal Commission would be a factor that would need to be considered in deciding whether it was reasonable, in all the circumstances, to approve or refuse aid.</PARA>
<PARA> Where assistance has been sought not from the ALAO but from the Government on the basis that the proceedings raise a matter of public interest or are a `test' case, and the proceedings seek to establish liability for exposure to chemical agents in Vietnam, the Government has suspended assistance (if it had been approved) or deferred consideration of the application. It did so following the establishment of the Royal Commission referred to in the question because the matters which that Commission is required to inquire into clearly have an all important bearing on, inter alia, claims such as are made in such proceedings. As indicated by the Government when announcing its establishment, the Commission's terms of reference were purposefully made wide and general, so that as many matters as possible relevant to the effects of exposure to chemical agents in Vietnam could be canvassed by the Commission.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) The Federal Government, in recognition that unemployment is currently the most serious social and economic problem facing the Australian community, is committed to the restoration of full employment as its major policy goal. In the context of the Prices and Incomes Accord, the Government has pursued expansionary economic policies to stimulate economic growth and boost employment opportunities throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA> In the period from March 1983 to July 1985 an estimated 410,400 new jobs (seasonally adjusted) were created. This figure is based upon the Labour Force Survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> The private sector is increasingly becoming the mainspring of job growth and economic recovery. Eighty-eight per cent of job growth over the year to May 1985 was generated in industries operating predominantly in the private sector of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> Data for public sector employment is only available for the period to March 1985, from the employer-based Survey of Employment and Earnings conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Although data obtained from the employer-based Survey differs in definition and source from that obtained from the Labour Force Survey, the estimates of public sector employment are broadly comparable with the total employment data from the Labour Force Survey. Over the period April 1983 to March 1985, public sector employment increased as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Commonwealth Government 22,900</PARA>
<PARA> (b) State Government 29,500</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister for Aviation aware that the deferral of the re-development of the Darwin International Airport is conservatively estimated, by the Air Conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association of the Northern Territory, to have cost each tenderer involved in the project in the order of $20,000; if so, is the Minister prepared to undertake to reimburse the tendering costs to each tenderer, provided all such costs can be justified.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recognise the cost of tendering is substantial and the Department of Housing and Construction avoids inviting tenders for works that it does not expect to proceed or inviting fresh tenders unless special circumstances apply. The decision to incur tendering costs with view to winning a contract however is a commercial judgment taken in the knowledge that circumstances may change and that the conditions of tendering make clear no tender will necessarily be accepted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 March 1985 (Hansard, page 571) Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Communications to reports in this week's Press which suggest that the Federal Government's decision to favour a transmission technology known as B-MAC is causing alarm amongst the industry and future rural recipients as well. Will the Minister please comment upon claims that remote and isolated outback inhabitants will have to pay thousands of dollars for expensive receiver equipment which will pick up, in the early stages, only the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and, in the later stages, only one commercial television service? Can the Minister also clarify the suggestion that the high costs and limited receiver potential could lead to a thriving black market in decoders which have the capacity to pick up more than one station?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The B-MAC transmission system was chosen because it has several significant advantages: high quality television, six sound channels, teletext and a data channel. It is the most advanced and efficient transmission system available.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware there is in the industry or in remote areas any alarm which derives from this decision.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a commitment to make basic television and radio services available to all Australians. The satellite system is designed to make possible ABC television and radio services and similar commercial services.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the first step in the progressive equalisation of services to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government decided last year to grant licences to provide one commercial television signal to remote areas in each of four zones: Western Australia; South Australia and the Northern Territory; Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales; and Queensland. The signals will be encoded so that they cannot be picked up outside the remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme, known as the Remote Commercial Television Service (RCTS), will allow for a regionally oriented services and is designed to enable reception through the less costly dishes planned for The Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service (HACBSS). The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal reported in May on the first RCTS licence in Western Australia. The Minister has endorsed the Tribunal's recommendation that Golden West Network should be the licensee.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the first part of Senator Bjelke-Peterson's question, the Government's first priority is to provide basic services to the outback as soon as possible. The vehicles for this are the HACBSS and RCTS services. It should be noted that, according to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's estimates, a national beam solution would cost consumers up to $106 million more than the spot beam solution which will be used for HACBSS and RCTS.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 May 1985 (Hansard, page 2429) Senator Missen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I referred to certain recent evidence by United States sources which I made available to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Communications. What the Minister has told us is what is normally understood but what I am asking is: Is this affecting the present decision of the Tribunal?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications was not previously aware of the findings of the United States Task Force on Violence.

The Tribunal monitors overseas developments and the Minister has drawn its attention to the Task Force findings.</PARA>
