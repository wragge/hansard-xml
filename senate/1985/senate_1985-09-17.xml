<PARA> (a) 1985 marks the 40th Anniversary of the Yalta Conference (February 4th-11th, 1945) between U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, at which plans were finalised for the post-World War II division of Europe into ``spheres of influence'';</PARA>

<TITLE>Human Embryo Experimentation Legislation</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>The petition of certain undersigned citizens of Australia shows that the proposed private member's Bill introduced by Senator Harradine-An Act to prohibit experiments involving the use of human embryos created by in vitro fertilisation-disadvantages infertile members of the community seeking treatment through the current medical procedure known as in vitro fertilisation because the inadequate definition of terminology relating to the proposals in the said Bill will prevent any further development and improvement in the relevant medical research anywhere in Australia and, hence, lead to the cessation of the freeze/thaw technique currently associated with the preservation of excess embryos created and intended specifically for the purpose of later implementation into the uterus of an infertile woman seeking treatment. We strongly believe that research should be allowed to continue under the strict guidelines already laid down by the National Health and Medical Research Council and Victoria's `Infertility (Medical Procedures) Act 1984'.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the proposed Bill infringes on the personal rights and liberties of infertile couples to have children, your petitioners as in duty bound therefore humbly pray that the Senate will view with sympathy our opposition to the afore-mentioned Bill and not support its passage through the Senate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall words of that genre being used by the Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, at a meeting at the Opera House on 16 February 1983. I remind Senator Chaney that since then there has been a wide-ranging debate about taxation issues, including the taxation summit, the publication of a White Paper on taxation issues, and a whole range of matters which put the whole tax debate in a new perspective. If Senator Chaney seeks particular mileage out of this question, I can revisit history for him for a little while about previous Liberal governments and, of course, I can talk about the present Opposition which, insofar as it has any identifiable position on anything, has changed it on a number of occasions and I suspect is about to change it again on such fundamental issues as the assets test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The people of Australia wait with bated breath as the Opposition tries to formulate a policy on a wide range of issues which, I say with the utmost certainty, must, if Mr Howard is to be said to be a leader with any degree of economic rationality, abandon policies adopted in the last 12 months. The Opposition must abandon them if there is to be any rational approach to the needs of this economy. So, yes, I recall the words. I think they must be seen in the sort of context that I have mentioned; that is, in the context of the first Hawke Government. Members of the Opposition are now confronted with the second Hawke Government and, in two or three years time, they will be confronted with the third Hawke Government. That is the great difficulty that they have to get over.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O97">Senator ELSTOB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. It concerns the National Health and Medical Research Council's Medical Research Ethics Committee. Is the Minister aware of recent criticism of the Committee in that it does not have adequate community representation and lacks the broader expertise found in ethics committees appointed by the State governments? Given this criticism and given that the Council is the major medical research funding body, whose role is also to provide national ethical guidelines on highly sensitive social issues in medical research, is the Minister able to say whether the Government is satisfied to leave the Council's Ethics Committee in its present form?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Health that the NHMRC Medical Research Ethics Committee is, in fact, a broadly based committee which is not composed primarily of medical experts, nor does it lack community representation. It comprises representation from the fields of law, philosophy, science, medicine and the community. Of the membership of eight, three are medical and, of the two co-opted members, only one is medical. The Order in Council under which the NHMRC operates limits it to an advisory role on matters of public health legislation and administration. Council has acted to provide leadership in ethical monitoring of research on the expert advice of its Medical Research Ethics Committee. It is interesting to note that most other grant-giving bodies insist on compliance with National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines prior to granting awards. The composition of the Medical Research Ethics Committee, along with other National Health and Medical Research Council committees, is subject to review from time to time. The Minister considers that the present membership of the MREC, determined in 1984, is appropriate to fulfil its current functions, and does fulfil the requirements suggested by Senator Elstob in that it is a broad-based committee and it has community representation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Minister representing the Prime Minister that the criterion of broad community support-the Prime Minister's ninth principle on tax reform-was used to excuse the backdown on the shift to a broad-based consumption tax. Is the Minister aware of a survey of 5,000 businesses conducted by the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce, which found 92 per cent opposition to capital gains tax and 89 per cent opposition to fringe benefits taxation? On the basis of the ninth principle, how can the Government possibly justify proceeding with taxes which obviously have so little community support?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that if the same people had been asked whether they wanted a reduction in marginal tax rates, more than 92 per cent of them would have agreed. I suspect that the answer from 100 per cent of them would have been yes. If a number of other questions had been asked about the proposed tax changes which have been mooted in the Press-they are sort of marginally accurate-there would have been totally different responses. People can jump up and down on pogo sticks on the basis that a capital gains tax is reprehensible in all circumstances and something which should not be tolerated.

We are concerned about the wider community. If the word `community' is used in a very narrow sense, communities all over Australia can be picked up which will be dissatisfied with any tax change. Above all, honourable senators opposite ought to remember that there is a wider community in Australia which is completely disenchanted with the present taxation regime in this country and it has been complaining about it for years. It has been complaining about high marginal rates and certain aspects of business taxes for years. If we change those areas of taxation, we will be doing something that honourable senators opposite did not have the guts to do in eight years in government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the absence of any intention by the present Government in Tasmania to provide any special counselling or advice services for women, our Government did decide in April of this year to open a Women's Information Service office in Hobart. I am pleased to report to Senator Coates that it has been very successful. Nearly 2,000 women have used the centre and 25 women's groups meet there regularly. Officers from the centre have travelled all over the State and have met with more than 40 women's organisations. In July the Women's Information Service organised a women's forum to mark the end of the Decade for Women. This was attended by more than 400 women from all over the State. The Service also acts as a referral centre and the most frequently raised questions relate to discrimination, housing, legal matters, financial problems and health issues. In summary, the Women's Information Service has been very well received by the women of Tasmania and is meeting an area of need which the Gray Government unfortunately has persistently refused to acknowledge.</PARA></TALK.START>

The answer to that is: I will not answer such questions. Anyone who had the slightest idea of the normal operation of the parliamentary system would have more sense than to ask that question. However, I have been asked by Mr Duffy to provide this answer on his behalf: The question relates to matters concerning the Government's budget process and I have no intention of commenting on that process, save only to say that the Minister for Communications advised me that at all times the ABC management strongly and competently conveyed to the Government the implications of its decisions on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the report to which Senator Jones refers. Evidently the New South Wales Opposition Leader does not listen to Question Time, does not listen to the questions relevant to this matter that are asked by Senator Jones, and does not read the excellent statistical analyses that have been sent around from time to time by Senator Maguire or the answers to questions in the Senate. Mr Greiner was under the very false impression that if he did a comparative economic statistical study of Queensland and New South Wales he would discover that the New South Wales economy looked very sick and Queensland looked quite healthy. However, what emerged from the study was quite the opposite. Mr Greiner has fallen on his face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will give just a few of the details regarding the comparisons between Queensland and the rest of Australia. The major facts are that Queensland has the highest rate of unemployment of any State. It has the largest number of working days lost per thousand employees through industrial disputes and, in that respect, it has almost double the national average of working days lost. It has the smallest growth in new dwelling comments for the 12 months ended March 1985-an improvement in Queensland of only one half of one per cent. In the rest of Australia the average was almost 14 per cent. Queensland has the second slowest rate of inflation decline, beaten in that respect only by the other non-Labor State of Tasmania. In the March quarter of 1985 fixed private capital investment in Queensland declined by 3.4 per cent while in the rest of Australia it increased by 11.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps most importantly of all, in the financial year 1983-84, which is the latest year for which statistics are available, there was a 24 per cent increase in the number of bankruptcies in Queensland when the number of bankruptcies in Australia on average fell by almost 5 per cent. I have not even gone into the enormous public debt that has been accumulated by the Queensland Government or the deficits on its income as against its expenditure which it has been running up in recent years, let alone its single parent birth rate which Senator Grimes mentioned which is by far the highest in Australia, along with its unemployment rate, its inflation rate and a few other things like that. In short, what emerges from any examination of leading economic indices is that the Queenland economy is the sick economy of Australia. Queensland is the sick State. It is dragging down the national average and it is dragging down the rest of the country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Finance, is quite serious and, I think, sufficiently simple to enable a straightforward answer. Does the Minister accept that the maintenance of high interest rates is, in the foreseeable future, central to the Government's current economic policy? I ask that question following the Minister's non-answer of a similar question asked yesterday by Senator Collard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not have a high interest rate policy. With the limited exception of housing loan interest rates, the Government does not have a policy of controlling interest rates at all. The financial system has been almost entirely deregulated over the previous 18 months or so and the Government does not attempt to set interest rates. The Government has a general economic policy which does have an effect on interest rates. It has other important effects. The incomes accord, which, as we all know, the Liberal Party of Australia would blow up the moment it came into government, should it ever do so, is the lynch pin of the Government's economic policy. It has produced the highest year-on-year growth rates that Australia has seen since the 1950s. It has already generated 430,000 additional jobs in less than 2 1/2 years. It has halved the rate of inflation and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that recently interest rates have increased compared with what they were in the immediate past. However, they are still very substantially lower than the record interest rates which prevailed in April 1982 when Mr Howard was the Treasurer. At the end of 4 1/2 years of Mr Howard's reign as Treasurer, 90-day commercial bills hit an all-time record interest rate of 22 1/2 per cent. Interest on Commonwealth Government short term and long term loans was at 16 1/2 per cent in June of that year. Interest rates are higher now than they have been throughout most of Australia's history, including the last 10 years. However, they are appreciably lower now than they were during the 4 1/2 years Mr Howard was Treasurer and primarily responsible for economic policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact, as Senator Zakharov's question suggests, that, despite the improvements in women's employment opportunities made by the Hawke Government, women are still under-represented in the upper areas of the work force and over-represented in the more fragile and less well-paid areas. In response to this situation the Government is taking a number of measures. Senator Zakharov may be particularly interested in a publication released yesterday by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations which outlines measures in the 1985-86 Budget aimed at improving the position of women in the work force and announcing the development in his portfolio of a national strategy on women in the labour force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The strategy will draw together a number of policies and programs currently in operation or being developed in the Department as well as initiatives taken in State or Territory offices and individual offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service. The Government's concern to increase employment choices and opportunity for women and to remove discriminatory employment practices is reflected in the special efforts being made to increase women's participation in labour market programs and open up employment in jobs which traditionally have been male. For example, in the community employment program the Government's major job creation project, a target of 50 per cent of jobs for women has been set. Considerable progress towards achieving that target has been made.</PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of some of the major recommendations of the report of the Kirby Committee of Inquiry Into Labour Market Programs will also help to improve the participation rates of women in all areas of the labour market. There will be special efforts, for example, to ensure that the new traineeships are as accessible to young women as they are to young men. The newly integrated adult training program will certainly provide major support for women re-entering the work force. Under the special trade training program, 500 places for trade-based pre-employment courses have been approved specifically for women. The women's research and employment initiatives program was established to provide funding and specialist research, small scale research and community initiatives in relation to women's employment. Two major projects on maternity leave usage in the public and private sectors have been funded, as has a major project on industry policy. A number of CES offices have specifically initiated activities aimed at unemployed women in their regions. These activities include an affirmative action program for female job seekers introduced in the Brunswick CES office in Victoria in 1984-85.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, a number of initiatives have already been taken through the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. These initiatives will now be co-ordinated and upgraded and, together with other legislative and policy measures being taken by the Government, should ensure that the pattern of structural discrimination against women referred to in Senator Zakharov's question will be adequately addressed during the rest of the term of this Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have seen news reports that South African troops have invaded Angola in pursuit of forces of the South West African People's Organisation. If these reports are correct, the incursion is the second to take place since South Africa announced the final withdrawal of its troops from southern Angola in April 1985. The Australian Government unreservedly condemns such actions. We have never accepted that South African forces had a right to be in southern Angola, and welcomed their reported withdrawal. We certainly do not accept that South Africa has a right to dispatch or station forces anywhere on Angolan territory without the consent of the Angolan Government. Incursions into Angola by South African troops do nothing to contribute to the climate of regional relations or to a climate of confidence in which the negotiations for the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia could proceed. Such actions do call into question South Africa's bona fides in proclaiming its readiness to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Namibian issue. The Australian Government continues to support the early independence of Namibia on the basis of Security Council Resolution No. 435, which endorses proposals for a ceasefire and a political settlement under United Nations auspices. We favour the early resumption of negotiations to this end and deplore events such as South African incursions into Angola which do serve to frustrate and delay this process.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Finance to the September issue of Lloyds Economic Report, a publication of Lloyds International Ltd, in which the result of the Government's deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions on wage discounting is said to be a further inclination by the Reserve Bank of Australia to maintain tight monetary policies. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Does the Minister accept this analysis and the inevitability of even higher interest rates in the wake of the Government's backdown to the unions?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="622" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the publication in question but the analysis that higher wages will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates is theoretically sound and has been empirically verified. I can give Senator Knowles an excellent example of empirical verification. In the last two disastrous years of the Fraser Government wages increased by 13 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, and inflation rose over those two years from about 8 1/2 per cent, from memory, to 11 1/2 per cent. Interest rates hit the all time record high levels in the middle of 1982 to which I have referred previously. Ninety-day commercial bank bills hit 22 1/2 per cent. Long and short term Commonwealth bonds hit 16 1/2 per cent in June of 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That explosion of wages, inflation and interest rates was triggered off by the Fraser Government's abandonment in mid-1981 of centralised wage fixing. The Fraser Government decided that it would experiment; it allowed the ideologues in the Liberal Party of Australia to experiment with a deregulated wages policy and let the market sort out wages. By the standards of the Fraser Government, economic growth at that time was at quite high levels. It was at lower levels than have prevailed since this Government came to office but, by the standards of the Fraser Government, economic growth was at quite high levels. The result of that cave-in to the ideologues of the Liberal Party which wanted to experiment with its dogmas about market forces determining wage levels was, as I have said before, a wages explosion, followed by an inflation explosion, followed by an interest rate explosion, followed, of course, by the first period of negative economic growth that we had had since the early 1960s and the worst recession that Australia had had since the 1930s. One would have thought that even the Bourbons of the Liberal Party would have learned something from that experience but, regrettably, we find that they have not. Having tried that disastrous policy in 1981, the Liberal Party is firmly committed to having a re-run of it and its economic consequences, should it ever be returned to government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A question was asked on Senate Estimates Committee F last Thursday and the Secretary of my Department, Mr Volker, informed the Committee that just over 7,000 veterans had in fact lost their service pension as a result of the assets test. Several days later Mr Fischer, my shadow in the other House, seized upon that statement to attack the Government's decision to establish the assets test and suggested that we were heartless and ungenerous in our approach to veterans. However, he never sought to establish how many veterans were in receipt of the service pension. That number is close to 400,000; so, in a sense, the highlighting of 7,000 withdrawals would not escape the notice of those who would expect to find that, out of that large number of recipients, at least 7,000 veterans and good Australian citizens would have accumulated considerable assets in the post-war years. Of course, that figure represents only about 2 per cent of those who are in receipt of a pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Sibraa asked me about the attitude of the Opposition parties on this matter. It is pretty clear that they have not got their act together because Mr Howard is on the record as supporting an assets test concept, as indeed was Senator Messner when he was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and as were many other Opposition spokesmen when they were in government. It is pretty clear that they are not too sure exactly where they are going now that the dries have had some sort of a coup and taken over the Liberal Party. We are not sure exactly where they are heading in this area when they talk about economic rationality.</PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a spate of right wing think- tanks emerging in recent times, although I suppose that is a contradiction in terms. One such publication was put out by a Mr Brian Buckley, whose claim to fame is that he was once on the staff of Sir Phillip Lynch, a former Treasurer in a Liberal government. He has suggested that another $120m should come off my Budget and has suggested in fact imposing taxes and assets tests on disability pensions, war widows' pensions and such like to reach that objective. That sort of think-tank these days includes people such as Mr Stone, Katherine West and many others who are all giving the Government advice, and it seems that Mr Fischer is trying to climb on the band-wagon. We hope that in the future he will look at the figures more carefully before he goes off and makes the sorts of public statements that he has in recent times.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Discussions have been held between Australia and Euratom officials on the timing of the next consultations under the agreement. Dates in November or December this year are being considered. Provisions for such consultations are a feature of all our nuclear safeguards agreements. These consultations provide valuable opportunities for the Treaty partners to discuss aspects of the operation of the Treaty and ancillary arrangements covering nuclear co-operation and to promote Australian views on co-operation and safeguards and non-proliferation questions generally. The consultations with Euratom should not be seen as a review of the Treaty as such; rather, they will involve a review of the manner in which the Treaty is operating and exchanges on broad nuclear policy questions within the competence of Euratom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second question concerned the 1981 agreement. The short answer to that is yes, the bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement is in force. The third question sought an assurance about breaking the agreement. The Government's position is that neither the nuclear safeguards agreement between Australia and Euratom nor that between Australia and France requires Australia to supply uranium to France. The suspension of uranium exports for end use in France continues in view of French testing of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific. The international safeguards system and the provisions of our bilateral treaty network provide assurance that Australian uranium is not being diverted for use in nuclear weapons by France or any other state.</PARA>
<PARA> As a matter of policy, as Senator Sanders would know, Australia is prepared to conclude safeguards agreements only with countries which are parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Non-nuclear weapons states party to the NPT have undertaken not to develop nuclear weapons. France is already a nuclear weapons state and is the only exception to that general principle in Australian policy; the basis of the exception being that although France is not a party to the NPT, France has undertaken to act as if it were an NPT party and it has upheld that undertaking. As to the question of our condonation of French military activities in the Pacific, I say simply that the Government's condemnation of France's nuclear testing in the Pacific is a matter of ample record.</PARA>

For a long time Mr Stone has not been averse to stating conclusions without knowledge of the evidence and even sometimes in conflict with the evidence or, at least, selectively culling out all evidence which does not support his predetermined conclusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did see a report in the Canberra Times that Mr Stone was advocating a 25 per cent flat tax. This is further sad evidence of Mr Stone's progressive cerebral decay. The fact that he now shares a platform with Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who also believes that cars can be made to run on water, leads one to suspect that before long Mr Stone might be reported as asserting that cars will run on water. However, Mr Stone has not entirely lost contact with the disciplined approach to mathematical questions which he once adopted and he appears to concede that a flat tax system which raised an equivalent amount of revenue would leave taxpayers in the $17,000 to $23,000 income range worse off. In fact, on average weekly earnings, which is about mid-point in that range, they would be $3 a week worse off. But what has either not been acknowledged or not reported is that a 25 per cent flat tax would make every taxpayer earning less than $23,000 a year worse off. That would be about 83 per cent of taxpayers. The Canberra Times report went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> At a news conference later he-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Mr Stone-</PARA>
<PARA>could not define the proportion of taxpayers who would be worse off at the outset of change.</PARA>
<PARA>That proportion is about 85 per cent. Nor does he appear to have pointed out that a taxpayer with a $13,000 income would be $22 a week worse off, that someone on $17,000 a year would pay $18 a week extra tax, that someone on $20,000 a year would pay $13.30 a week extra tax and that some five million taxpayers-I said about 85 per cent-would be worse off. Included among that 85 per cent would be the great majority of Australian farmers on their present income levels. As my colleague John Kerin pointed out in the House yesterday, the adoption of a flat tax proposal as advocated by the Federal National Party as well as the Queensland National Party would mean a tax increase of around $2,000 for a farmer on average levels of farm income, as reported by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics.</PARA>
<PARA> That is what would happen initially-that is 85 per cent of the population would pay more tax of the amounts I have stipulated-if a 25 per cent flat tax was introduced. Mr Stone was also reported as saying that with government restraint that 25 per cent rate could ultimately be brought down to 20 per cent. Assuming that the deficit would be of the same size, a 20 per cent flat tax rate applied now would require a cut in government outlays of the order of $12 billion or $13 billion. I cannot get any response from Senator Messner, Mr Howard or anybody else in the Opposition-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has noted with concern reports that Mururoa Atoll is crumbling under the strain of repeated French underground nuclear tests, but it has to be said that these reports are not supported by evidence now available to the Government, as was stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hayden, in the House of Representatives yesterday. The Government's opposition to the tests is well known, and, particularly in light of the South Pacific nuclear-free zone agreement recently signed at Rarotonga, we, of course, continue to deplore France's demonstration of its nuclear capability in the Pacific region. The Government's concern about the potential environmental effects of the French testing program was the reason it agreed in 1983 to a French invitation to South Pacific Forum countries to send a scientific team to visit Mururoa. This enabled a group of scientists from Australia, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand to inspect the French nuclear testing site at the atoll in October-November 1983. In releasing the group's report, as Mr Hayden did publicly on 9 July 1984, he noted with concern the report's conclusion that leakage could occur from the detonation chambers in the long term, and that the structural integrity of the coral limestones on the upper section of Mururoa Atoll had already been impaired. While the environmental and health effects of nuclear testing are important, the Government's dominant concern is that nuclear testing should not take place by any state in any environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the specific question about winds and currents, Mr Hayden advises me that he would need technical advice before being able to state whether winds and currents would bring any radioactive leakage into Australian fishing grounds. But there is nothing in the report from which I have just quoted to suggest that this is so, although it is not conclusive on that point and further research may well be justified. Regarding monitoring facilities for checking radioactive material in our sea water, I have not, as yet, had time to check this out thoroughly, but I am confident that such bodies as the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council could meet such a requirement.</PARA>
<PARA> The net result of all that is that although there are grounds for continuing concern about the environmental impact of the French tests on Mururoa Atoll, it has to be acknowledged that some of the more extravagant concerns that have been expressed are not well based in fact. But that does not alter the legitimacy of a continuing concern by us, in common with all countries in the region, about what continues to take place there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether Mr Booth criticised the figures for being inconsistently arranged, but I do know what Mr Greiner's analysis showed. It was not a biased analysis; it was prepared by the Liberal Party of Australia and it showed that Queensland had the highest rate of unemployment of any State. It lost, per thousand workers, almost twice as much time through industrial disputes as did any other State. It had the smallest growth in new dwelling commencements for the year ended March 1985. It had the second slowest breakdown in inflation, being second only to Tasmania in that negative respect. Its rate of private fixed capital investment was one-third of the national average, and so on. Those figures relate to the month of August. The monthly ABS survey of employment which, I suppose, Senator Bjelke-Petersen is referring to, is noted for swinging quite wildly from month to month, even on a national basis and on a State basis it would be likely to swing even more irrationally.

If I wanted evidence or a political platform from which to support the fact that over recent years Labor State governments in comparison with non-Labor State governments have had a vastly better economic record, the figures would suit me excellently. They show that the State of Queensland is the sick State in Australia. In spite of being dragged down in almost every economic indicator of any consequence whatsoever, the national performance is still extremely good. This is because we are fortunate enough, apart from the State of Queensland, to have only the small State of Tasmania governed by a non-Labor government. We have four Labor States and a Labor Federal government. Therefore, in spite of the burden in reducing the average that Queensland imposes on the rest of Australia, the national performance is extremely good.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Knowing Senator Maguire's uncanny perception in these matters, the Attorney-General has kept me well supplied with statistics on bankruptcies for 1984-85. To get the context clear at the outset, I shall give the national tally. In 1983-84, there were 4,909 bankruptcies but in 1984-85, there were 4,727. That is a decline around the country of 3.7 per cent.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When an economy is strong, companies and individuals can trade their way out of difficulties or get credit, as even Senator Messner might recall, to tide them over tough times. But when an economy is not basically sound, as was the case during the Fraser years, business confidence falls and the level of bankruptcies tends to rise. So the significant fall in the level in 1984-85 is a further indication of the way the Australian economy has recovered under the Hawke Government's management and its policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the situation in the States, Senator Maguire can be properly proud of the fact that in South Australia over that period there has been a drop in bankruptcies of 14.6 per cent. They fell from 775 in 1983-84 to 662 in 1984-85. Increases were recorded in three bankruptcy districts. There was a very slight increase of 1.8 per cent in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. In Tasmania there was an increase of 5.5 per cent and, rather fascinatingly, in light of some of the discussions we have heard today, in Queensland, there was an increase of 15.6 per cent. So South Australia had a drop of around 15 per cent and Queensland had an increase of more than 15 per cent. Nationally there was an overall drop of 3.7 per cent, but in Tasmania, there was a 5.5 per cent increase and in Queensland, an increase of 15.6 per cent. For the record, so that the real enormity of the failure of economic performance in Queensland can be appreciated, this is how the remaining States and the Northern Territory performed in those two years: In Victoria bankruptcies were down 11.5 per cent under the Cain Labor Government; in the Northern Territory they were down 7.5 per cent for reasons that remain obscure; and in Westen Australia under the Burke Labor Government bankruptcies were down 15.3 per cent. There has been no attempt to hide the total picture. There it is and there is the lesson the Opposition and Senator Bjelke-Petersen and her husband ought particularly to be contemplating.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been adversely affected by the actions of Hansard in its report of 16 September on page 543, which attributes words to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) which were not, in fact, said by him and which are not necessarily implied by what he actually did say. I have the agreement of Mr Shearwood of Hansard that words were added that were not spoken and I have heard the tape. The consequence of Hansard altering what Senator Walsh did say to make it grammatically acceptable has, therefore, changed the meaning of what he said to the extent that it removes the possibility of another meaning that was, in my view, deliberately left open by the Minister's words. No matter what Hansard's obligations to provide a record that is consistent with acceptable English usage, the prime responsibility surely must be to ensure that meanings are not changed by any improvement so undertaken. A reading of the offending section of the Hansard as it was actually said by Senator Walsh, and excluding your intervention, Mr President, reveals that his words have the very clear effect of claiming that I was insolvent. The words are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Interest rates of that magnitude could even cause stockbroking firms to become insolvent, as one did in Sydney a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ryan interjected:</PARA>
<PARA> Which one was that?</PARA>

<PARA> Patrick Partners. Indeed, we have a Patrick Partner with us-a former Patrick Partner has joined us in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>There was a pause for your intervention, Mr President. The next words were:</PARA>
<PARA> insolvent, leaving many depositors and clients screaming for their money. </PARA>
<PARA>The last mention of a name to which the word `insolvent` could relate was my own as a former Patrick Partner. In fact, I did not go insolvent. An official New South Wales inquiry into the failure of that partnership even exonerated me and specifically exempted me from the criticism that it did make of the remaining partners because, among other reasons, I had physically removed myself from the partnership activities after a dispute five months before the events took place that triggered the firm's collapse. That was why I took a point of order that Senator Walsh's statement, as actually made in the chamber, was false and offensive to me. My objection is, of course, rendered incorrect and misleading of the Senate if the change Hansard has made, for cosmetic reasons, to the record is allowed to stand. By interpolating the two words `it went' Hansard has ensured that the only possible construction from Senator Walsh's remarks is that they did not refer to me but to the partnership from which I had physically removed myself five months previously, whether or not I was still held legally to be a partner. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it unfortunate that I am put in a position of appearing to mislead the Senate solely because a statement is altered by Hansard, despite my objections, to exclude a meaning that it was capable of having in its original form. Mr President, in these circumstances, I ask that you request Hansard to reconsider its decision to alter the actual events of the Senate chamber-which was done simply to put the words into a stylistic pattern-in a way which had a capacity to distort the meaning of words used to my considerable disadvantage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second occasion on which concern has been expressed in the Senate by the senators on this side of the chamber about the alteration of the Senate Hansard record as it affects the words used by a Minister in this place. The first occasion involved Senator Gareth Evans and, in the view of the Opposition, there was a clear distortion of meaning in that case. In the case of Senator Walsh I have examined the transcript and, certainly, if the words which are said by Senator Michael Baume to have been added were added, in my view there is an alteration of the clear meaning of the words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise at this time to ask you, Mr President, to examine this case. I think the Hansard officers perform a difficult task and they do undertake the alteration of the transcript from time to time. Senator Walsh has told us that no alteration was requested by him or by his office. If that is what he has said presumably that is true. If that is so, it seems to me that it goes beyond the province of Hansard to make an alteration which can alter the sense. On the occasion that this matter was raised in the past I made inquiries and found out that, on occasions, my own staff had requested alterations to Hansard when I was a Minister. I found out that their requests, according to Hansard, had been to restore the original words used which, no doubt, were often less grammatical and less elegant than those which had been inserted by Hansard. But when there is an issue such as this which goes to the standing of a senator and on which he thinks it necessary to seek leave to make a personal explanation, I think it is highly undesirable that there should be any alteration to the record. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I ask you to examine the matter and to report to the Senate on the rules which govern alterations. I am not satisfied. I certainly do not impugn the motives of Hansard officers-I think they do a very difficult task well-but I believe that, if there is to be any error, it should be in favour of maintaining the errors which we make in our language and not in correcting them. If, in correcting them, there is any alteration of the sense of what is said, if potentially injustice is done to honourable senators, the position of either the Government or the Opposition can be distorted. </PARA>
