The government has moved to address all aspects of a Senate resolution of 7 April calling for action under World Trade Organisation rules—and I think that is what it referred to—on the effects of imports on the pig industry in particular. On 10 June it announced, as you would be aware, a further package of financial assistance to the industry, amounting to another $9 million for investment grants to specialist pig processors. It has also set aside special provisions under the national component of the new FarmBis scheme to improve risk management skills and the adoption of best practice in the industry.</para></talk.start><para>The government has also announced a benchmarking study of the entire pork production processing and supply catch to assess performance of the industry. It identified the need for a study of the medium-term export opportunities focusing on Asia. The minister welcomes the finalisation on 26 June of the terms of the reference from the Treasurer to the Productivity Commission for an inquiry into the imports of uncooked pork and into the profitability and competitiveness of the pig farming and pig meat processing indus 
 tries. This inquiry will examine whether safeguard action is warranted against imports of frozen pig meat under the WTO safeguards arrangements and will report within 140 days. It is now up to the industry to convince the Productivity Commission that the safeguard measures on imports of frozen pork can be justified under the WTO.</para><para>The Deputy Prime Minister has also indicated that the government would lead a high level trade mission to key markets in order to expand opportunities for exports of Australian pig meat in the latter half of 1998. This assistance is over and above that which the minister announced in November 1997 for the provision of $10 million in assistance to the pig industry under the national pork industry development program. In addition, on 8 April 1998 the government introduced amendments to the Trade Practices Act to clarify claims of `Product of Australia' and `Made in Australia'. I believe these are currently before the Senate or will be in the next few days.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4395</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

The government has acted very quickly with regard to the pig industry. It recognises—and I think I have said this a number of times in this place—and has great concern about the difficulties facing the pig industry. A lot of it has to do with things like oversupply of pork—not just with 
 in Australia but around the world. But the point is made that the inquiry will examine whether safeguard action is warranted against imports of frozen pig meat under the WTO safeguards agreement. With respect to the balance of the question on legislation, I will refer that to the minister.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Unemployment </title><page.no>4396</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4396</page.no><name role="metadata">MacGibbon, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator MacGIBBON</name><name.id>YH4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Ellison as the minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, and relates to the government's Jobs Network initiative.

It has ramifications in both the personal and societal senses in that it tears apart our social fabric, and there is also an economic consequence. This is a very important problem which this government is addressing and one which the former government obviously did not address.</para></talk.start><para>Under the current Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, when he was minister for employment, there were 359,000 long- term unemployed people. Indeed, in December 1992, when he was the minister, unemployment peaked at 11.2 per cent. His comments back in 1993 when he was minister for employment illustrated Labor's attitude to the long-term unemployed.

Obviously, the opposition does not want to hear this, but in the former system you had to go to the CES and be registered as unemployed.

What we are providing today in this reform is 1,400 sites—over four times the 296 sites offered by the CES previously.</para><para>But what does the opposition do? The opposition is content to pick out the negatives, to nitpick and to downgrade this reform for those seeking employment.

The minister has previously outlined the many benefits associated with the introduction of the youth allowance, including rent assistance for students and a more generous means

The opposition has struggled mightily over the last few weeks with their friends in the CPSU to try to develop a campaign to somehow frighten people about the youth allowance. The reality is that, of the 560,000 young Australians who will be affected by the introduction of this allowance, 153,750 will receive more money, 361,200 will receive the same payment, 32,350 will receive a reduced payment and 12,800 will receive no money.</para></talk.start><para>The important point is that students who have been campaigning for years to get rent assistance to be able to afford to go away to study, to be able to afford to have a decent standard of living while they are studying, at last are getting rent assistance. They are not only getting rent assistance, but they are also getting a pharmaceutical allowance and, if they live in remote parts of Australia, they may also be eligible for a remote area allowance.</para><para>I think what the scare campaign of the opposition is refusing to recognise or acknowledge is that they had an Austudy parental means test which, in fact, is less generous than the parental means test which will apply from tomorrow. First of all, they both started at about the same number of dollars as a base but under youth allowance they cut out very much higher. For example, for a family with one child living at home, the cut-out point would be at $41,000—about $4,000 more than the cut-out point for Austudy. If there was one young person living away from home, then the cut-out point of the family income would be $58,000—that is $12,000 more than the cut-out point for Austudy. You are not hearing the Labor spokesman acknow 
 ledging that as she travels around the country trying to frighten people.</para><para>The Labor spokesman is claiming that families in Gympie, Lismore, Burnie and Bendigo are going to somehow be disadvantaged by that. It just shows how out of touch the Labor Party still is because those are areas which, like most of rural and regional Australia, are still suffering after 13 years of Labor. These are families on low to middle incomes, compared with the rest of Australia. Most in fact will be eligible for assistance for their young people.</para><para>All we have had from the Labor Party is complaints about the initiative. Do they really want to go back to students getting less than the young unemployed? Are they prepared to go out and campaign in the next election on their cuts to the extra expenditure? This is not a savings measure, Madam President. It is $212 million extra expenditure on youth allowance—extra money over the next four years for youth allowance for the benefit of students as well as young people looking for work. But no, what we have got is a campaign of ALP and CPSU delegates trying to beat up a storm, trying to frighten the public, trying to do something to help the CPSU in its industrial relations campaign, in its negotiations of a new agreement with Centrelink management.

So that is a pretty good indication that young people and their families are interested.</para><para>Let me get back to this question of breaches. An administrative breach is imposed only where a person refuses or fails to comply with the request for information without reasonable excuse. It is understandable that some young people may have had trouble getting the information required, even though they were sent the data collection form five weeks ago. Centrelink are therefore doing all they can to help, including phoning those who have not sent the forms back. I hope Senator Stott Despoja appreciates that personal service.</para><para>If young people do not send the form back, Centrelink cannot work out if they qualify for youth allowance, so payments will stop until such time as they return the form. Those who return their forms after 1 July will have payments completely restored, provided they are qualified. So I urge all young people who received a form to send it back as soon as possible or to go and talk to their Centrelink office if they are having trouble getting the necessary information. Some young people will have found work in the intervening weeks and will not be returning a form for that reason. Nevertheless, I urge those who have been sent a form to contact Centrelink so we can establish their eligibility or otherwise for existing or new payments.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4400</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

But I would say that the Prime Minister went out of his way from the minute the Wik judgment was handed down to consult as closely as he possibly could with the leaders of the indigenous communities of Australia. We had something like 100 separate meetings with the indigenous leaders of Australia. The Prime Minister had Gatjil Djerrkura and other 
 indigenous leaders to the lodge on several occasions, separately and with other leaders of industry groups around Australia. Those discussions continued right through to about April or May of last year, when the National Indigenous Working Group, of its own volition, left the table. The Indigenous Working Group walked away from the consultation process which we had put in train because they said they were no longer interested in talking to us.</para><para>We did in fact take account of many of the indigenous concerns in presenting the Native Title Amendment Bill to this parliament. You on the other side know what those areas are in relation to agreements and representative bodies et cetera. The bill does protect and preserve native title. We have respected native title on pastoral leases, and I would have thought that you would have at least been prepared to acknowledge, given the outrageous and ridiculous position taken by the One Nation Party on this issue, that the government's position does indeed represent a fair balance of all the competing interests on this very sensitive and difficult issue for the government and for the people of Australia.</para><para>I remind you, Senator Woodley, that the National Indigenous Working Group's position was outlined in this so-called yellow book. This was the position which the Indigenous Working Group said was their bottom line, and that anything not in this book was not of interest to them and they were just going to walk away from it. One part of the bottom line for them is:</para><para>No extinguishment of native title by the Commonwealth, States or Territories without the informed consent of native title holders.</para><para>That is a polite way of saying that there is an absolute Aboriginal veto on any development of 79 per cent of Australia. It is a completely unacceptable position, which not even the Labor Party was prepared to put forward. But that was put forward as a bottom line—a veto on any development on land that may be native title land in Australia, which, as a result of the Wik decision, amounts to 79 per cent of Australia. So their position was unacceptable not only to the government but 
 to the Labor Party itself, both in government and in opposition.</para><para>We have sought to consult as closely as we can with indigenous groups in developing the amendment bill.

If they were favourable to the minister there would be a more effusive and warm response for the minister to sign, and in particular when they get letters written in from people attacking the ABC because that is in line with government policy. That was the example given by the minister.</para><para>I find it extraordinary that the example he would give is about the ABC, a statutory authority for which he is responsible and for which he should have some responsibility to publicly defend and explain its charter. But no, not this minister, he is always in there taking every opportunity to put the boot into the ABC. This is an unparalleled and unprecedented performance by any minister who has been in charge of the ABC since it was formed and created by an act of the Australian parliament over 60 years ago.</para><para>Of course, we know the minister is aided and abetted in this by the Prime Minister's own obsessions about the ABC, the Prime Minister's own chip on the shoulder and the Prime Minister's own vendetta to get even with every story and every comment run by the ABC that the Prime Minister thinks is against him or the Liberal Party of Australia. So the Prime Minister has egged on this minister to have this attitude towards the ABC.</para><para>I notice that Senator Alston did not put in the memo or instruct his department that maybe they should have the same response, for example, towards Telstra. I would imagine the minister gets many more letters complaining about Telstra's charges and about Telstra's service. Only yesterday we had the example given by the ACA in its quarterly report to March of this year that new telephone connection services in country areas have dropped by 17 per cent in the first full year of the one-third privatisation of Telstra. But no, that would not worry him. The minister does not want to get into criticising Telstra or even showing some sympathy for some of the legitimate complaints against Telstra, because he wants to promote Telstra for its privatisation. The one example he gives of the ABC, again, absolutely fits the pattern of abuse from this minister.</para><para>We say to the Australian people that it is not just the $55 million cut per annum that the ABC has suffered—most savagely—by this government since it came to office in breaking every promise it made during the 1996 election campaign to maintain the funding. Even on election night after they had won the election, Senator Alston reiterated the 
 coalition's commitment to maintain the funding for the ABC. The ABC is not only at risk from the cuts to its funding but also these attacks come about because this government, the Prime Minister and the minister for communications are all about one thing only, and that is destroying the ABC as a broad based national and comprehensive news broadcaster in Australia.</para><para>The Prime Minister and the minister for communications want to intimidate the ABC, particularly in the lead-up to the coming election. They know that, in many areas of Australia, the ABC is the only independent voice for Australians to get factual information about current events, about politics, and about social and economic issues in Australia. Sometimes those comments are not favourable to this government's policies; sometimes they are not favourable to the Labor Party; and sometimes they are not favourable to other political parties. But the ABC has a long history of providing a balance. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>4411</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I notice that there is no-one from the government side—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PATTERSON</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—Madam President, I raise a point of order.

What we have before us today is a proposition where the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) who is the minister responsible for the ABC—a person who ought to be defending the ABC and its legitimate function within our society—undertaking a role on behalf of the Liberal Party to attack the ABC, to vilify the

Why do they hate the ABC with such a passion? They do not like the ABC because it represents a threat to their notion of what is fair and reasonable.

They believe there are two sides to every question—there is a National Party side to the question and then there is a Liberal Party side to the question. There should be no other consideration of any other views in our society. We should not have an independent broadcaster capable of representing the broad range of values in our society. We should have a broadcaster that represents government views. That is their notion of what the ABC is all about.</para><para>What we have seen throughout the life of this government is a consistent and persistent campaign of denigration against the ABC. What we have heard is senior ministers from the government denigrating the ABC—from the Treasurer (Mr Costello), who described the ABC as lacking accountability, to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who said that the ABC was, in his view, politically correct to a fault, to this minister, who says that the ABC budget was bloated. These are the sorts of attitudes we see expressed by these politicians in this coalition about what should be an institution defended by both sides in this 
 parliament. What we have seen is a deliberate and systematic campaign by this government to undermine the integrity and the authority of the ABC. They have done so by reducing the resource provided to that body by this parliament and then back up that reduction in resource by a consistent campaign of abuse.</para><para>As a consequence, $55 million per year has been withdrawn from the ABC. The budget for the ABC has been reduced from about $555 million to just under $500 million per year. As a direct consequence of this government's action, a whole range of programs and a whole range of services to regional Australia and to different communities within Australia have been removed by this government's actions. That is a direct consequence of taking away well in excess of 10 per cent per year of the budget provided to the ABC.</para><para>In the arts area, we have had a whole series of programs removed, as we have in comedy, in drama, in sport and in documentaries. We have seen the services reduced in terms of the network services available. We have seen international services withdrawn. What do we get from this government? We get the consistent push that the bureaucracy now has to join in the holy jihad against the ABC and that the department has to join with the minister in its assault upon the independence and integrity of the ABC and seek to denigrate and abuse the ABC for doing nothing other than its job in terms of its charter and in terms of its capacity to represent the different views in our society. This government ought to be condemned and this minister ought to be condemned, because it is quite clear that he has been exposed here today. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>4412</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That was an amazing performance by Senator Carr.

They pushed through the factional fights in Victoria. A candidate who had a claim on that seat has been pushed aside. So we have a Labor candidate in the seat of Northcote in Victoria who is an ex-ABC reporter who sat on that unbiased ABC report of the election and said, `We have just lost a seat.' That is not the sort of thing we want to hear.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other day I was talking to a friend of mine. She said that she had been incensed by something she had watched on the ABC and said it was so biased. This person is a swing 
 ing voter. She said, `I am so upset about the fact that the ABC is biased.' I said, `Why don't you write to them? They have a thing called a code of practice. You can get a brochure and they will tell you how you can complain to the ABC. If you don't get a reply, then there's a process that goes on if you do not get a reply in so many days.' We rang up the ABC and guess what? There were no code of practice brochures available. I asked for them in the estimates committee and they said they would get them to me. I am still waiting.</para><para>Do you know how I can get those forms? I can get them off the Internet. This person does not have access to the Internet. So I had to print one out and send it to her. So that is how easy it is to complain about bias in the ABC. You cannot get a code of practice from them. This should be our ABC that allows us to tell them whether we think they are biased. I am putting the ABC on notice: get those forms out so that when people ask us about how they can complain about bias in the ABC they can at least go through the right process.</para><para>Also we heard in estimates that the committee to which you can complain about bias is absolutely stacked with journalists, not with people in the community. With all due respect to journalists, they are like politicians, although politicians better represent the community—they all have a particular view. I think the committee should be formed by people who can make an unbias, objective decision about whether there has been bias in the ABC. Maybe they could have one or two journalists, but to have a whole committee of journalists is not what we call cricket. So the ABC has a way to go.</para><para>To say that we hate the ABC is wrong. What we want is an ABC which is unbiased, which presents the facts, which is a genuine broadcaster of apolitical information, not taking one view or the other. They should also make themselves available. I put on the record here that I have just written to Donald McDonald recently to thank him for the ABC's involvement and commitment to the International Year of Older Persons. I had cause to write to him and thank him for the plans they are already making for the Interna

As chairman of the committee responsible for the International Year of Older Persons, I am delighted that the ABC is going to be involved in that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>4413</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me make a couple of comments about what Senator Patterson said. First of all, the body within the Senate which deals with complaints is the Privileges Committee. Let me tell you that the Privileges Committee is stacked with politicians. Does that mean that they cannot be fair and reasonable? Does that mean that they cannot actually be reasonable? Of course it does not. What a ridiculous thing to say.</para></talk.start><para>What about the ALP person who happens to be a journalist? Are you telling me that Mr Henshaw, who is now the Liberal Party candidate in the seat of Dickson and an ex-ABC talkback host in Queensland, was biased in favour of the Liberal Party when he was with the ABC? That is a pretty outrageous thing to say. I do not believe that he was biased, and I do not believe that that other person was biased either. People belong to political parties. It is the way it happens. People stand for election for political parties. You did. I did, and I am going to do it again. That is the way it happens. This is a democracy. In this country we are allowed to belong to political parties, and we are allowed to have jobs while we do that. We are allowed to stand for election.</para><para>Let me turn to a few things the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) said. First of all, the minister said that it is only polite to answer letters. I may have this almost right—I am sure I have the gist of it right. If someone writes to me, then they expect me to write back and address their concerns. That is perfectly reasonable and correct. So they do. If you do not address their concerns, if you do not answer their letters, then that is the way you lose touch. That is all true.</para><para>Let me ask the minister—unfortunately he is not here, but I am sure he is listening—what about the 17,000 people who wrote to him complaining about cuts to the ABC? They have not received a reply. The minister 
 has not replied to them, and the department has not replied. Even though the department has been instructed to tell them how awful the ABC is, they have not replied. There was no reply at all. I think the minister could lose touch if he does not reply to those 17,000 people, and I think he should do it fairly soon.</para><para>What about Mr Mansfield's inquiry which received 10,615 submissions—the vast majority of which were saying, `Do not destroy the ABC. Do not cut the ABC. Do not kill the funding of the ABC'? What happened? We got a lot of recommendations, some of which were quite good and others which did not even relate to the terms of reference for that inquiry.</para><para>We heard about the minister's performance on election night when he was asked by a journalist, `Will you cut the funding to the ABC?' He said, `No, I'm sure the Prime Minister will stand by his promises, and he has promised not to do that.' The journalist asked, `What if you find that there is a big black hole and you have to find somewhere to get that money from?' He answered, `I'm sure the Prime Minister will stick by his promises.' I and I am sure everybody else listening to the ABC took that to mean that the ABC would not be slashed. What happened? Of course the ABC was slashed—$55 million was taken out of the ABC's budget in the first year.</para><para>Let me make another point: $485 million includes the orchestras. It is not $500 million; it is $485 million, including the orchestras. It is $468 million when you take the orchestras out. The ABC does not have over $500 million; it has $468 million, which even Mr Mansfield pointed out was insufficient to run a national broadcasting organisation like the ABC. Even Mr Mansfield said that. So the government, I take it, does not agree with Mr Mansfield on that. But they agree with him on anything that he said would diminish the ABC.</para><para>I know that there are a few people in the coalition who approve of the ABC, who like the ABC, and who want the ABC to stay where it is. But, obviously, there are many people in cabinet who do not. The ABC is to 
 receive $20 million for digital funding when they need a minimum of $108 million. But if we are in government we just accept, don't we, that the commercial networks need $250 million? The ABC is getting $20 million versus $250 million. Obviously they cannot do anything with that.</para><para>Rural and regional services are going to be an absolute disaster because there is no funding. The funding is not there to make rural and regional a viable place for the ABC to broadcast into. Cox Peninsula has been closed down. That was a totally ridiculous decision. Even though it is desperately necessary to have a short-wave service into Asia, the government cannot make themselves reverse that decision. The government has to get its act together. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>4414</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to place on record at the start my dismay at the fact that you, Madam Deputy President, called two Labor speakers in a row, even though one of those Labor people was not in his seat.

Today, I would like to talk a bit about competition policy and privatisation. One seems to beget the other.</para></talk.start><para>South Australian Premier, John Olsen, from my home state, has argued that, if South Australia fails to privatise its electricity industry, it could actually put at risk the $1 billion bonus payments that South Australia was supposed to receive from the federal government. We actually believe that the National Competition Council has debunked Premier John Olsen's claim, but the same sort of ideology that says the market is best which underpins competition policy also underpins privatisation.</para><para>So let us start by taking the whole argument for allowing competition among suppliers of electricity. This argument has actually allowed the biggest users of electricity, big corporations, to negotiate supply contracts that have cut the price of power by up to 30 per cent. But, as the Council of Small Business Organisations chief, Rob Bastion, has pointed out in a recent speech, small business has not had the same access to similar discounts. Frankly, even if small businesses get access to alternative suppliers, they are unlikely to have the same kind of buying power to attract the bulk discounts.</para><para>Households are even less likely to win such benefits from a contestable market. So big businesses end up being the primary beneficiaries, and let us remember who initiated, or proposed, competition policy in the first place in this country—Fred Hilmer. So it is probably understandable that big businesses are winning.</para><para>A national market for electricity also has significant environmental consequences. This is another consequence that the Australian Democrats are concerned about. We still 
 remember when the federal and state Labor governments wanted to connect Queensland to the national grid via Eastlink, ignoring the environmental consequences of doing so, ignoring all those environmental consequences of cutting such a link through bushland and over settled rural communities.</para><para>But it can only get worse. When South Australia fully connects to the national grid, ETSA will be forced to compete, on price, against the Victorian power utilities. South Australia's gas fired power stations are the cleanest in Australia. That is something we are very proud of. Victoria's, however, which rely on brown coal, spew out as much as four to five times the amount of greenhouse gases for each kilowatt of power. Yet these environmental factors, or these environmental costs, are not factored into any equation, and South Australia will be forced to buy, on price, more dirty power at the expense of clean power. They are going to be forced to do so because of the price considerations. The development of other cleaner power sources around Australia will also be put at threat.</para><para>I would like to return to the claim by Premier Olsen in my home state of South Australia that competition policy must mean privatisation, a claim that he seems to share with a number of people in this country, including the Labor Premier in New South Wales, Premier Bob Carr. Both have argued that privatisation is necessary to reduce state debt and to deliver more efficiency in their respective markets, especially in relation to electricity. My Democrat colleagues in the South Australian parliament, under the leadership of Mike Elliott MLC, have spent four months going through Premier Olsen's arguments for the privatisation of ETSA, and they have found them to be bunkum.</para><para>Let us take the debt argument to begin with. Premier John Olsen says South Australia has a debt problem, yet the figures show that South Australia's net debt to gross state product ratio is now the second lowest in 40 years and is less than half the level it was in 1970. Analyses by economists, such as John Quiggin and John Spoer, show that the sale of ETSA will actually leave our state financially worse off when retained earnings and 
 interest payments from ETSA are taken into account. The loss to the public sector could be as much as $120 million to $180 million a year. That is hardly a good deal.</para><para>Then there is the question of the control of ETSA. Privatisation, particularly that of state utilities, has become a case of passing assets not just from public to private ownership but from Australian to foreign ownership—again, another area that the Australian Democrats are particularly concerned about. Thus, the Victorian power industry is now largely owned by American power companies. Queensland's largest power station is owned by a British-Canadian company. Even South Australia's, my home state's, water utilities are now controlled by a French company.</para><para>South Australia, instead of controlling our power utility locally, will again be a branch office town. The consequence is that we will find ourselves to be a branch office town. We will be subject to foreign ownership if we sell off our electricity supplier. It will happen much in the same way that we allowed water and other utilities to become foreign owned.</para><para>Will consumers benefit? Will price cuts necessarily follow? We argue that these benefits to consumers already exist with the public control of these utilities. Across Australia are publicly owned utilities that have kept price rises at or near inflation for much of the last decade now by achieving better efficiencies and new technology. Contrast that with Britain, for example, where a recent World Bank study concluded that, as a result of the privatisation of power utilities:</para><para>Power purchasers seem to be paying higher prices than they would have under continued public ownership.</para><para>Because, I quote again:</para><para>Higher company margins offset lower costs.</para><para>In short, none of the arguments that the South Australian government has made, particularly in relation to the sale of ETSA, have been found to hold water, if you do not mind my mixing metaphors.</para><para>The arguments from the New South Wales Labor government are not much better. I am not surprised that the premier, Mr Bob Carr, has failed to convince even his own party of 
 the so-called benefits. The evidence from New South Wales is that the government pricing tribunal has successfully forced price cuts of 20 per cent or even more under the seven years of the Liberal government. They are enforcing further price cuts over the next five years under a Labor government. Indeed, if New South Wales power stations are operated at the same level of efficiency as the Queensland power stations, which, for the record, are also publicly owned, a further $100 million worth of savings could be delivered.</para><para>But arguments do not seem to worry Mr Egan or his colleagues in the Australian Labor Party. I suspect that it is because he needs a slush fund in order to spend his way back into government. Some cynics might suggest that this is what former Prime Minister Paul Keating did along with former minister Kim Beazley when they flogged off Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank to fund new spending. I put on the record again that the Australian Democrats voted against those sales.</para><para>Despite the positive arguments, they seem to be catching, however. I notice that even in the Tasmanian parliament the Greens have been the latest victims. While not prepared to tick off a full privatisation of power, they are offering to support a long-term lease of the HEC, the Hydro-Electric Corporation, which, frankly, is pretty much the same thing, unfortunately. The slippery position of a party like the Greens in Tasmania can be contrasted with the position of parties such as the Australian Democrats, for example in South Australia and certainly at the federal level, where we have faced similar pressures but said no. You cannot essentially opt for a bit, the thin edge of the wedge, and allow the partial privatisation of a public utility, especially one that delivers in the public interest.</para><para>In short, across Australia, Labor, Green and coalition politicians have all been eyeing off their power utilities as short-term revenue raisers. Rational arguments seem to be falling by the wayside, be they economic, environmental, or social, as governments rush to cash in the family silver. The Democrats say that enough is enough. We have never supported 
 privatisation, such as this, that is not in the public interest.</para><para>Privatisation and competition policy in this country have gone too far. Ideology has carried governments into reform and policies that are not in the long-term social, environmental or economic interest of all Australians. Privatisation and competition policy at the end of the day benefit the big end of town far more than ordinary consumers, and that is not a fair deal for Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>4426</page.no><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name><name.id>BX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of the government to say a few things about the electricity industry in response to the Australian Democrats' statement regarding, in particular, the failure of competition policy to deliver better outcomes for consumers. I want to give the history of the electricity industry in Australia rather than comment on the detail of what a particular state government, to wit the South Australian government, is currently proposing to do. The statement really concerns two issues in this industry. The first issue is that of competition. The second issue is about who owns the assets in that industry; that is, whether they should be privatised or in state hands. I agree with Senator Stott Despoja that they are quite separate issues.</para></talk.start><para>Before talking further about the industry, I should declare my interest. I have had a long interest in the electricity industry, going back well over 20 years. The first was as a major buyer of electricity for a pulp and paper company in two states. In more recent years, before coming to this place, about five years ago, I was involved with a major electricity supplier. In fact, I was chairman of the Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania for four years.</para><para>The major point I want to make to the Senate and those who are listening is that the threat of competition has forced enormous changes in the electricity industry throughout Australia over the last 15 years. There has been at least a doubling of productivity within this industry over the last 15  years. Prices have come down right across the board in those areas where competition has been allowed to flourish.</para><para>What has happened? More than 15 years ago, we had state monopolies producing electricity in each of the states. They behaved just like any other monopoly. They were quite dictatorial, apart from when it suited politicians to interfere with what they were doing. I want to run through two examples quickly. Firstly, as a buyer of electricity, I had a major hand in establishing a pulp and paper mill at Albury in New South Wales 17 to 20 years ago. We had no sooner built the big industrial plant when the state Labor government doubled the price of electricity a year later. It made the plant immediately uneconomic. The plant would not have been built if we had known that that was going to happen, with the Labor government simply playing politics. Even though the Victorian electricity supplier was only 17 kilometres away and there was a line across the border, we were unable to buy cheap electricity from Victoria in order to keep the plant prospering in those times.</para><para>That has now changed due to competition policy. Australia is the poorer for this. Why? If the mill had been allowed to compete and buy electricity from the other state, it would probably have doubled in size in the mid-1980s and Australia would have been importing less paper.</para><para>The other key point that needs to be made about what happened in the 1980s is that, again driven by politics, the state governments made huge expansions in their state owned enterprises and wasted many billions of dollars increasing the capacity of electricity generation, particularly in the states of Victoria and New South Wales. Again, that was driven by politics rather than by the marketplace.</para><para> In the late 1980s, an Industry Commission report brought to the attention of everyone involved in the business the fact that competition was effective in other parts of the world, particularly in North America and parts of Europe, and that there was no reason why competition could not be brought into the market in Australia. That was a blueprint for what could be done in Australia. That is what has happened since then. But, well before that, the threat of competition coming to 
 Australia had driven substantial productivity increases in that industry.</para><para>In 1991, COAG made the decision to form a competitive market in south-eastern Australia. There has been increased competition from that time. We are still going through the process of opening up the markets. Because of the complexity of the market, we are, of course, starting off with large customers and then slowly moving down to households. That process is well and truly under way. As a result, wholesale prices for electricity have come down by enormous amounts. The actual wholesale spot price in Victoria and New South Wales today is about a quarter of what it was for even long-term contracts 10 years ago in both New South Wales and Victoria.</para><para>Contract prices have come down in those two states by at least 30 per cent over the last few years, and consumer prices have come down in real terms in Victoria by at least 10 per cent. They will come down further as competition bites and the options for small players to get into this complicated market become available for everybody.</para><para>The other issue is privatisation. If you have a competitive market, it does not matter who owns the assets—the government or the private sector. There are large advantages for Australia if our governments, and particularly our state governments, see their way clear to get out of owning commercial assets which they run themselves. Why should they be taking commercial risks with commercial enterprises when there are willing investors in the private sector who would be only too pleased to do that?</para><para>My earlier examples in relation to a particular company I was associated with and in regard to the marketplace putting in huge overcapacity and wasting scarce capital in Australia were political decisions, but if you have a competitive market there is no reason for governments to be involved. They can sell off the assets and basically retreat back to their core functions, while regulating and making sure that consumers get a good deal out of that market. That is what is happening.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">SHERRY</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—What if they sell them as a monopoly?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Gibson, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GIBSON</name></talker><para>—As long as they are part of the grid, Senator, as long as there is competition across the grid and people have access to that grid, while it has to start with large firms, over time it will move down to smaller firms.

It is also sensible for those governments, be they Commonwealth or state, to look to reducing their debt.</para></talk.start></continue><para>You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that over four years the Keating government built up debt of $70 billion, which we are in the process of reducing.

What is at the back of this debate to some extent—and I will not extend the whole allegation to the Australian Democrats on this occasion—is that the slogan they want the public to believe is that the Labor and Liberal parties are the same when it comes to competition policy. That is not true.</para></talk.start><para>There are substantial issues of principle, but the way in which you address those in the public interest is a matter that divides the parties quite considerably. The scapegoat to blame for the ills for electricity prices seems to be—at least in this motion—competition policy. I have heard residents around Australia say that competition policy is to blame for everything.</para><para>The subject before us is competition policy and the electricity power generation, distribution and supply industry and whether or not Australians are getting cheaper electricity prices as a consequence of it; and whether the transitional costs of moving from the system we have to a more competitive outcome is being handled properly. Before I address that subject, I would like to say a word about competition policy.</para><para>Some 20 per cent of all the goods and services we produce in this country are traded goods which are sold overseas. If Australia can lift the percentage of GNP it sells to foreigners, other people will consume what we produce in this country and our living standards and our quality of life and the number of jobs we offer to Australians will increase. As a consequence, in order to sell into foreign markets we need to be more nationally competitive. One of the things that you should ask yourself, when you look logically at how you make an economy as diverse and geographically widespread as Australia's more competitive, is how you can reduce input costs to industry.</para><para>Electricity is a major input cost to all sectors of industry, whether they be farming, mining, manufacturing or service sector industries. Therefore, input costs from electricity were a prime target of the Labor government in order to reduce those costs to consumers, to households and to industry users as well. We came up with the proposition of a national electricity grid for Australia. We asked, `Why is it that the state grids in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia should be confined within the geographical limits of where a cartographer drew the lines of what bounds a state on a map of Australia? Why can't you make one national grid? Why can't 
 you generate electricity from the most efficient source?' Back in the old days in South Australia at Leigh Creek you shovelled what looked like dirt into the generators, but it was dirty-burning brown coal, and the tonnage you had to put in to get a watt of energy out was a lot greater than the high energy, high calorific, clean- burning black coals of the eastern seaboard.</para><para>So we set this task for a national electricity grid, which enabled the most efficient production to be shared between the states. We said as well that while that grid ought to remain in public ownership and be maintained efficiently, in an effort to lower the cost of the energy supply that goes into the grid, those who supply energy to the grid can be competitive between themselves so that there is genuine competition. We also said that the wholesaling of energy out of the grid should be competitive, too, so that you can sell energy from wherever it is produced, in whatever state, and have a competitive market between wholesalers of energy. Obviously that would work clearly and most demonstrably in the corporate sector where there are high net users of energy. But there ought to be a competitive market in the selling of it.</para><para>It is right, as Senator Brian Gibson, a Liberal from Tasmania, said a moment ago, that energy costs have fallen. They have fallen remarkably. My own state of Western Australia remains isolated from the rest of this grid, and our energy costs are a lot higher. Our energy sources are either natural gas or brown coal from Collie, and they are not as efficient as the energy sources applied to the energy grid in the eastern states. Be that as it may, that is an unfortunate accident of geography.</para><para>Our model was to create a structure such as that which competes at the energy supply end and at the distribution end—that is, the selling of it in wholesale—and which has a network in public ownership which is the canals or channels which this energy runs down. We now have the states of New South Wales and Victoria signed up to that package, but the other states have not yet committed themselves fully.</para><para>Superimpose on top of that the debate about privatisation. I agree with Senator Gibson that it does not matter who owns the competitive units in this competitive structure. Whether it is publicly owned or privately owned is a matter of ideological choice; probably a mixture of both would be the better example. But that does not mean that if it is owned by the community, as a publicly owned good, it necessarily is less efficient or more efficient than one that is owned in the private sector. There might be a debate as to whether it is appropriate for the public sector to own power stations or whether it would be better to expend public sector administrative competence on other tasks. I do not think one would argue that owning a power station necessarily drains the public purse; it probably contributes to it.</para><para>If one looks at the whole debate on the privatisation of Telstra, one can see that one of the reasons why we are solid in opposing its privatisation is that it is a clear case of where public ownership of a national utility is in the national interest; very strongly in the national interest. Coming back to electricity, by and large I abide by the idea that a mixture is better but, nonetheless, public ownership is a very appropriate way of proceeding.</para><para>What has happened in the national competition debate—and no doubt this is part of the thinking of those who have put forward this motion—since we set the ground rules for it is that it has been taken over by those with an ideological or bureaucratic conviction that the important thing in this whole issue is to have competition policy. That is not the most important thing at all. Competition policy is a means to an end, and one always has to be careful about what is the end. The end here is: does it serve the national interest; does it reduce electricity prices; does it guarantee a more reliable supply; and does it meet the quality of life and economic tests? That is to say: does it bring into the net other forms of electricity generation that might be renewable energy sources of electricity generation?</para><para>That has been our structure. If competition policy does not serve those goals, if it does not put more Australians into work, if it does 
 not make the country more efficient or if it does not meet the quality of life tests, then competition policy is wrong, not those who want those better national outcomes. They are not wrong; they are the constant that is always right.</para><para>We therefore say in answer to a number of the questions that have come up in this debate that, first of all, look at the two models—in New South Wales and in Victoria. What the Kennett government did in Victoria was to privatise its power authority straight-up. The Labor government in New South Wales is breaking it up into various competitive entities so that you get that contest which leads to greater efficiency, lower prices and more jobs in the broader community. But at this stage it is debating whether it should sell off those entities or not, and which ones it should sell. In other words, it has achieved the efficiency goals before it achieved the profit motive. The Victorian government went straight for the dollar, made a quid out of selling its assets, like selling the family silver, and pocketed those funds in its budget. In New South Wales the difference is—a stark difference in philosophy between the major parties—that it created the efficient market which reduces the cost to consumers immediately. That is, first and foremost, one of the most outstanding issues.</para><para>A second point I make is that Senator Stott Despoja rightly pointed to the fact that in South Australia household consumers will have to pay more than large corporations that buy electricity off the same grid. That is because the South Australian government has negotiated preference deals with the industry sector, and their higher costs are paid by ordinary Australians in their household and domestic situations. She is quite right about that.</para><para>Our approach, though, is different, and this is why I draw a line under it. Our approach is to have the negotiations at the big end of town—in the corporate sector—go ahead, and when you have the best deal for them, you then declare that as the ceiling, and the cost for household consumers cannot rise above that. It can be below that, but it cannot rise above it. In the first tier, negotiate with 
 industry and set the price; in the second tier, provide the household supply price below the industry price. That is the Labor approach. That is the two-tier approach in this case, and that is the approach that is being adopted in New South Wales. So, at the end of the day, what we are about is creating the contest of competitive forces in the electricity supply area that actually reduces the cost of electricity to household consumers, makes their dollar go further and reduces the cost to business as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>4430</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Perhaps we make a mistake in assuming that people who are listening to this debate know what competition policy is, and I think we should not assume that everybody in this chamber knows what competition policy is. Those senators who were here in 1995 know that the Senate passed a bill which put competition policy into legislation. It was one of the largest and most overreaching pieces of legislation—affecting every piece of Australian life—that the Senate may have seen in a long time, if ever, but it had very little debate, considering the complexity and the overarching importance of it. Basically it involves a legislative review, which is still going on. That means that all legislation—state, federal and local—is being reviewed to see whether it is anti-competitive. That includes whether or not a child-care facility is anti-competitive because there might be rules that say that it should not be near a toxic waste dump—that kind of thing. The only legislation and services—state, federal and local—that are not being reviewed are those which have been exempted by legislation.</para></talk.start><para>We have seen no exemption legislation in this chamber. That means that all federal, state and local government laws and regulations are subject, at this stage, to competition policy. It is no good the Labor Party coming in and saying, `We didn't intend for it to be applicable to everything.' That is the reality; we have seen no exemption legislation.</para><para>I have had arguments about what is exempt and what is not with the Treasury in Western Australia which, as with most states, is responsible for oversight of national competi 
 tion policy in its state, and it said, `You shouldn't cite examples where local and regional areas are being hard-hit by competition policy and assume that it is part of competition policy.' Given that the legislation says that the principles of competition, privatisation and so on should apply to all government services, it is hard for anyone to logically argue that those processes, whether or not they are being forced or whether they are occurring voluntarily with governments at a state or local or federal level, are not part of competition policy.</para><para>It is hard to argue what was and what was not intended. The Greens (WA) said very strongly in 1995 that the setting up of the legislative review under the National Competition Council, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as the watchdog, was such an amorphous system—it was so large, so comprehensive, so overwhelming—that we did not believe that it was set up properly. We did not believe that thought went into it. It was rushed through by Paul Keating before he lost government, and nobody knew how it would operate or whether it would have the proper checks and balances.</para><para>It probably does not help to be right this far down the track. It is a relief to know that the ALP is now looking at reviewing the legislation to see what the impacts are or are likely to be. It is an ongoing process. It has not happened in the past—it is a process that is happening, like a big boulder that is coming down a hill and gathering moss as it is going. For instance, there has been a lot of mention of public interest, and that is no great help when you look at such things as the public interest under environment. The exemptions are that the competition policy must abide by government policies on environment. If government policies on environment are market oriented and they do not look after the environment, then competition policy per se is not obliged to look after interests of environmental sustainability.</para><para>Specifically, we have been asked to deal with the issue of energy. It is a very important issue because, quite frankly, it has been argued that the way competition policy in the 
 competitive market for electricity has been set up is incompatible, or can be used as an excuse to be incompatible, with reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</para><para>I would like to quote briefly from a paper from <inline font-style="italic">Ecological Economics</inline> by Mark Diesendorf. It says:</para><para>In order to allow efficient energy use to compete on an equal basis with electricity supply, it is necessary to create a market for energy services, not electricity, at the retail level. To do this requires institutional changes. Correct pricing is not sufficient.</para><para>There are many arguments in relation to the models that have been set up that prove that we should not go down the path of greenhouse gas reductions, and that includes the fact that the megabare and the gigabare models neglect the fact that `no regrets' policies are possible. They may require people to take a longer term approach.</para><para>Sometimes these bring back their expenditure or their investment in three years, but these are not the kinds of approaches that governments are making because they are not taking innovative approaches. They are leaving things to the market, and the market may not have it in their interest to reduce production of greenhouse gases, and the market certainly may not have it in their interest to reduce the use of fossil fuels. So we are left with a situation where the market, as it is, is dictating and governments are not prepared to make those institutional changes which may signal the real changes we need to go into the future, and that is the problem. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>4431</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The proposition put by Senator Stott Despoja in this matter of public importance is that competition policy has failed to deliver better outcomes for consumers in energy markets and that this, in part, is because of the enthusiasm of the South Australian and New South Wales governments to use competition policy as an excuse to privatise essential public assets like power stations. In responding to this proposition, let me first say that reform of the structure and regulation of the electricity supply industry aims to promote a more competitive industry, 
 delivering lower electricity costs as well as a more efficient and sustainable use of capital and energy resources to improve Australia's domestic and international economic competitiveness and performance. The benefits of a deregulated, interconnected, competitive national electricity market are real for every Australian. Economy wide, these benefits have been estimated at approximately $5 billion per annum. That represents benefits of more than $1,100 per year for the average Australian family, and that is not to be ignored.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Stott Despoja in her address, and more recently Senator Margetts, raised the issue of environmental matters. There are clear environmental benefits in these proposals. The reforms create opportunities for access for new technologies and competitive alternative energy sources. Environmental benefits also result from more efficient and cost-effective energy utilisation and investment decisions. This exemplifies the Democrats' hypocrisy in putting up this matter of public importance today. The Democrats are continually urging us with regard to environmental care and sustainability, and are also always encouraging support for environmentally beneficial technology. The electricity reforms of the government and, indeed, of competition policy do exactly that: they encourage that alternative source of energy and the use of new environmentally sensitive technologies, yet the Democrats want to oppose these initiatives.</para><para> The benefits for the environment are made clear in the statement made by the Prime Minister on climate change in November last year when he outlined the government's intention to accelerate the uptake of renewable energy in grid based power applications and to establish a firm market base for renewable supplies. The latter initiative on renewable energy goes well beyond the contribution to greenhouse gas reduction targets that the Australian government has set itself and recognises the central role of renewable energy. Again, the environmental benefits of competition policy with regard to the national power grid and electricity generation industry are clear for all to see.</para><para>Most importantly, of course, there are benefits for the customers requiring electricity. The first benefit for customers of stimulating the emergence of an energy services industry and taking advantage of competition between energy sources is that it will provide customers with options of energy-efficient products to meet their demands. Another benefit is the giving to consumers of maximum choice of supplier, including the options I have already mentioned of environmentally friendly or green power. Again, the Democrats should note this in particular. Benefits for customers also include forcing the establishment of new, more efficient technologies by suppliers who will be competing for customers. 	There will be direct benefits as retail customers, currently paying fixed or regulated prices, increasingly have the option of using alternative suppliers coming into the market to provide them with supply options. At present only larger customers benefit from those options, but these wholesale customers have been able to negotiate contracts with suppliers for electricity supply that are significantly below pre-competitive market prices. From this July, about 50 per cent of electricity users will have a choice of supplier and by 2001 all customers in the national energy market will have this choice of supplier, so that will drive down the cost of electricity to all consumers.</para><para>The Democrats also claim, as indicated in their MPI, that these market reforms are being used as an excuse for the privatisation programs of the states, and they particularly refer to New South Wales and South Australia. In fact, privatisation is not a requirement for market reforms. The national market reforms concern separation of generation transmission and distribution, and the introduction of a competitive electricity market. Furthermore, market reforms are also occurring in the gas industry, which is a privately owned industry already. This simply reinforces the point that it is absolute nonsense to link competition and the development of the national electricity market with privatisation.</para><para>The issue of who owns the energy market assets is quite separate from the issue of the introduction of competition. Privatisation is 
 desirable, because there are risks involved in operating electricity assets in a competitive market. Private sector investors are in a much better position to evaluate those risks than are governments. This has been made clear in the current debate in South Australia on the proposed privatisation of ETSA and Optima. Formerly in South Australia there was a predictable $200 million-plus dividend which the ETSA corporation earned for the South Australian government. But that dividend will become quite unstable, particularly as significant upgrading of the South Australian electricity generator technology—at expense to the taxpayer—would be required to maintain that dividend. It will also be placed in jeopardy because ETSA and Optima will no longer enjoy their monopoly share of the market. They will face competition from interstate private generators—potentially much more efficient private generators—coming into the South Australian market.</para><para>Senator Stott Despoja mentioned the issue of debt in relation to the privatisation of ETSA, and that is important. It is important to retire South Australia's debt. Of course, it was as a result of our experience with another government instrumentality operating in a competitive commercial market—the State Bank—that was the source of that massive $7.2 billion debt that currently hinders South Australia. Five billion dollars from the sale of ETSA and Optima will substantially reduce that debt, reducing our current $2 million a day interest payments to about $½ million and freeing up about $660 million each and every year in South Australia's state government budget. Senator Stott Despoja said the debt is not important, but the structure of our debt is quite different now from what it was in the past. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>4433</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We are debating the national competition policy in relation to the electricity industry with particular reference to South Australia and New South Wales. By way of background, the national competition policy emerged from a report known as the Hilmer report that was published in August 1993. A reform process was agreed on by the then Labor Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the 
 premiers in April 1995. There was a system of payments that were to be made available for following the process that was agreed upon.</para></talk.start><para>There are two main principles behind national competition policy. There was a recognition that there were many inefficient aspects of the economy that were preventing our Australian economy from functioning to its full potential. Senator Cook has referred to the fact that electricity is a very major component of costs to industry, particularly if we wish to value add a significant proportion of the resources, such as mining, in this country.</para><para>Most particularly, governments argue that our manufacturing industry has been facing stiff competition from imports. Therefore, national competition policy is meant to put similar pressure on other sectors of the economy, particularly government owned business enterprises, to lift their performance. The second major principle, and one that is often overlooked in the current debate, is that consumers, not just business consumers but consumers generally, should benefit from a more efficient economy via lower prices.</para><para>There is a process that has been established. Because of time, I will not go into that in great detail. But there is an important underlying philosophy, and it is important to recognise some of the limits of that philosophy of competition. If we are to maximise competitive markets, it is dependent upon a number of important preconditions. That will include the absence of any player in the market with market power, such as a monopoly or an oligopoly situation, and also the existence of perfect information. These assumptions often do not reflect the real world in which we live.</para><para>Competition policy has been subject to a range of criticisms, and I will come to them briefly shortly. It is important that we do have efficient allocation of resources not just in a narrow economic sense. For example, in the context of energy, it is important that valuable—and they are valuable and scarce—economic resources such as coal and water are not wasted. That is also very important environmentally. So it is not just in a narrow 
 economic context that the debate should be approached from.</para><para>In the electricity industry, there is a background of cross-subsidies in the delivery of the product. That occurs at a number of levels. It occurs from one generation to another generation of Australians via the debt that is transferred. It occurs from rich to poor communities and from larger population centres to smaller rural and regional centres. Frankly, that is as it should be. That public benefit, or, if you like, the community service obligation, should continue to exist.</para><para>In the context of social policy, it is important to ensure that, as a fundamental right in this country, everyone has connection to the power system at a reasonable cost, particularly in rural and regional areas of Australia. There is also another significant human element, and I refer to the work force in the electricity area itself. It is important that the wages and conditions provide a decent living for employees not only within society generally but also within the electricity industry. It is important to ensure that those workers are protected and that there is a reasonable balance of power in the negotiating process between employees and employers.</para><para>There are a number of components of the reform process. One is commercialisation. The reforms are aimed at making the commercial objectives of the enterprise paramount. Another is corporatisation. There is the creation of a legal structure of an enterprise which functions legally separately and returns to the government, if the government is the shareholder, a return on capital. In relation to privatisation, the transfer of ownership of the enterprise from the government to the private sector may occur, and I stress the word `may'. I would stress that national competition policy does not necessarily mean privatisation. You can have an efficient public utility or public utilities competing against each other against efficient private companies. Indeed, the approach of privatisation under the competition policy umbrella is often used as an excuse to privatise assets. I will come to that a little later.</para><para>It is an appropriate time for us to look at the public benefits from competition policy. 
 We are some years down the track in the development of competition policy. Some areas of competition policy do need review. Certainly, the community needs to be much more included in the competition policy process. Unfortunately, most people do not hear about a particular measure until it has been decided at government or bureaucratic level. Much more effort is needed to convince the community of the benefits of the process. In some areas there has been undue haste in the process. It may be better to slow the process slightly to ensure community support for the process in general as well as for individual aspects of the process. It should certainly be more transparent.</para><para>As I referred to earlier, there are a number of government decisions in relation to competition policy being used as an excuse. My attention has been drawn to the fact that the Liberal government in the ACT used competition policy to break a promise to build a suburban swimming pool. The South Australian government has also used competition policy as an excuse to deregulate Sunday shopping in suburban Adelaide.</para><para>There has also been reference to casinos. I note Premier Kennett in Victoria alluding to the fact that the implications of competition policy mean that, in that state, you either have zero casinos or two or more to meet national competition requirements. That is just not correct. There has been an extensive debate in the dairy industry and in respect of Australia Post, Sunday shopping, chemists and newsagents. I believe there is a substantial argument, on balance, in the sectors that I have mentioned that the public good outweighs the need for competition policy to apply.</para><para>Turning to the electricity industry very briefly, I note that the South Australian Premier, Mr Olsen, has justified the breaking of his election promise not to privatise the state's electricity industry by saying that if he did not privatise it he would lose millions of dollars in competition policy money from Canberra. That is not correct. He is using it as an excuse in order to sell off the South Australian electricity assets as a monopoly to obtain a monopoly benefit.</para><para>In New South Wales and Victoria, the electricity industry has undergone considerable change. There are important aspects in the transition towards a national electricity market. There are significant economic gains to be made from a national grid that at least incorporates South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. There is a question mark over Tasmania because the possible increase in return from its electricity corporation may not outweigh the cost of the grid connection, which is some $300 million. It is important to allow electricity suppliers to make whatever deal they can with their consumers, not just business consumers but consumers more broadly in the community, the household sector in particular.</para><para>In the last two years, a fully regulated government sector has been subject to competitive arrangements. Large industry customers have been able to choose their electricity retailer based on price and quality criteria. In Victoria and New South Wales there are 25 electricity retailers competing at the moment for about 5,500 customers in those two states. There has been the separation of generation, transmission and distribution with the creation of a large number of retailers. Many are privately owned. As I said earlier in this debate, that does not necessarily have to occur. You do not have to privatise assets as a result of competition policy.</para><para>I note also in respect of the South Australian government that they have reversed in principle support given last December for a $110 million plan to link its electricity grid with that of New South Wales. Why? Because the South Australian government wants to maximise the return from the proposed sale of its generating business, Optima Energy. But the consequences of this action of the South Australian government have been to short-change local consumers by preventing the importation into South Australia of cheaper New South Wales electricity.</para><para>We have an appalling waste in respect of the export capacity of the proposed Westlink connection to the New South Wales grid. It will provide an important capacity for the importation of power from New South Wales, which has a vast overcapacity in its electricity 
 generation. Queensland apparently refuses to accept the importation of power, to the detriment of its consumers.

Just briefly, the importance of this is that if you have a generating system that is isolated in a state like New South Wales you have to overbuild your capacity by about 25 per cent just to have the backup in case of failure of systems and excess demand. The great advantage of a national grid market is that you can do this balancing across all states, and you do not have to build excessive numbers of power stations, which I would have thought the Greens (WA) and the Democrats would welcome.</para></talk.start><para>New South Wales was initially, under the Greiner-Fahey government, moving in a very progressive direction in this area. The corporatisation and the split-up of the units of the old New South Wales Electricity Commission have proceeded apace, and we now have three competing generating units. The next step to ensure that we have competition with the other states is to privatise these units. This is a policy that is enthusiastically endorsed by the New South Wales coalition opposition. That is what they are going to do as soon as they get into power.</para><para>Ironically enough, it is also supported by Premier Bob Carr and his Treasurer, Michael Egan, but they have been blocked and stymied on bringing about true competition in this market by the trade unions, which will not let the Premier do what he wants. The unions are actually blocking the privatisation of the power assets in New South Wales, even though this would lead to greater accountability and efficiency. The New South Wales Auditor-General, Tony Harris, has said that the government's current ownership of 
 the electricity assets is `an unsustainable model'. Because privatisation is being blocked by unions, it is likely to carry on this way.</para><para>To give you an example of one of the problems this creates, the power provided to this parliament, and all the power in Canberra that used to come from New South Wales, under the increasingly competitive market now comes from the La Trobe Valley. So New South Wales has already lost jobs because the ALP government in New South Wales is dragging the chain. Mr Harris himself questioned the capacity of corporatised agencies to cope with rapid change brought about by competition reforms. If we do not move on to the next step of privatisation, New South Wales will continue to lose market share and jobs to the more progressive Liberal state government in Victoria. In addition, the longer the Carr government puts off the privatisation of these assets, the less likely it is to get the estimated price of $25 billion. That money will remove a lot of the debt that has been built up in New South Wales and enable New South Wales to return to schools, roads and hospitals the services they desperately need.</para><para>Energy Australia's own chief executive in New South Wales recognises the need for privatisation. In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 12 June, Paul Broad called `on the New South Wales government to privatise the state's electricity industry because it was losing value relative to its private sector Victorian competitors'. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 2 June said:</para><para>. . . the longer the industry unions and ALP members, therefore, resist the Carr Government's efforts to privatise the NSW Government-owned generators the worse the final deal for the unions—and NSW—will become.</para><para>Obviously, privatisation, like competition, will deliver benefits to New South Wales. Yet, according to former ALP federal secretary Bob Hogg in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>  on 27 May this year, this sale, which means so much for New South Wales, is being blocked, interestingly enough in his view, because of federal Labor's opposition to the Telstra sale. Referring to the sale, Mr Hogg said:</para><para>It would make it very difficult for the Federal Leader of the Opposition to explain away the 
 contradictory signals to the electorate—that it was alright to sell electricity but not telephony.</para><para>However, he made it clear that after the federal election the New South Wales government might have a clearer path for privatisation. So the ALP is stopping the people of New South Wales from benefiting from privatisation, for political reasons. The Democrats are also trying to deny these benefits to the Australian people. Any delay to the government in enacting legislation that would enable competition to proceed in energy markets reduces the pace at which these benefits can be passed on to consumers.</para><para>The coalition are not the only group or party to support this sort of energy reform. Since 1991 the Council of Australian Governments has recognised the need to deliver on the substantial benefits that major reforms of the structure and regulation of electricity and gas sectors can achieve. This reform is bipartisan and supported by the state governments.</para><para>Reform will see a progressive introduction of a national electricity market. It is aimed to be in place by 2002. The benefits of a deregulated, interconnected and competitive national electricity market are substantial—not only in financial terms but also in terms of the environment, something which the Democrats should consider.

The Attorney-General and senior departmental officers regarded the ALRC proposal to participate in the inquiry as being beyond its functions and powers. Although the President of the ALRC contested this interpretation of the ALRC's functions and powers, he decided to withdraw from further participation in the inquiry. It appears that no-one involved in the decision to withdraw from proceedings took account of the nature of the inquiry and the possible parliamentary privilege implications.</para><para>Consequently, the committee has found that no contempt has been committed by either the Attorney-General or any of the senior officers of his department in seeking to persuade the President of the ALRC to withdraw from the proceedings of the native title committee. 
 More detailed reasons for its findings are set out in the report, particularly in paragraphs 2.26 to 2.31.</para><para>Given the incompatible interpretations of the ALRC's statutory functions, which was so much in evidence during the inquiry, the committee has recommended that this question be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.</para><para>The committee also reminds senior officers of the Public Service and statutory authorities of their responsibilities to parliament, and recommends that an earlier resolution on this matter be reaffirmed by the Senate.

Also, on behalf of the committee, I present a statement on the scrutiny of Great Barrier Reef zoning plans, and I seek leave to incorporate the statements in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statements read as follows</inline>—</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Statement on provisions in legislative instruments which may have been more appropriate for inclusion in an Act</inline></para><para>The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances scrutinises all disallowable legislative instruments to ensure compliance with personal rights and parliamentary propriety. An important aspect of parliamentary propriety, and one recognised by standing order 23, which establishes the terms of reference of the Committee, is that legislative instruments should not contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment. The Committee raises this issue less often than its other principles, but it is a fundamental part of Committee scrutiny.</para><para>During the present Autumn sittings the Committee has considered two cases where legislative instruments provided for material which may have been more suitable for inclusion in a Bill, which is subject to all the rigours of parliamentary passage. 
</para><para>Four sets of amendments of the Therapeutic Good Regulations, Statutory Rules 1997 Nos 398-401, were all made on the same day. The Committee scrutinised these in the usual way and found numbers of defects. These included fees of up to $5,600, the basis of which was not explained; absence of a time limit within which a public official must make a decision; unclear drafting; strict liability offences; unfair provisions affecting business operators; and duplication in making the four sets of regulations on the same day. The Committee had considerable and detailed correspondence with the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the regulations and obtained explanations and a number of undertakings in relation to these problems, including an undertaking to amend before the end of this financial year.</para><para>This statement, however, will describe our correspondence about another possible deficiency raised by the Committee, which was that the amendments, or at least some of them, may have been more appropriate to be addressed through an amendment of the enabling Act, where the changes would be subject to full parliamentary debate. One reason for the Committee's concern was the number and intensity of representations which Senators were receiving about one set of regulations in particular, the sole purpose of which was to prohibit the advertising of natural remedies as "drug free".</para><para>The Committee wrote to the Parliamentary Secretary, who replied that this set of amendments had been intentionally separated out from the pre-existing provisions but that it would not be appropriate to amend the enabling Act because these are amendments of existing regulations.</para><para>The Committee replied to the Parliamentary Secretary suggesting that, with great respect, the Committee did not share her view. For the purpose of the Committee's terms of reference it is irrelevant whether the regulations are principal or amending regulations. The Committee's mandate to ensure that legislative instruments do not contain matter more appropriate for an Act is an important safeguard for parliamentary propriety and one which the Committee is vigilant to enforce. The Committee pointed out that its very first Report in 1932 dealt with this aspect of its terms of reference and the Committee has received undertakings since that date from Ministers to include matters, initially included in legislative instruments, in Acts. These included amending instruments. The Committee further advised that the subject matter in the present regulations was contentious and the subject of considerable public disquiet. The Committee noted the advice of the Parliamentary Secretary that she had established a committee of review to examine the issues in this regulation and would table the results of the review in Parliament. The Committee would, however, appreciate advice that 
 following this review the material in the regulation would be included in an Act. The Committee concluded its letter by advising that its actions in relation to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations, like its actions in respect of all legislative instruments, are directed to protect personal rights and parliamentary propriety. The Committee did not deal with policy and did not have a view on the policy aspects of the regulations. It aim was to protect the rights of Parliament.</para><para>The Senate disallowed Statutory Rules 1997 No.401 on 31 March 1998 on policy grounds.</para><para>The second case presented a somewhat different problem in relation to material included in a legislative instrument which may have been more appropriate for inclusion in an Act. The Public Service Regulations (Amendment-Interim Reforms), Statutory Rules 1998 No.23, made on 18 February 1998, provided for important matters affecting the Australian Public Service at a time when far-reaching reforms for the APS had already been put into legislative form, in the Public Service Bill 1997. That Bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 26 June 1997 and , after being passed in the Senate with amendments, was introduced into the House of Representatives again on 5 March 1998. The Committee wrote to the Minister suggesting that it may be appropriate for the Regulations to be delayed until the fate of the Bill has been determined and for the Bill alone to deal with some of the matters also included in the Regulations.</para><para>As an aside, to illustrate the breadth of matters which the Committee addresses, the Committee also wrote to the Minister about two other aspects of the Regulations. One regulation provided that the Public Service Commissioner must report to the Minister on the state of the service and that the Minister must present that report to the Parliament. There was, however, no provision specifying the time within which the Minister must present the report after it has been received. The Committee suggested that the Minister should be required to do this within seven sitting days of receipt. The Minister advised the Committee that the Regulations would be amended to include this requirement. Also, the Committee asked about apparent delay in bringing the regulations up to date, with some provisions obsolete for more than a decade. The Minister advised that the delay was unfortunate and should not occur again.</para><para>In relation to including the material in the Bill the Minister advised that he agreed with the Committee that the preferable course would have been to include in the Act the substantive parts of the Regulations in relation to APS values, the Code of Conduct, public interest whistleblowing, the state of the service report and mobility arrangements. However, the House of Representatives had now 
 rejected the Senate amendments and resolved that the Bill be laid aside. The Minister advised that, in the absence of the Bill, it was essential that these important issues are dealt with, to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and ethics of the APS.</para><para>The Committee accepted this advice, but in the meantime, in order to protect its options, had given a notice of disallowance of the regulations. The Public Service and Merit Protection Commission, which administers the Regulations, then issued a circular to all Departments and agencies in the APS, advising that the notice had been given and of its effect. After the Committee withdrew the notice the PSMPC sent out a further circular. The Committee congratulates the Public Service Commissioner on this appropriate action, which represents an understanding of the role of the Committee and a commitment to parliamentary propriety.</para><para>The Committee is grateful for the cooperation which it has received in its scrutiny in these two cases from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, the Hon Trish Worth MP, and from the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, the Hon David Kemp MP.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Scrutiny of Great Barrier Reef Zoning Plans</inline></para><para>In its scrutiny of legislative instruments to ensure that they comply with personal rights and parliamentary propriety the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances looks carefully at any instruments which may not be legally valid. Every year the Committee finds instances of such instruments, including those which are void because they purport to subdelegate legislative power. Generally any such subdelegation must be expressly authorised by the enabling Act. Invalidity on this ground is now particularly important because of the provisions of the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996, which will subject a broader range of legislative instruments to the safeguards of parliamentary control. This statement will report to the Senate on its scrutiny of a group of legislative instruments which illustrate problems in these areas and which are of continuing concern.</para><para>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority made three Zoning Plan Amendments on 23 September 1996, each of which subdelegated back to itself the power to control entry into areas of the Park and activities conducted there. These powers were broad and if legislative in nature appeared to be void unless expressly authorised by the enabling Act. Also, they purported to deal with the conservation of the Great Barrier Reef, which the Committee regards as an important issue, by the use of instruments which will not even be tabled in Parliament, much less be subject to disallowance.</para><para>The Committee wrote to the Minister for advice about the validity of the Amendments and received 
 an extremely brief reply which merely stated that the Attorney-General's Department (AGD) had assured the Minister that the subdelegations were administrative in nature and not legislative. The Committee wrote back to the Minister asking for a copy of the opinion, which the Minister duly provided. The opinion, from the Office of Legislative Drafting (OLD) of the AGD, confirmed that if the powers were legislative then they "certainly" should be provided for in the Zoning Plans themselves and thus be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and possible disallowance. However, according to the OLD opinion, they were administrative, because on an analysis of the circumstances they only apply the law in particular cases.</para><para>The Committee was somewhat startled by this opinion, which on its analysis of the circumstances appeared to fly in the face of everything which the Committee understood about the difference between legislative and administrative powers. In any event, the Committee wrote back to the Minister advising that if the power was administrative then it should be subject to AAT review and asking for confirmation that this would be done and that the existence of AAT review would be fully publicised to all persons affected. The Committee also asked for advice on the number of times the powers had been exercised and of the nature of the exercise.</para><para>The Minister replied to the Committee's letter to the effect that AAT review of these putative administrative decisions would not be provided, giving reasons for this which were, in the Committee's view, inadequate. The Committee wrote back to the Minister, advising that the view of the Committee was that the powers were legislative or, if they were not, then they should be subject to AAT review as set out in the Guidelines of the Administrative Review Council (ARC). The Committee, after studying the actual powers exercised, which banned or permitted fishing in particular areas for up to five years, also asked the Minister for advice that the Office of General Counsel of the AGD supported the view of OLD that the powers were not legislative.</para><para>The Minister's reply attached an opinion from the Office of General Counsel that, at least in terms of the ARC guidelines, the powers were "clearly" of a legislative nature, "obviously" not directed towards the circumstances of particular persons, but applying generally to the community. They were in "sharp contrast" to decisions which would normally be directional as administrative. This opinion did not refer to the earlier opinion from OLD.</para><para>The Committee wrote back to the Minister advising that it accepted this opinion from the Office of the General Counsel. The result of the opinion was that the subdelegations of power appear to be void, with the powers exercised under them void and all actions in reliance on the powers also void. The 
 view of the Committee was therefore that the amendments of the Zoning Plans should be remade as soon as possible. This would not redress the invalidity of the past 14 months but would at last ensure that future management of the Great Barrier Reef is on a valid basis. The Committee concluded by advising the Minister that the present position is that his own legal advice was that the Amendments are void or, on the best possible interpretation of his view, in breach of ARC guidelines. The Committee emphasised that action should be taken as soon as possible to correct this unsatisfactory position.</para><para>The Minister replied with another opinion from the Office of General Counsel that the powers were legislative but would be likely to survive a court challenge to their validity on the ground of subdelegation. This opinion did not mention either the first opinion from OLD or the previous advice from the General Counsel.</para><para>The Committee wrote back to the Minister noting that his own unambiguous legal advice was that the subdelegations were legislative for the purposes of the ARC guidelines and that under the guidelines they should therefore be subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament. The Committee asked the Minister if he would confirm that this was the case. The Committee also asked the Minister for advice that he was taking steps as a matter of priority to ensure that the powers are subject to parliamentary scrutiny, suggesting that the present position was unacceptable not only from the position of the ARC guidelines, but also from principles of sound public administration and parliamentary propriety.</para><para>The Minister's reply was to the effect that the powers were of a legislative nature, but that he did not intend to make them subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The Minister suggested that we conclude our correspondence.</para><para>The Committee now reports to the Senate on what it regards as the present unsatisfactory position, in which legislative instruments affecting important areas of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park for periods of up to five years are probably void and in any event are not subject to tabling or disallowance. The Committee was also disturbed by the various opinions from the AGD in its scrutiny of these instruments. In summary, one opinion from OLD advised that the powers should "certainly" be included in the disallowable Zoning Plans if they were legislative but in fact they were administrative. The next opinion, this time from the Office of General Counsel, advised that the powers were "clearly" legislative, at least for the purposes of the ARC guidelines. The third opinion, also from the Office of General Counsel, advised that the powers were legislative but valid. 
</para><para>The Committee notes that discussion of contemporary legal issues includes the concept of "jurisdiction shopping". It appears that within the AGD that jurisdiction shopping is a definite option.</para><para>There is another disturbing aspect of this matter. This is that the opinion from OLD advised that it was in accordance with advice being purposed in relation to the Legislative Instruments Bill 1996. Presumably this advice is that the powers are not legislative for the purposes of that Bill, which provides that the Attorney-General may issue conclusive certificates that an instrument is or is not legislative. These certificates may only be challenged on the grounds of procedural validity, not on their merits, and even that must be done by a Federal Court action which the Committee understands would cost a lot of money. If this is the case then that advice from OLD would have to be withdrawn in the light of the opinions from the Office of General Counsel that the powers in question are legislative and fresh advice given that the powers are legislative for the purposes of the Bill. The Committee will pursue this with the Attorney-General and if necessary report again to the Senate.</para><para>The Committee is grateful for the cooperation which it has received in it scrutiny of these instruments from the Minister for the Environment, Senator the Hon Robert Hill.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Works Committee</title><page.no>4441</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Reports</title><page.no>4441</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>4441</page.no><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator HEFFERNAN</name><name.id>C16</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Calvert and the Joint Committee on Public Works, I present the following reports: No. 3 of 1998—East Coast Armament Complex, Point Wilson, Victoria; No. 4 of 1998—Development of the Eastern Region Operations Centre at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales; and No. 5 of 1998—Redevelopment of facilities at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland.

</para><para>The extent of the proposal involves explosive and non-explosive storehouses, a transit facility, container parking and truck holding bays, an administration centre, a workshop security checkpoint, an isolation facility, engineering services and civil works.</para><para>In addition, the existing jetty, which is nearly two kilometres long, and wharf amenities are proposed for refurbishment.</para><para>When referred to the Committee, the estimated out turn cost of the proposal was $72.27 million.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that the proposal not proceed as proposed.</para><para>The report traces the history of this proposal, which has its origins in the need to close, what Defence have called, the Sydney Ammunition Pipeline. This involves transporting ordnance by truck and by barge from the ordnance storage facilities in western Sydney to the fleet base at Garden Island.</para><para>At present, the importation of explosive ordnance takes place through Point Wilson.</para><para>It was submitted that Point Wilson was the only site that could provide both a deammunitioning facility and a 1000 tonne Net Explosives Quantity container import facility.</para><para>In terms of the Navy's operational requirements the Committee found that Point Wilson is highly unsatisfactory due to:</para><para>.	 the distance from the Fleet Base in Sydney Harbour and the Navy's exercise area off Jervis Bay;</para><para>.	 the depth of water available for its largest ship, which would not allow berthing when fully loaded; and</para><para>.	 the lengthy road journey to Kingswood and return to allow for servicing of the unloaded weaponry.</para><para>The Committee also found that berthing facilities at Point Wilson require extensive upgrading to provide a long term loading and unloading capability for the importation of explosive ordnance and the ammunitioning and deammunitioning of Naval vessels.</para><para>These disadvantages were considered acceptable to the Department of Defence on the understanding that no suitable 1000 tonne Net Explosive Quantity facility existed elsewhere.</para><para>Inquiries by the Committee have established that such a licensed facility, Port Alma in Queensland, exists.</para><para>In fact, most consignments of Defence ordnance, transported on specialised chartered container ships, berth at Port Alma before proceeding to Point Wilson. Port Alma is fully licensed for a 1500 tonne Net Explosive Quantity. 
</para><para>The Committee recognises that Port Alma would impose an additional distance for land transportation.</para><para>However, this is offset by reduced sea transport and the fact that very small quantities of containers, approximately 100 per annum, are involved.</para><para>A slight increase in freight costs easily outweighs the $24.757 million required to upgrade Point Wilson to provide a long term import facility.</para><para>Based on these factors, once the need for a dual facility is discounted and because the Navy requirement for deammunitioning is approximately 30 tonnes Net Explosive Quantity, the Committee concluded that numerous deep water facilities closer to Sydney capable of meeting this criterion are available and should be investigated.</para><para>One such location is Twofold Bay, which offers excellent low cost or free land for on-shore facilities and buffer zones both for the current proposal and for future expansion.</para><para>The Committee has therefore recommended that the Department of Defence should re-examine the works in this reference and undertake further investigations into alternatives covered in the report with a view to referring a revised proposal for an armament complex to the Committee at a later date.</para><para>The second report which I have tabled involves the proposed development of the Eastern Region Operations Centre at RAAF Base Williamtown, NSW.</para><para>In brief, this involves proposal the construction of a new facility at RAAF Base Williamtown to enable the No 41 Wing Headquarters and Number 3 Control and Reporting Unit to be collocated and integrated</para><para>When referred to the Committee, the estimated out turn cost of the proposal was $18 million.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that this proposal should proceed.</para><para>The Committee has concluded that there is a need to provide facilities for No 41 Wing and its subordinate units to improve their operational effectiveness.</para><para>A purpose-designed Sector Operations Centre at RAAF Base Williamtown would be available to backup the one in Northern Australia, in keeping with the accepted concept of a layered air defence system.</para><para>Construction of a new facility would ensure compatibility with new equipment being acquired and the new facility would be purpose-built to suit contemporary operational needs. 
</para><para>The remaining conclusions address savings which would stem from the proposal in addition to enhanced operational effectiveness.</para><para>The report also recommends the need for urgent Commonwealth, State and local government action to address the question of responsibilities for flood mitigation measures and to combine forces to undertake the necessary measures.</para><para>The third report which I have tabled concerns the proposed redevelopment of facilities at RAAF Base Amberley.</para><para>When referred to the Committee, the estimated out turn cost of the proposed work was $73.7 million.</para><para>The Committee has recommended that the project should proceed as proposed.</para><para>As one of the RAAF's major airbases, RAAF Base Amberley is the home base of the RAAF's Strike Reconnaissance Group and supports a variety of other Air Force units.</para><para>Despite investments in new facilities which have been made over the past three decades, many of the existing Base facilities are over 50 years old.</para><para>Some buildings used for the support of F-111 aircraft are converted buildings constructed during the Second World War.</para><para>An examination of the future direction of the Base undertaken by the Department of Defence, identified deficiencies which adversely affect the ability of the Base to perform its designated roles in a safe and flexible manner.</para><para>The Committee has therefore concluded that a need exists to redevelop or provide new facilities at RAAF Base Amberley to enhance operational, training, aircraft maintenance, logistics, domestic, and ancillary capabilities.</para><para>The scope of the proposed work can be justified as addressing shortcomings in the existing facilities and infrastructure that have contributed to inefficient work practices and reduced productivity levels.</para><para>The new work will contribute to increased compliance with modern health and safety standards.</para><para>A number of heritage buildings are proposed to be demolished to make way for new facilities or because they will no longer be required when the project is completed.</para><para>Arising from concerns expressed by a number of heritage organisations, the Committee has therefore recommended that the Department of Defence should consult further with Heritage Authorities before demolishing these buildings.</para><para>Similarly, because a number of highly toxic substances are used in the maintenance of F-111 aircraft the Committee has recommended that as 
 part of the project, the Department of Defence should undertake a detailed study of liquid trade waste generation, its storage, treatment and disposal to eliminate any risks of toxic substances entering waterways adjacent to the Base or entering the watertable.</para><para>I commend the reports to the Senate.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator HEFFERNAN</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title><page.no>4443</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>4443</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>4443</page.no><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator HEFFERNAN</name><name.id>C16</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present report No. 362 entitled <inline font-style="italic">General and Specific Purpose Payments to States</inline> , and I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator HEFFERNAN</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para><para>I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows</inline>—</para><para>Madam President, the Australian States and Territories are dependent on funding from the Commonwealth for a significant proportion of their expenditure.</para><para>The financial assistance provided by the Commonwealth to State and local governments is a substantial component of both the outlays of the Commonwealth and the revenues of the other levels of government. It accounted for approximately 20 per cent of the total outlays of the Commonwealth general government sector in 1996-97. It also represented approximately 37 per cent of the total revenues of the State general government sector and 19 per cent of that of the local general government sector.</para><para>Madam President, all Commonwealth payments to the States and Territories are made as Specific Purpose Payments or General Purpose Payments. The grants are contingent upon the fulfilment of a wide range of terms and conditions.</para><para>The conditions which the Commonwealth usually attaches to the <inline font-style="italic">use</inline>  of SPP funds are generally set out in Commonwealth legislation, in agreements concluded between the parties, or in other program documentation. While conditions are not imposed on the States' <inline font-style="italic">use </inline> of GPPs, some conditions are attached to the <inline font-style="italic">receipt </inline> of those funds. These 
 conditions are set out in States Grants (General Purposes) legislation.</para><para>Madam President, the JCPAA was asked by the Senate to report on conditions which may appropriately be attached to SPPs and GPPs.</para><para>From its examination of SPP program administrative arrangements, the Committee reached a number of conclusions regarding SPP payments and conditions which may appropriately be attached to them. In particular, Madam President, the Committee believes that Commonwealth departments should draw upon the ideal features, which it has set out in this report, in preparing specific conditions to be attached to individual SPPs under their administration.</para><para>For example, Madam President, the Committee believes that for efficient and effective management of SPP programs, it is important that SPP program objectives are specified in terms of clear, achievable and measurable outcomes,  that the roles of the parties to SPP arrangements and their responsibilities for particular program management activities are clearly defined,  and that SPP financial accountability requirements are as streamlined as possible.</para><para>Turning now to General Purpose Payments, Madam President, the Committee examined the four payment conditions which the States are currently required to meet for receipt of GPP funds. The most significant of the four conditions requires the States to comply with obligations relating to the implementation of national competition policy and related industry reforms. The Commonwealth will make payments totalling some $16 billion over nine years to the States if they make satisfactory progress in implementing the reforms.</para><para>The case of national competition payments indicates that conditional GPP funding can advance broader agreed reform agendas under particular circumstances. This suggests to the Committee that there is potential for greater conditional GPP funding in the future, particularly where there is shared Commonwealth and State commitment to regulatory reform;  where there are demonstrable economic or other benefits to the Australian people and the national economy;  and where agreed funding conditions satisfactorily address the particular interests of the Commonwealth and the States.</para><para>Other GPP payment conditions require the States to make payments to the Commonwealth in the form of fiscal contributions and higher education superannuation contributions. The States are also required to make payments for any Commonwealth grants to higher education student organisations as a consequence of State actions preventing or hindering the collection of student organisation fees. Each of these conditions was enacted to deal with special circumstances and is not likely to have 
 more general application to GPP funding in the future.</para><para>The Committee therefore concluded that there is little to be gained from attempting to prescribe a definitive list of specific conditions which might appropriately be applied to hypothetical future conditional GPP funding arrangements. Those conditions would need to be determined for each case.</para><para>Madam President, the report also addresses conditions relating to the role of State Auditors-General. The Committee found that problems have been encountered by State Auditors-General when financial audit and acquittal responsibilities are imposed on them under SPP agreements between the Commonwealth and the States.</para><para>The Committee believes that, in the interests of enhancing the public accountability of Commonwealth and State government agencies for SPP programs, without compromising the statutory independence of State Auditors-General, it is important that responsibilities for the financial certification of SPP payments are not imposed on State Auditors-General. It is also important that opportunities for the conduct of co-ordinated or joint audits of SPP programs by the Commonwealth and State Auditors-General continue to be actively pursued.</para><para>Madam President, the JCPAA was also asked to inquire into `recent developments concerning the Victorian Auditor-General'. Although the Committee found this part of the terms of reference to be imprecise, the Committee has taken it to allude to the review of the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Audit Act 1994</inline>  which was initiated by the Victorian Government in 1996. In the Committee's view, this is a matter which falls within the constitutional jurisdiction of the State of Victoria; the JCPAA's mandate is limited to the Commonwealth sphere.</para><para>Madam President, this Committee, like its predecessor the JCPA, has been very mindful of its duties and responsibilities as set out under its Act. The JCPA, in inquiring into the administration of SPPs in 1994 and 1995, did not comment on the administrative practices of the non-Commonwealth parties to SPP agreements. Accordingly, the JCPAA has not addressed the issue of `recent developments concerning the Victorian Auditor-General' in this report.</para><para>Madam President, this report has drawn attention to the range of conditions attached to general purpose and specific purpose payments, and identified ideal features of these conditions. It has highlighted the significant and special place of Auditors-General in the overall accountability framework for the administration of these payments.  
</para><para>Finally, Madam President, constitutionally the Commonwealth may grant financial assistance to the States and Territories on such terms and conditions as the Parliament sees fit. It is the Parliament which is ultimately both the arbiter of the conditions attached to general and specific purpose payments and the institution to which government agencies are accountable for the administration of those payments.</para><para>In conclusion, I wish to thank the secretariat staff who have assisted in the production of this report:—Gillian Gould, Laura Gillies, and in particular, Russell Lapthorne from the Australian National Audit Office, and the Secretary to the Committee, Margot Kerley.</para><para>Madam President, I commend the Report to the Senate.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">Heffernan, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator HEFFERNAN</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4445</page.no></debateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives agreeing to the amendments made by the Senate to the following bill:</para><para> Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Bill 1998

On that date the Committee tabled an interim report which stated that the subject was a complex one which warranted an extensive review and which sought an extension of time to report. In the course of the inquiry the Committee received 341 submissions and held 14 public hearings and 11 inspections, covering all states of Australia.</para><para>The degree to which individual members of the public accept commercial utilisation of wildlife varies greatly and the submissions sent to the Committee revealed a high degree of disagreement about the ethical desirability of commercial utilisation of wildlife, aside from any impact on the environment, economics or biodiversity. The report that has resulted from this inquiry reflects the complex nature of this subject; it is a comprehensive report covering both issues arising from the commercial use of wildlife, in the first part, and the various wildlife industries in the second part.</para><para>The use of wildlife by people is not new. More recently, however, commercial use of wildlife has come about through the deliberate placement of a value on a species to provide an incentive to preserve that species and indirectly its habitat.</para><para>There is a second reason for increasing interest in commercial use of wildlife in Australia and this is that wildlife industries may offer opportunities to broaden the income-base of rural businesses. Degradation of marginal agricultural land which has resulted in reduced productivity and increased fluctuation in profitability of traditional income sources has led to an upsurge in interest in alternative agriculture enterprises.</para><para>As well as a commercial impetus, there is an ecological reason for this movement: the realisation that the Australian landscape is for the most part better suited to production of indigenous species of plants and animals than exotic species.</para><para>The term `commercial utilisation of wildlife' encompasses a spectrum of activities, ranging from high intensity use such as farming of animals and the manufacture of products from those animals, to low intensity, supportive `management' of wild populations for benign purposes such as ecotourism. 
 There are a number of broad types of commercial utilisation of wildlife, each with its own term: hunting, harvesting, ranching, farming, and nature-based or ecotourism.</para><para>The economic use of Australian native wildlife has been limited in the past by a number of factors including government regulations, lack of entrepreneurs and lack of markets. Thus commercial activities have come about in an <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline>  way, rather than through coordinated or systematic processes. While each state and territory has legislation which controls the keeping and movement of wildlife, the Federal government plays a critical role in the control of exports through its administration of the <inline font-style="italic">Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982</inline> . All state governments and the Federal government support ecologically sustainable commercial utilisation of wildlife in policy and in practice, although they vary in the extent of their support.</para><para>The report discusses the value of wildlife to society and notes that opponents of commercial use of wildlife reject the notion that wildlife should have a financial value placed on it, arguing instead that wildlife has an `intrinsic' value so society should accept responsibility to preserve wildlife on that basis.</para><para>In contrast, proponents of commercial utilisation of wildlife believe that not only can wildlife have a monetary value placed on it, but that it must.</para><para>The Committee also received evidence, however, that while many people believe that attributing a purely intrinsic worth to wildlife or habitat is in itself an argument to preserve it, the practical reality is that in many cases this philosophy has not resulted in its protection, particularly on private lands. The Committee received evidence arguing that it is important for wildlife, and particularly habitat, to have some economic value placed on it, if only to ensure that it can compete on an equal basis with other land uses which already have an economic value and which, by default, are seen to be more important.</para><para>The Committee's report examines in detail the environmental impact of commercial use of wildlife, the economic viability of the various commercial activities and the impact of State and Federal government laws. In terms of the environment, the Committee has concluded that the future of biodiversity conservation in Australia depends in part on finding mechanisms, and particularly financial incentives, for natural habitat to be restored and conserved on private lands. The Committee concludes that, if appropriately managed, commercial utilisation of wildlife could potentially provide one such mechanism. The Committee believes that the concept of replacing traditional farmed animals with native wildlife in marginal agriculture lands has merit and supports 
 the suggestion that experimental trials be conducted.</para><para>In terms of economic factors, the Committee considered the role of market forces on sustainable use of wildlife, the economic benefits that may arise from commercial utilisation of wildlife and the public sector costs incurred. As with any new industry, the economic viability of emerging wildlife industries may be uncertain. However, compared to industries based on inanimate resources or services, economic uncertainty in wildlife industries is exacerbated by two factors: the inherent unreliability of supply; and the fickle nature of demand for wildlife products.</para><para>Because many wildlife industries are relatively new and often supply niche markets, their economic importance to Australia is largely unquantified. However, this information is critical to any assessment of the significance of these industries to regional economies and to the general economy of Australia. The Committee recommends that the Government monitor the environmental, social and economic impacts of commercial utilisation of wildlife so that a balance sheet can be constructed to assess the full impact of wildlife industries on the Australian economy. The Committee also alerts Federal and State Governments to the fact that industries based on commercial utilisation of wildlife have the potential to result in high public sector costs and the consequent need to fully monitor those costs.</para><para>The Committee concludes that the related issues of property rights in wildlife assets and public investment in biodiversity conservation are of considerable importance. The Committee believes that the current and potential role of the private sector in biodiversity conservation is significant, but currently considerably undervalued. The Committee recommends that the Federal Government investigate ways in which private sector investment in biodiversity conservation can be supported and encouraged. The Committee received evidence on the model of sustainable use of wildlife as used in southern Africa, whereby in some areas ownership of wildlife is transferred to local landowners, and recommends that the Government examine the appropriateness of such a model in Australia.</para><para>In examining the adequacy of government regulations on the commercial utilisation of wildlife the Committee found a number of different views. The first view was that presented by animal rights groups and some conservation groups which argued that the current legislation was flawed because it allowed for the exportation of wildlife products and thus failed to adequately protect all native animals.</para><para>The second view, which came primarily from industry groups, was that many statutory requirements were unnecessarily restrictive to their businesses. 
</para><para>Three types of problems were encountered: first, inflexibility in statutory arrangements; second, an overall excess of administrative procedures, compliance with which was costly and time-consuming; and third, inconsistencies between state arrangements, and between state and Federal arrangements leading to a call for a national approach to commercial utilisation of wildlife.</para><para>The Committee is concerned that duplicated and onerous administrative procedures are unnecessarily hindering legitimate industries in Australia and recommends that State and Federal Governments together review all administrative procedures relating to commercial utilisation of wildlife in Australia with a view to increasing their efficiency so as to ensure that there are no unnecessary hindrances to industry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>Third, many conservation groups, scientists and amateur biologists argued that some regulations were counter-productive to the conservation of wildlife and maintenance of biodiversity. The Committee believes that governments should make greater efforts to recognise the contributions made by biologists. The Committee recommends to Federal and State Governments that they review wildlife regulations with a view to facilitating the work of professional and amateur scientists so that they can actively contribute to biodiversity conservation.</para><para>Fourth, animal rights groups and the RSPCA argued that the current system of voluntary codes of practice did not contain sufficient legislative strength and that there was insufficient industry self-regulation to protect the welfare of individual animals subject to commercial use. The Committee is particularly concerned about animal welfare and recommends that some aspects of the system need strengthening.</para><para>Of all matters considered by the Committee, the most controversial was the issue of whether international trade in live fauna should be permitted. Strong arguments were presented by both proponents and opponents of live trade and the debate centred on whether legalising the export of live animals would act to reduce incentives for illegal trade.</para><para>In short, while the Committee appreciates that there could be a threat to biodiversity should trade in live animals result in an increase in illegal activities, the Committee did receive evidence demonstrating a number of benefits which may arise should illegal activities decline as a result of the opening up of legalised trade. In considering the question of whether live exportation of wildlife should be legally available to commercial interests, the Committee notes that prohibition of trade has not prevented smuggling of live animals or eggs overseas and that private enterprise in other count 
 ries has benefited from commercial use of Australian species.</para><para>The Committee believes that the current prohibitionist policy does not work to fully protect wildlife from illegal activities, although the extent to which it does not work is difficult to ascertain. The Committee notes that the Federal Government is currently undertaking a review of all environmental legislation and recommends that the Government include in that review consideration of other policy options for wildlife protection. These range from reversing the onus of proof so that those who keep live wildlife must be certified to do so, to putting more resources into the detection and prosecution of those keeping wildlife illegally, to increasing penalties for illegal activities regarding native wildlife.</para><para>In the second part of the report the Committee considered the various individual wildlife industries. These include: kangaroos, emus, crocodiles, brushtail possums, birds, marine and coastal species, reptiles, amphibians, insects, native plants, essential oils and bushfoods. The Committee also examined zoos and wildlife parks, nature-based tourism and hunting activities. In addition, the Committee looked at indigenous use of wildlife both on a subsistence use basis and on a commercial basis and made a number of recommendations in this area.</para><para>Finally, I wish to refer to an article on the Senate's Wildlife report which was written by a News Limited employee, Gerard McManus, and published in all of Rupert Murdoch's Sunday newspapers—the Sunday Herald-Sun and the Sunday Mail,</para><para>These reports, quoted an unnamed `source' claiming that the Committee would recommend lifting bans on the export of Australian native wildlife.</para><para>The reports were given high prominence and accompanied by pictures of wildlife—in inverted commas—"for sale".</para><para>I contacted the editor of the Sun-Herald, informed him that the reports were factually incorrect and requested a correction.</para><para>I received a letter from the editor, Mr Russell Robinson, which informed me that despite the paper being informed by the Chair of the Wildlife Inquiry that the Committee would not recommend the legalisation of wildlife exports, the paper quote "stood by its story".</para><para>I believe that this sort of irresponsible journalism is absolutely appalling. It is bad enough that the reporter concerned made an error of judgement by quoting a source who did not have the authority to substantiate the claims made and that the reporter did not seek to confirm the claims made. But to refuse to correct such a widely distributed and high profile story is unprofessional, unethical, irresponsible and just plain sloppy journalism. 
</para><para>I inform the Senate that as Chair of this Inquiry that was shamefully misrepresented by Rupert Murdoch's Sunday newspaper, that I will be pursuing the people responsible.</para><para>But I want to use this opportunity to condemn this particular media reporting which brings shame and disrepute on the parliamentary press gallery which has a long standing reputation for ethical and professional political journalism in Australia.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—I particularly want to draw attention to a couple of matters in the report and issues surrounding the report. I want to acknowledge the work of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in conducting this inquiry. It was very controversial and a very difficult inquiry to deal with. We received over 300 submissions. I understand that if we stacked all the submissions on top of one another, including all the extra submissions we received, they would reach over a metre high, which is quite a lot of material to get through.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The secretariat of the committee did an absolutely amazing job in reading those submissions, taking full account of them and incorporating in the report the various opinions which, clearly, came from different ends of the spectrum. It is very important that I compliment and thank the committee secretary, Andrew Snedden, and the author of this report, Pippa Carron, for her work on what is a very far-reaching and comprehensive report. I believe that they have done an absolutely amazing job. I would also like to thank Judith West who did a lot of the hack work associated with this particular report.</para><para>I want to comment on the media attention which has been given to this report, and there was a lot of attention. Let me say, in the first instance, that most of this was highly responsible. Although, on many occasions, the media wanted to know the recommendations, I indicated to them that it was not possible to have those recommendations canvassed until the report was presented and, almost to a person, that was observed. But there were a couple of media reports that I believe were totally irresponsible and I want to refer to those now.</para><para>An article on the Senate's wildlife report, written by a News Ltd employee, Gerard McManus, was published in all of Rupert 
 Murdoch's Sunday newspapers—the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Herald-Sun</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Mail</inline>. These reports quoted an unnamed `source' claiming that the committee would recommend lifting bans on the export of Australian native wildlife. The reports were given high prominence, accompanied by pictures of wildlife which were captioned, in inverted commas, `For sale'.</para><para>I contacted the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Herald-Sun</inline>, informing him that the reports were factually incorrect and requested a correction. I received a letter from the editor, Mr Russell Robinson, which informed me that, despite the paper being informed by the chair of the wildlife inquiry that the committee would not recommend the legislation of wildlife exports, the paper `stood by its story'.</para><para>I believe that this sort of irresponsible journalism is absolutely appalling. It is bad enough that the reporter concerned made an error of judgment by quoting a source who did not have the authority to substantiate the claims made and that the reporter did not seek to confirm the claims made. I might add that that `source' was nobody in the secretariat of the committee. I want to place that on record, in case it could be inferred.</para><para>That the author refused to correct such a widely distributed and high-profile story is unprofessional, unethical, irresponsible and just plain sloppy journalism. I inform the Senate that, as chair of this inquiry which was so shamefully misrepresented by Rupert Murdoch's Sunday newspaper, I will be pursuing the people responsible. But I want to use this opportunity to condemn this particular item of media reporting which brings shame and disrepute on the parliamentary press gallery which has a longstanding reputation for ethical and professional political journalism in Australia.</para><para>I do not want to go over all of the issues which are canvassed in the tabling statement which has been incorporated, but I will underline a few issues. This inquiry took about 18 months. It was referred to the committee for inquiry and report on 26 May 1997. On that date, the committee tabled an interim report which stated that the subject was a complex one which warranted an 
 extensive review and which sought an extension of time to report. In the course of the inquiry, as I said previously, the committee received 341 submissions and held 14 public hearings and 11 inspections, covering all states of Australia, including Tasmania and, I might add, Kangaroo Island in the Great Australian Bight.</para><para>Let me underline that there is an increasing interest in the commercial use of wildlife in Australia and that wildlife industries may offer opportunities to broaden the income base of rural businesses. Degradation of marginal agricultural land, which has resulted in reduced productivity and increased fluctuation in profitability of traditional income sources, has led to an upsurge of interest in alternative agricultural enterprises. Many of these are under way and the committee was surprised to find so many different ways in which wildlife is commercialised in Australia. When one talks about the commercial use of wildlife one thinks immediately, perhaps, of kangaroos or emus; but we discovered that in fact there is a wide variety and very large range of commercial uses for wildlife.</para><para>Let me draw particular attention to the activities of Dr John Walmsley in South Australia and the very interesting work he is doing which undoubtedly has had great benefits in terms of biodiversity, reconstruction of degraded habitat and the recovery of threatened species. The fact is that he has been able to do that as a private citizen and as a commercial enterprise. Through his company, Earth Sanctuaries, he is expanding that work. It is very interesting to see someone who, although a commercial operator, has such a commitment to the environment. Nevertheless, Dr Walmsley is very controversial and is, probably, one of those people who always engenders debate. If anyone wants to see someone who is using the commercial utilisation of wildlife in a way which is enhancing all of the goals we share then, certainly, they should look at what he is doing. Many others are also commercially utilising wildlife in many different ways.</para><para>I commend the whole report to readers so they may be able to get an overview of what is happening and also understand the 
 committee's various recommendations which came out of the evidence we received. As I said, it was a difficult job for the committee because we received evidence from many different perspectives. To try to bring all that together so that it all the evidence was treated equitably was a difficult job, but I believe the author of the report, Dr Carron, actually did achieve that. People may not agree with everthing, but I would say to them that, before they criticise the report, they had better read it because that is the only way they will be able to address seriously the issues raised in the report. All of those who were witnesses to the inquiry and all of those who were involved in the inquiry would certainly agree that this is a serious issue and I believe it is addressed in a serious way by this report.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>4449</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I commend the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for its report on the <inline font-style="italic">Commercial utilisation of Australian native wildlife</inline> . This is a very important report which will be of great interest to the many Australians who are concerned about the welfare of wildlife and native species in this country—not least those who apparently, quite deceptively, have been alarmed by the recent stories in the press that Senator Woodley referred to indicating that this committee was going to, if not open the flood gates, at least open the door to the commercial exploitation of Australia's wildlife through export for money. I for one am very reassured to hear that the committee is not advocating anything of the sort.</para></talk.start><para>We live on a planet which has seen the rapid extinguishment of species. Scientists estimate that, of the 30 million of our fellow species on this planet, some quarter will have gone to extinction in the lifetime of the current generation. Major amongst the factors in that are the loss of forests and the degradation of native vegetation cover. Australia has a record on that which is as abhorrent as the record of many countries elsewhere around the world. I need only cite the loss of 400,000 or 500,000 hectares of native vegetation cover in Queensland per annum under successive Labor and Liberal governments to point to the tragedy of the loss of ecosystems and, there 
 fore, the threat of the loss of species and the sending towards extinction of species which currently might be seen as safe. One only has to look at the performance of the current government—not least the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill—which has expanded woodchipping in native forests in Victoria and Tasmania and no doubt shortly through the regional forest agreement in Western Australia, to be concerned about the rapid loss of wildlife in this wonderful country of ours.</para><para>There are many other invidious threats. The recent import of a fox into Tasmania—which is currently being hunted in the Burnie region—presents a phenomenal threat to the rich diversity of wildlife in Tasmania, including marsupials which have a stronghold in Tasmania. The same species on the mainland have gone to extinction or are close to extinction because of the depredation of foxes on the mainland. We spend far too little of the nation's monetary resources protecting one of the most important parts of our nation's pride and make-up—that is, the wildlife which has been the subject of this report.</para><para>I for one am very concerned about the implications of the commercial utilisation of wildlife. During the proceedings of this committee, we visited an abattoir, if you like, or a processing works in Tasmania which is experimenting in the exportation of brush-tailed possums. The brush-tailed possums are caught in cages and transported in boxes within a day or so to the processing site. There they are stunned with a gun through the forehead. They are skinned and their carcasses are prepared for export to Asia, where they are sold as tree fox or under other appellations and are replacing the near extinct species which are thought to be medicinal, including as an aphrodisiac, for parts of the population in Asia. In other words, their species are extinct or nearly extinct so we set up a wildlife trade in our species, which are nothing like theirs but which will do as a substitute. These species have none of the medicinal properties that were supposed to be in the species hounded to near extinction or extinction in Asia, but we go along with this 
 subterfuge so someone can make money out of it.</para><para>I have been criticised roundly by Cherry Ripe in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> for daring to speak up on this matter, but I intend to continue to do so because it is a matter that many Australians are alarmed about. Are we bequeathing to future generations a world in which the only large species which survive are those which have a price, which have a human use or which can be given over to us as the ultimate predator on this planet? If that is the philosophy—and it seems to be the philosophy at least of this age of economic rationalism—then we as a species are ultimately going to suffer enormously at our own hands due to the spiritual deprivation and deprivation of soul resulting from the loss of wildlife, the diminution of the variety of life and our failure to accept our responsibility to pass on to future generations the wealth of wildlife and the richness this brings to human beings as they search for meaning in their own existences untold years down the line from now.</para><para>So it is a very critical matter. I am pleased that so much has gone into this inquiry. It is, no doubt, not the end of the line. It is not going to stop the loss of species, the exploitation of species or the viewing of species as simply a matter of worth when they have a dollar value attached to them. It is up to all of us as parliamentarians to be part of a vigorous, ongoing debate which has as its aim the saving of the species which we enjoy in Australia and our contribution towards a global effort to rescue from extinction the grand variety of life there is on this planet.</para><para>That is one of the reasons we Greens are here, of course. We take an attitude that this is fundamentally important. We take an attitude that the diversity of life on the planet—both we and the ecosystems—is inextricably part of the one grand design of life on this planet. When we exploit one, we ultimately exploit the other. If we exploit one to extinction, we threaten another, even ourselves, with extinction further down the line—if not physical extinction, extinction of the soul and the spirit, those things which make 
 us as human beings happy and fulfilled in our life on this planet.</para><para>I congratulate the committee—everybody who worked on this committee, everybody who made submissions to it. I recommend that the public and other parliamentarians read the report. I can assure everybody—I do not need to say this, but maybe the assurance is there—that we are never going to be rid of this problem of loss of wildlife and, therefore, loss of part of the nation's richness, unless we tackle the fundamental problem of economic rationalism and the religion of the age which says, `Nothing has value, unless it has monetary value.' That is something we have to tackle in our own hearts, if we are going to tackle the real problem of the loss of species on this planet and in our own magnificent country.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>4451</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to return to the tabling of the JCPAA report on <inline font-style="italic">General and specific purpose payments to the states</inline> .</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Crowley)</name></talker><para>—Senator Allison, can I just see if anybody else wishes to speak on this report before we take up your request?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>4451</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just wish to say a few words. I hope I will not delay Senator Allison too long. Whilst I respect my colleague, Greens Senator Bob Brown, and his views, which, in many instances, are quite correct, I have to say I cannot agree with him on the issue of whether or not we ought allow—indeed, ought not foster—the commercialisation and utilisation of some wildlife.</para></talk.start><para>In some parts of Australia, it is probably better that we enter into—and we already have, in many instances—farming of what was, if you like, formerly wildlife of this country. In terms of ecological sustainability, that is a better move, in some instances, than the introduction, as we have seen, of sheep and cattle in some areas simply because of the nature of the soil and the region.</para><para>Let us go to some of the issues with regard to commercialisation of wildlife. For a long time, in my state—as is the case in many other states—we have seen commercial 
 activities operating in various forms and to varying degrees, albeit there has probably never been an appropriate management system in place. I have been one to participate in those activities. If I express a particular interest in this, that is it. I have participated mainly because I needed the money and/or, in the case of some game, a source of food. But it is something that we need to be very thoughtful about, and it can work.</para><para>Senator Brown was talking about brush-tailed possums and the fact that they are trapped. He did not say that, in many instances, there are significant numbers of brush-tailed possums—to the extent that they basically eat themselves out of house and home, particularly where they find themselves on farming property that is pastured. They are destroying a lot of the trees, unfortunately, as Senator Brown would know, down through the midlands of Tasmania simply because we as human beings have obviously taken away too many trees in the first place. But the possums have not declined in number, rather they have increased in number in Tasmania by virtue of the fact that they have access to a greater food source as a result of farming. It is, therefore, quite acceptable on the basis that it is managed appropriately for there to be a commercial activity involved in that.</para><para>What really annoys me is that we have other measures in place—namely, poisoning and/or shooting of many of the wildlife species—on the basis of pest control or vermin control and we leave them to waste. That is a sad reflection on us in terms of the management of any ecological system. In my view, there is nothing wrong with that if you can utilise it on the basis that you can ecologically maintain it. I do support that concept very much because I believe that it is very important.</para><para>In many instances, we have done exactly the opposite, but I think that, in this day and age, in terms of environmental matters, people generally have moved to the extent that they have a far better understanding and acceptance of the fact that we do have to act with a significant degree of responsibility. But it does not say that we cannot enter into commercial activities that may well be to the 
 benefit of some species of wildlife, and possums are but one.</para><para>In Tasmania, two wallaby species have been targeted for commercial activities in the past. They also thrived as a result of land clearing and the introduction of farming. They have increased rather than decreased in number. It is not unreasonable that we, in a very well-managed way, allow for a commercial activity in that sense. Again, in the name of vermin control, poisons are laid and wallabies are shot and left to waste. I find that totally unacceptable when there are employment opportunities—albeit declining, as a result of conservation activities which have led to a decline in the requirement for fur and/or hide products. Some of the wallaby skins that are destroyed in vermin control programs could earn money for the unemployed and the country generally. They could be turned into a very valuable commodity.</para><para>I will have to check, but I am sure that I see Australian Democrats and Greens senators carrying leather wallets and leather handbags et cetera.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">WEST</name><name role="display">Senator West</name></talker><para>—And leather shoes.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—And wearing leather shoes.

 conditions might be imposed by the Commonwealth on specific purpose payments to the states relating to the independence of auditors-general. The JCPAA would not have been our choice of committee to deal with this issue. Firstly, the Democrats have a limited role on the committee. Secondly, we think it is not in the interests of either major party to find that such a condition could or should be imposed on the states. The executive of the coalition, and of the ALP for that matter, despite their rhetoric, actually like the idea of auditors-general being somewhat nobbled. Governments of both persuasions to varying degrees do not like to be criticised, and that is precisely what auditors-general generally do.</para></talk.start><para>The condition the Democrats would like to have put on the states grants bills, which are the vehicles for Commonwealth money flowing to the states, is simple. It is that the Commonwealth auditor-general be satisfied that Commonwealth money will be protected by audit by an independent auditor-general. That is the least that Australians should be able to expect.</para><para>Three times we have put amendments which would impose that condition and three times the coalition and the Labor Party have voted against those amendments. What triggered our action in the first place was the Victorian state government's extraordinary step to effectively remove the auditor-general from his vital role of executing performance audits. The excuse given by the Victorian state government was that it had to comply with the national competition policy introduced, as we all know, by the Labor government and strongly supported by the Liberal and National parties.</para><para>Of course, auditors-general around Australia customarily contract out audit functions; there is absolutely nothing new about that. Premier Kennett was not satisfied. Here was a perfect vehicle for nobbling the Victorian auditor-general, who, it turns out, had much to criticise the Victorian state government for. The Premier stripped him of his department and central role as the sole decider of who and what is to be audited. Mr Kennett pretends that this gives the auditor-general a more 
 direct line of reporting to the parliament. We all know that that is nonsense. Mr Baragwanath knew he was being nobbled. Not a public servant given to overstatement, he spoke, and I quote him at the conclusion</para><para>of the review process undertaken by the three-person team set up by the Victorian government, which included a director of the Crown Casino and former director of KPMG, one of which stands to gain from less scrutiny of government's performance in relation to gambling and the other, who comes from the very sector, which stands to gain from more audits being done by the private sector. And it is necessary to spell out those influences brought to bear on accountability in Victoria. Last year, after the review team had done its work, Mr Baragwanath said:</para><para>I am more convinced than ever that the direction proposed by the review team will lead to a situation in which a future parliament, if confronted by either an oppressive or a corrupt government, would be relatively impotent and not privy to information which would allow it to call such a government to account. The team's model has been postulated in a report which is devoid of empirical evidence and is characterised by unsubstantiated assertions, textual inconsistencies, uncertainty as to the likely outcomes and recommendations based on minority views.</para><para>They might be minority views, but they are very influential views. Auditors-general everywhere agreed that this was an attack on the accountability of government. The Labor Party agreed that it was an attack on accountability, but it would not support our amendments which would have put a condition on the handing over of money to the state government which, again to use Mr Baragwanath's words:</para><para>. . . would be relatively impotent and not privy to information which would allow it to call such a government to account.</para><para>The first reason for the ALP not supporting our amendments was that this was not an appropriate bill. We then tried with the Commonwealth Auditor-General's bill—that was the suggestion by the ALP. However, it seems that that was not appropriate either, so we went back to a states grants bill. Again, the answer was no, and the matter was referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.</para><para>It was our view at the time that the Senate Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration would have been more appropriate. I do not wish to take anything away from the JCPAA, but this committee almost always reaches a consensus, I understand and, given the domination by the two major parties, neither of which is really willing to take on the states over this issue, we have a very thorough but a very cautious report which, not surprisingly, recommends the status quo. Again, I take nothing away from this report. In fact, it is a very interesting read and very useful for someone like me who has only been in the parliament for a short period of time.</para><para>The report starts by reminding us of section 96 of the constitution which gives the Commonwealth parliament the power to grant financial assistance to any state on such terms and conditions as the parliament sees fit. It points to the institutional arrangements between the states and Commonwealth governments which are supposed to deal with intergovernmental financial relations, and it cites the Premiers Conference, COAG and the Commonwealth-States grants commission.</para><para>However, we saw no action on the attack on the independence of the Victorian Auditor-General at these forums. Perhaps it was there and perhaps we do not know about it. These meetings are closed to the public and anything but transparent, so we do not actually know what was said, but my guess is that nothing was said. Intergovernmental forums like the Premiers Conference have not been very successful lately either. With health funding, the Commonwealth-state disability agreement and housing agreement, the list of agreements which have not been agreed goes on and on. It is very unlikely that the Kennett government would have said, `What a great idea! Put conditions on our grants so that we cannot do what we want to do.'</para><para>The report canvasses the idea that joint audits might be undertaken, such as happened with better cities funding. With respect, that idea is not likely to restore the independence of the Auditor-General in Victoria. It is a nice idea for the future, but it will not reassure Victorians that their money is being protected 
 from corruption. Again, executive government wins out. I think the major parties both look forward to a time when the Auditor-General will be less critical, less able to delve into the workings of the executives.</para><para>Federal Labor is unwilling to assist the Labor opposition in Victoria to achieve its claimed objectives, which were clearly spelt out by Mr Brumby in his flyer to households in Victoria. I will mention a couple of points from that. Labor promised that the Office of the Auditor-General would be re-established under the direct control of the Auditor-General, who would be responsible for staffing the office and for other resourcing decisions within the office. The Auditor-General would have the sole power to carry out, or to designate an auditor to carry out, the external audit on all public sector agencies over which the government has control, significant influence or to which it has financial exposure. It also says that the Auditor-General would not be subject to any direction on how to carry out audits. It has been a very long time since the ALP has had control over the upper House in Victoria.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—I think it was one week in our whole history.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—Precisely!

Groups representing public interests have not had adequate time to have input into this crucial legislation. What we are seeing here is a change from current television and other services to digital technology, which makes the change from analog mobiles to digital mobiles look like a pup. It has extraordinary ramifications for the whole of society not just through the television that we will be watching in the coming decades but 
 also through the whole panoply of potential digital communications, which includes person to person, home to office, city to city, and city to outer space communications for that matter. I think that nothing and no-one will not be touched by this technology and therefore by this legislation.</para><para>But how many out there in the public know what is going on? For example, how many people know that a very limited club will be given the right through this legislation to the television services coming out of it for a good many years to come—that exclusive club being the current licence holders for television broadcasts.</para><para>Here is a grand opportunity to broaden the ownership, the—if you like—variety and the delivery of television services to the Australian public. It is known that we have one of the most constricted and owner-concentrated media in the world. We should be using this as a grand opportunity to open up the airwaves to new players and therefore to a greater variety of choice for the public; we ought to be fostering that. For example, the government ought to be behind public broadcasting from community groups. They have been much more successful in the United States in having such public broadcasters coming from special community groups and getting a slice of the action than we are in Australia with a nil result. Community groups here will not be getting a slice of the action for years, if not decades, to come. That is the first thing; this should have been an opportunity to reduce, not confirm, the concentration of media ownership in this country.</para><para>The second thing is that Labor appears to be trading far too cheaply on this opportunity. The job of opposition here is to act in the public interest, not in the interest of the big media moguls. I have read a lot in the last few days, particularly following Senator Conroy's speech, about how Labor is here trying to abuse one or other of the media moguls in the public interest. But where is the result? Why isn't Labor using this opportunity to insist on improved Australian made children's programming content on television services? Why isn't Labor using this opportunity for protection of Australian made 
 entertainment products against the New Zealand cheapies, which can now flood and compete on the market after the High Court decision? Why isn't there even a requirement in this legislation—tweaked by Labor at its insistence in the talks that it is having with the government on this—that the networks give tangible evidence and commitments that they will be spending the capital on establishing the digital networks they are talking about?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—That is in our amendment.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—It is in your amendment, Senator Schacht, but if the amendment fails, you will still be passing the legislation; I will bet my bonnet on it.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—No, no.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—If I am wrong on that—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—You are absolutely wrong.

Nevertheless, I do not go along with Labor in just reducing the timetable for that implementation. I believe that right from the outset there should have been an opening up of the competition against the current very select few TV broadcasters in the main. There even should have been government assistance to ensure that such competitors were there, because competition in the media is the lifeblood of the flow of proper information. It is an essential and basic tenet of democracy as we see it.</para><para>As far as the ABC is concerned, I would like to have seen an amendment to ensure that the transmitter for Radio Australia near Darwin was part of the parcel of obligations coming from government on the delivery of broadcasting services on behalf of the Australian community. Some may think that is not within the narrow purview of this legislation, but I think the opportunity has to be taken when it can, when a government has done the wrong thing and cut out a vital service to this country, to ensure that it puts it back in. The few million dollars that are required to keep Radio Australia going are chickenfeed compared with the amount of money that is going to be made in profits from those who get the exclusive few licences that the government is going to extend for digital television broadcasting and, further down the line, for a whole range of other programs.</para><para>This is a grand opportunity to do something about reducing, rather than confirming or enhancing, the very limited media ownership and control of the airwaves that we have in Australia. I doubt that we are going to see this opportunity taken by either of the big parties to secure that end.</para><para>I am pleased to hear that the Labor Party is going to insist on amendments or it will not pass the legislation. I will be listening to the debate in the committee stages very carefully to see how far the Labor Party is prepared to go towards the much stronger position of the Greens regarding the obligation of commercial broadcasters in particular to provide a much wider service to the Australian public, to protect the interests of regional viewers so that they are not left out of this change of technology, and to ensure that there is better Australian content in programming in this country. Why should we simply be subject to the increasing bombardment of programs coming from overseas, not least the violent nature of programs that are fed to us from the American so-called entertainment networks?</para><para>It is a grand opportunity; I do not think the public recognises what an opportunity it is. There has not been sufficient time for the public or the media watchdogs for the public to feed in to this legislation, and that is why I foreshadowed the amendment that we put it to a committee so that, come October, we will be in a much better position to reflect what the public really thinks.</para><para>The imminence of an election seems to concentrate the mind on changes to the electoral legislation—we have seen a bit of that in recent times—and also on the potential for enhancing the interests of those who already control the media. As far as the Greens are concerned, we are here as watchdogs to help steady the impulse on both those counts in this parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>4458</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Digital television represents the cutting edge of technology and communications. It not only represents a new age of television but it is a cornerstone of convergence. Perhaps it is also the most significant step in generating the innovative milieu of a learning economy in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>In this process, the government has been solely focused upon the technology involved in HDTV and the way in which it will be physically provided. While the introduction of new technology is neutral, its application is political and this bill could be described as the most short-sighted attempt at managing 
 information technology that could have possibly been produced.</para><para>This ad hoc piecemeal approach to the new digital era that is exemplified by this bill highlights the lack of a forward thinking policy and regulatory framework for the information society. The real issue in this debate is the way in which we as the Australian parliament shape future communications and the future communications environment. We will have many opportunities in this new environment, in particular the ability to unify rural and regional Australia with the metropolitan cities in terms of both the industrial and technological economies. For regional Australians, it would mean equal access to the same services that now exist in cities. For rural business, it would integrate them at a central level into the powerhouse of the Australian economy. In the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">The global information economy: the way ahead</inline>, it claims:</para><para>The information industries are important as industries in their own right because of their size and growth potential. But it is their potential to contribute to the productivity and competitiveness of businesses throughout the economy that is of the greatest significance.</para><para>If correctly introduced, digital services will remove the differences that now isolate regional Australia. Regional Australia would be, for the first time, centrally included within the industrial and technological heartland that has only ever existed around the major metropolitan cities.</para><para>This momentous change also provides unparalleled opportunities for education across all areas of our society. With HDTV, people that have never before had access to services such as the Internet will now be included in all aspects of the information age. The departmental report from the information industries task force points out:</para><para>Information and communication technologies are an important enabler, underpinning productivity and competitiveness in every industry. It is through their enabling role that the information industries can contribute most significantly to Australia's future economic growth, employment and productivity.</para><para>According to the report, the key point in achieving this is `an open and competitive 
 market for information and communication technology products and services'. The report goes on to state:</para><para>Government leaders must accept the need for the information industries to be competitive. There must be greater awareness that information and communication technologies are inevitably transforming the economy, that the productivity and competitiveness of Australian businesses in all industries throughout the economy will depend upon best practice application of best of breed systems and solutions, and that this will not happen unless the Australian information industries are themselves innovative, financially sound and world competitive. Government must provide leadership and lead by example.</para><para>In the case of digital television, the government has certainly not led by example. The decision by the Howard coalition government to extend the ban on any new commercial television free-to-air broadcast licences being issued until 2008 will effectively allow existing broadcasters to shape the future of this industry. It is far more concerned with a cost-benefit analysis discussion rather than the merits of this technology. There is a war going on about control of this pipeline of information at all levels of its development. Corporations are desperately trying to maintain control over what is available on this pipeline and how it can be accessed, and to position themselves to operate the toll gates.</para><para>Much of the debate around this bill has focused on the availability of the technology and the costs of its introduction. This aspect is only the beginning, and one of the least important aspects of this process. This is a highly political development in the future communications environment that we will live in. The opportunities are enormous, but the risks are also vast. Right now, we have the opportunity to shape the most important factor of our future lives: the way we communicate with each other, learn and develop as a nation.</para><para>This is a role that is central to government, yet the Howard government is avoiding its responsibility. We have to get the digital screen into homes to drive the development of the Australian digital content industry and networked software industry. Software is where the value added gains will be and is the 
 area where we have competitive skills. This is the key industry development issue.</para><para>We may have a minister for the information economy, but we do not have a policy or regulatory regime for the information economy. If we did, we would not just be putting another bandaid on the outmoded Broadcasting Services Act; we would not be pretending that we can settle this broadcasting matter without also fixing up the communications regime. We still have an analog era approach to new digital imperatives: it is time we moved out of the comfort zone of the analog 1950s into the digital 1990s.</para><para>Structural adjustment policies need to ensure that the entire convergence value chain is established in Australia. This includes the need to get the digital screen into people's homes to provide access to all kinds of digital services. The government's legislation is based on service definitions which are already being eroded. It attempts to entrench legacy industry arrangements which cannot be sustained in the medium term.</para><para>To give the existing commercial television networks access to this technology for an exclusive period is to both deny access to potential competitors and to give a head start to the huge media conglomerates that already control most of the information delivery in Australia. The benefits of digital television come primarily from diversity: the diversity of communication streams and the convergence of a diversity of media.</para><para>The government has given this legislation immense priority. The reasons for this are obvious. The decision to restrict competition and free-to-air television until 2008 will give unparalleled advantage to the existing licence holders. The government explains that the decision is to compensate for the high cost of conversion to digital television. If this is true, then how will new entrants into the marketplace fare after 2008 when they have to face not only the high cost of building a network but also competing against existing and firmly established operators?</para><para>In its submission to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee, the Fairfax group 
 highlighted the dangers of the government's approach. They said:</para><para>This approach could be interpreted as offering an implicit subsidy inherent in the `gifting' of a valuable resource to incumbent broadcasters to ensure the ABA decision has the best chance of success.</para><para>This term until 2008 will give an advantage of several years head start to these broadcasters in the lucrative information technology industry. The future of this industry is in a combination of several different forms of media—in essence, multimedia. Digital television will allow these licence holders to operate several forms of communication through the one transmission network. In the future the television will also carry Internet capabilities and have on-line shopping, amongst other uses. It will include a pipeline with two-way communication capabilities.</para><para>In its submission to the Senate committee on these bills, the Fairfax group pointed out that the use of this digital spectrum will be ever increasing. Using Professor Richard Ducey's words:</para><para>. . . digital television allows us to reinvent what we mean by television. Nobody says that television broadcasting has to be radio with pictures. It could be computer software. It could be instructions on how to run a smart house. It could be how to run electronic books.</para><para>It has the capacity to reshape the way in which we function as a community in all its aspects—socially, politically and economically.</para><para>The Howard government, with its ban until 2008, will have effectively given these companies almost a decade to determine and manipulate the way in which this technology is used. More importantly, it will also deteriorate the role government can play in the process of digitisation. The government will be corrupted along with the process. Fairfax also related to this in its submission when it said:</para><para>The risks to government should be clear enough. Prescribing industry development compromises government's role as a planner, regulator and policy maker, and implicates government in the commercial fortunes of the participants. In effect, Government, more than industry, becomes responsible for delivering HDTV to the community. 
</para><para>In this new communications environment, we will see a very vast convergence of multimedia. Even today the difference between Internet, television, newspapers and other forms of media is becoming increasingly smaller. The learning economy is about this convergence and is very different from the economy we are used to living and working in. The OECD compares the learning economy as follows:</para><para>In contrast with the neoclassical view of the firm as a simple economic robot, modern evolutionary economics now see it as a searching, learning mechanism. It survives and improves by continually reinventing itself. It consists of a pool of assets, including both physical assets and intangible ones such as capabilities, and intelligence, which learns from the environment and modifies the resources.</para><para>This technology is vitally important for regional Australia. It represents a generation change and the availability of information and entertainment for Australians. For regional Australia to miss out would be a travesty that would represent the final denial of regional Australia ever having the same access to services as metropolitan Australia.</para><para>I fundamentally believe that regional Australia is entitled to communications services comparable to those available to Australians living in metropolitan areas. The government has also acknowledged this directive but is very lax in its approach to fulfilling the objective. Regional is simply not the same as metropolitan. It requires distinct approaches, distinct technologies, distinct market structures and distinct regulatory incentives.</para><para>It is clear the regional broadcasters will be forced to pay up to twice the cost of installing the network for digital television in regional areas. The vast distances and area that those broadcasters cover places them at a distinct disadvantage in comparison to their metropolitan rivals. For example, the cost for the larger regional licence areas is around $300 million. In addition to this will be the $176 million facing them in dual operating costs for eight years while they continue the existing analog transmission. The added factor that makes these costs significantly high is the fact that the revenue base in regional networks is much lower than the metropolitan areas. </para><para>In a recent media release on 24 June, Telecasters Australia indicated that:</para><para>One thing must be made absolutely clear: regional Australia achieving digital equality with metropolitan Australia by 2004 is simply a hoax. As the legislation stands, the government's targets for the rollout of digital services in regional Australia are unaffordable and unachievable.</para><para>I also note with some relief that the government has taken on board some of the concerns of regional broadcasters in recent days. The government has conceded that regional Australia has no hope of achieving the equality that Minister Alston has expounded. But what is new about this change to the legislation? It is certainly the right thing to do, but, as always with this government, rural and regional Australia is but an afterthought.</para><para>We need a regional communication strategy which addresses the delivery of all kinds of communications services to those in regional areas. Instead, we have a piecemeal approach driven by the Telstra sale imperative and the major metropolitan media interests which simply is not exploiting the opportunities presented by convergence. There is no recognition that satellite broadcasting and telecommunications are likely to be integrated within the next two or three years and that this will have profound implications for the delivery of new data services in rural and remote areas.</para><para>I urge the government to support the Australian Labor Party amendments. There must be competition in high definition television, and it must be at a balance with the development period. This technology must be made available to all Australians. Particularly in light of the enormous economic and social change that high definition television will bring, it is vital that rural and regional Australia are included in the process. HDTV represents a generational shift in the way we will conduct our lives, and all Australians must have the opportunity to participate in this change. The Australian government must get the policy settings right from the outset if every Australian is to have the opportunity to benefit from the knowledge based society of the 21st century.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>4461</page.no><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name><name.id>1X4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not want to take a great deal of 
 time, but in the time between now and the suspension for dinner I would like to reflect on some of the concerns of operators of television services in rural and regional and remoter areas of Australia. Whilst in New South Wales a lot of the regional services are aggregated—and we enjoy the luxury of the three commercial television stations, plus SBS and ABC—there are a number of areas in this country, particularly in western New South Wales, that do not have that luxury; they only have smaller independent television stations providing them with a service. In the last 24 hours I have received correspondence from the Mayor of Broken Hill, who is very concerned about what the impact might be on the people of Broken Hill.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWNHILL</name><name role="display">Senator Brownhill</name></talker><para>—Old Blackie, eh?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1X4</name.id><name role="metadata">West, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator WEST</name></talker><para>—Yes, our friend Peter Black, the Mayor of Broken Hill, is very concerned and very dedicated to making sure that people understand the concerns of his local community. It is a local community that is isolated from many other places—20,000-odd people live there—but they do relish the service that they get from Broken Hill Telecasters Ltd. They get local news bulletins. They get local services. It is only a small area, as I say, but these networks are very concerned about the impact that this may have if the smaller independents do not get access to a moratorium that the commercial stations in the metropolitan areas are being offered in this bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>They have grave concerns because this will impact upon their financial viability. In the long run, if their financial viability does not work out, one of two things will happen: they will be taken over by somebody or they will cease to be a service. Something must be done by this government to look at allowing a moratorium for these independents. I am aware that this is covered by the opposition amendments. I hope that the government is listening to rural communities as the television stations seek to access the same moratorium that the big players in the city areas have access to.</para><para>It is much easier for the big players in the city areas to absorb the costs that are going to be brought about by this improvement in 
 technology and television service. I think it is interesting to look at some of the figures that I have been given. In the smaller regional markets, with their lower revenue bases and sparser populations, the relative impact of capital expenditure required is vastly greater to that in the metropolitan markets. One of the regionals in South Australia has quoted that it costs $342 per TV home served to provide this update, as opposed to $64 in the metropolitan areas. It is quite obvious that this difference is made greater if the comparison is made on the basis of market capitalisations of the operators in the two markets. This must affect the viability and the ability of these regional services to provide a service and to update their equipment into the future to be able to meet the deadlines.</para><para>The lack of a moratorium for the regional services will cause commercial uncertainty in the operating environment just at a time when the operators need to raise the investment capital required to introduce digital services. Also, the entry of new licenses into the market would severely impact on localism in programming—local news content. We all know that in regional areas we like to sit down at 6 o'clock at night to listen to the local news, the news that relates to what is happening in our region and maybe our community. Localism in programming is vitally important.</para><para>The entry of new licenses will impact upon access to local news services, community service announcements and the affordability of advertising for local businesses and industries in those smaller regional communities. Operators would be forced to cut costs by greater use of cheaper material from outside regional communities. This would impact on local people. It will also have an impact upon people's ability to attract national advertisers if they have to raise the cost of advertising. It will also have an impact upon people's ability to lodge advertising with the smaller stations.</para><para>I know that a joint submission was made to the inquiry by the Spencer Gulf Telecasters, the Broken Hill Telecasters, the South East Telecasters and Riverland Television. I think it behoves the committee and the government 
 to look very carefully at the submission from those regional telecasters, because they are providing services in the more difficult to service rural and regional areas. They are not necessarily providing services to the remoter areas, but they are certainly providing services to regional areas. It is of vital importance that those television stations have the same rights and competition protection and assistance afforded to them that the large metropolitan stations have.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4463</page.no><id.no>r408</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>4463</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 25 June.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Order!

We have indicated our agreement with the other side of the chamber that we want transparency, we want disclosure. We have reacted promptly and quickly to the advice from the Electoral Commission to the extent that there is a problem for them in ensuring that associated entities are properly revealed. We have accepted the amendment that the AEC itself put forward on this matter—and that has now been agreed to by the chamber. We have also got the mechanism for full audits of the parties. If the motivation for this amendment—that is, the Greenfields loan to the Liberal Party—is not a loan but a gift, that will be revealed in the audit and dealt with accordingly.</para></talk.start><para>So we do think we have moved to ensure full transparency in relation to associated entities, that these amendments from the ALP 
 go too far—they are too much of a sledgehammer to crack a nut—and there is unacceptable vagueness in some of the wording of these amendments, particularly in relation to the definition of associated entities. The period of disclosure being made at any time has a retrospective effect. We see other problems in the actual mechanics of some of these amendments. In any event, we believe that what the government has done on this issue is eminently reasonable and satisfactory, and there is no need to go beyond that in a way which we think may have unintended consequences and not work as effectively as the ALP may hope.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>4463</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens take the contrary view from the government on this. They are very important amendments. As the opposition has clearly put it in the previous session when we were discussing this last week, the effect of these amendments is to ensure that people cannot get around the intention of the relevant legislation when they  are making donations to political parties of any kind.</para></talk.start><para>The matter in hand is a device by which people or entities, corporations, are finding that they may be able to subvert the intention of the act by making `loans' to political parties. There may or may not be any intention to call in those loans further down the track. There may be no intention to ever call in those loans, so that, in effect, what is happening is that a donation can be made to political parties—and this can be many tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars; it could be millions of dollars—without disclosure being required because, instead of being a straight-out gift, they are seen as a loan.</para><para>That was not the intention of the legislation. That is not what disclosure is about. This is a potential device for hiding donations going to political parties. And, of course, the intention of donations is always to have strings attached, to get rewards. Corporations, in particular, do not make donations to the big political parties—and we are really here talking about the coalition or the Labor Party—without the expectation that it is going to advantage their political situation.</para><para>In reality, it would be quite irresponsible for a board of a corporation to allocate a sizeable loan—a woodchip corporation, a mining corporation, some other form of developer—to a potential government party, without expecting there was a return, without expecting that this was a good investment of the shareholders' money. So be it. Let the people within corporations who decide how much is going to the big parties determine what is in the interests of the shareholders. But how are the shareholders, let alone the wider public, going to know about it if there is no disclosure?</para><para>As with taxation, in this matter of disclosure of political donations, there is always someone trying to find a device to get around the law—at least, the spirit of the law. There is always somebody trying to effectively cheat the public. That is what it is about—the public of Australia—and in this situation it is about cheating them of disclosure.</para><para>I cannot understand why the government does not think that tighter laws are better in this case—tighter laws than the ones they have accepted by way of amendment. The opposition has come up with those tighter laws, and the reality is that Senator Harradine is crucial in this regard. It is crucial to the good workings of democracy that his vote is cast in favour of these amendments. It will make the difference as to whether or not the amendments get up. As has already been indicated in the debate, the opposition amendments are being supported by the Greens and by the Democrats.

I will seek to have the questions on the amendments put separately—opposition 
 amendment 1, and then, as a block, amendments 2 to 5. As the committee would be aware, I moved those amendments in that manner to facilitate the debate.</para></talk.start><para>I say, particularly to Senator Harradine, that I do appreciate in relation to amendment 1 that there are issues in relation to the question of the definition of `associated entity' and I do acknowledge that the AEC has some difficulties in that area. I am certainly not aware of any concerns that have been expressed in relation to the thrust of the opposition's amendments 2, 3, 4 and 5, which I was starting to canvass a little earlier when the committee was last debating this matter. We believe that there is a need to amend the act to change the disclosure period, so that in the event that a loan like the Greenfields loan is forgiven, thus becoming a gift, its donors must still be disclosed, even if the gift is outside the same disclosure period as the original donations. I spoke about that matter at some length previously.</para><para>In relation to the opposition's amendments 3 to 5, I am not aware of any suggestion at all that these are not embraced and supported by the Australian Electoral Commission. I do not think there is any suggestion that that has been the case, and certainly the minister has not indicated that. I accept that the AEC argues about the question of definition, and that is why I have asked for the votes on the amendments to be separated in this way, although I believe the opposition's amendments would significantly strengthen the Electoral Act if they were accepted by the committee.</para><para>Our final amendments go to the issue of the receipt of loans. The primary problem we have with the $4,650,000 Greenfields loan is that we have no evidence—nor has anyone else any evidence—to prove that it is a loan given on commercial terms. We do know from their annual return that the Liberal Party made a payment of $100,000 to the Greenfields Foundation. However, we do not know when that payment was made. It may have been used as some sort of establishment grant to set up the Greenfields Foundation. Even if it is a repayment on a loan, it certainly would have to be at a very lucrative inter 
 est rate of around 2½ per cent. There does not appear to be any indication that there is any commercial rate of interest or that the loan was made on a commercial basis, and the evidence mounts for such a loan being forgiven.</para><para>These are important issues. During questioning in Senate estimates committee hearings—and I think this is an important point to make—the AEC conceded that a 2½ per cent interest rate on a loan would give reasonable grounds to assume that the loan was not on a commercial basis and possibly even constituted a gift. We acknowledge that, without the adequate level of information, without a proper information base, it is very difficult to determine whether that is the case.</para><para>These amendments—and I would be very surprised if they are not supported by the Australian Electoral Commission—would prohibit a loan from being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution—that guarantees its commercial nature—unless certain information is disclosed. What is wrong with that principle? It is really fundamental, basic information, like the terms and conditions of the loan, and details about the individuals and organisations from whom the loan was received.</para><para>I believe that this information would have to greatly assist the Australian Electoral Commission in their investigation and their proper dealings with—if necessary, pursuit of—suspected associated entities. It is incredible that we are seeing this sort of cover-up in the debate on this bill. But as far as the government and the Greenfields Foundation are concerned, if they are really fair dinkum, if they want to prove that there is nothing wrong here, there is no rort going on, there is no manipulation of the electoral system at all, if they want to show that they are not using forgivable loans as gifts, they should not have anything at all to fear from these important amendments that are before the committee.</para><para>I strongly put to the committee that these amendments are worthy of support. I particularly direct these comments to Senator Harradine, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman: even if you accept arguments, which I certainly acknowledge, that the AEC 
 does not embrace the definitional question in amendment 1, I am strongly of the view—and, certainly, not a skerrick of evidence has been provided to the committee to suggest otherwise—that the other amendments that have been moved in the name of the opposition are worthy of support. They are an important step in ensuring integrity in the disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</para><para>It is important to make the point that we in the opposition have spoken to the Australian Electoral Commission. We have worked hard to get these amendments right. We have tried to ensure that the drafting is as good as it could be. I do not believe that the government could possibly have any negative advice, or advice indicating that our amendments 2 to 5 should not be supported, from the Australian Electoral Commission. I would be very surprised if any fair-minded and reasonable person would not argue that they are an important step forward in terms of protecting the integrity of the disclosure provisions of the Act. For that reason, I ask for the committee's support of these amendments.</para><para>Questions have arisen about amendment No. 1, which I outlined in my previous contribution when we last dealt with the committee stage of this bill. The amendment relates to a proposal to improve the current definition of `operates wholly or mainly for the benefit of one or more registered political parties'. The Labor Party wants to change that because we think this is a loophole that can be exploited. We think it is unsatisfactory. I know the AEC have got concerns about that, but the spirit of these amendments is to ensure there are no loopholes that can be exploited. That is why our proposal reads `to operate wholly or to a significant extent for the benefit of one or more registered political parties'. I commend these amendments to the committee. I ask the committee if amendment No. 1, which stands in the name of the opposition, could be put separately as a question before the committee.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Prior to putting that question to the committee, let me clarify the situation with regard to what you have moved.

While the opposition would acknowledge that the last two divisions were lost—the first one, in relation to opposition amendment No. 1, by two votes, although the tellers' record originally showed four votes. The last vote ought to have been lost, and was lost, by my count, on a tied vote, but you have announced the result as 31 ayes and 32 noes when in fact I believe it was 31 ayes and 31 noes. In the previous division, you announced, I think, 30 ayes and 34 noes. It was 30 ayes and 32 noes. I think Senator Heffernan might be seeing double here. We obviously have no alternative here but to check the division lists.</para></talk.start><para>The point here, of course, is that both these votes would have been lost by the opposition, but I believe that Senator Heffernan is making some mistakes here in the pairing arrangements. Obviously he has got a long way in the Liberal Party because he just counts votes that he does not have. I do draw that to the attention of the committee. I do not mind losing. In fact, I am used to losing in politics. But, frankly, I think Senator Heffernan can do a better job than the one he has just performed most recently in those two divisions.

That report says that political parties are required to lodge returns of election expenditure in addition to 
 annual disclosure returns. The Liberal Party submitted that the two returns involved unnecessary duplication and that the election returns should be abolished. Similarly, the Labor Party submitted that the party should be able to lodge the audited annual accounts in place of both the annual return and the election return.</para><para>While the Australian Electoral Commission expressed strong support for audited annual returns, it advised that it would only support the lodging of parties' internal audited accounts if those accounts provided `full and timely disclosure in a simple and easy to understand format'. On the election return, the AEC noted that this return was abolished when the more detailed annual return was introduced. It was then reintroduced when the requirement to lodge claims for election funding was removed. The AEC does not object to the election return again being abolished.</para><para>The Australian Democrats said at pages 161 and 162 of the report:</para><para>Requiring the disclosure of electoral expenditure by political parties provides a valuable cross-check on donations received.

 We are fulfilling the joint standing committee recommendation, which I believe had the support of both the government and the opposition. Requiring political parties to lodge both returns of election expenditure as well as their very detailed annual returns was an unjustified intrusion by the state into the affairs of the parties and was quite an unnecessary duplication of their reporting requirements. They have to report everything in their annual return. To also impose on voluntary organisations—that is, political parties—a completely redundant requirement that they report again overlapping expenditure in another return is unnecessary. For those reasons, we do not support it. We maintain the position as put to us by the joint standing committee, which, as I say, had the support of both opposition and government members.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>4468</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens support the Australian Democrats' amendment.

We believe that, in its amendments to the Electoral Act, the bill is appropriate. It is, again, in response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and its recommendations which, from recollection, had both government and opposition support. Items 143 to 145, which are opposed by the Democrats, simply provide that registered parties may 
 lodge annual returns of expenditure in the approved form or lodge their audited financial statements in a form which meets the requirements as approved by the Electoral Commission.</para></talk.start><para>That seems eminently reasonable and sensible. I do not really understand the opposition. I also think that item 146 is an eminently sensible proposition, which says that political parties should no longer be required to report amounts paid out by them in the detail that is currently required. It says that they should just list their total expenditure. As was put to us by both the Liberal and Labor parties, there is no public policy justification for requiring that essentially third parties who sell goods and services to political parties should be put into returns in this way.</para><para>It is difficult to see what the public benefit and public policy purpose of such a requirement is. Item 146 maintains the requirement to record total expenditure on those sorts of things by the political parties, without having to put that Fred Bloggs, the plumber, came and fixed the toilet and that it cost the party $500—without that sort of thing having to be disclosed every year.

It says, `A return under this section must be accompanied by an auditor's certificate.' I remind the Senate of a passage I read earlier from page 102 of the 1996 federal election report in which, at paragraph 8.22, it said that the AEC expressed strong support for audited annual returns. The AEC has indeed expressed that strong support, and senators who follow these 
 matters would be familiar with the booklet entitled <inline font-style="italic">Funding and disclosure report: election `96</inline> , issued by the AEC, which is a very valuable document. Since representatives of the AEC are present, I compliment you on it.</para><para>In terms of Democrat amendment No. 8, the AEC had said with regard to that matter—and I will use its words because they are quite adequate for the purpose—that:</para><para>For disclosure to be effective, the returns lodged with the AEC must be accurate and complete at the time that they are placed on the public record. While the act contains penalty provisions for persons knowingly lodging incomplete returns, this cannot guard against genuine errors.</para><para>It has been the AEC's experience that some errors have not been advised to it or uncovered as part of its audit program until some time after the public release of the returns, thus effectively, albeit inadvertently—</para><para>and I am not sure that the AEC is right on that `inadvertently', incidentally—</para><para>avoiding public scrutiny.</para><para>It is well beyond the AEC's current resources to undertake audits of returns in the period between their receipt and public display. There is a strong public interest argument that disclosure returns of political parties, and perhaps associated entities, should carry some guarantee that they are free from errors and omissions at the time that they go on display. Requiring parties to submit disclosure returns which have been certified by a registered auditor would address this concern.</para><para>The AEC's recommendation No. 6 says:</para><para>Political party annual returns be accompanied by a report from an accredited auditor.</para><para>That is a very particular recommendation and one which I would urge the Senate—and especially the opposition, since it was in full accountability mode earlier—to support. Every political party, to my knowledge—certainly ours, and I would expect all others—is audited. Every political party has access to an auditor. A great deal of additional expense or trouble does not need to be taken for an auditor's certificate to be provided but, most particularly, it would assist the AEC enormously in establishing that the facts before it have been verified and are reasonable in the critical matter of accountability and of providing a full record.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>4470</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On balance, the government is not in a position to support this amendment. I am not saying that at some point Senator Murray may not wish to have this matter considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and to have all parties present evidence to that committee as to how they think it would work, what the implications would be for the parties, how expensive it might be and how much it would require them to change their current procedures. I think that process should be gone through in some detail. At the moment, the parties do submit their returns, and there are significant penalties for submitting false returns. The AEC audits the parties on a regular basis anyway and, of course, that would expose any falsities or problems with any of the returns that are being submitted.</para></talk.start><para>Again, I do not think there is any evidence brought to this parliament that justifies at this stage this sort of imposition on the parties, given the current circumstances they must deal with and the current requirements they must meet. I think we would need further evidence of circumstances which necessitate this, and I think if it is to be considered in the future, it is appropriate and proper for the bodies that will be significantly affected by it—the political parties all round Australia—to come before us and give evidence as to what it would mean for them and how, if you are going to do something like this, it might work.

What better way to start than by having a certificate to validate the parties' own auditing.</para></talk.start><para>I remind the committee again that what is involved here, amongst other things, is some $30 million post-election that is paid to the parties for electoral funding—principally to the big parties that are turning against this motion—out of the public pocket.

If you look at the top of page 4 on sheet 852, you will see that after (d) it has 145C after section 314AC and then the paragraph ends at 314AC; please excise that entire section.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Are you moving that formally, Senator?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—That is how I would like to amend my amendment, and then I would like to move it formally.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—You can just move it in that form.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>(9)	 Schedule 1, page 35 (after line 3), after item 145, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">145A After subsection 314AC(2)</inline></para><para>Insert:</para><para>(2A)	 The return must identify which of the amounts received are donations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">145B At the end of section 314AC</inline></para><para>Add:</para><para>(4)	 An agent must return any sum which has been purportedly paid out of a trust fund or out of the funds of a foundation unless it is accompanied by a declaration, in an approved form, setting out:</para><para>	 (a)	 details of the beneficial and ultimate control of the trust estate, including by trustees; and</para><para>	 (b)	 the identities of the beneficiaries of the trust estate, including:</para><para>		 (i)	 in the case of individuals—their countries of residence; and</para><para>		 (ii)	 in the case of beneficiaries which are not individuals—their countries of incorporation or registration, as the case may be; and</para><para>	 (c)	 details of any relationships with other entities; and</para><para>	 (d)	 the percentage distribution of income within the trust; and</para><para>	 (e)	 any changes during the relevant financial year to the information identified in paragraphs (a) to (d).</para><para>(5)	 An agent must return any sum which has been purportedly paid by a club, whether the club is an incorporated body or not, unless it is accompanied by a declaration in an approved form, setting out:</para><para>	 (a)	 the purposes for which the club exists; and</para><para>	 (b)	 the identities of office-bearers within the club; and</para><para>	 (c)	 details of any relationships with other entities; and</para><para>	 (d)	 the name and address (not being a post-office box) of any person or organisation which was the original source of the funds paid by the club to the party.</para><para>The amendment you have before you now has two parts, essentially. The first part refers to 145A after subsection 314AC(2), which says:</para><para>(2A)	 The return must identify which of the amounts received are donations. 
</para><para>I refer you again to the AEC's <inline font-style="italic">Funding and disclosure report:</inline><inline font-style="italic">election `96</inline> , and to their recommendation 5. In the preamble to recommendation 5 it says in part:</para><para>There is always considerable interest from journalists and political parties, particularly in relation to donations. Donations, however, are not separately identified from other receipts in the returns.</para><para>That is quite extraordinary, really.</para><para>This can lead to confusion and in some cases misreporting by journalists (in one instance a disclosure of the maturity of an investment was reported as being a donation from the bank involved in the transaction). It also complicates the task for the AEC when attempting to identify donors who are required to lodge disclosure returns.</para><para>Recommendation 5 said:</para><para>In their annual returns political parties be required to identify donations separately from other receipts.</para><para>That is exactly what we have said. We are just a small party. We run on volunteers; we do not have highly paid officials, but every donation that comes in is recorded separately, and so are other receipts. It would surely be in the interests of all parties concerned—the AEC, journalists and anybody else who is looking at this—if this was identified separately. I assume that the instance in which the AEC indicates there was a problem would have affected one of the major parties. I cannot recall it as having been something that arose from us. I have a suspicion that it is not on this side of the chamber; it might be on the other side of the chamber. But the fact is that it is a problem, and we think it could be resolved.</para><para>The second section of the amendment before you, which is put into the same section because it runs on to 145B, refers to the very matter which Senator Faulkner outlined earlier, and that is the question of how trusts are dealt with. I refer you to page 161 of my minority report to the 1996 federal election report, where we said:</para><para>It is also most desirable to remove any lingering doubts concerning Trusts. One of the roles they play in political donations is as a screening device,—</para><para>which they do, incidentally, in other forms of business and organisational life—</para><para>hiding the true source of donations. There are legislative precedents for requiring disclosure by 
 such bodies. The hidden donations from trusts and foundations, sometimes with a foreign source, are of particular concern, and any loophole must be closed.</para><para>You might ask: what is the legislative precedent? The legislative precedent is the Export Market Development Grants Act, which requires these kinds of disclosures.</para><para>We are asking the Senate to support that an agent must return any sum, unless it is accompanied by a declaration in an approved form, because the only way to punish someone who is not behaving properly is to make him give back the money which, purportedly, has been paid out of a trust fund or out of the funds of a foundation. The AEC would develop the declaration, and that is what the political party would have to receive. They would hold that declaration, and it would be nobody's business but theirs unless the AEC wished to see it.</para><para>The declaration would be in an approved form setting out the details of the beneficial and ultimate control of the trust estate, including by the trustees, because we, as representatives of the people, in these broader issues of disclosure, do not want trust funds behind which lurk mysterious figures. It is not beyond the bounds of belief to think they could be foreign figures—people, for instance, who support open gun laws or who have a particular view on society which is not in the interests of Australia in its democratic and progressive form.</para><para>We think the ultimate and beneficial control of the trust estate should be disclosed, including by the trustees. The identities of the beneficiaries of the trust estate should be included and, in the case of individuals, their countries of residence, because that is relevant to where a donation comes from—whether it is from Australians, from foreigners, or from some militia outfit in the boondocks of America. In the case of beneficiaries which are not individuals, their countries of incorporation or registration, as the case may be, should be disclosed, as well as details of any relationships with other entities, the percentage distribution of income within the trust, and any changes during the relevant financial 
 year to the information identified in paragraphs (a) to (d).</para><para>Any corporation that pays a donation across has to disclose these things. You know exactly who owns a corporation, who the shareholders are, and who receives the income returns. It is all there to be seen, so why shouldn't it be the same for a trust?</para><para>In item 5 we say the same things about clubs, because there are clubs which are constituted to raise funds for political parties. We think the political party receiving the funds should have a declaration, in an approved form, setting out the purposes for which the club exists, the identities of office bearers within the club, details of any relationships with other entities, and the name and address—not being a post office box—of any person or organisation which was the original source of the funds paid by the club to the party.</para><para>Those are designed to stop the system whereby there is limited disclosure. Those two things addressing the issue of trusts and clubs are designed to deal with the situation where donations are made by blind entities which cannot be properly identified, and that is their purpose. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate gave a very impassioned defence of his earlier amendments on exactly these lines, and these are a different form of presentation. As I say, they have their roots in legislative precedent; they certainly have their roots in the intention of the act.</para><para>These are matters which have clearly been decided previously by the Senate and by the House of Representatives. The House and the Senate have said that they want full disclosure; they want an open and transparent political system. These amendments go to the heart of that issue of making sure that full disclosure, full accountability, full openness and full transparency are available to the society as a whole for the protection of our political system and for the protection of our people. That is why we have put these amendments to you. We clearly warned you of our intent in recommendation 9.4 way back in June 1997 when our minority report was published, and we are now putting it before you. I commend the amendment to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>4473</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Again, I regret to inform Senator Murray that the government is not in a position to support this amendment. Amendment 145A requires that the return must identify which of the amounts received are donations. The act currently has very stringent requirements on disclosure of amounts received by political parties in each financial year and sets out in detail the requirements the parties must meet in relation to the amounts received by the parties. That is all there for everybody to see—every amount received of $1,500 or more from any person. We think that is adequate, and again I do not really understand the argument that the parties should have to go through and identify, in each case, which amount received happens to fall into a definition of `donation' as opposed to any other amount received. It is all there. Virtually every amount a party receives is, in effect, a donation, given that they are not, in most cases, businesses of any kind—so every amount they receive is, by and large, of the nature of a donation. I really cannot see the public policy purpose served by this particular amendment. I do not think the case has been adequately made out.</para></talk.start><para> In relation to item 145B, you are saying that party agents, the servants of the parties, are going to be guilty of an offence if they receive moneys from trusts or clubs where the trust or club has not supplied very detailed information to the parties. I think that is what it means. If the agent gets a donation from a trust or a club, he has to receive a declaration from that trust or club setting out all this quite insignificant detail.</para><para>I do not know what happens then. I suppose you are then going to wait for the auditors come along and see whether every single donation from every club or trust that is $1,500 or more has the appropriate declaration with it and whether that declaration meets these requirements. Then somebody—presumably the AEC—is going to have to make a decision as to whether the declaration meets all these requirements. It has items in it such as that it has to set out `details of any relationships with other entities'. Frankly, I do 
 not know what that means. I am a pretty rusty sort of a lawyer, but I think that one is going to be extremely difficult for anybody to police. It also refers to `the percentage distribution of income within the trust'—there is a whole range of requirements.</para><para>I would have to say that, by and large, the Liberal Party as far as I am aware—from my many years working for the Liberal Party—does not generally receive money from trusts and clubs. So my comments are not based on self-interest but on my reasonably intimate understanding of who gives money to the Liberal Party. To the extent that any trust was an associated entity, it is picked up by the quite significant associated entity requirements that we have just augmented.</para><para>Again, I do not see that there is such a massive problem with the current disclosure requirements that justify going to quite extraordinary lengths, frankly, to discourage any club or trust that might give money to a political party to continue doing so. This is not something that would particularly affect the Liberal Party. We just think it is going way over the top without the appropriate justification. It is putting party agents in an extremely difficult position in relation to any moneys they receive from any trust or club. So I regret that, on balance, we cannot support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>4473</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I put a question to the minister in view of the statement he has made, which he might like to correct.

I think Senator Murray's admonition of the minister was quite in order in this regard. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the Liberal Party is certainly willing to exploit any loophole it can on these sorts of issues.</para><para>Can I say this to Senator Murray: as I understand it, your original proposal was to bring these amendments forward to the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 . That is what the opposition had thought you were going to do, and it is what the opposition still thinks is more appropriate than doing it here. However, given the defeat of the very important amendments in relation to the Greenfields Foundation and the very transparent attempts by the Liberal Party to cover up the details of a $4.65 million loan to the Liberal Party, I have become even more 
 tempted by the amendments that you have moved.</para><para>I have only one problem with these amendments, and that is that I am not certain about all the implications of them. I would like an opportunity to look at the implications and perhaps discuss them—if I find any—informally with you. I cannot go any further in this debate than to say that, Senator Murray, but the spirit of what you are trying to achieve is certainly embraced by the opposition. For its part, the opposition is happy to discuss with you, in the lead-up to the debate on the next bill, some of the implications of these amendments and perhaps work with you further in refining them.</para><para>Your motivation is a motivation that is shared by the Labor Party.

I agree with the sentiment of the Democrats that, if that sort of money is being put into political parties, there should be clear accountability for it. The same goes with trusts.

We were opponents in that election but, as you know, the Democrats support fair elections.</para><para>Mr Tuckey remarked in his submission—in fact, I believe there was an attempt to take it to law, and the AEC may be better acquainted with the situation than I am—that an advertising campaign was launched against him and they were unable to identify who had started it, who had funded it or where it came from. It was misleading, untruthful and, as I say, caused him considerable anguish. I do not 
 think any person contesting an election should be subject to that sort of occasion.</para><para>So this amendment was an attempt to address that. The amendment does say:</para><para>the name and address (not being a post-office box) of the person or organisation which was the original source of the funds to pay for the advertisement, handbill, pamphlet, poster or notice appears at the end thereof;</para><para>At present we say, `Authorised by Nick Minchin of the Liberal Party'. It is plain who is authorising it, and who is paying the funds. But if it is authorised by Mr X, we are simply of the view that Mr X should identify where the money comes from. That was not so in the Tuckey offence. Once again, Minister, this is put up as an issue of fairness. Once again, if  you feel unable at this time to address it in full, I would perhaps suggest that the matter could be looked at again by both the AEC and the joint committee to see if that proposed amendment fixes the problem.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>4477</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do recollect Mr Tuckey's evidence before the committee where he described to us this election campaign which he felt was anonymous and that perhaps the committee could look at it. The committee did note—and I think this had government and opposition support—that, while we understood the problem he was trying to deal with, we did not think the solution was really workable.</para></talk.start><para>There are a number of problems with it. In most cases, parties receive general donations to support their election campaigns and then engage in election advertising. There is no necessary correlation between the donation and the advertisement. It is certainly very rare that you would allocate a donation to a particular advertisement. So it is not normal for there to be a particular source of an advertisement of the kind described—handbill, pamphlet or poster—in this amendment. So I am not quite sure how it would work in practice.</para><para>It would also mean, if you were able to identify the particular source of the money, having a third piece of information on the handbill or poster or whatever it is. You 
 already have to put the person who authorises it and takes responsibility for the contents as well as the name and address of the printer. Now we are going to add a third item: the name of the person who is the original source of the funds.</para><para>I think that is unnecessary and probably unworkable. We do have extensive disclosure provisions. Donors to parties that end up using all of that pool of funds to pay for ads are all disclosed. We are disclosing who takes responsibility for the ad. I have not changed my view; it was the view that I held as a member of that committee. It was a view shared by all government and opposition members. While we sympathised with the problem—and I guess all of us involved in politics have seen this—where ads appear and we have difficulty identifying or finding the person who does authorise the ad, I do not think this is the way to solve that problem.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>4477</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I say to Senator Murray that I am absolutely relaxed if the minister wants to send it off to the committee for a further look at it.

The idea here, as I understand it, is that, along with authorisations, the source of funds to pay for electoral advertisements needs to appear. That is the basic thrust of this amendment. I have to say, Senator Murray, that I do see this as a very unrealistic one. However, if it is sent to the committee and we are going to have another look at it, I am happy to engage in that in a serious way.

I think these issues are well understood by every senator. I have the impression—Senator Minchin can acquaint me with his views himself—that Senator Minchin has some sympathy for this kind of approach. It will be interesting to hear how Senator Minchin responds. For those who are students of these matters, I did write at length, on pages 152 to 155 of my minority report, on this matter of truth in advertising. I remind you all again that it works in South Australian legislation exceptionally well. Amendment 3 reads:</para><para>A person must not, during the relevant period in relation to an election under this Act, print, publish or distribute, or cause, permit or authorise to be printed, published or distributed, any electoral advertisement containing a statement, purporting to 
 be a statement of fact, that is inaccurate and misleading to a material extent.</para><para>I think that qualification is critical because, plainly, in the rush and hurry of campaigns, there will certainly be errors made, but it is material errors that we are concerned about. Amendment 4 is merely a consequential amendment. Amendment 5 reads:</para><para>In a prosecution of a person for an offence against subsection (4) . . . it is a defence if the person proves that he or she:</para><para>		 (a)	 took no part in determining the content of the matter, thing or advertisement; and</para><para>		 (b)	 could not reasonably be expected to have known that the matter, thing or advertisement was inaccurate or misleading or likely to mislead an elector in relation to the casting of a vote.</para><para>Those words are very carefully chosen. Those words, and the elements within those amendments, have been tested over time by the Democrats with amendments, in previous debates, in the content of the Commonwealth Electoral Act in 1983-84 when it had these issues within it, and in a subsequent prosecution of this case by us. I think it is a case that is well known to you all. The minister, who is from South Australia, would certainly understand the issues. Rather than speak any further, I will wait and hear his response.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>4478</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Given the pressure of government business, I will not indulge in lengthy comments on a matter which I have considered at great length during my political career. As state director in South Australia for eight years, I obviously had to work under this legislation. I did not have any difficulty with that, and fortunately was never prosecuted—unlike, regrettably, one of my friends in the Labor Party, Terry Cameron, who was successfully prosecuted. I note that the just retired state director of the South Australian Liberal Party has been charged. As well, I think a couple of Labor Party people have been charged with offences under this provision.</para></talk.start><para>Having worked successfully under it in South Australia, and personally believing that 
 it is, on balance, a reasonable proposition, I supported it when it was brought before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. As a member of that committee, I supported the recommendation of that committee that a provision of this kind be included in the Electoral Act. I guess that is based on my own personal experience of having worked with this in South Australia. The fact is that I am only one voice in the government and the government, on balance, in response to the joint standing committee report, decided not to support that amendment. I quote from the government response:</para><para>The Government firmly believes that political advertising should be truthful in its content. However, any legislation introduced to enforce this principle would be difficult to enforce and could be open to challenge.</para><para>Previous Committees have found that it was not possible to legislate to control political advertising and that voters, using whatever assistance they see fit from the media and other sources, remain the most appropriate arbiters of the worth of political claims.</para><para>So the government did seriously consider this matter and, as a member of that committee and as the responsible minister, I was keen to ensure the government did give due weight to the committee's recommendations and consider this very frankly and honestly. But, on balance, the weight of opinion within the government was not to introduce a provision of this kind because it was not satisfied that provisions of this kind are fully workable and they may contradict the proper freedoms which we grant to parties and candidates to seek to persuade voters to their cause.</para><para>It is quite different from advertising for particular products. You are advocating ideas and reasons why you should support one party and not another and it is not easy to apply the normal disciplines of trade practices, with respect to products and services, to political advocacy. So I understand those on both sides of the political divide—people from the government and opposition of good intent and integrity who support truth in political advertising, but who nevertheless do not support a provision of this kind in the electoral act. 	All I can do, Senator Murray, is indicate—as I have said—my own personal 
 sentiments but point out that the government is not in a position to support this.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>4479</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have had the minister humiliated here, to the extent that he had to run out the `I'm just one voice in government' defence.

Senator `just one voice in government' Minchin in fact got his colleagues on the joint standing committee to back him up on this.</para><para>This is, of course, a backdown from the government on the eve of an election where we are probably going to see the sort of campaign that we saw in embryonic form with the Wik advertising campaign—the great Australian dream campaign—that the opposition exposed. That backfired, of course. We take a different view to this. I am not just one voice in the opposition. We collectively say that the existing provisions of the Act, section 
 329(1) on misleading or deceptive publications, do cover the issue.</para><para>We also say to Senator Murray that attempting to legislate here—to go further than the existing act, to go to a definition of truth versus untruth—would be extremely controversial. I think it would be almost unenforceable. It would be very much open to challenge. It is something that, on behalf of the opposition, I am not willing to support.</para><para>I understand why Senator Murray is trying to achieve this. I note the view of the AEC who said that they believe there is little point in regulating the factual content of political advertising if remedies are not available when the damage is actually occurring. I also note that the AEC consistently has argued that its reputation for neutrality would be impaired if it were to be given responsibility for truth in advertising provisions.</para><para>I appreciate what Senator Murray is trying to do here. It will not be supported by the opposition. But, Senator Murray, I will give you this commitment through the chair: never, ever will we descend to the defence of `Oh, we are just one voice in government' or, `Oh, we are just one voice in opposition and that is why we are not willing to adopt a consistent position that we had previously'. This is a breach of probably non-core commitments. We assume they were not core commitments that were made by the government prior to the last election. It is just a breach of another commitment made on many occasions during the election campaign. It is just a breach of what they argued for at the joint standing committee. But, I understand the reason why. Because, after all, Senator Minchin is only just one voice in government. But what an influential and powerful voice he is. Just ask the Prime Minister because Senator Minchin is the only person who stands between John Howard and Mr Costello becoming Prime Minister.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>4480</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have heard, not from the mover of this motion, Senator Murray, but from the leader of the government on this matter, Senator Minchin, that there has been successful prosecution under exactly the same provisions in the South Australian legislation and that

Unscrupulous people out there who try to sell you materials or goods and who try to take your money off you by telling lies, being deceitful or being misleading run the risk of being caught and punished. But when it comes to voters, it is not quite the same. Although there is provision for insisting on non-misleading advertising, when it comes to putting some teeth into that—as Senator Murray and the Democrats are doing here—the big parties say, `Ooh. That's unenforceable. That would create all sorts of problems.' We must remember that we are in the situation where we have compulsory voting. In an age where increasing numbers of citizens change their votes from election to election, voters have a right to go to the booth expecting that the material they have been handed to persuade them is dinkum and honest and does not set out to deceive them in so far as the facts are concerned.</para><para>Here we have both of the big parties saying, `We're not going to go as far as these Democrats amendments to bring the national legislation in line with South Australian legislation'—legislation which we have heard, from no less than the minister himself, is working. We even have the minister saying, `Left to my own devices, I would support this, but I have been rolled in the party room and I can't.' Let me say to Senator Minchin that, if we had the opposition on side, all he would have to do is walk over here and then the public's expectation that there would be truth in advertising at election time would be fulfilled through legislation. But that is not going to happen.</para><para>These Democrat amendments are not going to be supported here because, firstly, Senator Minchin is locked into the party machine, which made a decision about this legislation behind closed doors without debating it and, secondly, the opposition, in its own deliberations on this, has come up with the same conclusion as the majority of the coalition—that is, `This legislation is too tough. It might catch out one of us or one of them.' Truth and politics, we are told, do not mix too well and we are seeing a good example of at least nervous nellieness about that here in the chamber tonight. We have got to be a bit better than that. We have to try to defend the truth because we have to defend the electors' right to be informed correctly in the run to the ballot box, to not be deliberately misled and to not be given facts which are untrue and which were knowingly put before them by somebody, with a view to unscrupulously changing votes, who recognised that they were untrue.</para><para>It is a pretty important matter and it is a pretty sad moment when neither of the big parties can support a very simple, just and proper amendment such as this so that voters can be defended from lies, deceit and deliberate misleading in the run to elections.

This amendment arises out of recent events and its fate is entirely in the hands of the major parties as to whether they agree or disagree. I do not expect to be surprised by their opposing it because it really is an attack on any incumbent government. What the amendment seeks to do is to prevent an incumbent government using government advertising to push party political policy.</para><para>As we know, there is a great deal of debate on tax policy currently. I think the story is that some $10 million worth of taxpayers' funds are going to be pushing out a particular view that the government has come to, and the opposition in estimates have been quite vigorous about that. However, whilst they may be vigorous in estimates, I doubt they would like to see the practice stopped because when they are in government it works quite nicely for them, too.</para><para>However, on straightforward accountability grounds, we feel obliged to put this before the Senate so at least it can be known that it was 
 put up and that there was a reaction.

Of course, there is a definition of advertising and public money, the purpose being to allow the government to continue to use its advertising funds for the appropriate activities of government but not for political party purposes.

I just do not know quite how this would work in practice.

Any election held before November will not be caught by this anyway.</para><para>Quite sensibly, of course, you are providing exemptions to it, but there is a whole range of exemptions.

It is quite legitimate for governments to inform the community of changes to policy and why they are being made. In any event, all government advertising stops the minute an election is called. In opposition, we complained about a lot of the former Keating government's advertising but, as the current opposition does, you make your case in the political marketplace. If you, as an opposition, believe that a government is engaging in quasi political advertising, you go out and make your case in the political marketplace and seek to convince voters that the government is abusing its entitlements. If you can convince the voters of that, good luck to you. As I say, it stops the day the election is called.

The minister draws a distinction between what he describes as `service advertising', to use his words, and other advertising. It is for those 
 technical reasons, I have to say, Senator Murray, that the opposition will not support the amendment you have moved.</para><para>But we do have a situation where this government is engaging in absolutely massive taxpayer funded advertising and a very significant quantitative and qualitative research program to both inform that advertising and, we believe, inform the Liberal Party's federal election campaign. Through the Senate estimates committee process, we have been able to expose at least $40 million worth of advertising that can only be described as politically partisan election advertising that is motivated only because of the proximity of a federal election campaign. Of course, there have been the examples of the youth allowances and the tax campaign that is about to be on a television screen near you in the next few days, and so it goes on.

An enormous number of advertising campaigns are being conducted by the Liberal Party. The only reason for it is a partisan motivation.

 questions on notice. Other material has been obtained by the opposition as a result of FOI requests. I am hoping that still more will be made available for the benefit of all members of parliament and the Australian public. However, I am not holding my breath for that to occur.</para><para>This is a particularly low-life political operation that we have in relation to advertising. Heaven knows what will happen to the advertising accounts when this massive amount of political advertising is pulled off the screens and the caretaker provisions cut in. One can only assume because of the amount of money that has not been disclosed in the Greenfields Foundation's loans that it will be quickly replaced by advertising for the Liberal and National parties paid for, on this occasion, by the coalition parties themselves. The point about this current advertising is that the taxpayer is funding the bill and it ought to be the Liberal Party.

Before it was elected, it talked about lifting parliamentary standards and ministerial accountability.

There are absolutely no constraints on any of the research that is informing these campaigns. What assurances do we have that it will not fall into the wrong hands at Robert Menzies House? What assurances do we have that Liberal Party apparatchiks will not be misusing that research? The Labor Party will continue to try to hold the government accountable on this and expose 
 this blatant rort and, most importantly, blatant misuse of taxpayers' money.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>4485</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Briefly, Senator Faulkner has amused me a couple of times tonight.

It does not actually do the job he wants it to do. There are probably three forms of government advertising. The first is what I would call standard advertising, such as defence force recruiting and advertising for tenders, and that should continue, even during a caretaker period of government. The second form of advertising is basically an information exercise, and the government can bask in the reflected glow of that type of advertising. That sort of advertising is usually, on balance, suspended from the issuing of the writs.</para></talk.start><para>The third type of advertising is blatant electioneering, which I have to say has been pioneered more by state governments than by federal governments over the years. You need look no further than what has been done by Mr Jeffrey Kennett. Tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money have been expended on glossy leaflets and reports and TV and radio advertising in Victoria.</para><para>The problem with Senator Murray's amendment and that `6 months preceding' an election period is that, if that became law a 
 government would time all its advertising campaigns and then go six months early, as they were planning to do in this particular period. At the moment, there is not just a colossal amount of government advertising in the pipeline, but it is all bunched up—it is targeted for July as much as possible. If you asked the government to average out its advertising expenditure for the calendar year 1998, it would bubble along, take a massive leap up—like the measurement of an earthquake—and then drop back down.</para><para>It is timed to get that advertising in at what the government regards as a crucial time for its electoral cycle. Your amendment would not pick that up, unfortunately. Therefore, it is not just a question of the major parties ganging up on the poor old minor parties and bashing them up again. That occurs on occasions with electoral bills, although often your rights are also protected—although that is rarely acknowledged—but on this occasion it is really definitional. I do not want to revisit the idea of truth in advertising, but I must be about the only person in the chamber who cannot philosophically define truth. It is not something that I necessarily think judges are any better at, but we will not return to that particular debate.</para><para>The real problem in the way advertising is handled by this government is that it has a secret manual. That manual says, `Look, let's have a political advertising campaign.' Normally, these are based on legislative change or a conscious and hard decision of cabinet, but what the government is doing with the tax thing is neither. It will not have a legislative base or a cabinet decision; it will just go out and research and run advertising that anticipates its decision, because the government is keeping its tax package hidden. That is why it stands out as one of the most blatant exercises in Commonwealth history. Also, the fact that it has funding of $10 million re-emphasises the point that it is simply a political campaign.</para><para>To get back to the government's manual, what is it? The government says, `We've got a campaign coming up. As much as possible, why don't we go out and research it in quantitative and qualitative ways? Gee, I wonder 
 who is good at that?' Then they sit around and puzzle for ages and come up with the name of Mark Textor, Liberal Party pollster. He gets given the work. He may not ask political questions, but certainly, if he pads out his account, he will do cheaper research for the Liberal Party later.</para><para>Mark Textor is the bloke they sent to England to advise the Major government on how to get re-elected. If anything would dent their credibility, it would have been that. They usually get Mark Textor to do the research.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—It is a similar task this time.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Yes, it is a very similar task. Then when it comes to the advertising, you have to spread it around. There are 1,100 names in the database. It is surprising how often the names of Ted Horton, Mark Pearson, Toby Ralph and John King come up, either at Needhams or Lintas. It is amazing how much work Lintas has got in the last few months. Three major campaigns are coming up on the government payroll, and it just happened to get them. Did it get them by objective means? Is it public servants who choose Lintas? Of course it is not. It is a political committee.</para></talk.start></continue><para>And what a fair and just committee it is. It is chaired by Senator Minchin. Who else is on it? Petro Georgiou, a former state secretary in Victoria, is on it, and I think the third member is Mr Tony Nutt, a former state director of the New South Wales branch—a very splendid one, I might say; he has a better record than the other two. They are on the committee, and they are the ones who choose who gets the work.</para><para>Guess who gets the work? It is the good old boys. That team gets the work every time. I understand that they are in for something like another five contracts, although you may want to deny that. That gives them a good living, but this is not just a question of money. These are prestige accounts. These are accounts that are like notches on the belt. They can go into their advertising pitches around the country and say, `We ran the immunisation campaign' or `We ran the youth care campaign' or `We ran the tax campaign', and it looks tremen 
 dously good on the CV of those companies. It may not be massively profitable but, in general, there is a reasonable profit to be made.</para><para>We never want to return to the days where Needhams get the contract in a fix and then produce the most woeful ads one could imagine, just black and white on reels which any amateur could come up with overnight—several hundred thousand dollars was the eventual cost.</para><para>So what they do, Senator Murray, is go back to the manual, they get their favourite researcher in and they get their favourite advertising companies in—the very people that will be the backbone of their campaign in the next federal election. But your amendment, unfortunately, will not obliterate that as a fact.</para><para>I thought Leader Faulkner made some rather disappointing comments about Senator Minchin being needed in the chamber. Senator Minchin does not need to be in the chamber propping up numbers or anything else. He knows as well as I do that there is one way of telling if a Liberal Party leader is in trouble: Senator Richard Alston is always the last one to jump off the wharf onto the departing boat. So all Senator Minchin needs to do is to keep his eye on him. But I have some advice for you, Senator Minchin: if Senator Alston jumps, you want to be one second right behind him.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>4486</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Temporary Chairman, I withdraw amendments 13 and 14 on sheet 852.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>4486</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I appreciate very much Senator Murray's cooperation in trying to achieve the government's legislative timetable.

In fact, the matter was postponed because the committee was not in a position to report. This was a very rushed process. This bill was referred by the Selection of Bills Committee last Wednesday, with the closing of submissions on Friday.

We had 
 requested that this particular report be deferred until tomorrow on the basis that we did not believe we had adequate time to prepare a proper report. Given that the report is being presented at 10.15 and, as I understand it, could easily have been deferred until sometime tomorrow morning, I think it is rather unfortunate that the government did not have the grace to allow for the extension of the period for the committee to report on this bill given that the timetable of the report—that is, presenting the report now rather than tomorrow—will have no bearing on the actual timetable for the debate of this bill.</para><para>The only issue that might have arisen prior to the presentation of the report were it deferred until some hour tomorrow morning was that perhaps we would have been debating whether the bill will be exempted from the cut-off. If we are debating that tomorrow morning, it may still be that this bill is not exempted from the cut-off in which case it will not be debated in this session and will be debated in the next session in which the Senate sits. That is a matter which none of us has any certainty about at the moment, but we hear certain things in the media which indicate that perhaps we are likely to be here in August.</para><para>Nevertheless, we are talking about a bill which affects an export industry which returns billions of dollars to the Australian economy and affects thousands of rural producers and thousands of wheat growers. For this bill to be dealt with in this way, particularly in relation to the reporting of the committee and for the committee to have been given such an inadequate timetable, means that—I make no apologies for this—the opposition's minority report is not what I would have wished it to be in normal circumstances.</para><para>But the reality was that we had an extremely short timetable in which to prepare a minority report. There are still issues which warrant, in my view, serious consideration. There are issues which industry representatives have indicated they would want satisfaction for before they were satisfied the bill should pass in those circumstances. I think it is important that I draw that matter to the Senate's attention in terms of the tabling of 
 this report and the resolution that the bill be printed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>4491</page.no><name role="metadata">Crane, Sen Winston</name><name role="display">Senator CRANE</name><name.id>UW4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make one brief comment in terms of the processes as the chair of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.

I rise to support the remarks of Senator O'Brien, as he has quite clearly outlined the difficulties under which the opposition has been placed in this matter. I also concede there have been difficulties under which all members of the committee have been placed with respect to this matter, not the least of whom would be Senator Crane, the chair. The reason for that is the government's incompetence in dealing with this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>This is a most serious matter. This legislation has its genesis in the proposals to restructure the Australian Wheat Board. The first set of legislation came before the parliament last year. Senators will remember that it was the opposition's recommendation at that time that, because of the serious issues that were still unresolved within the industry—I repeat: within the industry—the original legislation, the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, be withdrawn and that the whole package of legislation be brought back before this parliament this year.</para><para>We were told that it was likely that the legislation, which is now the subject of consideration of the committee's report, would be available probably in May of this 
 year. That was our recommendation, but our recommendation was not picked up. What ultimately happened was that the parliament debated and dealt with the first tranche of the legislation involving the restructuring of the Australian Wheat Board. But, as I said, there were very serious outstanding issues still to be resolved—issues which went to the structure of the new companies and the share allocation of the company to replace the Australian Wheat Board; issues relating to the appropriate way in which the wheat industry fund should be dealt with; and particularly important issues regarding the taxation treatment of grower funds within the wheat industry fund.</para><para>Those issues were on the table and were still not resolved at the time the legislation was dealt with by this parliament last year. We were assured at the time that those issues would be resolved before the second set of legislation came before the parliament. Here it is now, 30 June, the end of the financial year and we have a situation where the committee has met and taken evidence from grower organisations around this country and it is still abundantly clear that there is no agreement across the broad range of organisations within the wheat industry. Even those organisations that support this legislation have raised serious reservations.</para><para>In conclusion, Senator Crane's analysis of how this matter has come before the committee is incorrect. We have cooperated all the way with the government. It is on their hands that the legislation has not been dealt with.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>4492</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Parer</inline>) proposed:</para><para>That the Senate do now adjourn.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>One Nation</title><page.no>4492</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>4492</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One Nation has of recent times been the subject of numerous speeches and commentaries, and tonight I wish to add my few thoughts. The degree of support One Nation ostensibly enjoys and the reasons for it are the subject matter of my contribution this evening. At the outset let me place on record my concern at and repulsion of One Nation's policies. In so doing, I do not seek to con 
 demn those who have voted in Queensland or indicated support through opinion polls.</para></talk.start><para>The policy elitism of recent years has been the factor in some members of our community expressing discontent with the established parties, which especially includes the Greens WA and the Democrats, who under the previous government were able to have too great a say about the issues of the day thereby often denying the aspirations of the vast bulk of Australians, some of whom are now rebelling. This political and policy elitism was, and still is, very destructive of our social fabric. The former Democrat leader admits to as much in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of Thursday, 18 June 1998. The Democrats are typical of that elitism, playing up to obscure policy positions and demanding their adoption in exchange for support at the expense of mainstream aspirations.</para><para>The Greens WA are also typical of that elitism. The Tasmanian Green senator yesterday asked a question oozing with smarmy elitism—exactly the behaviour and attitude which so many are now rebelling against. Allow me to remind the Senate what the question was. It stated:</para><para>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. You will have noticed One Nation's new policy of banning immigrants who do not pass an English test. Would it not be simpler to block or export people who are not clear on the name of our country and who think it is an eight letter word, minus the`l', pronounced `Austraya'?</para><para>That kind of question is hurtful and divisive to many thousands within our Australian community. If you do not spend all your time in the wilderness and, in fact, you do bother to mix with real people, as I and my colleagues on this side do, you readily understand that many thousands of our fellow Australians use that pronunciation for their country in the pubs, clubs, the RSLs, at churches, at parents and friends groups, at the football—you name it. There are thousands of Australians who pronounce `Australia' in the fashion of the leader of One Nation.</para><para>How she pronounces words is completely and utterly irrelevant to the debate. The Green WA attempt at personal humiliation because of a perceived lack of elocution should not 
 disqualify any of us from partaking in the future of this country. That sort of question was typical of the divisiveness which I condemn One Nation for.</para><para>On the basis of the Greens senator's concern about elocution, I suppose people like Dr Hewson and Robert Tickner, as two examples, should have been disqualified from participating in the national debate. The Greens senator may want us all to speak the Queen's English—a laudable aim but hardly vital. And the personal and immature attack of the Greens senator will undoubtedly drive more support to One Nation. Rather than concentrating on elocution, I suggest that we as a nation ought to be concentrating on content.</para><para>The task for this country is not to engage in schoolyard bullyboy behaviour—trying to tease somebody about the way they speak—but rather to engage in the clash of ideas and vision for this nation. The strident commentaries of the Left and their fellow travellers have led to counter overreaction by elements of the community to the contrived overreaction by the Left to the policy positions of the day.</para><para>Just take the 10-point plan, for example. The 10-point plan now looks so distinctly moderate next to One Nation's one-point plan, which is to totally abolish native title, a horrid prospect for this country. Yet our approach—which was moderate, which was considered, which was mature, which did take into account the possible reactions by different sides of the community—was pilloried by elements of the media who sought to portray it as extreme and racist, which it clearly is not. Those who need to live with native title and who do live with native title knew those allegations to be false. Unfortunately, what happens is that when moderate solutions are not successful otherwise moderate sensible people are seduced and/or driven by more extreme elements into the arms of more extreme solutions.</para><para>A case in point is the avoiding of environmental issues by the major parties. As a result, the Green movement started. Similarly, if the mainstream view is not reflective of the aspirations of the people, you will then get 
 other extreme organisations forming such as One Nation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">BARTLETT</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name></talker><para>—And the Liberals.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>—Senator Bartlett makes that marvellous interjection that the Liberal Party is somehow an extremist party—that from the person who claims to be the national campaign coordinator of the Australian Democrats reflects very poorly—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">STOTT DESPOJA</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name></talker><para>—A substantial claim.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>—on the Australian Democrats and, of course, indicates why their standing in the polls is receiving a substantial decline.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">STOTT DESPOJA</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name></talker><para>—Look at One Nation in Tasmania, Senator Abetz.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>—Madam President, isn't it amazing how the Australian Democrats go to you and ask you for protection against interjections during question time and other occasions and then have the audacity to engage in exactly the same behaviour which they so piously object to in the media?

In relation to the issue of the English language being spoken by our migrants, can I suggest that the One Nation policy is both hurtful and extreme. It would have meant that people such as Sir Arvi Parbo, Victor Chang and others may not have been able to come into this country and make the substantial contribution that they have made. And there would be very many Australians who feel very uncomfortable with One Nation's comments in relation to the speaking of the English language, because a lot of people within the community at large who are making a contribution today would have come to this country in the position of being hardly able to speak one word or a few words of English. So for One Nation to make those comments I find to be hurtful, distasteful and very divisive.</para><para>I can understand their concern if their view is that migrants ought to be taught English and assisted with the language, because that is so vital if you are to participate within 
 society. So what they ought to be arguing for, rather than their extremist policy, is the encouragement of migrants and the Australian migrant English program which the minister for immigration runs.</para><para>There are other matters that I wanted to canvass. Time has run out, but what we as a nation need to do is not engage in the sort of petty politicking of the Greens senator during question time yesterday. What we have to deal with is the real issues, the real content, and debunk the policies of One Nation once and for all to ensure that they do not get any stronger foothold in this country.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Copyright</title><page.no>4494</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>4494</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on a matter that is very important to a whole host of small businesses around this country involved in a whole range of activities, including the music industry. Primarily, I want to speak about government proposals in copyright amendment legislation to change the laws of this country that apply to copyright and, in particular, those that relate to the music industry.</para></talk.start><para>But there are two very important points to be made about how the government has gone about this. They brought in two bills: Copyright Amendment Bill 1997  and  Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . The first bill proposes to amend laws that relate to labelling and packaging. If those bills are passed by this chamber, they will have an immense effect on many small businesses around the country that have developed their business on the basis of a particular brand, label of a product or name of a product.</para><para>As a member of parliament, I have received numerous letters from many of these businesses, saying that they were basically unaware of the government's intention to introduce such legislation. For many of them—some of them have developed their businesses over a long period—it would mean a significant decline in their business, or it could wipe them out altogether.</para><para>As I say, I have received letters from the small business community. It is also interesting to note that a letter has been circulated to some members of parliament from the Sydney 
 Olympic Games Organising Committee that goes to this very question of sponsorship and the impact that this legislation which has been proposed by the government could have on potential sponsors, particularly name brand sponsors like Nike, Adidas and others, who might be providing sponsorship through local businesses—the agents, agencies or distributors of those products in this country.</para><para>I could not let it pass without saying something about fishing, for which I have a great love. I refer to people who have developed a business by distributing certain imported fishing products. Whilst we are developing a very capable and a very good domestic industry in the manufacture of fishing products, we still need to import them to a large degree. There is a national distributor for, say, Shimano fishing reels, which are considered to be among the top brand of fishing reels in various aspects of fishing—although, I have to say, not in my particular pursuit. They produce very good equipment and they are distributed through a national distributor and then there are sub-distributors in each state. Those people can, in effect, be wiped out by this government's legislative proposals. I have heard that the government intends to amend Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 1). To what extent, I do not know.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator, the bill is on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> .

I refer to the government's policy proposal for this type of activity—that is, the current copyright laws in this country—and how it will affect businesses in this country. Having built up a business, they then have expenditure that relates to advertising, transport and all sorts of other things that go to generating employment within our community. I think the government has fundamentally underestimated just how important are the proposals that they intend to put and the effect that they will have.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is no more so than in the music industry. In the music industry, it would seem that the minister's view is to pursue a commitment given by the present government prior to the 
 last election because they felt that it was a good thing to do politically; that it would deliver them some kudos politically to provide cheaper CDs to the Australian public. Everybody is in favour of cheaper everything; we all know that. But the reality is that, when it came down to it, the Senate committee which held an inquiry into this proposal found that all of the claims of the government, including those of the ACCC, were found wanting, on the basis of substantive evidence that these claims about cheaper CDs could not be supported.</para><para>The minister made a few modifications to what he proposed. He said to the Australian public and to the music industry, `To protect you against the importation of pirated CDs, to protect you against all sorts of other manner of things illegal, we will reverse the onus of proof. That's what we'll do.' He said publicly, on any number of occasions, in radio interviews, et cetera, that that is what he would do. Unfortunately for the minister, the Attorney-General's Department said something quite different. They told the Senate committee that they could not and would not reverse the onus of proof.</para><para>I recall asking the minister a question in this place as to what was meant by the reversal of onus of proof. He said that he did not really know, that he did not really have an opinion about that. It was rather odd that he had a number of opinions about it and how it could be achieved when he made those comments publicly. The reversal of onus of proof clearly means that you require a person—in this case, say, an importer—to prove that the product they intend to import does not breach the laws of this country. That is squarely what it means.</para><para>In reality, even with what the government proposes to do, there is a very major legal problem for the music industry and the people in it. Even today, under the existing copyright laws, there is a major problem for the existing music industry to prove that the CDs that are imported into this country are illegal. It is only under the present copyright laws that there exists the possibility for them to even catch up with imported products. The copyright laws are restrictive, but they are restric 
 tive for a very good, sound reason. The minister originally promoted the fact that the copyright laws had been changed in this country and in that country. In some countries, they have changed them back. Indeed, in one country, after 10 years of having the free market approach, they changed the law back because it had in effect wiped out their music industry.</para><para>So that is what we need to avoid as a country. I suppose the fact is that, as you pointed out, I should not talk about the bills and it is against the standing orders to do so. But I am puzzled at the moment as to what the government is intending to do with their proposals. I have heard all sorts of things, like the government intends to slip off the agenda one proposal that relates to Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 1) but continue on the basis of the other because they think the other is more politically acceptable because the kids and mums out there will all go for cheaper CDs. Well, I say to the government: you have a responsibility to govern in the interests of the country—that is, all of the country—and you should not apply unjustifiable, indefensible processes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drugs</title><page.no>4495</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>4495</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I begin my adjournment speech tonight, not by dignifying Senator Abetz's comments. I can understand his spurious attacks on the Democrats, because he may be feeling a little vulnerable. I rise to actually support his comment that we should not mock the language of others. I should put on the record that the reason I interjected was to save the senator losing the flow of his arguments, as could have been the case had I taken a point of order when he was adversely reflecting on members of the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>I rise tonight to debate an issue that is often considered taboo in our community. I begin by commending the funding that is provided under the national illicit drugs strategy, whereby $27.7 million has been allocated to non-government organisations to treat drug problems, focusing on the prevention of illicit substance use abuse amongst young people in 
 particular. I note that the funding applications actually close on 13 July this year.</para><para>In Australia we have just had Treatment Works week, which actually coincided with the United Nations International Day against Drug Abuse on 26 June. I take this opportunity to congratulate not only all of those who were involved in that particular program but all of those who are in the front line around Australia in attempting to reduce drug-related harm. I think it takes special people to work in that particular field.</para><para>Many social workers, health workers and youth workers have pointed out that criminality hampers education about drug abuse. In fact, one of the few media sources where I have actually heard realistic discussion about drug abuse and indeed the dangers of smoking marijuana and ways of getting help to stop has been Triple J. By freeing up police and legal resources used in the apprehension and punishment of marijuana users, we would have more funds available for health and social services. Illegality of drugs prohibits people from seeking help for addictions. It promotes secrecy, isolation and marginalisation.</para><para>As Hazel Hawke has said, `We all need to be a little more honest about drug use'. The use of marijuana in our community is now widespread. Research demonstrates this: almost half of Australia's teenagers have tried marijuana and more than 10 per cent smoke at least once a week. We need to recognise these facts. A 1994 survey even showed that 35 per cent of Young Liberals and 34 per cent of members of federal parliament have, at some stage, smoked marijuana. Had they been caught, of course, it is unlikely that they would actually be here. Since they were arbitrarily lucky enough to escape punishment, I think they owe it to others not as fortunate to be a little more honest about whether or not they support existing laws in relation to drugs.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">EVANS</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—But they didn't inhale.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—I take that interjection—Senator Evans insists they did not inhale. But the possession of a criminal record by those who have inhaled or those

Alcohol and tobacco, which of course are legal drugs, are sold in clearly marked containers specifying the associated health risks, content and purity. Such a system applied to currently illegal drugs possibly would be an integral step towards reducing death by overdose.</para><para>The Australian Democrats support harm minimisation over zero tolerance in relation to drug use. We believe drug abuse is a social and a health problem that should be addressed through medical and social services, not through the law and justice systems. We oppose the idea of making those people who choose to use marijuana criminals. We oppose the idea that otherwise law-abiding citizens should be turned into criminals for the personal use of a drug which is, according to the research, in widespread use—and has been in widespread use for many years.</para><para>Although there are a number of groups on record who support our policy—the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Parliamentary Group for Drug Law Reform; even the AMA are on record supporting drug reform—the Democrats are the only major political party which has actually been prepared to put out a policy, state our beliefs and identify where we stand on this issue. In addition to the high levels of support for decriminalisation of marijuana by the bodies I have just mentioned, a 1994 poll of federal politicians found that more than half of them were in favour of decriminalisation.</para><para>The South Australian government—in 1986—and, of course, the ACT government have relaxed laws in relation to marijuana. In effect, this is decriminalisation for small amounts. A report in May 1998 actually demonstrated that this change in South Australia's marijuana laws did not lead to an increase in use compared with other states. Since the 1970s, report after report has recommended decriminalisation of marijuana.</para><para>I recently received a letter from a person in relation to our drugs policy who made some 
 significant points about the existing government laws and policy. I quote:</para><para>There can be little argument that abuse of drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, is bad for an individual's health and detrimental to society. However, such harm is exacerbated by making substances illegal and hence, denying users access to health care and treatment programs. Today, despite the millions of dollars spent on law enforcement, drugs are available in nearly every city. In fact, marijuana is more readily available to school-age persons than alcohol—the black market is unlikely to ask for proof of age.</para><para>This young person finished off by saying:</para><para>End the war on drugs, release the prisoners, educate us.</para><para>When reports show that 24 per cent of young people have used marijuana before they turn 16, we are clearly crying out for responsible public health education about this drug, for rational public debate, not only in the community and in the media but in the parliament.</para><para>The Democrats are concerned about the fact that half the teenage population are risking criminal records because of the existing drug laws, but we are also concerned about the 10 per cent of teenagers who are smoking more than once a week.</para><para>In February 1998 the World Health Organisation concluded that cannabis was safer than alcohol and tobacco. That report, I might add, was unsuccessfully suppressed despite political pressure. We do not pretend that marijuana is a harmless substance. It is relatively benign in comparison to alcohol or heroin, but we do bear in mind that 70 per cent of females aged 14 to 24 years of age and 50 per cent of males usually consume alcohol in quantities which are hazardous or harmful. We are particularly concerned about statistics such as those from 1996 which showed that about 200 15- to 24-year-olds died due to heroin. That was a substantial increase from 1988.</para><para>There is a problem in mixing drugs. We know that it is unlikely that you could die from marijuana, except through a secondary source, but mixing drugs is risky. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the marijuana being used today is a great deal more potent than 
 that which may have been commonly available 20 years ago.</para><para>So the use of marijuana is not without serious health implications or issues—issues that we feel could be more readily addressed and more easily addressed if the use of marijuana was decriminalised. One of the reasons we support decriminalisation is that we believe there are potential dangers with marijuana use. The responsible use of any drug requires education. In a climate of fear and deception, where marijuana is swept under the table and where any drug debate is considered taboo, these serious health issues are not being properly addressed. A report to the United Nations General Assembly's special session on drugs earlier this year called for a shift in drug control policies from punishment to public health issues. It has been suggested that the global war on drugs is causing more harm than drug abuse itself.</para><para>The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) described the government's Tough on Drugs strategy launched in November last year as a balance between law enforcement and education, treatment and research. I believe that the balance is still far too much in favour of law enforcement. Justice James Woods noted that illicit drugs:</para><para>. . . have an enormous impact on corrupting police, particularly police who are otherwise decent, law-abiding and efficient detectives.</para><para>Drug issues are highly political, not least because the drug trade is highly lucrative. The drug economy is created by prohibition, which makes the commodity being illegally traded increasingly valuable.</para><para>We live on the largest island in the world. We are not going to be successful in shutting off the supply of this drug, but we can do something about demand, particularly abuse, overuse and misuse. We can help people avoid drug abuse. Criminalising them is not the way. Marijuana and other drugs can do great harm—we acknowledge that—but prohibition and punishment is not preventing drug use. We call for a debate on these issues—not only a debate in the parliament but a rational debate in the community and the media. We believe we should be shifting the balance from criminalisation and treating 
 this as a criminal issue to treating it as a social and health issue.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drugs</title><page.no>4498</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>4498</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is quite fortuitous that Senator Stott Despoja has tonight raised the issue of drugs, particularly from the demand side, because I want to speak about the supply side. I want to speak about illicit drugs in the community.</para></talk.start><para>The fight against drugs should unite governments of all persuasions and not be used for political point scoring. It is a problem that should be tackled as a community, a community made up of people of all races, all walks of life and in fact all political parties. That is the point I wish to discuss tonight—that the fight against illicit drugs in New South Wales is being hampered by the Carr government's half-hearted commitment to work with the federal government, while it is constantly blaming the Commonwealth for the policy failures of the New South Wales government.</para><para>For example, how hypocritical is it of Bob Carr and his government to take money confiscated from drug dealers and channel it into other areas? That is precisely what the Carr government has done. Mr Carr's police minister, Mr Whelan, told a recent parliamentary budget estimates committee that the Crime Commission, the body established to seize assets obtained through criminal activities, has taken a record $9.3 million from drug dealers since the legislation was widened last year to include organised crime. That amount is $4 million higher than for any previous year. Bob Carr, who likes to use any and every opportunity to try to deflect attention from his own incompetency, should surely practise what he preaches and use the funds in the war against drugs. After all, they were seized from people who profited from the misery of drugs.</para><para>But Mr Whelan told the estimates committee that the proceeds from the sale of confiscated goods will be used to fund anti-crime measures, such as the government's $700,000 campaign to educate the public about the new laws in New South Wales covering the carry 
 ing of knives. While this is a very worthy cause, surely Bob Carr should stick by his principles and use seized drug assets to combat drug use. It is not as if New South Wales is travelling at the front of the pack in combating illicit drugs. Victoria has arrested more heroin dealers in the past two years than New South Wales. New South Wales spends less per capita on law and order than any state other than Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The real recurrent expenditure by New South Wales is $194 per head, compared with $210 for Victoria, $218 for Western Australia, $213 for South Australia and $195 for Tasmania. These are not the Commonwealth's figures. These are the figures published by the steering committee for the review of Commonwealth-state service provision. It is just another example of how the Carr government is failing the people of New South Wales.</para><para>Obviously, Mr Carr's short-term memory problems have precluded him from acknowledging the government's Tough on Drugs strategy. That initiative was initially costed at $87.5 million over three years when it was announced last year, but such is the Commonwealth's commitment to the strategy that in this year's budget the funding was lifted to $215 million over five years.</para><para>Just what a menace illicit drugs are can be gleaned from statistics released by the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia. It found that in 1996 there were 634 heroin related deaths in Australia; up to 66 per cent of prisoners reported they were under the influence of alcohol or drugs when they committed their major crimes; more than 25 per cent of prisoners have a major drug problem; up to 80 per cent of property crime in New South Wales is drug related; illicit drugs are associated with more than 40,500 hospital bed days in Australia each year; on any given day specialist agencies provide residential or counselling services to more than 9,000 illicit drug users; and spending on illicit drugs amounts to some $57 billion a year.</para><para>The Commonwealth is seriously committed to this fight, which is why it has increased spending to battle drugs. The additional 
 spending will be broken into $50 million over four years for ways to address the use of drugs. This includes $21 million to strengthen the capacity of non-government treatment services to better assist those people with drug addiction and to help break the cycle of drug dependency and criminal behaviour; $4.36 million to evaluate and promote best practice in the treatment of illicit drug dependence; $15.5 million for a community-wide education and information campaign to discourage a new generation of drug users and addicts; and, $3.5 million to develop a strategic early warning system to alert governments to emerging drug problems. On top of this, there will be $50 million spent to find ways of tackling the supply side of the drug trade.</para><para>Once again, Bob Carr's selective memory was in evidence when all these initiatives were announced. He seemed to forget that the Commonwealth has already funded three strike force teams, and three strike force teams are based in New South Wales. The funding from the Commonwealth for strike force teams is $15.5 million, more than the funds for the new strike force teams announced in the latest round of announcements for the drug strategy.</para><para>The Commonwealth provided the funds for these new strike force teams because it recognises Sydney is a major gateway for the importation of drugs. In fact, the establishment of strike force teams could have led to calls from other states that they were being disadvantaged, but it did not because they recognised that the Commonwealth's strategy against drugs is not about winning votes but about saving lives and restoring shattered hopes.</para><para>Bob Carr also likes to claim that the Commonwealth has cut expenditure for Australian Customs in its drug detection activities. Again, he is making up exaggerated stories to try to create a smokescreen to hide his own government's failures in the battle against drugs. The reality is that, between 1991 and 1995, the number of personnel in Customs fell by more than 700. Those years—1991 to 1995—were, of course, years of the Labor government but, under the coalition, things have steadily improved. In 
 fact, Customs resources have been particularly targeted towards areas where they are likely to be of greatest benefit.</para><para>For example, in the 1996 budget, $26 million was provided over three years for technology specifically designed to aid in drug detection and interception. The coalition has also upgraded the Customs marine fleet, which enables the department to undertake surveillance up to 300 nautical miles off the coast, and there has been increased funding to match the increase in passenger movements in and out of Australia.</para><para>But it is in the area of heroin seizures that the result is most spectacular. In 1996 to 1997, Customs seized $40.6 million worth, compared with $15.4 million worth the previous year. The $40 million figure represents just under 170 kilos of seized heroin.</para><para>Let us look at what that means in terms of use: 300 grams of heroin represents 6,000 hits, or one hit for every student in 10 large high schools; one kilo represents 20,000 hits, or 10 hits for every professional football player in Australia; five kilos represents 100,000 hits, or one hit for everyone who might go to an Australian Rules grand final at the MCG; 32 kilos, the amount seized in one haul in 1997, represents 650,000 hits, or one hit for every person in the Northern Territory and Tasmania; and, 78 kilos, the amount seized in Sydney in May 1997, represents one hit for every household in Sydney, or one hit for every 15- to 19-year-old person in Australia.</para><para>It is clear then just what an impact the seizure of 170 kilos has on the illicit drug market, but still Bob Carr cannot bring himself to be positive. Bob Carr must stop his constant whine and whinge routine and, instead of his fatuous excuses, get stuck into the battle against drugs. His commitment seems to waiver.</para><para>For instance, how can you be serious about the battle against drugs when you have police stations, such as that at Canterbury in Sydney, advising that they will be open only from nine to five on normal business days? Does Mr Carr really think that they are the only hours in which traffickers traffic? Instead of looking for cheap shots, Mr Carr should be 
 directing his energy and attention to a positive and constructive approach to combating the flow of drugs into this country.</para><para>The Commonwealth has already clearly spelt out its commitment to this objective through strategies, policing and funding. It is time Bob Carr did the same. The deaths of 634 Australians a year from heroin, most of them tragically young, should wake us all up to see that the problem is too important and too urgent to be reduced to the level of political tit for tat.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>23:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>4500</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 11.05 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>4500</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>4500</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission—Commonwealth programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples 1995-96—</para><para>	 Handbook summary.</para><para>	 Individual program descriptions.</para><para>Advance to the Minister for Finance—Statement and supporting applications of issues—May 1998.</para><para>Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Act—Australian Institute of Health and Welfare—Australia's health 1998—Sixth biennial report.</para><para>Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act—Nuclear Safety Bureau—Report for the period 1 October to 31 December 1997 (NSB.QRM 41).</para><para>Provision for running costs borrowings—Statement and supporting applications of issues—May 1998.</para><para>Treaties—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Bilateral</inline> —</para><para>		 Text, together with national interest analyses—</para><para>			 Agreement on Medical Treatment for Temporary Visitors between the Government of Australia and the Government of New Zealand, done at Melbourne on 4 May 1998.</para><para>			 Exchange of Notes, done at Canberra on 4 June 1998, constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to further extend in force the Agreement relating to the Establishment
