The amendment uses almost the same wording as was endorsed by all parties in the Senate when amending the social security legislation bill in 1996. In that bill it was agreed to insert just such an amendment to ensure that the legislation would not be racially discriminatory. I move this amendment in similar words to ensure that this legislation will not be racially discriminatory.</para><para>The clear intent of the amendment—as it was the intent of Senator Margetts's amendment, which was defeated on Friday—is to ensure that the Racial Discrimination Act prevails so that we do not have discrimination as a result of the Native Title Amendment Bill. The question I put to other entities in this place is this: how can you argue against an amendment which will ensure that there will be no racial discrimination?</para><para>On <inline font-style="italic">Meet The Press</inline> yesterday, the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, Daryl Melham, 
 had this to say of the legislation coming through this place—which is satisfactory, as Labor sees it: `If we wanted to be destructive, we would be supporting the Greens' amendment, which is a clause-buster.'</para><para>The only way to take that is to understand that, like the government, and I presume Senate Harradine, the Labor Party will not be supporting this Greens' amendment because it busts racial discrimination in this legislation.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">HARRADINE</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—That is not true.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Senator Harradine says it is not true.

Professor Tony Blackshield, in commenting on Senator Margetts's amendment, made it clear that in his opinion the weak amendment coming up next does not do the job. It is not a clause-buster, Senator Harradine, through you, Madam Chair. It is not a clause-buster, as the Labor Party rightly described this one.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In this situation, we do need clause-busting legislation. If there is racial discrimination in this bill, and I say there is, let us bust it—let us call a spade a spade. Let us have an amendment here which will make sure there will be no racial discrimination.</para><para>If an amendment which Labor, Senator Harradine, the Liberal Party and the National Party voted for under the social security legislation was good enough then, please get up and explain, all of you, why it is not good enough for the indigenous people of this country. Why is this amendment not good enough to deal with the Wik 10-point plan which, I repeat, is racially discriminatory?</para><para>Through you, Madam Chair, conversely, if your 10-point plan is not discriminatory, Senator Minchin, then support this amend 
 ment. Why can't you support this amendment? What clause is there that needs busting, that you need to worry about? But you say there is none.</para><para>The Labor Party, the government and Senator Harradine say there is no racial discrimination, presumably, in the legislation—there are no clauses with discrimination. We all know that there are, but they say that there are not. So how can they argue against legislation which is tailor-made to seek out such discrimination and which gives the High Court the power to seek out such discrimination and knock it out of this bill if it is there? Instead of that, we have the Labor spokesman on the weekend saying, `We can't support that amendment from the Greens because it might clause-bust where there is racial discrimination.' Well, they are hoist with their own petard; they are uncovered by their own argument. There is no excuse for not supporting this amendment, as there was no excuse, in my books, for not supporting Senator Margetts's even stronger amendment of last week.</para><para>To each of those who will follow and who oppose this amendment, I will repeat the question: if it was good enough for you to back the social security legislation affecting all Australians, why is it not good enough for you to back this legislation which specifically affects the indigenous people of this country?

The only change this time is the addition of the clause note; 7(2) as a substantive subclause was deliberated upon and carried last year. The clause note has a dual effect. It says:</para></talk.start><para>The provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</inline>  apply to the performance of functions and exercise of powers conferred by or authorised by this Act.</para><para>It clarifies that.

I would argue that the clause note emboldens the operation of the RDA with respect to performance of functions and exercise of powers. I remind you that in the debate last time, the amendment—I think at that stage it was Senator Harradine's—was carried. The argument went along the lines that the amendment incorporating the RDA had the effect of ensuring that the legislation would have to be assessed as a whole as against the Racial Discrimination Act rather than on a one-by-one clause busting operation. So there is no difference in terms of the substantive clause or the interpretation given to it by the clause note.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>2029</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you for that explanation, 
 Senator Bolkus. I was on the wrong track, so I am happy to be pulled back but, in a sense, part of what I said still stands—that is, we have subsection 2 because of the vote for validation of those intermediate past acts. Clearly, it needs to be here so that we do not turn around and reverse the vote which was taken. I was simply pointing out that the Democrats had great problems with and voted against the validation and that is why this subsection gives us some problems. However, I thank you for the explanation that this was in accord with what we passed last time. The Democrats and, I presume, the Greens would prefer the amendment which we moved and which was defeated on Friday, but I give an indication that we will vote for this as a very much second-best option.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>2029</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The problem with this amendment is not that we did or did not vote for it last time. In fact, I am aware of the fact that not only did we vote for it last time, but we helped to put it. The reason we were convinced to vote for this version amongst the various versions last time was that the legal advice we were given at the time indicated that it was a stronger Racial Discrimination Act amendment than has subsequently proven to be the case. The legal advice at the time—and we all know what kind of pressure cooker situation we were in at the end of last year—was that it was an amendment which would subject the bill to the Racial Discrimination Act. The problem with the reading of the bill—and Senator Bolkus knows this very well, although he says that it is a whole measure—is that the Racial Discrimination Act is only taken into consideration when there is any doubt, and that means it is taken as an interpretive tool. In all the advice we have received, that seems to be the growing consensus.</para></talk.start><para>The government know this. I guess we will all be looking very carefully to see what the government do in relation to this, but they have the same access to legal advice as all the rest of us. They have seen the advice that Senator Harradine has been given. They have seen the advice that we have tabled from Professor Tony Blackshield and they have 
 their own legal advisers. So the government know that the amendment which is being re-put with the addition from Senator Bolkus is not going to save this legislation from racial discrimination.</para><para>If I were unkind, I would read out the various quotes from Senator Bolkus at the end of last year where he mentioned that a whole range of people indicated that this bill was racially discriminatory. Of course we know that. We also know that, if there is quite clearly racially discriminatory elements of the bill, elements that do not need to be interpreted, then they will remain racially discriminatory and there is really not a lot we can guarantee the High Court will do.</para><para>In fact, we believe this is a false premise. We have had a rotten bill put together and, let us face it, that is what we are talking about. The bill that is left, the bill as we see it, the bill that we are debating, is what is left from the decimated rights of indigenous Australians. It is a rotten bill, it is a discriminatory bill. We believe it is the wrong thing to do to get a rotten bill, stick a Racial Discrimination Act amendment in it and then say, `That's fine. We've done our bit for Aboriginal people.' It is exactly what happened during the Hindmarsh legislation, and we know exactly what protection that afforded the Ngarrindjeri women.</para><para>Therefore, I would say to the ALP that it is not good enough. They know that, we know that, the advice from Senator Harradine would indicate that he knows it, too, and the government know it, too. This is not a clause-buster. It will make very little difference to the government's bill, except where there is interpretation needed. The fact that it was voted for last year was simply that, in the pressure cooker at the time, we received advice that has proven not to be accurate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>2030</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think I put last Friday the government's reasons for opposing all the proposed amendments on the Racial Discrimination Act. Our position has not changed since this matter was debated last December. The only difference in the proposition being put before us now from that which 
 was put last December is the addition of the note, which I guess purports to try to limit the operation of the provision but, regrettably, the substantive part of the clause has not changed. It still reads that this act is intended to be read and construed subject to the provisions of the RDA. The only exception is the validation regime. From the government's point of view, that still leaves the degree of considerable legal uncertainty which motivated the previous Keating Labor government to consider and reject the inclusion of such a provision in the original Native Title Act. As I said, a particular provision was inserted in that act which we have retained in the Native Title Amendment Bill.</para></talk.start><para>I refer senators to what Father Frank Brennan has been saying and indeed what he said in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on this matter. It hardly needs to be said that Father Frank Brennan is a great supporter of the Aboriginal position on this issue,  not the government's. As he said today in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>:</para><para>Since Wik, people have confused the two issues of non-discrimination and making the new law "subject to the RDA". It is essential that any law be as non-discriminatory and certain as possible. Now there is a new RDA problem: any legislative regime implementing Wik has to accommodate prevailing pastoralists' rights over yielding native title rights.</para><para>Such a regime cannot be rendered subject to the RDA because the RDA ensures that all rights are treated the same. If the Aboriginal and government lawyers can come up with a Solomon-like compromise on the RDA, well and good. Otherwise the Senate should leave it well alone.</para><para>I think Father Brennan has identified the considerable problems just in one area alone—that is, accommodating the High Court's decision, which we are doing in this bill. The High Court said that, where native title rights have survived and they run into the operation of the pastoralists' rights, then, as a matter of common law, the rights of the pastoralists shall prevail. Why this area is difficult is that not only are we dealing with the interaction of laws that for the first time really involve a property right that is inherently only available to people of a particular race, but that right is founded in the common law, which is, as a fundamental part of our 
 legal system, always subject to statutory rights.</para><para>As you would know, democratically elected parliaments make statutory law and courts make common law, and statutory law will always prevail in any circumstances. Here we have a situation where the common law right is available only to people of a particular race and, therefore, not surprisingly, the High Court has said that, where there is any clash, the statutory rights prevail. In many cases, as we know, the statutory rights are held by Aboriginal pastoralists. There are Aboriginal pastoralists who exercise these statutory rights and, where their statutory rights conflict with the surviving native title rights, their statutory rights must prevail, as a matter of law, as declared by the High Court.</para><para>Therefore, in the words of Frank Brennan, it is impossible to impose this sort of provision. The Labor Party's wording still leaves it open to someone to propose that each and every provision of the Native Title Act be read and construed subject to provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. It does not eliminate that possibility. We do not believe the note, of itself, is a sufficient limitation on the potential operation of this clause.</para><para>We have to remember that we are talking about a Native Title Act which, as I said before, is probably the most significant federal imposition on land law and land management in this country. It means that virtually every major development on 79 per cent of Australia must comply with that act. If everything done potentially under the Native Title Act is subject to being subsequently challenged by a litigant claiming that there is some inconsistency with the RDA, it would be a legal nightmare, for the reasons most eloquently put by Senator Harradine before lunch in a previous debate.</para><para>This is a proposition, as I say, the Senate considered in 1993 and rejected because of the potential legal implications—the legal chaos that could result, the legal uncertainty over thousands and thousands of titles issued under this act and the potential nightmare of every provision being challenged. We maintain that the act, as amended, will continue to be beneficial to Aboriginal people. If there is 
 a view that that is not the case, then of course that can be challenged in the High Court and the High Court can decide whether there is any infringement of the races power. But it is simply unworkable and unacceptable and producing of enormous uncertainty to subject the Native Title Act to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2031</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Just briefly, the minister seems to have forgotten that something seems to have been missed out here—that is, the certainty for Aboriginal people that they will not be discriminated against and they will not lose their rights.

That has influenced me greatly in my consideration of this particular matter.</para></talk.start><para>First of all, I suggest to the minister that, far from creating uncertainty, the way the opposition's amendment is now framed is going to give you considerably more certainty than otherwise. Surely it is not considered that proposed section 7(1) is ambiguous because it speaks of the Native Title Act being `read and construed subject to the provisions of the RDA'? It does not say the Native Title Act is `subject to the RDA'. That is a matter of which the government should take full consideration. Presumably it would be much more uncertain if it said that the Native Title Act is `subject to the RDA', but it says that the Native Title Act is to be `read and construed subject to the provisions of the RDA'.</para><para>If the government's argument is that proposed section 7(1) is ambiguous, the ambiguity can be removed by a statement of the parliament in a manner which will give effective guidance to the interpretation of the law by the courts. This is precisely what the opposition's amendment does. It takes note 301 from the High Court in Western Australia v. The Commonwealth and incorporates it 
 into the legislation. The actual note before us says:</para><para>The provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</inline>  apply to the performance of functions and exercise of powers conferred by or authorised by this Act.</para><para>I would have thought that that ought to have gone into the legislation as a substantive clause in any event, and I would not have thought the government would have any objection to that first sentence of the note. The second sentence is, as I noted, from WA v. The Commonwealth, footnote 301, and says:</para><para>To construe this Act, and thereby to determine its operation, ambiguous terms should be construed consistently with the <inline font-style="italic">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</inline>  if that construction would remove ambiguity.</para><para>Of course, that is not a clause-busting provision.

On the resumption, however, the Senator informed the Senate that he had changed his mind and that he now proposed to support the amendment.2 As a result of Senator Harradine's vote, the amendment was passed by the Senate. 
</para><para>In the House of Representatives on Saturday, 6 December 1997, the Prime Minister identified the Senate's amendment of s 7(1) as one of the four reasons for the Government's decision to reject the Bill as amended by the Senate. He said, "The third of the proposals which we reject is the proposal to subject the Native Title Act to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act."3 However, a detailed consideration of the amendment, indicates that the Government, by so characterising the proposal, has misunderstood the effect of the Senate's RDA amendment and that there is no technical legal justification for the Government's rejection of it.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">History of s 7 of the Native Title Act</inline></para><para>Before considering the Senate's amendment of s 7, it is worthwhile reviewing the history of the section.

The amendment (Green amendment No. 1A inserting a new clause 6A) was moved by the Greens and supported by the then Government as well as the Democrats and Senator Harradine. The wording of the provision was a compromise reached by the Government, the Democrats and the Greens in order to minimise the uncertainty which the Government feared might flow from a provision which subjected the whole of the Native Title Act to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Senator Gareth Evans acknowledged this point in the debate:</para><para>The concern was that if we overemphasised the specific need for continued consistency with the RDA, perhaps [the legislation's being a special measure under s. 8 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975] might somehow be put at risk, or other unforeseen consequences may arise. . . . [The provision] makes clear that the Racial Discrimination Act will apply to the provisions of this act and conduct carried out under it. . . . There has never been any doubt about our good faith in wanting the RDA to apply. We have just been concerned about possible unforeseen technical consequences flowing from its application. I think those concerns are met by this drafting.4 
</para><para>Senator Alston questioned Senator Evans on whether the amendment might itself have unforeseen consequences. He referred by way of example to a number of provisions in the Bill including one preserving public access to beaches. (This provision is to be found in s 212(2) of the Act). Senator Evans replied:</para><para>As to the other specific matter that Senator Alston raised on the question of access to beaches, there is I suppose a question mark which does still exist in one's mind. . . . It is not inconceivable that that [provision] might possibly be construed as being a discriminatory act against Aboriginal people in breach of the RDA.</para><para>If that is a problem then the parliament will just have to deal with that when it arises in an explicit way. . . . Having regard to, but not being determined in our response by, the advocacy of Aboriginal groups, our belief is that the risk factors, if you like, associated with having a clause like this are not so great as to outweigh the utility of having a clear and resounding demonstration in the body of the legislation itself, not just the preamble, that we really do value the RDA and want to give it effective operation.5</para><para>Prior to the enactment of the Native Title Act, the Western Australian parliament had passed its own legislation purporting to establish an alternative native title regime to that proposed in the Commonwealth legislation.6 Under the WA legislation common law native title was extinguished and replaced with statutory rights of traditional usage within a regime prescribed by the Act. After the enactment of the Native Title Act, the WA Government commenced proceedings in the High Court which, inter alia, challenged the validity of the Native Title Act and various substantive provisions thereof.7 This was an important part of WA's case as s 11 of the Native Title Act (which applied to State legislation passed on or after 1 July 1993) provided that native title was not able to be extinguished contrary to the Act. By virtue of s 109 of the Constitution inconsistent WA legislation would have no valid operation.</para><para>In the course of the case, the WA Government argued that s 7(1) was destructive of the substantive provisions of the Native Title Act. The submission was summarised by the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ as follows:</para><para>The Native Title Act was said to discriminate in favour of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and thus to offend the Racial Discrimination Act. As s 7(1) preserved the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act, so the argument ran, the offending provisions of the Native Title Act "must be regarded as inoperative".8 The High Court dismissed the submission. The joint judgment said 
 that the argument encountered considerable obstacles and gave three reasons, the effect of which may be summarised as follows:</para><para>1. It is not easy to detect any inconsistency between the Native Title Act and the Racial Discrimination Act.</para><para>2.	 If there were any discrepancy in the operation of the two Acts, the Native Title Act can be regarded either as a special measure under s 8 of the Racial Discrimination Act or as a law which, though it makes racial distinctions, is not racially discriminatory so as to offend the Racial Discrimination Act or the International Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</para><para>3.	 Even if the Native Title Act contains provisions inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 both Acts must be construed so as to avoid absurdity and to give to each of the provisions a scope for operation.9</para><para>The joint judgment then stated that the only manner in which the Native Title Act could be construed as affecting the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 was in the application of the ordinary rule of construction that the general provisions of an earlier Act must yield to the specific provisions of a later Act. The judges concluded:</para><para>Section 7(1) provides no basis for interpreting the Native Title Act as subject to the Racial Discrimination	  Act. The Native Title Act prescribes specific rules governing the adjustment of rights and obligations over land subject to native title and s 7(1) cannot be construed as intending to nullify those provisions. It may be that s 7(2) is otiose but that provision is properly to be seen as inserted out of an abundance of caution. It follows that the inconsistency between the WA Act and the Racial Discrimination Act either survived enactment of the Native Title Act or, if the Native Title Act affected the relevant provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, from the time when that occurred, an inconsistency arose between the WA Act and s 11 of the Native Title Act.10</para><para>In other words the High Court was quite explicit that s 7(1) did not nullify the substantive provisions of the Native Title Act as argued by WA. However, as regards the effect of the subsection, the High Court did not make a definitive finding. Earlier in the judgment the judges said, "It is difficult to identify the legal purpose which this provision is intended to serve."11 And earlier still they said in a footnote:</para><para>Although nothing in the Native Title Act affects the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act, nothing in the Racial Discrimination Act is capable of affecting the operation of the Native Title Act properly construed. However, to 
 construe the Native Title Act and thereby to determine its operation, ambiguous terms should be construed consistently with the Racial Discrimination Act if that construction would remove ambiguity 12</para><para>In the context of the case before it, the High Court did not need to resolve the difficulty in identifying the legal purpose which s 7(1) was intended to serve. The WA legislation was inconsistent with both the Racial Discrimination Act and the Native Title Act. Therefore, if, in accordance with the normal rules of construction, the general provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act must yield to the specific provisions of the Native Title Act, then the WA legislation was inconsistent with s 11 of the Native Title Act. If, however, by operation of s 7(1) the general provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act did not yield, then the WA legislation was inconsistent with that Act.</para><para>The uncertainty which the High Court's reasoning exposed as to the legal efficacy of s 7(1) still exists and will continue to exist until the parliament amends the provision or the High Court in a suitable case decides the issue.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senate Debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</inline></para><para>Despite this uncertainty and the High Court's criticism of s 7(1), the Government in its Bill did not seek to amend the provision. Only s 7(2) was to be amended to include reference to intermediate period acts in the exclusion provisions of that subsection.</para><para>The Opposition, in its extensive list of amendments released shortly prior to the Senate debate did not seek to amend s 7(1) either. Rather it proposed to amend the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 by adding to the operative part of the Bill a new section containing an express declaration of the intention of parliament that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act are to prevail over the provisions of the amending Act. That proposed amendment has been criticised by the Government and others for going the extra distance which Senator Evans in 1993 had indicated the Opposition, when they were in government, were not prepared to go. But more fundamentally, it applied only to the amending Act. In other words, when reading the Native Title Act as amended by the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, one would have to be alert to what sections were in the original Act and what sections had been inserted or amended by the amending Act. The uncertainty identified by Senator Evans in 1993 was liable to be compounded by the form of the proposed amendment.</para><para>By the time the Opposition amendment came to be moved in the Senate, however, further consideration had been given to the matter and the amendment had been considerably refined. Rather than adding 
 a separate section, the amendment as moved altered the wording of the existing s 7(1) to read:</para><para>(1) This Act is intended to be read and construed subject to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.</para><para>This is a substantially different provision to that which had originally been proposed by the Opposition. However, the Government does not seem to have comprehended the difference. In the debate Senator Minchin said, "Could I just forewarn Senator Bolkus that I would not mind his explaining this quite innocent question: what is the difference in the wording between the original ALP amendment on this issue and the new amendment?"13 Without waiting for an answer to his question, Senator Minchin continued his speech. It is apparent from this speech that the Senator was in fact still focusing on the vices demonstrated by the original amendment. He criticised the Opposition for proposing something that they were not prepared to contemplate in 1993 and he used such words as "To make the Bill subject to the RDA will have exactly the consequences which . . . Senator Evans forecast, and therefore it is unacceptable."14</para><para>Similarly, Senator Harradine seems to have been of the view that the amendment as moved was in substance no different from the original Opposition amendment. In his pre-lunch speech he stressed the uncertainty issue:</para><para>I am saying that this measure we have before us today is really a huge invitation to constant, endless litigation. It is not going to do anybody any good. If that is the outcome of placing the RDA provision that has been moved by Senator Bolkus into this legislation, it certainly will create widespread uncertainty, which we do not wish to have. . . . In putting the RDA provision in here, you want a lawyers picnic. You do not want to have a degree of certainty. You are inviting the government to say, `This measure is totally unworkable'. . . . It is unworkable because every provision in the legislation will have to be subject to the RDA. There will be endless litigation about it.</para><para>Why did we not put it in the 1993 legislation? For the very reason that we ought not be putting it in here. The Labor government at that time knew that it was a nonsense to put a similar provision in the Native Title Act.15</para><para>In his post-lunch speech it is apparent that the Senator more fully appreciated the distinction between the original Opposition amendment and the amendment as moved. Focusing on the words of the amendment, as well as the important political significance of the issue itself, he said:</para><para>I am coming to the view that, unless we do what is being proposed—that is, to have the bill read 
 and construed subject to the provisions of the RDA—we may be sending the wrong messages to the whole of Australia and to all Australians . . . .</para><para>I feel that it would be unwise for the government to maintain the view that it would be unworkable. The view that I had come to was that the government would regard it as totally unworkable if the RDA provisions went in. I hope the government will see that, in the end, it is probably better to have the RDA provisions there. We tried it in 1993 in subsection 7(1) . . . . As has been expressed around the chamber, subsection 7(1) of the RDA [sic] was found by the High Court to be less than operable. That is the message that has been given to us by the High Court. Perhaps we ought to heed that message and include what is being proposed by the opposition in this bill. Otherwise you could have efforts by some people to overturn this measure by stating that the measure is not constitutional under the race power.16</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Why the Government can and should accept the Senate's RDA amendment</inline></para><para>The Senator's speech encapsulates the elements which justify the amendment as moved and ultimately adopted by the Senate:</para><para>1.	 It is a response to the High Court's criticism of the existing provision.</para><para>The Court did not have to decide the legal effect of the provision because the WA legislation was held to be inconsistent with both the Racial Discrimination Act and the Native Title Act. However, the Court did indicate that, if the provision had any meaning at all, then it was limited to altering the ordinary rule of construction applying to inconsistent statutes. The Senate amendment confirms that that is indeed the legal effect which is to be given to the provision. Were s 7(1) to remain unamended then ultimately the High Court would have to decide if the provision had any efficacy. Until such a case were heard and determined there would be uncertainty in this regard. What the Senate has done is to remove that uncertainty and to make clear how the legislature wants the provision construed rather than leaving it up to the High Court to make the decision for it.</para><para>2.	 It re-enacts what the parliament agreed to do in 1993</para><para>Contrary to what Senator Minchin, in the hurly burly of the debate, may have thought the effect of the amendment to be, it should now be seen, in the light of considered analysis, that it does not do that which the Prime Minister asserted in his speech to the House on 6 December 1997. The amendment does not say, "This Act is subject to the provisions of the Racial Discrimi 
 nation Act 1975". Rather, it comprehends the construction issue identified by the High Court in footnote 301 and in the third of its reasons for rejecting the submission of the WA government on the effect of s 7(1). In that regard it should be noted that the High Court said that "Section 7(1) provides no basis for interpreting the Native Title Act as subject to the Racial Discrimination Act "17</para><para>3.	 It would be unwise for the Government to maintain the view that it would be unworkable.</para><para>The High Court said that s 7(1) does not nullify the specific provisions of the Native Title Act. To reinforce that point the judges said that s 7(2) may be otiose and "is properly to be seen as inserted out of an abundance of caution."18 Section 7(1), in its original or amended form, so construed does not provide a firm foundation for a challenge to specific provisions of the Native Title Act such as those relating to past acts, future acts, or, in terms of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, confirmation of past extinguishment.</para><para>4.	 Failure to respond to the High Court's criticism of s 7(1) would send the wrong message to Australia and to all Australians.</para><para>The High Court having expressed doubt as to the efficacy of s 7(1), the issue then becomes whether the parliament considers it sufficiently important for it to amend the provision so as to remove the doubt. By failing to act, the parliament will indicate that it no longer considers an effective RDA provision to be worth worrying about and that it is prepared to let the High Court decide whether the relationship is to have any efficacy..</para><para>5.	 The presence in the Act of an effective s 7(1) enhances the prospects that the Native Title Act as amended by the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 will be held to be constitutionally valid as being within the races power (s 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution). The Government has consistently maintained that its Bill is not racially discriminatory. Many critics have rejected that assertion and have contended that because the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 does (and the Native Title Act as amended by the Bill will) racially discriminate against the indigenous people of Australia, it will be found by the High Court to be invalid. That view depends on the High Court's holding that the races power requires legislation to be beneficial. This is an issue which is yet to be resolved. If there is such a requirement, then the presence in the legislation of an effective provision relating to the Racial Discrimination Act will provide additional scope for the Government to argue that 
 the Bill and the amended Act, on balance, are beneficial and/or a special measure.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>If the Government were to agree to the Senate's RDA amendment, there would be less—not more—uncertainty than exists under the present legislation. The issue of access to the beaches, for example, remains whether the parliament adopts the original s 7(1) or the amended form. But that is not a problem created by the Senate amendment of December 1997. The parliament in 1993 indicated when it enacted the Greens amendment No. 1A that it was prepared to accept the risk in that regard. Four years later we still do not know whether the risk is real or not. (But the High Court's comments on the limited effect of s 7 suggest that it is not real.) However, we do know that by leaving s 7(1) in its unamended form the uncertainty as to the efficacy of s 7(1), identified by the High Court in 1995, will remain until the High Court, rather than the parliament, decides the issue.</para><para>1 See, for example, Australian, 6 December 1997, p. 6; Sydney Morning Herald, 6 December 1997, p. 2; Age, 6 December 1997, p. 14.</para><para>2 Senate Proof Hansard 4-5 December 1997, p.

I would point out to the Senate and re-emphasise a number of points in the notes as to why the government can and should accept the Senate's RDA amendment: first of all, because it is a response to the High Court criticisms of the existing provisions, and it is the situations that have given rise to those criticisms by the High Court that have concerned the government. The High Court did not have to decide the legal effect of provisions because the WA legislation was held to be inconsistent with the RDA, and also with the Native Title Act. But the court indicated that, if the provision had any meaning at all, then it was limited to altering the ordinary rule of construction applied to inconsistent statutes. The Senate amendments confirm that that is indeed the legal effect which is to be given to the provision.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Secondly, the RDA amendment actually re-enacts what parliament agreed to do in 1993 and I have to point out that I have often wondered why the government was so concerned about this particular matter. I fear that the government may have thought that the effect of the amendment was that it should be now seen, in the light of considered analysis, that it does not do what was suggested by the government the last time we met. The Prime Minister asserted in his speech on 6 November, and this is very important—it is worth while reading the Prime Minister's comments—that, because of the RDA amendment, the act would be subject to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.</para><para>In fact, as I have just indicated, that is not the situation at all on this particular measure. We are saying that the provision means that it is to be read and construed subject to the RDA. It does not say that the Native Title Act is subject to the RDA. Now, of course, it is made even more certain because the opposition is suggesting, and I am supporting it, that it comprehends the construction issue identified in the High Court's footnote of 301 in the third of its reasons for rejecting the submission of the WA government on the effect of section 7(1). In that regard it should be noted that the High Court said:</para><para>Section 7.(1) provides no basis for interpreting the Native Title Act as subject to the Racial Discrimination Act.</para><para>That is something that account should be taken of by the whole of the committee, including the government. The third point that I make is that it would be unwise for the government to maintain the view that the provisions that we are suggesting would be unworkable. The point is that the High Court said that section 7(1) does not nullify the specific provisions of the Native Title Act. To reinforce that point, the judges said that section 7(2) is:</para><para>. . . properly to be seen as inserted out of an abundance of caution.

Nothing in this amendment of the Labor Party has so altered the intent of the Senate's amendment in such a way as to suggest that the government could do anything other than reject this amendment.</para></talk.start><para> It remains a critical provision for us because of the enormous impact of the Native Title Act on Australia. Now,  following the Wik decision, the amended act will affect every single exploration and mining lease and major development on 79 per cent of Australia. That is where all that sort of activity occurs anyway, so we are talking about everything in Australia being affected by the Native Title Act as amended. We simply are of the view, on balance, that to subject the act to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act would render the practical workability of the Native Title Act so uncertain for the billions and billions of dollars of activity that occurs every year in Australia as to make this an unacceptable proposition.</para><para> Thousands of people every day decide whether they are going to invest their money, seek licences, seek leases or engage in developments that create jobs and create wealth. They have to go through all the state provisions to achieve what they want to do. Then there is another layer to go through of everything to do with the Native Title Act. Any responsible lawyer advising any major developer is going to say, `Yes, we think that, if you do all this, you'll comply with the state things. If you do all this, we think you'll comply with the Native Title Act, but of course I've got to tell you that, in terms of your investors, your shareholders, your lenders and everybody else, there is always the possibility of someone challenging what you are doing in your investment and your lease, even if you've got it validly under the NTA, as somehow invalidly issued because of the operation of the RDA.'</para><para>They may not have a case, but for a developer who is risking shareholders' funds of, as we know with Century,  a billion dollars or whatever, you have to look at the risks. If there is a risk that the lease upon which your whole investment depends could be held up in court for who knows how long even though you have passed all the steps along the way and got it validly issued under the Native Title Act—which of course is not an easy process—but, because of some asserted problem resulting from the fact that the act is intended to be read and construed subject to 
 the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, it will have, in our view, potentially devastating consequences.</para><para> To pick up on what Senator Harradine said, he is seeking to assure us that the words `to be read and construed subject to the RDA' are different from saying `subject to the RDA'. He may be right, but he may be completely wrong. I can guarantee you that, if you were to pass this and we were to accept it, there will be a legal argument put that, in practice, there is really no difference and that the act should be seen as subject to the RDA. That will be an argument that would be put—who knows what a court might find? Who knows then whether we are going to be in a situation where every provision of the NTA is to be examined subject to the provision of the RDA or whether everything done under the NTA is subject to challenge as being somehow inconsistent with the RDA.</para><para>I have to say no-one in here has yet given me an answer to the very problem identified by Father Brennan—that we are now dealing with native title having survived on pastoral leases, an issue that the Senate did not have in its mind when it passed the Native Title Act. We now have a situation where the High Court has said there is a hierarchy of rights on pastoral leases, which is totally inconsistent with the whole notion of the RDA that you have equal rights.</para><para>From the other point of view, you also have to acknowledge and remember that the right to negotiate is a procedural right available only to a certain group of people, not to any other titleholders. It is arguable—and the argument is put—that it is a discriminatory right. If you start imposing these sorts of double jeopardy propositions, in our view you do enormous damage to the certainty that is required of the law, particularly in an area like property law where the certainty that is required is fundamental to the prosperity of the whole nation. The very issue that we are all concerned about—the workability of the Native Title Act—is dramatically affected potentially by the operation of this provision.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>2038</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In a way what Senator Minchin says corroborates the point of view that we have been

The fact is there is double talk on the other side of the chamber when it comes to this provision. Senator Minchin says that it will affect every single development on 79 per cent of Australia. What about the indigenous interests there? He is saying that indigenous interests in their land, in their traditional rights and in their culture being given integrity are going to be serially dented, eroded and affected by this panoply of developments that he foresees across 79 per cent of Australia. We can argue with that one, but that is the one that the Prime Minister brought forward.</para><para>`They should have no protection if it discriminates against them'—that is what is being said here. The government does not want the indigenous people of this country to be protected when it moves to back those who would develop the country in a way which is inimical to their rights and interests. It is more than that. This is cutting the ground from under the indigenous people's rights to have even a say. Let us remember that.</para><para>These developments are not just mines; they are dams, cotton crops, broad scale plantations, potential woodchip operations, deep sea fisheries, oil drillings, roads, canals and fences. There are huge changes to northern Australia coming up. The government is saying, `We are not going to give the indigen

That of itself would be bad enough, but Senator Harradine and the Labor Party are saying, `Ditto: the indigenous people get no say in the transformation of their country that is coming up.'</para><para>The government is saying, `Let's not have the Racial Discrimination Act surveying this loss of rights to the indigenous people.'

But we hope it will tie the High Court's hands in a way that it is not going to get down to any specific clauses in this legislation which may be racially discriminatory.'</para><para>The best the High Court can do is weigh up all the discrimination with the benefits and, if on balance it is satisfied that it is not too bad for the Aboriginal people, then the discrimination stands. There is to be no clause busting here; discriminatory clauses which specifically discriminate against the indigenous people of this country stand. That is what is being put to the Senate. That is why we oppose it.</para><para>As Senator Woodley said, the Labor Party, Senator Harradine and the government having failed the test on this issue now leave us in the position where we support the weak fall-back provision, the one we thought was strong last December. The problem with that is that this is going to be revisited not just on us but on this community for a long time to come. You cannot discriminate against people through legislation and get away with it. You cannot divest yourself of the responsibility as legislators to leave it to the courts to sort it out.</para><para>Senator Harradine says we should have clarity here. The clarity was in Senator Margetts's amendment and the amendment I moved this morning, both of which he opposed. They said to the High Court, `Discrimination in this legislation will be removed.' That is what our amendments said. Senator Harradine voted that down. The Labor Party voted that down. The government voted that down.</para><para>So the best we get is, `Put it back to the High Court without clarity and hope it will come up with a resolution.' That is not strong or courageous legislating. That is, at best, ducking the issue. I submit that there will be people voting for this legislation who will be hoping it has no effect, taking into account the Brennan theory that the problems coming out of it are too much for us to face up to. I submit that, given our history, it is about time we did take a stand. That might cause the community a little bit of difficulty. But at least we should face up to reversing the troubles that the indigenous people have had in the past and making sure that we do not compound them into the future.</para><para>The final thing I want to say—and I do not want to allow this to pass—is that I challenged the Labor Party, I challenged Senator Harradine, and I challenged the government to get up and say why they did not support the clear indiction to the High Court not to allow racial discrimination; and why they do not support busting clauses which are discriminatory. Not one of them got to their feet. I am not allowed to call that cowardly but I submit that that is what it is. I submit that it is ducking their responsibility to answer for what they are doing. I submit that it is failing to have the gumption to get up here and defend the indefensible. Their silence speaks volumes. Their absence of response speaks volumes about what is happening here and they ought to think about that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>2040</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister has indicated that nothing has changed since last year.

The government has said they are going to take their toys and go home and that means there is absolutely no point in our continuing on this debate. Is that, in fact, the case or will the theatre be played out in the lower house when we all know that this amendment does, at best, very little?

I do not know whether this is to find another form of words or whether this is to make a new statement which will clarify whether this is game, set and match. Perhaps it means that this is where the debate ends and the rest becomes purely icing on the cake. Perhaps what we should have done, as a Senate, is made sure that the very best amendment went in. It seems that this is largely theatre with the government saying to the audience, `Look, this really is not going to do much so go on, accept it, ` which is what I am hearing. The government is saying, `This really is not going to bust your clauses. This isn't really going to make sure we are not discriminatory in the bill. Come on, let us have it. Let's pretend,' because that is what it is—it is pretence.</para><para>What is happening behind the screen now? Do we now have an announcement that we can all go home, that in reality all the rest is just nonsense? Or is the government going to say, `Okay, maybe we were badly advised before and we really are going to accept it'?

I actually thought that Senator Harradine's arguments may have swayed the government because they were very convincing. Let me say again that, although this is certainly not the Democrats preferred option, we will vote for this amendment. It looks to me as if the government is not prepared to shift at all. I might say there has been a lot of talk about compromise, but it has only been one side that has been asked to compromise. The government has not shifted one little bit. I do not know whether they believe the 10-point Wik plan is a compromise. But that compromise was never worked out with 
 anyone except the government and the people it wanted to talk to.</para></talk.start><para>It is quite clear now that the government's refusal to consider the application of what I regard as Australia's primary human rights legislation—that is, the outlawing of racial discrimination—is a real trigger for a race election based on Wik. I wonder whether, reiterating what Senator Margetts said, there is any point in going any further once we do vote on this particular amendment, if it means that that sticking point will be sufficient to strike down this legislation. I asked the question because I wanted to be very clear when I voted what it was I was voting for. It may be that if it is sufficient to strike down the bill—and I thought that was what the minister was saying to us—then perhaps the rest of the debate might need to be adjourned. I do not know. But if this clause is totally unacceptable to the Howard government, then perhaps we are on the way to an election. That is why I was grateful to the minister, even though I disagree with his position, for at least clarifying that no further qualification of the Racial Discrimination Act would be acceptable to the government. If this qualification—which I agree is very much a second best option—is not acceptable to the government, then perhaps we should all go home. I certainly have a lot to do before Easter. Perhaps that statement should be made and then let us see which way the vote goes.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>2041</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wondered if we might have a report from the extra-chamber meeting that just took place out there.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>2041</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was about to speak to Senator Margetts and Senator Brown as well.

In this area, as in all the others, the opposition moved quite a number of amendments last time—amendments which presented an alternative approach to the problems here but amendments which, in the main, were not accepted. As reflected in the second reading amendment, our concerns are and continue to be that 
 the government has gone too far and, in going too far, questions arise as to workability, constitutionality and also unfairness.</para></talk.start><para>The starting point for the opposition in this area—and I think this is the position of others in the Senate—is that changes are needed here. There are problems; there are problems in terms of overlapping native title claims. Some claims have been lodged in ambit terms, whilst a small number have been overly optimistic. But our proposals differ from the government's in that our proposals maintain that the government has failed to sufficiently take into account the fundamental cultural relationship between Aborigines and their land. The government's amendments are extremely onerous and in some respects are based on a denial or a winding back of the common law.</para><para>Our amendments had a number of major purposes. Specifically, they were geared towards ensuring that claims would not be registered unless they comply with strength in criteria and they are geared towards assigning clear roles for the register, for the rep bodies and for the registration process. We also attempted to make explicit provision for challenges to be made against false claims and applications. Concern has been with respect to overlapping claims. What we tried to do last time was to provide mechanisms for dealing more effectively with overlapping claims on the current register and with claims registered since June 1996.</para><para>Our criticism of the government's position is and continues to be that the threshold test in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  is complex, is ambiguous in places and extends beyond a reasonable balance. For instance, the government's physical test started out by excluding those who had been locked out of their country. We felt that was totally unjust.</para><para>The other injustice we identified was that in the government's provision they were paring back the common law. The government bill has failed to recognised the cultural connection of Aboriginal people to their land. There will be situations where a claimant has not had physical access to the land but still retains the religion, the stories, the knowledge 
 and the traditional law and customs relating to his or her traditional country. We moved an amendment to ensure that that common law right was being protected.</para><para>With respect to multiple claims, we felt the government went a bit far. They got the balance wrong. Some overlapping claims can reflect traditional law. Traditional law can accommodate groups having a right to traverse the country of others through soul lines and dreaming tracks. Generally, as I say, we think the government's balance was wrong and we think there was inherent unfairness in their winding back common law rights; not just unfairness, but also there would be constitutionality problems involved in it as well.</para><para>Concerning our position, we put up a proposal which ensured that the registrar was, for instance, not to register an application unless satisfied that the certification was reasonably made by the rep body. We ensured review under the AD(JR). We ensured that there was capacity to uncover situations for instance of fraud in an application, and a whole range of mechanisms which were geared towards ensuring that the process could be somewhat more streamlined and made more sustainable.</para><para>We also recognise the role of rep bodies—this will be a part of the debate later on. Under the government's proposal, rep bodies would have increased and enhanced roles. We also thought the rep bodies could have a vital role to play, particularly with respect to retrospective reviewing of overlapping claims. We also pursued a provision to ensure that challenges could be made to the Federal Court as to the truth of sworn facts in an application.</para><para>Priority considerations were reflected in our legislation through amendments which sought to ensure that the registrar would give priority to consideration of claims in relation to areas over which section 29 notices had been given. It goes on, but at the end of the debate, as I said, most of our amendments were not accepted. But we are now confronted with legislation which we have to tackle in a way in which our objective is to state our previous position and also to see whether we can make 
 some gains on what was passed through the Senate last year.</para><para>The core of the debate here will go as to the threshold test, the registration test. The revised amendments go to this and we maintain that the government's balance between procedural rigour and fairness has not been struck properly. Native title applicants will be required to provide detailed information about the factual basis of the claim. We have no problems with that. Non-native title parties will be entitled to challenge factual assertions in the Federal Court and the registrar must only enter onto the register of claims details of claims and interests which, in the opinion of the registrar, can be established prima facie. That amendment also reflects the amendments moved by Labor in the previous proceedings in December last year. However, the revised registration test does not require native title applicants to meet criteria which have a speculative foundation in the common law. In this way, we believe the government goes too far. It excludes from registration people who might have a firm basis in the common law.</para><para>We will be moving amendments and I will go to those later during the deliberations in the committee process. I can say at this stage that the government amendments, which I am sure will be moved, are on the whole supported by the opposition, in many instances not because they are the preferred option but because they are incremental gains on the debate last year.</para><para>We have a number of our own amendments as well. I will go to those when they come up. In essence, the issue as to the threshold test is one that we will have to go to very soon in this debate. We believe there should be reflection of the common law. There should be a capacity, as the government has argued, for a physical connection test. We believe there should be provision for accommodation of those who have been locked off their properties and we also believe that the Mabo test, which is reflected in our amendments—a test which accommodates the common law rights pursuant to traditional association with the land—should be available for people who are making claims and who 
 would otherwise be unjustly denied the capacity to make a claim if that aspect of the common law was not reflected in the legislation.</para><para>We also believe that these three aspects should be available in the alternative. The government has a different view from that, and I am sure Senator Harradine has as well. I am also sure that we will argue those different aspects out through the course of this debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>2044</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government is moving its own amendments to the registration test, Nos 66 to 76, which are a sign, I think, of our good faith and our willingness to consider propositions put to us and matters that arose out of the Senate deliberations last December. We have not watered the test down, because we think a sufficiently rigorous registration test is vital to the effective operation of the Native Title Act and the ending of the real problem we have across Australia of completing overlapping claims which are causing considerable dissent within Aboriginal communities, let alone in the wider community.</para></talk.start><para>In particular, we have considered the misunderstanding about the operation of the prima facie test that was raised in the Senate. There was some fear that every single native title right and interest claimed in any one claim had to pass the prima facie test or the whole claim could not be registered. That was never our intention. To the extent that it could be read as having that effect, we have proposed an amendment to give it the meaning we intended. The amendment says:</para><para>The Registrar must consider that, prima facie, at least some of the native title rights and interests claimed in the application can be established.</para><para>The note attached to the amendment says that only those rights and interests that are established are taken into account for the purposes of the right to negotiate. That is what was intended. In other words, if one claim contains 10 native title rights and interests which are sought, and six of those pass the registration test, the claim is registered with respect to those six. Those six are then able to be the 
 subject for consideration in the right to negotiate process but not the four for which a prima facie case could not be made. It does not mean that because four of the rights claimed did not meet the test the claim does not get registered, which was, I think, the misunderstanding on the part of some in respect of the previous tests. So I think that is a clarification which I would hope the Senate should accept.</para><para>In relation to physical connection, it remains our view that it is not unreasonable to say that for a claim to be registered at least one member of the claim group should have or have had a traditional physical connection to some part of the area claimed. The obverse of that is to say that a claim should be registered even though not one member of the claim group has ever had any physical connection to the land claimed. Remembering that the registration test is about access to all the statutory procedural rights available to registered claimants with respect to future developments, that is not an unreasonable test. To suggest that those significant procedural rights, including the right to negotiate in respect of mining and compulsory acquisitions on 39 per cent of Australia, should be available to claim groups even though not one of them has ever had any connection to the land claimed seems to us—and, I think, to the wider community—a preposterous suggestion.</para><para>We have changed the way in which the physical connection test is described, with the addition of 7(b), to make it clear that, where just one member of the claim group had had a connection and would have expected to have continued to have that connection but for things done either by the Crown or a statutory authority or any other person, then that will satisfy the registration test. We believe that is an up-front acknowledgment of what may well have occurred in the past, and that is that some members of claim groups may well have had their connection to that land severed by actions of that kind, and they should not be prejudiced in having their claims registered. This takes account of such a situation, but we do not believe that we can go beyond that to another generation and therefore be in a situation where claims are 
 registered even though not one member of what may be a very big claim group has ever had any physical connection to the land claimed.</para><para>This does not affect the rights of claimants to seek native title determinations before the Federal Court by normal Federal Court action. This registration test, I remind you, is about registration with the tribunal essentially for access to the statutory benefits of the right to negotiate. Therefore, a test of this kind is, we think, perfectly fair and reasonable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>2045</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to make a substantial contribution to this issue.

We are dealing with a situation where we are staring at the possibility of blatant disrespect, and the issue is the ability of indigenous Australians to be respected—the kind of respect that has been discussed in relation to the heritage act with the Justice Evatt report, the kind of issue that has not been taken up by the government.</para><para>Whenever even members of the government talk about the issue of indigenous Australians and the land, they acknowledge the spiritual connection. What I want to know is: if that is acknowledged in just about every speech we hear at public places in various ways, why does it stop short of legislative acceptance? I believe that is impossible to answer. There is 
 no reason why. Many people believe we are getting to the point where the government is going to be asking us to make a decision which, in fact, denies that spirituality.

 been bundled with pay-TV. As I understand it, they had only a handful of customers on that service. But they continue to provide long distance service offerings and, indeed, the pay television service in Ballarat, and they remain the only regional centre with access to Northgate's very competitive long distance rates.	Indeed, had you read the article the other day, you would have seen that Northgate's management was saying that they were astounded at the level of interest in that long distance service. So, quite clearly, Madam President, Northgate is responding to local demand and providing the services accordingly.</para><para>It is a grotesque distortion to then go on and argue that somehow competition does not deliver new services. This is the Labor Party to a T—`We decide who gets what and where and then we go in and say to the carrier, "Deliver it".' That is the way you would run a telecommunication system, is it? You have got Austar rolling out services in Darwin and Alice Springs; you have got people providing services all throughout regional Australia, but you want to go in there and tell carriers how to deliver and when. It really is getting to a very silly stage.</para><para>That is why even Kenneth Davidson was mocking your leader this morning.

The latest Drake International job survey has found that total employment should grow overall, despite the Asian crisis having an impact in some sectors, with an annualised rate of increase at two per cent. So all the signals are there for increasing employment in this country. That, I remind you, is to be added to the 220,000 jobs that have already been created since the coalition government came to power. So that is good news; that is probably one of the most vital issues facing this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why is it occurring? One of the reasons is that we now have the lowest business interest 
 rates in 25 years, giving small business a chance, responding to their needs and enabling them to expand and to grow. I mentioned last week the good news of Westpac bringing down interest rates for small business. I asked that it be followed by other banks, and I am pleased that the Commonwealth Bank has announced reductions in small business interest rates—more good news for Australian business. We would like, of course, to see the other banks do it as well. We estimate that this could be a saving of $300 million a year off the bottom line for small business in this country, giving them again the opportunity to further grow and expand.</para><para>So what we have been able to deliver for small business is lower interest rates—the lowest in 25 years; what we have been able to deliver for the family is lower housing rates—the lowest in 30 years; and, of course, inflation is now down to the lowest level in 30 years, so that people can retain what they earn rather than lose it as they did during the days of Labor.</para><para>Just contrast it briefly. Remember the highs of Labor—its great achievements? Small business interest rates—20 per cent; home loan interest rates—17 per cent; one million unemployed—11.2 per cent of the Australian work force. What a contrast with a government that is getting on with the job, getting the fundamentals right, cutting back expenditure and giving small business the chance to grow and expand, which is now resulting in substantial reductions in unemployment and increases in employment.

 our overall energy mix, and the government is committed to encouraging an expanded commercially viable renewables industry.</para></talk.start><para>In November 1997, as part of the $180 million five-year program, the Prime Minister announced a major new package of measures to encourage innovation in the renewable energy sector. These measures include $21 million for a renewable energy innovation investment fund on a two to one funding basis with industry; $30 million of concessional loans and grants for the development and commercialisation of strategically important renewable energy technologies—this represents a huge increase on the $4.8 million over four years spent by Labor; and $10 million for a showcase fund to support leading edge renewable energy projects in areas such as tidal power, solar thermal power and photovoltaics. This is an action oriented program for the renewable energy sector which goes much further than simply encouraging research. It will stimulate innovative technologies and wealth creating business. It will provide many new real jobs for Australians and new export industries to help address Labor's legacy of foreign debt.</para><para>The Howard government has established a target for electricity retailers and other large electricity buyers to source an additional two per cent of electricity from renewable energy sources by the year 2010. This target will provide significant opportunities for the use of solar, biomass, wind and other emerging technologies. It will also provide its own stimulus for renewables R&amp;D.</para><para>Never before has the electricity industry been so well placed to look at cost effective markets for renewable energy technologies. Already, over 120 megawatts of electricity capacity has been installed to supply electricity using municipal and agricultural wastes. Many of the newly formed electricity distributors are actively marketing green energy and promoting installation of renewable energy systems.</para><para>As a result of these initiatives by the Howard government, the level of support for renewables will be considerably greater than that provided by any previous government. Funding for renewable energy in Labor's last 
 budget was estimated at $7.5 million. In 1998-99, the first year of the Prime Minister's climate change package, Commonwealth funding of renewable energy R&amp;D is estimated at $16 million. This represents a massive increase in support for renewable energy R&amp;D and includes measures not even contemplated by Labor. There is little wonder that Labor has nothing to say about renewable energy. Labor failed to produce an integrated renewable energy strategy in government, as in so many other areas.

The purpose is to ensure that the development occurs without environmental damage and, in my particular responsibilities, I am obviously particularly concerned with damage to world heritage values. But the project also has been structured in a way that will ensure there is not damage to other environmental values.

There is no consistent legal mechanism in the states and territories for the automatic recognition of overseas adoptions. Under current arrangements, a child entering Australia after being adopted overseas comes under the provisions of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act until such time as the adoption is formally recognised by a state or territory court. Whilst that has been a satisfactory arrangement for other countries, Senator Harradine, the view of the Chinese government is that it is insufficient and that they need an automatic 
 recognition of the adoption process that has taken place in China.</para><para> The matter could have been resolved through the ratification of The Hague convention by both Australia and China, as parties to the convention are obliged to recognise adoptions made in accordance with its arrangements. But as China is not expected to ratify the convention for some time, we have looked at other ways to progress the matter. We have agreed that the Australian laws should now be amended to allow for the automatic recognition in Australia of foreign adoptions from prescribed countries where a bilateral agreement has been made with Australia.</para><para> We will introduce this bill into the parliament in the next session, Senator Harradine. I trust that the parliament might be prepared to deal with it in the one session so we can put it into effect. That will enable finalisation of the bilateral agreement with China. The effect will be that the arrangement under the bilateral agreement will, in addition to the law, have the effect of recognising the adoption that had taken place in China. There will then be in place an arrangement for ongoing adoption of children from China under this process. It has been frustratingly slow, but I am pleased that progress is now being made.

A particular concern is the loose way in which many journalists report the likelihood of a double dissolution election in the event of the rejection of the Native Title Amendment Bill. As an example, today's ABC main morning radio news led with the following: `Debate on the Wik bill continues in the Senate today with a race based election looking increasingly likely.' This type of reportage is based on a series of political presumptions and value judgments, not on facts. It implies that the rejection of the government's Native Title Amendment Bill inevitably means that the next election will be fought on race issues, an expression which has increasingly become code for racial abuse with an additional connotation that such an outcome would be the fault of the government.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—Who wrote this rubbish?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—I know you think it is all rubbish, but just listen.

They are exercising freedom of choice and they have always done that. In fact, for as long as I can remember that has been going on. You might even call it reverse cost shifting in so far as the states retaliate by sending the patients to get their X-rays done and their prescriptions filled outside the public hospital system, so it is sort of tit for tat in a sense. It has been investigated by the state governments, I know in my own state, to see to what extent it is.</para></talk.start><para>I know that you are probably referring to your own state of South Australia, but there are different situations particularly in Queensland, for example, where you have to differentiate between what occurs in the cities and what occurs in the rural areas, where often the private beds are used, and whether they are private or public really does not matter; whereas in the cities—certainly in Queensland—the private hospitals are entirely physically separated from the public hospitals. In some other states the private patients go into the public hospitals, such as in New South Wales, and are designated whether they are public or private.</para><para>So there is validity to the arrangement, but it is really a twofold argument. The private hospitals, on the one hand, have to lift their game and the private practitioners have to lift their game so that they can attract patients to the private hospitals; on the other hand, the public hospitals have to lift their game because they have to become more efficient. Everybody knows that the cost of running a 
 public hospital bed is much higher than a private hospital bed, so when these private patients do elect, as is their right, to go into a public hospital, they cost the public purse more because of the cost of that occurring. So it is an argument both ways.</para><para>But whether or not it is a major argument in relation to the quantum of money that goes across, I do not believe it is because there are not a huge number of people who do this. I found in my own state, for example, after surveying it, that it was not a matter of cost, it was a matter of choice of those people who elected to do that for whatever reason. We never really got to the bottom of it. Usually, it was an association with the hospital where they had been to as a patient before, they were happy with the service that they got, and they came back—but they privately insured so that they could have that safety net so that if ever they had a catastrophic illness where they wanted to go to another hospital and seek private care then they could do so.</para><para>The government is addressing this particular problem, as you know, because we have already promoted it and the bill has been prepared to allow hospitals to contract with doctors.

One such Agreement under the banner of the WTO is The Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994—commonly referred to as `the Dumping Agreement'.</para><para>Article 5.8 of that Agreement states:</para><para>'. . . an inquiry shall be terminated immediately in cases where the authorities determine that the volume of dumped imports. . . is negligible'.</para><para>The Agreement goes on to say that, in this context, `negligible' means that the volume of dumped goods from a particular country is less than 3 per cent of total imports of those goods into a Member country or, where several countries have less than 3 per cent of such imports, their combined share does not exceed 7 per cent of imports.</para><para>Article 18.4 of the Dumping Agreement requires that signatories shall take all necessary steps to ensure that their domestic laws and regulations conform with the provisions of the Agreement. In response to this Article the then Government introduced a Bill into this Parliament in 1994 to amend the relevant Acts dealing with anti-dumping matters. The Bill was passed by both Houses and the amended legislation took effect from 1 January 1995.</para><para>One such amendment was the introduction of a new section into the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 section 7B. Subsection 7B(3) states that the Anti-Dumping Authority must terminate a dumping inquiry if it finds that the volume of dumped goods is negligible. The definition of `negligible' is to be found in section 269TDA of the Customs Act 1901 but, for practical purposes, is essentially identical to that contained in the Dumping Agreement as explained above.</para><para>If the Authority finds that the criteria applying under subsection 7B(3) of its Act apply in a given case, the Parliament has decided that the Authority is to terminate the inquiry with respect to the exporters in question. My advice is that such termination is mandatory (the Authority has no 
 discretion in the matter) and has not issued powers to the Minister to overturn the Authority if it so acts.</para><para>Against this background, it is obvious that the Minister cannot overturn a decision by the Authority to terminate an inquiry. If he were to do so, he would clearly be acting contrary to law, contrary to the Dumping Agreement and in contempt of this Parliament.</para><para>These were amendments proposed by the then Government, the Labor Party, and if Senator Murphy has a problem with the fact that the Authority must terminate the inquiry then he should ask his colleagues, Senators Schacht and Cook who were the relevant Ministers at the time.</para><para>Let me reiterate that the legislation is quite clear and unambiguous on the division of power for terminating inquiries and where the Authority is authorised to terminate, the provisions are mandatory. The Minister has no authority in this matter.</para><para>There is another feature of both Australia's legislation and the Dumping Agreement that would prevent the Minister imposing measures on the basis suggested by Senator Murphy. Before the Minister can impose dumping duties on future exports of a particular product, he must be satisfied—in accordance with subsection 269TG(2) of the Customs Act 1901—that dumping has caused or threatens to cause material injury to the Australian industry producing like goods, and that there may be future exports that may be dumped. This requirement has been reflected in Australia's anti-dumping legislation for decades and is also contained in the Dumping Agreement.</para><para>There is no scope for the Minister to impose anti-dumping measures on the ground that `no level of dumping is acceptable' as suggested by Senator Murphy. This is not an adequate basis in law, nor in terms of Australia's international obligations, for imposing such measures.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Question</inline></para><para>Madam President, I ask- a supplementary question. Minister, I thank you for the part answer that you gave, but you did not really address the question with regards to whether or not the government will reject the ADA findings and impose any duties. I guess that is part of the problem. I wonder whether or not the Minister is going to tell the workers at the Wesley Vale paper mill in Tasmania that the loss of their jobs on the basis of a result of a so-called negligible amount of dumped paper is an acceptable price to pay for the Government's failure to introduce legislation to improve the anti-dumping laws of this country. Is this just not another example of the long list of the non-core promises for which Australians again must pay? 
</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Answer</inline></para><para>On 25 February the Ministers for Industry, Science and Tourism and Customs and Consumer Affairs announced that there would be a comprehensive reform of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing duty mechanisms. Under the new arrangements, interim duties can be imposed after 60 days, the time taken to reach a final finding will be reduced to 155 days and the Anti-Dumping Authority will be abolished. These reforms will give Australia the fastest anti-dumping arrangements in the world. Draft legislation to implement the new arrangements is expected to be introduced into Parliament in the May budget session with a commencement date of 1 July 1998.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Northgate Communications, BallaratTelstra: PrivatisationNative Title</title><page.no>2062</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>2062</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston), to  questions without notice asked today.</para><para>In moving to take note of his answer, I want to point out that this minister now has a large amount of egg all over his face. It is just over a year ago that he and the Prime Minister conducted the inaugural telephone call for Northgate in Ballarat. During that telephone conversation, which was on 13 March 1997, Senator Alston told the Prime Minister:</para><para>. . . courtesy of Northgate Communications who are offering some very exciting telephone arrangements including free local phone calls, which is an Australia wide first, and very significant discounts on a range of other products . . . </para><para>So there it was: the minister was skiting to the Australian public and to the Prime Minister that this new arrangement would provide free phone calls in Ballarat, in what is called the `local loop', to people who signed up. In the subsequent conversation, the Prime Minister was enthusiastic in endorsing these remarks by Senator Alston and in saying how good Northgate was for providing local loop free calls in Ballarat.</para><para>During the 12 months since March last year, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) has got up in the Senate on a number 
 of occasions and said, `This is our policy. It is working to provide free local calls in regional Australia. This is a first. This is a credit to our policy.' He was also saying, `Therefore, you don't need to have a commitment by Telstra and others to provide a range of services because competition will be provided by these new carriers coming into regional areas.'</para><para>I do not want to take too much of the Senate's time, but I want to point out that, on 20 March last year, Senator Alston said in the Senate:</para><para>. . . and I suppose the reason we keep talking about Ballarat is that I happened to go there last week and launch this new product. In many ways it is a typical example of how, all of a sudden, Ballarat seems to be the testbed for regional Australia, when maybe six months ago you would have said, `Well, the bush is going to be left behind.' All of a sudden they are going to be the only people in Australia who will have free local calls to Northgate customers, and suddenly there is the prospect of untimed local calls between Ballarat and Melbourne, which is about 130 kilometres. So I would hope there will be a lot more pleasant surprises in terms of competition in the bush.</para><para>During the last 12 months, every chance he has had, this minister has trumpeted in this place, in Senate estimates and in media interviews free local calls in Ballarat by Northgate as justification for his policy to deliver to the bush.</para><para>Last week in Ballarat, Northgate made it quite clear that local calls will no longer be free when they suddenly ceased the service. Today, when I said in my question that Northgate had left the local consumers with no service and with no notice, the minister said in his answer that I had that wrong. On 2 April—the day after April Fools' Day—the Ballarat newspaper said:</para><para>Northgate customers who contacted <inline font-style="italic">The Courier</inline>  yesterday said they had signed up an unlimited number of local calls for $10 a month, but the special telephone supplied with the service had not worked for about a week.</para><para>Mr Buddemeyer said local customers had been informed of the closure and service cancellation but Northgate customers denied the claim.</para><para>Northgate customer Stephen Densley said he discovered Northgate's Sturt St office had closed yesterday when he went to query a bill. 
</para><para>Mr Densley said his free local call service had only worked sporadically but two weeks ago it had stopped working altogether.</para><para>He said he had not been informed of the service cancellation or office closure.</para><para>There we have it: a clear-cut case that this company has closed down the service to customers. Why didn't we get a comment from the minister today in answering the question about the government's vaunted new customer service guarantee? Is that worth an investigation? Should Mr Densley get a rebate from Northgate because of the lack of service? Nothing from this minister. Today we exposed how the minister has misled the Australian public, particularly regional Australia. They will not get free local calls. The only way they will get a decent service is through Telstra. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline> .</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2063</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It seems amazing to me that Senator Schacht has got up; we do not hear from him much on telecommunications issues.

Labor ignored 
 regional Australia for almost 13 years. Only at the end of their 13 years in office did they have any interest in regional Australia. They cobbled together policies that were borne out of a recognition that they had 29 marginal seats and that they were not going to win any seats in rural Australia. That was when they started to take some sort of interest in regional Australia, and their belated policies were flawed. They did nothing for regional Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>With the partial sale of Telstra, we put in place a process where we see huge benefits coming to regional Australia. Only last week, Senator Richard Alston announced $21 million to improve regional telecommunications with a second tranche of a $250 million, five-year, regional telecommunications infrastructure fund called Networking the Nation. We saw the opportunities announced for regional Australia: programs in Tasmania that will improve telemedicine, programs in south-west Queensland for a women's justice network covering 16 locations, a pilot three-year project to assist women needing independent legal advice through video conferences, sites and training for community workers with connections to legal aid. I could go on and on about the sorts of programs that have been put in place through this fund.</para><para>What happened when Labor was in government, when it sold the Commonwealth Bank, was that the now Leader of the Opposition made a promise not to sell the bank. They also put into the prospectus a commitment—a letter from the Prime Minister, I think it was—saying that they would not sell any more of the Commonwealth Bank. And what did they do? Was there any bleating about people in regional area as a result of what would happen with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank? There was nothing. They sold the Commonwealth Bank. They did not go to the Australian people, as we did. Before the last election we said that we would sell one-third of Telstra and, if we are to sell any more, we will come back to the people and let them decide. Labor did not do that. They did not do that with Qantas, with CSL or with anything else.</para><para>The other thing that they did was that, when they sold those assets, they spent the money; they did not use it to retire debt. With the further projected sale of Telstra, we will retire 40 per cent of the Commonwealth debt which will reduce our interest payments by $8 billion. That is what we are going to do: wipe off that debt. What did the Labor Party do when it sold our assets? It spent the money. It wasted the opportunity to retire our debt.</para><para>To have Senator Schacht come in here and bleat about an incident in Ballarat, when those people would be covered by other telephony services, to focus on that when there are issues of importance in Australia that require their attention says something about the Labor Party.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>2065</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I admit I was absolutely stunned by the response to my question by Senator Alston today in relation to the commitment that he gave with regard to jobs in Tasmania.

I don't know anything about 30 jobs to Tasmania. I can't direct Telstra.' As I said to Senator Alston, the reality is that this was his commitment. He said it in a press release. He cannot direct Telstra but he can say it in a press release in order to convince Senator Harradine to pass the one-third partial sale of Telstra. The commitment was given in the minister's own press release where he said:</para></talk.start><para>As part of its Australia-wide plan to speed up network modernisation and ISDN availability, ISDN services in Tasmania will achieve a 70% customer penetration by June 1997 and 90% by December 1997, creating an additional 30 jobs.</para><para>Thank you very much, Minister Alston, because 90 per cent has been achieved but, unfortunately, the rest of Australia has approximately 96 per cent.

I hope that Senator Harradine is listening because I say to him: you cannot trust this government. You could not trust this government with regard to the one-third sale of Telstra and you cannot trust a single thing they say with regard to the two-third sale because they are not going to honour their commitment.

I am sorry that Senator Schacht has left the chamber. He was having a bit of fun interjecting, and I wanted to give him a quote of Adlai Stevenson that says, `Why is it that, when political ammunition runs low, inevitably the rusty artillery of abuse is always wheeled into action?' I think that says a lot about Senator Schacht. I do not think he takes his shadow responsibilities for telecommunications terribly seriously. After all, I think Senator Alston is still waiting for his submission to the Mansfield inquiry on the ABC. Clearly, Senator Schacht is derelict in his duty, and probably his colleagues realise that and he is a bit of a joke. He has a lot to smile about and I wonder why.</para></talk.start><para>The government has introduced the legislation for the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra. I wish to make a couple of points about this historic move. By selling the government's remaining stake in Telstra we are bringing Australia into line with the rest of the world. If Senator Schacht wants us to remain in the league of Mozambique and Albania, that is terrific, but I think even Albania is selling its telco and the only country that is not proposing to sell its telco is Cuba.</para><para>We plan to so something worth while with the proceeds of the sale. The first objective is to retire debt, and we plan to slash by about 40 per cent the $100 million government legacy left to us by former finance minister, Kim Beazley, as my colleague Senator Patter 
 son said. This will mean a corresponding enormous and continuing reduction of our annual interest payments. This will benefit all Australians much more than any annual dividend the government would otherwise receive from Telstra, a fact that has been confirmed by independent economists.</para><para>The second objective is to deliver a social benefit, the full details of which have yet to be announced. But this government's $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust, which was a commitment from the sale of the first one-third of Telstra—a historic commitment unsurpassed by any government in Australia's history—demonstrates our ability to run a successful program that spreads a genuine benefit right across the nation from small landcare groups to entire catchments. The Labor Party complained about not receiving funds from the Natural Heritage Trust, but it needs to be said again and again that they represent only 1.3 per cent of the land mass of Australia. Their credentials as being a truly representative party are a complete and utter farce.</para><para>The ALP has plenty of form on privatisation. The difference is that when we said that we were going to sell something we did. When they said they were not going to privatise something they went exactly against what they had proposed. I give the example of the Commonwealth Bank. Really, the problem for the ALP with the sale of Telstra is that they know what is right. Senator Schacht probably knows what is right. Mr Beazley wanted to privatise Telstra in 1994 and he said as much privately. Mr Keating said that there was nothing wrong with it in principle. If you believe Graham Richardson in <inline font-style="italic">Whatever It Takes</inline>, pretty clearly Mr Keating wanted to sell Telstra. At the Hobart conference—the great debating failure that livened up the early part of the year with Cheryl Kernot's marvellous cameo performance, wonderful entertainment for the people of Australia but not much vision for the future of Australia—the ALP proposed that they were going to sell an additional 19 per cent of Telstra. It was actually there, ready for debate. It was knocked off but still there, still part of the parcel. They were wanting to do 
 something that was fundamentally right for Australia but were not able to do so.</para><para>We said in 1996 that we would privatise one-third, and we did. We won the election, we sold one-third of Telstra and we provided over $1.25 billion to the Natural Heritage Trust. One point six million Australians bought shares, including 600,000 new investors, and 92 per cent of Telstra employees bought Telstra shares. That included, might I say, people in regional Australia who supported it: 200,000 investors west of the Great Dividing Range. I admit that regional Australia has some legitimate concerns about all telecommunications changes, but they  have no concerns about the privatisation as such. Telecommunications are the key to regional development and to decentralisation in Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>2067</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am surprised that Senator Sandy Macdonald did not defend his leader a little better, but we will come to that in a few moments.

Under the one-third privatisation of Telstra, we have already seen a decline in service to the people in rural and regional Australia. Then, in more recent times, we had Mr Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, raising issues about the services offered in North Queensland at the time of a recent flood there. So it is a concern on their side of politics.</para><para>But what do we have? We have a situation where the people in rural and regional Australia are raising legitimate concerns about their ability to receive basic operational telecommunication services in rural and regional areas. Of course, we have already seen Northgate fail, and we have seen a major report which shows that there is a decline in the services being offered through Telstra.</para><para>Now what are we to see? Is the new policy for people in the country to involve a pedal wireless? Will we go back to the pedal wireless and have the government vaunting that as some sort of fitness and health program for people in rural and regional areas? Will they say that this is really a modernisation in telecommunication systems for people in rural and regional Australia? That is about all they are going to offer if they keep going down the path that they are going down.</para><para>We have heard nothing from this government that will give any certainty to people in rural areas. Even if the government does go ahead with their further privatisation of Telstra, there is no guarantee of service to people in rural Australia. Rural Australian people deserve something better than they are 
 being offered by this government at this point in time.</para><para>Clearly, when you look at how they trumpeted the service that came out of Northgate, nothing was delivered in the longer term, and that is something that rural Australia is definitely aware of and something that they will take into consideration when this goes before the ballot box some time this year. Undoubtedly you can fool some of the people some of the time, but not all of the people all of the time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>2068</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Hogg, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but not all of the people all of the time, and you have not fooled anybody any of the time because I assure you that, under the sale of Telstra, people in regional and rural Australia will not be disadvantaged at all. The universal service obligations will be maintained and people in regional and rural Australia will continue to have an excellent, competitive and cheap telephone and telecommunication service under the Howard government following the sale of Telstra and the expansion of competition.</para></talk.start><para>This debate has been hung around the fact that a very small company in Victoria closed down its local operation, and they did that because they only had 50 customers. Not many companies, I assure you, could survive with just 50 customers. So that company came to a very reasoned and sensible commercial decision and closed down their local services. What has not been mentioned by the opposition, of course, is that they have maintained untimed calls at 95c a call to other capital cities and overseas calls at $4.95.</para><para>But let us get back to the main issue—services to rural and regional Australia following the sale of Telstra. The government has guaranteed that regional and rural Australia will not be disadvantaged once the sale goes through because the universal service obligation will be maintained.</para><para>Let us just see what that universal service obligation is. First of all, it will mean that installation and maintenance costs in regional areas will be subsidised by phone users in the cities. The universal service obligation will 
 mean that access to public switch telephone networks will be maintained; the ability to make and receive national and international calls 24 hours a day will be maintained; there will be 24-hour access to the emergency number which gives the customer access to emergency services free of charge; there will be continued 24-hour access to operator assistance for directory assistance, national and international call connections and reporting of service difficulties; every customer will have a unique telephone number; and, furthermore, there will be a level of privacy and security maintained to enable users to conduct business and personal communications with confidence.</para><para>All of these things will be maintained under the universal service obligation when Telstra is privatised and other operators come in to provide competition. After privatisation, Telstra will continue to improve its services in regional areas, building on its present commitment to upgrade all exchanges to digital technology with effective completion by December 1998.</para><para>These ongoing investment plans will not be affected by changes in the ownership and structure of Telstra. In fact, in the last six months of 1997, Telstra spent—wait for it—$1.53 billion on telecommunications equipment in Australia, and nearly 40 per cent of that money was spent in regional areas. There is no doubt at all that the full sale of Telstra will have enormous benefits for ordinary Australians in general and for those in regional Australia in particular. The sale of Telstra will provide an opportunity for share ownership, it will help reduce the national debt by a factor of 40 per cent and it will ensure healthy competition in Australia's telecommunications industry. The outcomes of that for the people of Australia will be to promote better choice, enhance performance and provide lower prices for consumers.</para><para>I think it was Senator Mackay who spoke about the costs of calls to consumers. It has to be remembered that telephone calls have been dropping steadily in cost over many years due to remarkable advances in technology. There is no doubt at all that when Telstra is privatised and the whole telecom 
 munications industry is opened up to competition, those costs will continue to drop. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and R.A.A.F. casualties;</para><para>2.	 R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal; and</para><para>3.	 R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is.</para><para>Members of the Army and R.A.A.F. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya.</para><para>In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was "operational" and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points.</para><para>Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service.

One member of the Committee, Senator Stephen Conroy, sought to question Mr Elliott using as a basis for his questioning a document which was challenged by Mr Elliott's legal adviser as being improperly obtained. As a consequence of the NCA committee discussions, the document from which he quoted 
 was expunged from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record of proceedings.</para><para>Following the public hearing, the NCA committee raised questions on which it sought what was in effect an advisory opinion from the Senate Committee of Privileges. The questions, in order, asked by the NCA committee and the answers which the Committee of Privileges now gives, are as follows:</para><para>(a)	 whether Senator Conroy's rights in relation to his capacity to question a witness appearing before the Committee were infringed in relation to the Committee's proceedings in Melbourne on 12 June 1997.</para><para>The answer to that is:</para><para>Having concluded that none of the evidence given by Mr John Elliott in his written submission of 4 June 1997, and his oral presentation of 12 June 1997, should have been received by the National Crime Authority Committee (see answers to questions (b) and (c) below), and that as a consequence no members of that committee should have been permitted to question him, the Committee of Privileges must also conclude that Senator Conroy's rights as a member of the committee were not infringed.</para><para>The next questions are:</para><para>(b)	 whether a member of the Committee is prohibited from asking questions of a witness in respect of evidence given to the Committee by that witness covered by either of the elements of subsection 55(2) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 or that relates to material covered by section 51 of the Act.</para><para>and</para><para>(c)	 whether the Committee was prohibited from receiving some or all of the evidence of Mr John Elliott in Melbourne on 12 June 1997, because of the provisions in subsection 55(2) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, or because the evidence related to material covered by section 51 of the act.</para><para>The answer to that is:</para><para>The Committee of Privileges has concluded that, given the nature of Mr Elliott's evidence, both written and oral, before the NCA Committee, that committee was so constrained by subsection 55(2) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 that it was prohibited from receiving any such evidence. It follows that committee members were similarly prohibited from asking questions of him in respect of the proscribed evidence. It also follows that committee members generally are prohibited from either receiving, or asking questions in respect of, evidence given by a witness covered by either of 
 the elements of subsection 55(2) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984.</para><para>The committee has further concluded that section 51 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 had no application to the proceedings of the National Crime Authority Committee on 12 June 1997, and has no general application to that committee's proceedings.</para><para>The question under (d) was:</para><para>(d)	 whether, as a consequence of the consideration of point (c), some or all of the evidence Mr Elliott gave to the Committee should be expunged from the transcript of evidence.</para><para>Our answer to that is:</para><para>While this question is ultimately a matter for the NCA Committee to determine, the Committee of Privileges suggests that expungement of any evidence taken by that committee on 12 June 1997 is impracticable, ineffectual and undesirable.</para><para>In reaching these conclusions, the Committee of Privileges points to the difficult relationship between the NCA Committee and the National Crime Authority since the act came into operation because of the constraints imposed by section 55(2). It observes that the present NCA Committee might not have faced such difficulties as have led to the present conclusions if recommendations of its predecessor had previously been acted upon.</para><para>The Committee of Privileges notes that the NCA Committee has tabled in the House of Representatives and is about to table in this chamber a report on the general terms of reference to which I have referred; it hopes that the statutory constraints which have caused such difficulty for the National Crime Authority Committee since its establishment will be promptly addressed.

The other two multilateral agreements are about Australian involvement in  amendments to the International Whaling Convention the Truce Monitoring Group on Bougainville and.</para><para>The four bilateral agreements deal with amendments to a double taxation agreement, amendments to a health services agreement, an extradition treaty and an agreement on judicial assistance and cooperation. These agreements are with four quite different countries, and give some indication of the variety of work undertaken by the Treaties Committee.</para><para>The so-called London Convention will be replaced by the 1996 Protocol when sufficient countries have expressed consent to be bound by it. Our consideration of this Protocol is the subject of almost half a long chapter in this report. It is particularly appropriate for us to have reported on this matter in the International Year of the Oceans. 
</para><para>We gave further consideration to this Convention in the context of the withdrawal of a previous declaration of objection about the spoil form mining of jarosite. It is good to be able to record that this mining has ceased and Australia is now able to withdraw its earlier declaration.</para><para>The third multilateral treaty we considered in this Report was the amendments agreed at the 49th Annual Meeting in October 1997 to the <inline font-style="italic">International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling</inline> .</para><para>Australia has been opposed to commercial whaling for many years and supported these amendments. The Committee is aware of strains within the Commission set up by the Convention and the fact that there are real concerns about the future role and viability of the Commission.</para><para>During this inquiry, at a hearing in Sydney, we took evidence from Mr Chris Puplick who was the Chairman of the National Task Force on Whaling. He was also, as many Honourable Senators will remember, a Senator for NSW for a number of years. The Report of the Task Force was an important document in the preparation of this Report.

I am sure all Honourable Senators will be aware of the tragedy which has been going on in Bougainville since 1989.</para><para>Australians, both Australian Defence Force and other non-military personnel, were involved in the Truce Monitoring Group and earned great credit by their performance.

Bougainville is a matriarchal society and women members of the TMG were invited to discuss issues with village women in a way which was, of course, of considerable benefit to the peace process.</para><para>The Committee agreed unanimously in all eight cases that the Agreements should be supported.

I thank Margaret Swieringa for her work in its preparation.</para><para>As all senators are aware, a profound change has occurred in the region. The optimism of the early part of this inquiry, that ASEAN economies would continuously grow and prosper, has been tempered by the currency crisis which began in Thailand in July last year and has since affected, in varying degrees all of east Asia. The crisis has brought expectations of growth back to more standard levels, has highlighted the complexities of achieving sustainable development and has emphasised the importance of institutional development and good governance in that process. It has thrown down a challenge to ASEAN—its slow consensual style, its decisiveness and its cohesion.</para><para>The crisis also has altered the strategic outlook for the region, with the strategic uncertainty inherent in the reorientation of great power politics at the end of the cold war exacerbated by the possible threat to internal political stability in some states. The decline in economic circumstances is likely to worsen the broader security threats of transborder crime, illegal movements of peoples, the outflow of refugees, disputes over environmental degradation and competition for resources. Many of these are issues of concern already on the agenda of the ASEAN regional forum—an undeveloped avenue for regional consultation, whose importance is recognised and supported by the committee.</para><para>The inquiry took a considerable body of evidence in the early part of 1997 which stressed the oppor 
 tunities in the region for Australian trade. Australia's natural, geographically-based connection to the `fastest growing region in the world' appeared to ensure the expansion of Australian export trade. The report deals in some detail with an analysis of the bilateral and sectoral trade relationship between Australia and the region and including regional trade liberalisation under AFTA and APEC.</para><para>The committee does not underestimate the seriousness of the current problems or the challenges they pose. These are not simple or painless matters for countries to resolve. The committee was able to take some evidence on the possible causes of the problems and on the response of the IMF and regional governments. The committee endorses the Australian government's readiness to participate in the IMF packages offered to the republic of Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. However, with such rapidly developing circumstances over recent weeks, our analysis is simply a snapshot. The seminar held in parliament house on 19 march and the seminar report will elaborate on our preliminary findings, particularly in respect of Indonesia.</para><para>The report remains optimistic about long term trends. It concludes that `despite the recent economic difficulties in the region, which are likely to result in depressed demand for Australian exports in key ASEAN markets, the prospects for continued growth in two way trade in the long run remain solid.'</para><para>However, in other spheres of our relationship with the region, some concerns were expressed. Many witnesses stressed the importance of paying more attention to the social, cultural and political relationships between Australia and regional countries. Areas of weakness were perceived in bilateral tensions over political style or the differences in values, particularly human rights, declining cultural representation or the paucity of expenditure on regional cultural activity.</para><para>Strongly criticised was the withdrawal of our most natural communication with the region through the closure of radio Australia. The committee strongly urges a reconsideration of the decision to close the Cox peninsula transmitters.</para><para>The committee believes that: ASIAN studies and student exchanges, both of ASIAN students coming to Australia and of Australians studying in Asia be enhanced and improved; and that literary, artistic and cultural exchanges with the region be increased.</para><para>To this end, the committee endorses the new international cultural council and hopes that it will be adequately funded and resourced to achieve real advances in regional understanding and appreciation.  
</para><para>Development assistance to the region will need to be reassessed in the light of the economic downturn. The crisis has focused particular attention on the need for institutional strengthening and the development of regulatory and accountable systems. Many of the recommendations of the report are directed to strengthening capacity and institutions in both the financial and political spheres.</para><para>In its 30th anniversary year, which ASEAN began as a self-confident, independent and forceful regional voice, the economic crisis has provided a challenge to the association's ability to retain its cohesion and to act decisively in the interest of the whole region. This report lays down some of these challenges.</para><para>I commend the report to the senate.</para><para>Debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Crime Authority Committee</title><page.no>2077</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>2077</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>2077</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Ferris and the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Third Evaluation of the National Crime Authority</inline> , together with submissions and transcript of evidence received by the committee.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>2077</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para><para>I would like to firstly thank the committee secretariat for wading their way through a substantial amount of documentary evidence, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> , controversy—it was a very difficult report to prepare for the secretariat staff. I want to put on record my congratulations to them for their report. I would like to congratulate members of the committee for persevering at times under extreme duress, particularly when some witnesses gave their views of the committee at varying stages, but everybody maintained a degree of decorum you would expect.</para><para>To the substance of the report, there are a number of recommendations in the report which I endorse. The majority of the recommendations were endorsed by a cross-section of all parties in the chamber. The report calls for a number of increases in the powers of the authority to deal with search warrants but at the same time keeps a balance between the civil liberties aspects.</para><para>Probably the most controversial of the recommendations is to do with the powers of the committee itself, and that is what I would really like to speak about the most today. The committee report stresses the difficulties that the committee has in effectively supervising the National Crime Authority. What you have is a committee that is completely constrained by the act from actually being able to supervise the activities of the authority. This is a necessity and a balance that, when the legislation was passed—and this chamber debated it at length, I understand—was to protect the NCA from interference. At the same time, it has led to a committee that is unable to properly do its job.</para><para> Governments of both persuasions have baulked at giving the committee more access and greater power. This is not a party political speech; this is to say that the committee, in the past, has been treated with a fair degree of disdain by governments from both sides. But in the light of what has transpired over the last few years and allegations that have mounted about the proper or improper behaviour of the NCA, the committee has been unable—it does not have the resources; it does not have the support—to effectively monitor the NCA.</para><para>What we have seen is governments of both persuasions standing there and saying, `Yes, we have an oversight body. We have the joint parliamentary committee. It looks after the NCA. You can sleep well at night, citizens.' Members of the committee strongly felt that this furphy should be put to rest. This committee cannot effectively monitor the NCA. Ironically, it is probably the one thing I am in agreement on with John Elliott. There are not many things on which I and John Elliott agree.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Ferguson interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name></talker><para>—He is the Carlton President for a start. John Elliott has stressed that the committee is incapable of supervising the NCA. Ironically, I agree with him. It is nigh on impossible to get an answer on a controversial issue out of the NCA. I am told that the current management of the NCA is much freer in what they are willing to discuss than previous managements of the NCA. The 
 question of whether you can brief the parliamentary committee on the activities of the NCA is a difficult issue. The NCA is involved in many important investigations, particularly in the world of drugs. It is doing as good a job as it can within the funding levels that it has.</para></talk.start></continue><para> Both sides have been responsible—again, this is a non-partisan position from the committee—for reducing funding levels for the NCA. It has gone too far. If this organisation is to be able to do its job properly both in corporate fraud and in the fight against the drug lords, then you absolutely have to be prepared to give this organisation more money. It has many runs on the board when it comes to breaking drug rings. It needs resourcing. The committee was told about many instances where the NCA is not able to pursue obvious cases that come to light because their funding is constrained. This is a fault of both governments. As I say, I am not here saying that the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or the coalition are responsible. This is something that has to be non-partisan.</para><para>There is a need for greater funding for the NCA which is not tied. We have a situation at the moment where they have been given extra funding, and that is worthy, but it is tied to individual issues. They must be able to operate and monitor, and take advantage of increased funding to continue the pursuit of all sorts of organised criminal activities. Organised criminal activity is getting more and more sophisticated. We are hampering the NCA's capacity to fight it by its lack of support overall in its recurrent funding, its base level funding. I promised to only speak for five minutes. I do not want to hold the chamber up. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee</title><page.no>2078</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>2078</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>2078</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Chee, Sen Bill</name><name role="display">Senator O'CHEE</name><name.id>EU4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Sandy Macdonald and the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, I present report No. 1 of 1998 of the Senate Foreign

The underlying principles have remained, however, and have been strengthened at each annual meeting. These principles include a commitment to frank and constructive dialogue between parliamentarians from the 26 member countries representing over 45 per cent of the world's population. </para><para>I can inform the Senate that there certainly were free and frank exchanges of views at Seoul. At the sixth annual meeting the agenda covered a wide range of matters, many of which were the subject of consensus resolutions after the debate. These included: the fourth ASEAN regional forum; the Korean peninsula situation; Cambodia; APEC's Vancouver meetings; the Asian currency crisis; regional economic cooperation; the environment and other global issues such as energy, education, drugs, terrorism, cultural exchanges and corruption; the Ottawa convention; and Myanmar.</para><para>Members of the Australian delegation participated fully in all plenary sessions and I believe made a significant contribution. We worked well together in the executive committee, the plenary and also the working committee to develop the joint communique. Australia also nominated with Japan, Korea, Peru and Thailand to serve on the APPF's technology working committee, which will be working towards, amongst other things, the establishment of an Asia Pacific interparliamentary open information network by 2001. This presents a particular challenge and an opportunity to create an effective, open and secure mechanism for legislative interchange and the information exchange between member parliaments and individual parliamentarians. As an early development, the APPF's website is already established and links most parliaments, albeit superficially at this stage.</para><para>This was my first experience of an APPF meeting, but I know you, Madam Acting Deputy President, the President and your predecessors have given strong support to the APPF over the years. This year's meeting at Seoul was pleased to accept Australia's invitation to host the eighth annual meeting in Sydney in January 2000. This was widely seen as a further example of Australia's commitment to this important region.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 7) 1997</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2079</page.no><id.no>r421</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of the Economics Legislation Committee</title><page.no>2079</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2079</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the report of the Economics Legislation Committee on the

I am being asked to be amongst the first group of politicians in Australia to dismiss the spiritual and cultural imperatives of indigenous Australians; I will not be part of this. If Senator Harradine wishes to inflict another dose of cultural genocide upon Aboriginal people, let him do that with the support of the Prime Minister and Senator Minchin. He will certainly not get my assistance to ease his conscience on that matter.</para></talk.start><para>Both the government's provisions and Senator Harradine's amended physical connection test are utterly disrespectful to Aboriginal people. They are caving in to a racist paradigm which seeks to define `real' Aborigines. They ignore the shame and hurt that is felt and experienced by the stolen generations. It is one more kick in the teeth to the victims of an appalling modern day holocaust. Senator Harradine has a clear choice: his amendment does not have the numbers from the non-government parties in the Senate; either he sticks to his 1997 position, which maintains the Mabo spiritual and cultural connection test, or he supports the Howard government's despicable physical connection test.</para><para>I have no doubt that Senator Minchin at some stage soon will attempt to discredit my argument by claiming that I do not understand the legislation and that I am not aware there is a two-stage process for native title claims. So I would like to put on record that I do understand that this physical connection test applies to the registration track of the proposed two-track process. I do understand that it requires at least one member of the native title claim group to have or have had a physical connection to the land claimed. I am also aware that the regulations refer to a physical connection. I believe those regulations should be disallowed, but there is a big difference between those regulations and this legislation. </para><para>The regulations do not prevent someone from exercising statutory native title rights. Both Senator Minchin and Senator Harradine will claim that a physical connection test is needed to provide workability to exclude multiple claims. Let me make it clear now that the physical connection test has nothing to do with workability. In fact, most of the so-called problem areas associated with overlapping claims such as the goldfields involve claimant groups who would pass even the government's draconian physical connection test.</para><para>This is not about workability; it is a direct attack on the integrity of Aboriginal culture and should be exposed as such. There is already a host of changes to the registration test which ensure that it will be far more difficult to gain registration for the purposes of gaining the right to negotiate. This physical connection test—and Senator Harradine's lawyers have said this to me—is about satisfying that racist sentiment in society that says that the indigenous people of this continent are only real Aborigines if they are still living in the bush and that, somehow, those who have moved or have been moved to places other than their traditional lands are inferior in terms of native title rights. That is what the physical connection test is about. I for one refuse to give way to this Hansonite view.</para><para>It is totally insulting for Senator Minchin to say, as he has on many occasions, that this test is necessary to establish that only bona fide claimants obtain the right to negotiate. In effect, Senator Minchin is saying that those who have been denied the ability to maintain a physical connection for whatever reason are not bona fide Aboriginals. I must say that I am ashamed to be part of a parliament where such views are expressed. I am sure that in years to come people looking back at these debates will be shocked and appalled by such views, just as millions of Australians are currently shocked and appalled by such a notion.</para><para>In essence there are two sets of reasons why the physical connection test should be opposed. The first set of reasons is associated with the short-term effects on the native title process. There are those legitimate claimants 
 who may well achieve a determination of native title based on the Mabo test who will miss out on the right to negotiate. As Aboriginal people have stated on many occasions, native title is next to useless without the right to negotiate. For Senator Minchin or Senator Harradine to claim that this physical connection test is somehow justifiable because it applies only to those wishing to claim the right to negotiate is disingenuous in the extreme.</para><para>I do not know how many registrations will be knocked out by this test, but neither does Senator Harradine nor Senator Minchin. The mere fact that there is a distinct likelihood that winnable claims will be denied the right to negotiate is sufficient for it to be rejected outright. Let us not forget, either, that the new registration regime will apply retrospectively to potentially knock out existing claims already in the right to negotiate process.</para><para>There are very serious cultural and legal problems associated with a test involving parenthood, such as that which is proposed by Senator Harradine. During the committee hearings on the bill, Professor Marcia Langton said:</para><para>The issue of apical ancestry in Aboriginal belief systems is one of belief, particularly because of such things as, say, in some Aboriginal societies there is the taboo on speaking the names of the dead.</para><para>I hope somebody is listening to this because, if we are talking about people having to establish this in a court or before they get to any legal process, and if you are dealing with cultural issues where people are unable to speak the names of the dead, then you have a problem built in.</para><para>It is not always going to be easy to establish that deceased parents had a physical connection to the land when, in some Aboriginal communities, it is actually against traditional laws to even speak the names of parents who have passed away, let alone establish a prima facie case before a tribunal, especially a native title tribunal which, under the changes proposed by section 109(2) of this bill, will not be able to take into account cultural and customary concerns which are 
 deemed to unduly prejudice any other party to the proceedings.</para><para>The other serious, and I would say fatal, flaw in Senator Harradine's amendment is the definition of `parent'. In many Aboriginal communities, a person's parent is not their biological mother or father but another member of the clan group. How does Senator Harradine, or anyone else, see the definition of `parent' being applied in a culturally appropriate manner? Again, how will it be defined by a tribunal and a Federal Court which have been restricted in their ability to take cultural and customary concerns into account?</para><para>What about when a member of the stolen generation has been adopted? In this case their legal parent may well be a European Australian, and as such they will be excluded from being a person who can qualify as a native title claim group for the right to negotiate even if their biological parent, from whom they were stolen, had maintained their cultural and spiritual connection to the land. This amendment is the height of cultural insensitivity. It will see international derision heaped upon this country. It is a cruel joke played on the Aboriginal people of this continent.</para><para>The second set of reasons why we will be opposing any form of physical connection test is perhaps even more important than the more technical issues I have already raised. It is the message it sends to the entire community about the nature of Aboriginal land rights. For the first time, this parliament will be saying that a former physical connection is necessary for a native title right to be enjoyed. How is that going to make Aboriginal and Islander people who do not pass the test feel about themselves and their cultures?</para><para>I am sure that Senator Minchin will soon invoke his mantra that only one member of the claim group needs to be able to demonstrate a physical connection for a group to be registered, but what does this effectively do to establish a hierarchy of Aboriginality within Aboriginal communities? Those people in a community who cannot pass the government's test will know that they have not been classified by the government as the types of Aborigines who can qualify their 
 claim group for the most important native title right available to indigenous communities—the right to negotiate—no matter what their history of oppression, no matter what irrepressible connection to country and culture those Aboriginal people have. This is really offensive stuff.</para><para>What sort of country is willing to sell Aboriginal culture and spirituality for all it is worth when it comes to marketing for tourism or the Olympics, yet relegates it when it comes to actually providing substantive native title rights? People in this chamber who even contemplate a physical connection test of any kind have to take a really hard look at themselves and their commitment to understanding and reconciling with the Aboriginal people of this land.</para><para>This issue highlights how totally inappropriate it is for a group of white parliamentarians—and I include myself—to be making laws about native title rights when there is no possible way that we can understand the complex nature of Aboriginal communities and their relationship with country. We run an enormous risk of making some horrendous mistakes. It is clear that the only native title rights which we should be passing into law are those which have the unadulterated and informed consent of indigenous Australians—and you could hardly say that of this bill.</para><para>I know that we have been critical of the ALP over the last few days, but I acknowledge that Senator Bolkus abhors racial discrimination and that he reflects the views of rank and file members of the Labor Party who abhor racial discrimination. I therefore trust that the ALP will also reject Senator Harradine's amendment. It may be a marginal improvement on the government's measures, yet it falls far below the standards of racial discrimination to which Senator Bolkus and the Labor Party ascribe. The ALP has promised to maintain its position of 1997. Its rejection of Senator Harradine's amendment is central to keeping that promise.</para><para>I indicate again that the Greens (WA) will not be supporting Senator Harradine's amendment, so it will not be a matter in this particular case of going from what is a preferred option to whatever happens to be left. In fact, 
 we ask Senator Harradine to withdraw the amendment to avoid bringing further shame upon this parliament. I repeat that Senator Harradine now has a clear choice either to support a test which recognises spiritual and cultural connections or to be relegated to historical infamy by supporting the government agenda.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>2082</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it might be easier, given that in previous debates there has been some confusion about what we are dealing with, if we deal with the blocks as indicated and then work through them—that might be easier for everybody.

This section of the government's amendments is perhaps the most troubling example of what the 10-point plan is really about. When we last debated this bill in December, I spoke extensively on the issue of spiritual connection to land, not just for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, islander Australians, but for all of us. I want to make some reference to that speech again.</para></talk.start><para>I must say that, in my experience as a clergyman, when people speak about the significance of spirituality there is no doubt that for many people that is the fundamental way in which they describe their being. That is so often true of Aboriginal and other indigenous people. For that reason, we see the registration test as a trapdoor through which the government would like native title to fall. It is a hurdle that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders will have to jump to have their rights dealt with in a fair and equitable way. What is not very often understood, though, is that native title is the self-evident, manifest reality of their daily existence. Indigenous Australians do not need courts or tribunals to convince them of the existence of native title.</para><para>The whole reason that native title exists in both common law and in statutes is because white people do not, in the main, recognise indigenous reality. Native title is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander insurance policy against the repeat of the dispossession, dishonesty and genocide of the past. To gain that insurance, Aborigines are expected to pay too high a premium—for that is what the registration test is.</para><para>I turn to Senator Harradine's amendment. This amendment requires that native title claimants have to prove not only that they had an association with the land but also that they have had regular physical access to the land. There is the qualification of an additional generation with the physical connection and we recognise that as an improvement, but the Democrats could not support this amendment. We believe that the physical connection test is flawed in morality and in law. The Democrats do not accept that, in moving this amendment, Senator Harradine has given enough consideration to issues such as those raised in the recent report on the stolen generation whereby many Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their families and continuous physical relationship with the land was deemed impossible. I add that, with successive governments in Queensland of all complexions, it was government policy to move people from one end of the state to the other. </para><para>I will give a couple of examples. One of the communities which has been spoken about on a number of occasions in this chamber is the community at Mapoon on western Cape York. Part of the reason that the Mapoon people are having such a struggle in resolving native title is that, even amongst themselves, there is confusion about who really belongs to that community, so a distinction has been made between historical and traditional people. The traditional people are those who can trace their ancestry back many generations, whereas historical people are people whose grandparents, perhaps, or great-grandparents were moved to Mapoon from many other parts of northern Queensland. For them Mapoon is also their land, but a distinction is made between those who can trace their ancestry back many generations and those who have an ability to trace their ancestry back only two or three generations.</para><para>This whole issue is compounded by the fact that, in the early 1960s, the people were driven out of Mapoon. Some of them went to Thursday Island, some of them went to New Mapoon near Bamaga on the tip of Cape York, some of them went to Aurukun, and some of them went to Weipa. So again the removal of people was compounded.</para><para>I have spoken on a number of occasions to some of the ancestors of the Mapoon people. In Cairns, for instance, a large group of them are trying to understand how they can reclaim their community. It is not a pastoral lease but the community has mining interests all around it. The people in the community want to re-establish their own community, yet they have this problem. If the registration test as proposed is applied, we will have to say to a whole group of people from Mapoon, `Sorry, you don't qualify.'</para><para>The next example comes from Rosalind Kidd's book, <inline font-style="italic">The Way We Civilise It</inline>, from which I quoted a few days ago. In the community of Yarrabah near Cairns, almost all the people have come from somewhere else. What community do they belong to? That is the question that they ask. Many of them do not know where they came from, but Yarrabah has become their community. What kind of connection is required of them? Then there 
 is the example from the time of the Second World War. Pastor Schwartz was the missionary at Cape Bedford in Cape York. Because he was a German he was regarded as a Nazi sympathiser. The belief was that he had perhaps infected the community at Cape Bedford, so the military authorities demanded that the mission be disbanded. Reverend Schwartz was kept under armed guard and his belongings were searched. The mission car was confiscated in 1942, leaving no transport for medical emergencies, et cetera. The 271 residents of Cape Bedford were transported about 2,000 kilometres to the Aboriginal community at Woorabinda in central Queensland.</para><para>The relocation was appallingly bungled. Under military and police guard, people were refused time to gather clothing and belongings. Apart from a meal at Cooktown, no food was available next morning, nor on the 14-hour boat trip to Cairns, nor on the overnight train until 5.30 a.m. the next day at Cardwell. Nothing was provided from that evening until Rockhampton was reached the following afternoon. Woorabinda was nowhere near ready to accept them and to cut a long story short—and if I had time, I would certainly recall all of the disaster of this removal—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOSWELL</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—Please don't!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>—I think I should for your sake, Senator Boswell.

To what community do they belong, Cape Bedford in Far North Queensland or Woorabinda in Central Queensland? This is the problem that we have with the definition of the registration test that the government, and certainly Senator Harradine in his amendment, are putting upon us. I know there is considerable support for the refining of the registration test. I think everyone agrees with that. But it cannot be so refined that it creates a situation where the registration test is so onerous that it effectively wipes out accessibility to native title procedures.</para><para>It really is an issue of access to justice. A harsh test is not the issue. The injustice flows 
 from a harsh test in combination with unreasonably tight time frames from notices that will have the effect of impairing or extinguishing native title. We believe the government is attempting to say to native title applicants, `Sure you can have native title. You even have native title procedures. Just use them but don't expect us to make them work.'</para><para>On the other hand, the Democrat-Greens (WA) amendments will ensure that there are no technical knockouts of native title. Professor Langton, whom I mentioned in my earlier speech, in response to a question from Senator Ferris on overlapping claims—the main excuse the government is using to substantiate such a massive high jump bar for indigenous people to access their rights—said:</para><para>So, in answer to Senator Ferris's question, I wanted to explain the problem in this way. I spoke before about how one of the principles which anthropologists have identified in order to ascertain the workings of an Aboriginal land tenure system is the notion of descent from an apical ancestor.</para><para>As with all human cultures, the ancestor may be real or legendary, to use a lay term. For instance, British royalty had at one time its constitution in divinity and it was believed that the king, or the queen, was the divine representative on earth.</para><para>It was called `the divine right of kings'. She continued:</para><para>That is why the monarch is the representative of the Church of England, because of the doctrine of the monarch as divinity.</para><para>In a similar way, most human cultures have a belief system about ancestry. These days with DNA and RNA testing, some of this can be affirmed or denied, but much of it still is not amenable to scientific inquiry. Belief systems are belief systems and as we know with racism, generally false propositions which operate on illogic are not amendable to facts. So in the same way belief systems are simply belief systems and there is no point in taking blood tests and doing DNA tests because it is not relevant to the exercise. One would not do a DNA test on the queen to see if she were, in fact, a descendant of God.</para><para>That is rather a strange notion. Professor Langton went on to say a number of other things. That is available to us all in the transcript of that hearing.</para><para>When we take into consideration the genocide that has happened to indigenous people, 
 the provision of a physical connection test is an amendment that could easily have been drafted by the discredited historian David Irving. I appeal to the government and to the Senate to accept the Greens and Democrat amendments as fulfilling the need for a registration test which will sort out the various problems that have been enunciated.</para><para>We cannot accept Senator Harradine's amendment because it is based, we believe, on a false premise. We do recognise that Senator Harradine's amendment does improve the government's registration test, but neither the government's test nor the improvement which Senator Harradine is moving fulfils the basic principle that I have enunciated: the principle that, in the end, there are spiritual and cultural connections to land which are far deeper than any physical connection and that sometimes those kinds of connections can last for 200, 500 or 1,000 years, as in the case of the Jewish people—an example I gave in my previous speech. I commend our amendments to the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>2085</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Chair, I am at a bit of a loss to know where we are.

My amendment is to ensure that indigenous groups or members of indigenous groups who have been locked out by pastoralists or by actions of government, or those members of indigenous groups who have been stolen—the stolen generation—will be specifically included in the registration test, even if there is not one of their group currently alive who at some stage, even as a baby, has set foot on the land.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I said in the beginning of this debate that I am not prepared to see a diminution of the common law rights of indigenous Australians to their land. I stand by that. The fact that is being forgotten here is that for those indigen 
 ous groups to be entitled to native title they must have connection and descent, and the land must not have been subject to extinguishment. That is the CDE test. I think people have forgotten that. We are talking about native title; we are talking about the decisions in Mabo; we are talking about decisions in Wik. If you look at those, you do need CDE. You need contact, connection and descent because, in Mabo, the basis for native title was the rejection of the legal fiction, terra nullius. That is what we are dealing with here.</para><para>In order to ensure that we are giving an avenue to the genuine native title owners of the land we must establish some sort of registration test.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—There is one.

I will come to the spiritual connection in a minute. Have a word to others who are interested, including miners, pastoralists, governments and country townspeople—or city townspeople, for that matter. Those who want to see the High Court decisions upheld want to see a situation where all bogus claims are prevented from being successful and the huge number of overlapping claims which beset those who are concerned about this matter not able to get through the threshold test. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with having a proper test?</para></talk.start></continue><para>We are looking at a question now of what the High Court said. We do need to recognise that the High Court made it clear which indigenous people are entitled to a recognition of their native title. The High Court recognised that native title existed, and it recognised that native title should be recognised by the community where there is connection and 
 descent to the people who owned that land in 1788 when the first Europeans came to this land.</para><para>I now go to the arguments on the bill itself. In section 190B(5) the bill requires the registrar to be `satisfied that the factual basis described in the application . . . is sufficient to support the assertion that the native title rights and interests claimed exist.' Government amendment 73 expands that provision to spell out clearly that the factual basis on which it is asserted that native title rights	 and interests exist derives from the Mabo decision.</para><para>In section 190B(6) the bill requires the registrar to consider `that, prima facie, each of the native title rights and interests claimed in the application can be established.' There have been negotiations about this and I have made it perfectly clear to the government that I am concerned that that is too restrictive. Government amendment 73 changes this to `some rights and interests'. Previously, as the government wanted it, it said `. . . each of the native title rights and interests claimed in the application can be established'. The government has said `Okay, we will change this to `some rights and interests'.</para><para>Another amendment set up a register of those interests, including the spiritual interests and cultural interests of the indigenous group, which is very important to their connection to the land. I believe that this is a very significant amendment as it enables the native title claimant to be registered even if they are unable within the very strict time limits that are in the legislation to establish all of the claimed native title rights and interests.</para><para>To further improve this situation, opposition N34—perhaps, Senator Bolkus, that could be moved separately when the time comes—allows the register to be amended after registration so that native title claimants, when they come to negotiate, are able to negotiate about all the native title rights and interests which are then registered. That not only gives certainty to the pastoralists, the governments and those who need to consider the matters but also it gives a degree of certainty to the native title claimants. That is good.</para><para>The bill, in section 190B(7), introduces the traditional physical connection test which is not, strictly speaking, part of the common law test for the existence of native title. Unfortunately, many people seem to have been convinced that a requirement for a physical connection test is necessary to bring order into native title law. The amendments to the threshold test package which I have spoken about above will do far more to eradicate the spurious and scandalous claims than a physical connection test. When I said, `spoken about above', I meant the matters that I raised in this chamber in December. Honourable senators, if they are interested, can either go back to those or read the document entitled `Native Title Amendment Bill 1997: the Senate's amendments to the threshold test'. That is an eight-page document that was provided to me by my legal advisers.</para><para>If the government is insistent on this test, it needs to be ameliorated to ensure that those indigenous people who have been the victims of the locked gate and stolen generation problems are not prevented from having their claims registered when they have not given up their native title rights and interests to the lands of their ancestors. It is important for us to receive examples of this. As yet, I have not received examples of that situation. It is important to have some examples presented to us so that support can be maintained.</para><para>The government has gone some way to providing this situation in government amendment 73(7)(b). This does not go far enough given the fact that many of the victims of those policies and incidents, due to the scandalously low life expectancy among the indigenous, may no longer be living. Hence I propose to move N4 to add an extra generation to the government's physical connection test.</para><para>I come to Senator Woodley. Of all those people about whom he speaks, is there not any one of that indigenous group who is alive who, maybe as a child, was on that area? We are getting down to the practicalities now. I believe it is important when we deal with legislation to have a good understanding of what is being proposed and examples of how the amendments that are being put forward 
 are going to somehow affect the rights of particular individuals.</para><para>The bill, in section 190B(8), does not add anything to the threshold test package. An application must not be made unless there is compliance with the matters set out in section 61A. However, this provision puts an obligation on to the registrar to ensure that the application does comply with section 61A prior to its being registered.</para><para>The bill, in section 190B(9), required the registrar not to register a claim where the native title rights and interests consisted of or included ownership of minerals <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> where the Crown owned the minerals. Since it is possible that native title rights may include ownership of minerals in circumstances where the Crown at common law has ownership, that provision went too far. The government's amendment No. 73 inserts the word `wholly' to take care of the situation where the Crown's radical title to minerals may be burdened by native title.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>2087</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Earlier I spoke in general about the issues involved here. I suppose, like Senator Harradine, I thought we were going through the amendments sequentially. I have already indicated what the opposition will be doing regarding amendments 66 to 69. I want to spend a few minutes considering the core issue of this part of the debate, and that is the threshold test—the registration test—and how it should operate.</para></talk.start><para>The core issue is this: who is a genuine native title holder? How can that be resolved through the process? As Senator Harradine has said, a number of us in this place, in the community and among the working group are concerned that we are able to distinguish the bogus, fraudulent and overlapping claims from the genuine ones but, in doing so, we must ensure that there is still a course open for those with genuine claims to be able to pursue them.</para><para>In essence, the parliament needs to see how the High Court test in Mabo No. 2 can be best applied. When one listens to the debate, it is quite apparent that there are different views—those of the government; the opposition, which has a view shared with the Greens 
 and the Democrats; and Senator Harradine. In a numbers sense, we are skating on thin ice and hopefully something will come up, through the evolving debate, and the votes.</para><para>We think that the government's position goes too far. It is too restrictive and it is a curtailment of the High Court test. We are concerned that we not go too far in taking away common law rights and we are concerned that the government's proposal does in fact that. At the same time, we are concerned that it does not allow a course for some genuine claims to be pursued. Our amendments provide not just for the single test in the government's bill—the physical connection test, which is reflected in the government's amendment 73(7)—but ensure also that three tests apply in the alternative. The amendment that we are pursuing today is identical to the amendment that we pursued in the debate last November and December.</para><para>We accepted then the test put up by the government at the time of traditional physical association—that is, that one member of the native title claim group has or previously had a traditional physical connection with the area. That is still the first leg of our three-part test. In the alternative, we felt it imperative that the parliament take into account the injustice related to those who had been locked out and were denied traditional physical association. It would have been quite unreasonable for the parliament not to have recognised the importance of factoring in the position of those who were dispossessed of their land by lock-outs or by other actions forced upon them. That constitutes the second part of our test.</para><para>The third part of our test is, in essence, to pick up the words of Mr Justice Brennan in Mabo. For us, it is important that, if the parliament is to be seen to be reflecting the full impact of the common law, then the words of Justice Brennan should be reflected in legislation. I remind senators that he said:</para><para>Where a clan or group has continued to acknowledge the laws and (so far as practicable) to observe the customs based on the traditions of the clan or group, whereby their traditional connexion with the land has been substantially maintained, the traditional community title of that clan or group can be said to remain in existence. 
</para><para>In other words, there should be an avenue for them also to pursue native title claims.</para><para>We are concerned that these two aspects of connection—the physical and, as a subset of physical, the denied physical, together with traditional association with the land—are still maintained in a threshold test which, at the same time, ensures that the bogus, fraudulent and overlapping claims can be dealt with. They are dealt with comprehensively in other aspects of the legislation already passed through the parliament and still to be considered here. One way or another, we are still concerned that this avenue be made available.</para><para>Let us keep in mind also that we are not dealing with these three alternatives in isolation. We are dealing with them given that the legislation, as passed last year and as to be passed this year, ensures that the evidentiary burden is much higher than it was in the pre-existing legislation. There has to be establishment of a prima facie case. A whole raft of requirements were adopted by the Senate last year that ensure that, not just in terms of overlaps but also in terms of the burden of proof. At a very preliminary stage the burden is such that much of the flotsam and jetsam, I suppose it could be called, is not allowed to go to base one.</para><para>Our position is to reflect that. Our position is to acknowledge that this test will work within a framework as has already been deliberated by the parliament. Our other objective is to ensure that we meet the requirements of common law. You are talking about potentially taking away the common law rights of people. No matter what anyone says or what interpretation one gives to the case in the High Court last week, it is fair to say that anyone who reads that case will come away with not just a feeling but an understanding that to take away one's common law rights would meet with a different response—a stronger response—from the High Court.</para><para>We have to ensure that we do not do that. Senator Harradine says, `Well, give us an example where, by deleting the Mabo-Brennan test, you are denying people access to justice and access to their rights.' There are instances involving people on Palm Island in the Forties where, with careful consideration, 
 it may very well be that those people would be denied access under either the Harradine or the government test. We say that, if the view is that no-one will qualify under this particular test, there is no cost to anyone if we play it safe and ensure that this avenue is available to people.</para><para>There is some concern that the physical connection, as proposed by either Senator Harradine or Senator Minchin, is too restrictive. As I said, people in and around Palm Island in The Forties, for instance, may be denied access to native title claims because of the operation of the alternative test proposed. We will be pursuing our amendment that adopted last year. We see Senator Harradine's as a second best. We see the government's proposal as excessively restrictive and we will not be able to support that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>2089</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Bolkus for that clear exposition on why Senator Harradine's proposal is going to fall short of the mark. Senator Harradine's amendment cuts out a whole category that was available last year and that was argued by the committee, including Senator Harradine, on very cogent grounds. That category defends the rights of indigenous people to make a claim through traditional connection with the land, even if they have been locked out or fail to have a direct connection in the interim.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Harradine said that my amendment was to ensure persons who have been locked out will be specifically included, but he meant some persons who have been locked out will be specifically included. What his amendment does is water down, withdraw from and reduce even the tests that were voted on by the Senate in December last year. In particular, it is taking away from many people their spiritual and traditional connection, which is the foundation of their connection with the land. It is taking that away as a tenable and acceptable claim when people want to reconnect themselves with the land.</para><para>Let us remember this: on all of these occasions, these people have not wanted to be disconnected. Their history is not one of wanting to leave. There is a terrible history involved here, and time and time again it has 
 been visited on indigenous people and time and time again, through fraudulence, force or trickery, they have been removed from their land. Senator Woodley gave a gruesome account of how recently that has occurred on a large scale in Queensland, and we have to remember that.</para><para>I do not hear Senator Harradine getting up and being concerned about spurious and scandalous claims from people other than the indigenous people involved in this situation. The pall of potential misuse of this legislation hangs across the indigenous people. Why should that be the case? Why is it that Senator Harradine is moving back from the position that was held just last year, that he defended just last year?</para><para>I have two questions that I wish to have answered at the end of my comments. My first question is to Senator Minchin, who indicated on the weekend that a connection with the land is enough to give people the right to make a claim. I ask this: is any connection enough? Is a visit to the land enough? Can the government tell the committee if a visit to the land at some time in the past is enough to allow a traditional owner to make a claim?</para><para>My second question is to Senator Harradine. After Diaspora, did the Israelites have no right to go back to Israel? Did the generations of disconnection disclaim them? Are you opposed to the process of this century which saw the Jewish people going back to Israel, the return of the Israelites?

To not see that parallel and to back one but not the other is to discriminate, and that is again what is happening here.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I was at Doomadgee in the gulf country last year and I met up again with one of the wonderful members of the Gunggalida community, Wadgular Binna. As we were standing in the bush there, a group of us put to her that at that stage it looked like spiritual connection may be discounted, even as far as negotiations on mining were concerned. Her response was instant: `Take away our spirituality and you take away our hearts. That is taking the hearts out of us as people.' We should remember that. There are too many broken hearts in the last two and a bit centuries of the history of the indigenous people in this country. We have to do the best we can, because not one indigenous person is here to be able to speak up for that feeling they have for the land. We have to try to put ourselves in their position and, if we do, we will be found wanting.</para><para>There are double standards being employed here and it is not a very nice process.

Of course there are, otherwise they could not make a claim. The problem is, however, Senator Harradine, as I was saying, in making the physical connection the fundamental test, even going back a generation, you still do not solve the problem for those people I was speaking about. Take the Mapoon case: you have different groups of people, all of whom have a physical connection, making different claims, and some claims were not being allowed because even the degrees of physical connection were being debated. That was the problem.</para><para>Let me see if I can help us with a way through. The Democrats agree there must be a registration test but the real problem is the resourcing of representative bodies. That is where the problem has come about in trying 
 to apply the registration test where we have had overlapping claims and, in Senator Harradine's words, some bogus claims as well. Where even the 1993 act itself has been used and the representative bodies have been able to operate properly, they have been able to resolve those overlapping claims.</para><para>Take the example which is quoted regularly of the whole Kalgoorlie area and the goldfields. Just last week the Goldfields Land Council pointed out to me that by using the 1993 act they had been able, through negotiation, to collapse the 57 overlapping claims into two and in fact are now, through discussions with the mining companies in that area, on the point of signing agreements very beneficial to all the parties involved. So if the representative bodies are properly resourced, then even by using the 1993 act they are able to resolve the whole problem of overlapping claims. But the resourcing is critical.</para><para>Even in the 1993 act, bogus claims are knocked out. `Vexatious and frivolous claims'—I think is the wording—are not allowed. There have been vexatious and frivolous claims made—I have no doubt about that—but they are being dealt with, and they can be dealt with under the 1993 act, let alone under any amendments that we might propose.</para><para>Senator Harradine is right—many of these claims will not succeed simply because the native title has already been extinguished. I would point out that Mabo actually also said that the doctrine of terra nullius was null and void. By abolishing that doctrine, in one sense the whole of the continent should be open to claim. But, of course, as we know, the 1993 act made it quite clear that many parts of the continent are not subject to claim and native title has been extinguished in many parts of it.</para><para>I do not know whether I want to open up the debate about the Jewish people, but the point I was trying to make was that, again, a physical connection is not required of people who want to return to the state of Israel. The ancestors of some of those people have been separated for 200, 500, a thousand, two thousand years. In fact, you would have to go into myth and legend if you tried to trace any 
 connection between the current state of Israel and the original tribes of Israel. Nevertheless, Jewish people have a very strong connection. It is not physical connection; it is cultural connection. It is a connection of spirit; a connection of race, if you like.</para><para>The same problem, however, exists in many other parts of the world. The dispossession of the Scots, the Irish or the Welsh from their lands has never been properly settled. Those issues remain today. It is only as we negotiate with people properly and sit down with them that we begin to solve those problems. I am glad to see that, at least in relation to Scotland and Wales, there are now ways through after 700 years in some cases. Unfortunately, the Irish problem remains with us.</para><para>What we are saying is there are historical examples which give us pause. There is no direct connection between them. But what they say to us is, in terms of history, we need to learn the lessons that you need to deal with people with respect and deal with them properly. We need to negotiate outcomes which people can own and live with. Otherwise, the sore will continue to fester until finally it has to be dealt with.

Proposed subsection (7) states:</para></talk.start><para>The Registrar must be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group currently has or previously had a traditional physical connection with the area covered by application.</para><para>So we are not talking about `set foot as a baby'; we are talking about lived in what is considered to be a traditional physical connection with the area. I am wondering where this might lead to in the end. This might lead to the actual footprints—the tracks where people stood. Maybe we will get so tight in revisiting this over time that only those places which were regularly trod will become the areas where registration is accepted. I believe that it is a problem.</para><para>Over time concern has been expressed to me by a number of people, including the very people with whom Senator Harradine danced the other day. Gladys said to me, `I hope Senator Harradine understands this is a dance about our land and our culture.' I am not sure he did. The information I have received from the Mirimbiak nation's aboriginal corporation talks about the cases in Victoria, Victoria having a history of close occupation. I will read some parts from this letter:</para><para>Further, it may affect the way national laws regarding Indigenous people are implemented in Victoria. It may affect the way the registration test is implemented. Therefore the test itself should be carefully drafted to prevent perpetuating this stereotype.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>This requirement emphasises the government's conception of native title as something that purely exists in the physical domain. It emphasises the need as expressed by the State Government for native title holders to prove physical connection and presence on land, before any claims to spiritual connection will even be considered. Victorian Aboriginal people are not seen as having been on the land—"they have all been assimilated".</para><para>It goes on, and this, I believe, is a statement from the court:</para><para>It may amount to a pre-judgement about the nature of native title in Victoria.</para><para>It is inappropriate, before trial, for the nature of native title in Victoria to be pre-judged by the imposition of a threshold test, which may impose the wider community's pre-conceptions of what is Aboriginality. This will have particular pernicious effects in Victoria.</para><para>It is not the only way to achieve that end.</para><para>The most appropriate means of addressing the "problem" of over-lapping and ambit claims is by means of a well resourced, strong, and accountable—both legally and culturally—representative body. Mirimbiak is part of the way to achieving these aims with Victoria's native title holders. To date, there are no overlapping claims in Victoria.</para><para>I just wondered if Senator Harradine did a statistical analysis. I do not think this is about numbers, but it seems to be the way Senator Harradine is presenting it. If you did a statistical analysis of those potential claims which may now or retrospectively be either questioned or declared invalid, are these the claims that are likely to be associated with 
 overlapping claims? I have never argued that overlapping claims are a problem per se.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOSWELL</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—Why?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name></talker><para>—I have mentioned this on several occasions. The problem that existed in 1993 was the fact that the bill was drafted for white land law. It was therefore impossible to assume that Aboriginal land law would fit neatly and conveniently within European or white land law. It is our expectations of land connection and land ownership about Aboriginal people which, on a number of occasions, have created the problem. There are overlapping land associations depending on the situation, depending on the season, depending on the clan group. That is Aboriginal culture. There are times when people speak for themselves. There are times when people speak for wider groups. There are times when they cannot speak for their land connections without particular circumstances being involved. There are circumstances where different groups can speak for the same area of land. They are legitimate multiple claims.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Aboriginal people are being required to deal sometimes with hundreds of mining claims on the land for which they speak. We do not seem to think that that is a problem. We do not extinguish mining claims for that reason. I believe the problem is, in many cases, firstly, the way some cowboy corporations are acting and misusing the act and, secondly, the resourcing that is available not just to land councils but to other representative bodies—they could be corporations or other Aboriginal bodies—who are trying to deal with the issues and represent the people for whom they are set up.</para><para>This is important. When I spoke last on this issue, I talked about the situation in Western Australia. I talked about a situation where the health of a particular person or the failing health of a particular person may, if this bill goes through in this form, be the defining condition of whether or not a claim is recognised. I have a statement I would like to read from the Swan Valley Nyungah Community, a statement concerning their spiritual connection to the land and the 10-point plan. They say: </para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Spiritual Beliefs cannot be separated from the Aboriginal People or the Land.</inline></para><para>The Spiritual Connection to the Land is a given thing to us by Birthright and cannot be changed.</para><para>The Spiritual Beliefs are our Title Deeds to our Land, and we the people give no given consent to no Aboriginal groups or Labor or Liberal or any politician to say that they can do this to us—to try and separate our Spiritual Beliefs from us and the Land and our Land Title Claims.</para><para>It is not a question of one generation here and now. It is begun from the Beginning of Time with our very existence through all generations from then to now and it doesn't change.</para><para>The Spiritual Beliefs, the Spiritual Dreaming cannot be taken out of the Land just because people wish to do so now.</para><para>They have no authority, they have no given consent from the Aboriginal Nation as a whole.</para><para>Land Title Claims comes from within the Land and that is where our Life begun.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Our Spiritual Beliefs are the Roots of our Land Title Claims and our Beginning and they are not allowed to be ignored or not considered. No-one has any authorisation to alter or take our Spiritual Connection out of the Native Title Act.</inline></para><para>OUR SPIRITUAL BELIEFS, OUR SPIRITUAL DREAMINGS ARE THE ROOTS OF OUR LAND TITLE CLAIMs.</para><para>It is important to realise that that, for many people, is the most important basis. What we would be saying in relation to a registration test is that you do not get over the first hurdle</para><para>unless we ignore the overall importance of your spiritual connection. What we are saying if we vote for the government's position or Senator Harradine's amendment is that the pivotal point will be your level or your group's level of physical connection because you will not get any further unless that has been proven. I believe this is basically a disrespect of the importance of the spiritual connection to land. Simply dealing with figures, simply dealing with what is considered to be legal outcomes and simply putting in some kind of statistical argument will never overcome that huge gulf that seems to be existing between the government and what many people are telling us on this issue.</para><para>I said to Senator Harradine—and he interjected at the time—that there is a registration test. If the portions of the bill which deal with the physical connection test are knocked out, 
 there will still be a registration test. It may not be an ideal one, but there will still be a registration test. There are many hurdles for people to meet when making native title claims and the government has made sure there are as many as possible. However, it is simply not conscionable to suggest that to register and to gain the right to negotiate Aboriginal people have to pass a physical connection test for all and more of the reasons we are giving.</para><para>When we do get to that portion, I will not be moving all the Greens (WA)-Democrat amendments because we would like to concentrate on those areas which are most salient to the debate today. The first area where I will be moving an amendment is when we get to schedule 2, item 63. I would like to ask people to consider in the meantime dealing with Senator Harradine's amendment first, if possible, so we get a clear picture of where the Senate is going on that, because it is quite clear statements have been made by Senator Woodley now and by the Greens in relation to our voting pattern on those issues.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>2094</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Again I think there has been a misunderstanding of what we are all about. We are not saying what native title claimants should receive other than a statutory provision which gives them access. We are actually talking about statutory procedures which, if there is a registration of a claimant group, will enable that claimant group to have access to the land and to a right to negotiate over the registered interests, including spiritual or otherwise. The government is saying—it is rather insistent upon this—that those statutory procedures should be based on certain facts. In negotiation with the government, it has now placed before the Senate some amendments which will, to a certain extent, ameliorate the situation within the bill. So we are not determining what indigenous group could achieve native title.</para></talk.start><para>I have asked continuously in discussions here and around the place for an example.

It is a significant improvement, might I say, and there will be a number of others as a result of hours upon hours of discussions and examination of the matter.

The group which Senator Woodley spoke about would be able to meet the test that the government has applied. But let us take as an example a group who are relying only on a traditional cultural connection with certain land upon which there is some other group established at the present moment and say that they can—and I have not been given any example of that, but let us say that they can. There is nothing to prevent those people from applying to the court and proving their native title claims. There is nothing in this legislation that will prevent them from doing that.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—Except maybe a lot of money, Brian.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name></talker><para>—I am trying to deal with the situation which we face by the

I think that is what we should be aiming at. I say again that, when the time comes, you will have to presumably justify why you are not voting for an amendment which covers the stolen generation or the locked gates situation. Again, I have not been given any examples of those people who would not now come within the test being considered by the Senate, but if there are—and I am assuming there may well be—I am proposing this as at this particular stage.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>2095</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The real issue here is obviously between us on the non-government side. It is interesting to see that Senator Minchin has not really had to participate too much in the debate for the last few hours. The choice really comes down to Senator Harradine's amendment or Labor's amendment as to whether we apply a threshold test which reflects the common law.</para></talk.start><para>I think if we are to have a clear understanding of where we are going here, it would be very fair to say that there is a mile of difference between both the Harradine and the Labor amendments and the government's. I think we need to place on the record that there is an enormous chasm between the alternative proposed by the government and the alternative proposed by the opposition parties. We will move ours and will stick with ours because we believe that it more fully reflects the letter of the common law. But I for one have been trying to meet Senator Harradine's challenge in terms of trying to name one group of people who would be denied access under his test as opposed to the one proposed by Labor. It is important for us, and I still maintain that it is important for the parliament, to be seen to be implementing rather than curtailing the common law in particular in this area.</para><para>When it comes to the vote here, we all should recognise that there could be an enormous injustice if both the non-govern 
 ment tests go down, not just an enormous injustice but enormous injustices. For instance, earlier on I said that in the Palm Island case, people moved from western Queensland. The Wangkangurru people from the south-east corner of the Simpson Desert were moved in the 1940s. They know the sites; they are a very traditional people and they are imbued with a traditional connection with their country. They associated, and continue to associate, themselves with it, but their parents have died.</para><para>In those circumstances where parents have died, they would not meet the government test. They would meet the opposition test, but they would also meet the Harradine test. It is important for us to recognise that, if neither of these two tests gets through the Senate, an injustice will be perpetrated on these people. So I say there is probably a marginal difference between the Harradine and the opposition tests in all practicality. We believe our test is a—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—Oh!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—Senator Margetts, go through them all. I will go through a few more in a minute. The fact is that there is some difference between us and Senator Harradine, but there is a mile of difference between Senator Harradine and the government, especially if you are from the south-east corner of the Simpson Desert still trying to maintain a claim. Their land is now under an Aboriginal Land Act Queensland claim. As I have said, they would be protected under either the opposition or the Harradine proposal. They are one group.</para></talk.start></continue><para>People on Great Keppel Island are in the same situation; they were moved not in the 1940s but in the 1920s. So if they had one person from that claim group who could meet the Harradine test, they would still be able to pursue their claim. It would not be pursuable under the government test. Fraser Island is another one. As to Fraser Island, it is a national park and, as a consequence, I do not know that they would have any claim right under the act. They would not. In respect of those people, they might have been moved in the 1890s, closer to the turn of the century, but their rights have already been dispensed 
 with—I suppose that is the best way to say it—by legislation.</para><para>Let us not vote on this without appreciating that there is a big difference on the ground between the two alternative tests and the government test. The test that we are putting up reflects Brennan in Mabo, but Justice Brennan in Mabo also made reference, as did other justices, to the tide of history washing away the connection. That is something that we also need to take into account if we were, for instance, to take the view that, if the opposition test was not to succeed, nothing else is anywhere near as good as that; therefore, we will vote against all other provisions.</para><para>I suppose I am calling for both the Greens and the Democrats to keep in mind the enormous chasm between the Harradine test and the government test. We moved the Mabo-Brennan test last time. We still think it is a true reflection of the law and we think it is a better expression of the law, but if that test is not successful in the ensuing votes, then we will have to have a very close look at the Harradine test—in particular, to look at the injustices that would be perpetrated on claim groups if a more reasonable test than the government's is not successful.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2096</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is extraordinary to make a call to the Greens and Democrats but not to Senator Harradine on this.

If one person dies out of a clan group it loses its right to register a claim, even though the clan group as a whole has a tradition and an attachment to their island, to their land. Why should we be cutting those people out through an amendment that Senator Harradine has brought forward to try to make the government see this as being more acceptable? Why shouldn't we leave it to the court? Why shouldn't we leave the registration available to people who have a legitimate claim? Why shouldn't they have their day in court?

It is a very simple procedure.

 to negotiate. It is appropriate that there be a rigorous test. Everybody seems to agree on that. The question is: how rigorous? What we have said is that, in relation to physical connection, the registrar needs to be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group currently has or previously had a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters covered by the application.</para><para>In answer to Senator Brown, it will be a matter for the registrar to determine whether he or she is satisfied that there is at least one person who currently has or previously had the traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters covered by the application. That is entirely a matter for the registrar. As to the question of whether native title is determined or not, that is a matter for the courts. We leave it entirely to the courts to apply the Mabo test. The Mabo test was that they have maintained their traditional connection—and that means from the time of settlement—and that the native title has not in the meantime been extinguished by an act of government. That is entirely a matter for the courts to determine.</para><para>Of course, once a claimant has a determination—having passed the court test—and is a determined holder, then they automatically have the right to negotiate. They do not have to go through this process; this is a process for claimants. Once they are determined holders they automatically have the right to negotiate in respect of any future mining or compulsory acquisitions.</para><para>I am happy for you all to argue among yourselves about this, but you have to premise your argument on what this test is all about; it is about access to a statutorially created set of procedural rights that are not part of the common law. The High Court has said nothing about it, nor has it created the statutory right to negotiate. This is a creature of this parliament. It is appropriate that this parliament set a reasonable threshold for access to these procedural rights, remembering all the time that it is entirely a matter for the courts to determine what traditional connection actually means.</para><para>I think most Australians probably presume that what the High Court was talking about was some sort of physical connection. We are not saying that that is the case. It is left to the courts ultimately to determine, case by case, whether traditional connection is a requisite for a determination that people hold native title. That is a matter for the courts. All we are saying is that, if someone wants access to this set of procedural rights which is not generally available to anyone else—the person is only a claimant, remember; the person has not had a determination that they actually hold the native title—then one member of the group has to satisfy the registrar that they currently have or had a connection. The obverse is to say that someone, as a claimant group, can have access to this set of procedural rights even though not one member of the claim group has ever had any connection to any part of the land in question.

 other relatives once they have died? What may be necessary to establish physical connection in the test that Senator Harradine has suggested?

I do not know if this does answer the question because I am again having difficulty fixing the parameters of this debate.</para></talk.start><para>An example, Senator Harradine, of a group which I do not think would pass your test is the Turrbal group. The Turrbal group of people inhabited Brisbane in the early days. We are now beginning to uncover some of their story, particularly because of Tom Petrie, one of the early settlers of Brisbane, who recorded a lot of the history of the Aboriginal people.</para><para>The Turrbal people were massacred in Brisbane in the 1850s and were thought to be extinct. But, because we have been able to uncover this history, it is known that Maroochy Barambah, who is recognised by all the Aboriginal people of south-east Queensland as being one of the Turrbal people, is a descendant—I only have her English name—of Kitty. Kitty is a Turrbal woman who escaped that massacre and fled to a part of south-east Queensland near the town of Kenilworth. She has made a claim. It is not a claim over people's backyards; it is simply 
 a claim to enable the Turrbal people to have some participation in decision making in relation to some of the places of special significance in and around Brisbane. The Turrbal people would like to have a particular place set aside as a keeping place for their artefacts. I am not sure whether Maroochy Barambah would ever qualify in a physical connection test because of the break in the generations, although we are now beginning to find the links.</para><para>The other problem we have in Queensland is, sad to say, that many of the files in the department have disappeared.

All we are saying is that to pass this part of the test, the registrar has to be satisfied that just one member, at some stage in their lives, had that traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters claimed.

In respect to both amendments, we are trying to accommodate a situation where you might have, for instance, multiple claims in a particular claim. As the provisions now stand, in those circumstances there is no capacity for an ongoing consideration of the claims separately. We are concerned to ensure that where a registrar makes a determination in respect of some of the claims the registrar does have sufficient flexibility to, for instance, defer consideration of some of the claims or all aspects of the overall application and deliberate on them at a later date. That is why we will move the amendment to reflect the words `continue to consider' in RN35 and `thereafter considers' in RN34.</para></talk.start><para>There has been what I would claim to be a typographical error in respect of RN34.

This is about which rights and interests can be dealt with in the right to negotiate process. What if you are halfway through a right to negotiate process and another set of rights and interests is added to the register? We think it is impractical.

What I think Senator Bolkus is pointing out with his N amendment is that, rather than it going to arbitration, once the information comes to light why can't the registrar simply register that particular interest?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2103</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That is exactly the point that we are pursuing.

 sense, what we are trying to achieve is some flexibility for the registrar, who could be in a position to proceed with some claims but may, for instance, have called for more information and may want more information in respect of some others. By being able to proceed with some and allow further consideration of the others it provides flexibility, recognising, as Senator Harradine rightly says, that we are talking of a much higher threshold in terms of the evidentiary test and the sort of information that is required.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>2103</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government is not able to accept the amendment, as I have stated.

Subject to that sort of uncertainty, we do not think it is reasonable.</para><para>Claimants should identify those native title rights and interests which they claim and give the registrar the opportunity and the information required for him or her to satisfy themselves that it is a prima facie case. So far as that right to negotiate process is concerned, those are the rights and interests which will be able to be subject to negotiation as to the impact on them of the proposed lease or licence. Once the claim is registered, with respect to any future section 29 notices claims can be amended if additional evidence is brought that persuades the registrar that additional rights and interests should be registered. But I think you must take account 
 of the other parties to a right to negotiate process and the certainty which they have every reason and right to seek as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>2104</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Harradine mentioned that this registration test is substantially higher than what was there previously.

We are setting the standard and it will be for the registrar to apply it. We ourselves are not seeking to apply this test to all the claims in the system. I remind you that the test will apply only to claims registered since the government's registration test was first introduced into the parliament. That is now some time ago. I think it was the end of June 1996 when we first introduced legislation regarding this test and we indicated then that the test would apply to all claims registered after that date. I think there were several hundred claims registered to that point which are not affected by this test per se, unless there is a section 29 notice issued in respect of them, so it will have a differential impact in terms of when the claim was registered, what it covers, et cetera. But, no, we believe that this test will do what many Aboriginal groups have sought—that is, to impose more discipline in the registration process to ensure that only those with bona fide genuine claims and claim groups will have access to the right to negotiate.</para></talk.start><para>I remember sitting down with the Waanyi representatives complaining about the problems in relation to the Century process. They said to us, `There are claimants involved in this right to negotiate process who should not be here. There should be a better test to ensure that they are not part of this registration process.' It was even said to us then that we ought to have a majority test in relation to the right to negotiate: that if a majority of registered claimants can reach agreement then the agreement should be signed. We are not doing that; we are not putting in a proposal of 
 that kind. The right to negotiate still involves the necessity to get the agreement of all the claimants if you want to avoid going to arbitration.</para><para>But the test will minimise the extent to which there are several claims coming from within the one claim group. This is something sought by Aboriginal people to ensure that one claimant group makes one claim, and you do not have several claims being made by people who are all related and within the one claim group. We are confident that, as it is implemented and as claims are made, it will reduce the extent of the real problem within Aboriginal communities of multiple competing and overlapping claims often generated from within the one group and that the right to negotiate process, which we acknowledge is a very important process for Aboriginal people, will involve genuine claimants sitting down, discussing and seeking agreement with the proposers of the particular mining development.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>2105</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The minister must have promised something to the bush in relation to this particular threshold measure.

I am just wondering if what we are doing here is trying to organise the pattern so that that promise is broken by the ALP.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>2108</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Once again, the flak seems to be coming from this side of the parliament, and unjustifiably so.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JX4</name.id><name role="metadata">MINCHIN</name><name role="display">Senator Minchin</name></talker><para>—Oh, I don't know.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—Yes, you have your own interests here. I could argue with Senator Margetts at length, but the reality of the situation is that we are continuing with the amendment that we moved last time.

That is the one I want to vote on first.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Blind Freddy understands that, if the numbers are not here for this one, the Senate has to make an assessment as to what the second best preference is, if it is concerned about protecting Aboriginal interests. If, to some, that second best preference is the government's position as opposed to Senator Harradine's, let them be judged on that. But we have been busting our guts to try to get the amendment that was passed last time up through the Senate this time, and that has been very much one of the major purposes of this debate, not just in here but in discussions over the recent four, five or six weeks at all different levels. The commitment is there. The commitment stays there. But, in all your purity, if you want to vote Aboriginal interests 
 down, Aboriginal rights down, Senator Brown, go ahead and do so.</para><para>As I mentioned earlier, there are some real hard cases out in the community, people who will move to different areas who will not qualify to pursue claims under Senator Minchin's test, who will qualify under ours and who will also qualify under Senator Harradine's.

No matter how much blustering bombast that you throw at me, no matter how much rhetoric you indulge in for the next hour or so to try to argue that it is the Labor Party who is selling out, let me tell you that you are the one walking with your eyes open over the side of a cliff.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>2109</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That does tempt me to my feet. I am not going to enter into any argument with Senator Bolkus. I have heard the heavyweight arguments coming from the ALP before. We have seen them try to browbeat us into agreeing to log forests. We have even seen them try to browbeat us into such ventures as the uranium mines, dams and so on.</para></talk.start><para>That is not what is germane here. Germane here is proper order. On the non-government benches, there has been a move to bring in a new amendment—that is, Senator Harradine's amendment—as against those we dealt with in December. The right and proper thing is to test that amendment before we go back to the position we had in December. We have made it quite clear that we will not be supporting that Harradine amendment. It does not make any difference which order it goes in, and let me make it quite clear why that is the case.</para><para>I am not going to be dictated to in selling out Aboriginal interests further by Senator Harradine or anyone else. The Labor Party can do that if they want to, there has to be a line drawn somewhere. If it is `brinkpersonship' that Senator Bolkus is engaged in here, it is not working. The proper order that Senator Margetts has put forward in dealing with these amendments should be the way we go. It does not matter. It is not going to change the voting outcome, and so be it.</para><para>Let me just reiterate that we have an alternative coming from Senator Harradine which is not just marginally different; it is vastly different, and it cuts out people who could make a claim. We can challenge each other all night as to which of the 800 potential claims come within or without the ambit of Senator Harradine's or Senator Bolkus's positions. The fact is that people will be cut out, and that is why all of us—Senator Harradine, the Democrats, the Greens and the Labor Party—should be sticking with where we were last December and ensuring that those people who have a spiritual claim, an attachment to the land, which comes through their grandparents, their uncles or aunts, are not cut out by the Harradine slippery slide away from that position towards the government, as is inherent in his amendment.</para><para>It does not matter what order they come in. Senator Margetts has put forward the sensible way of doing it. But, if the Labor Party wants to side with Senator Harradine against the government, and people on this side are in that or against anybody, so be it. We will not argue about the procedure. We will argue about the substance of what is happening. There has to come a point where you say, `Enough is enough.' There has to come that line. All of us had a position in December on this issue which we said was the bottom line then, including Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine has drifted away from his bottom line. As far as I am concerned, he can drift on his own because there are people out there in the bush who lose out if we drift with him.</para><para>I will be saying a bit more later when it comes to the upgrade provisions and the right to negotiate over the upgrade of lands. I will not canvass that here because that is going to be a test in itself. So much has been sold out already, though. Of course the argument always comes up, `Oh, well, drift a little further.' Not on this one. We stated our position in December, Labor did, the Democrats did and Senator Harradine did. But Senator Harradine has now decided to renege, to give away more against the wishes and interests of the indigenous people. Be that on his head. The Labor Party can decide what it wants to do in its own good time.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2110</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just want to remind the Senate that nobody has answered the question about how you deal with the difficulty of defining `parent' in Aboriginal culture, given the variety of Aboriginal culture; nobody has answered the question of how you deal with stolen generation adopted children; and nobody has answered how those cultural complexities will be dealt with in any way, shape or form by Senator Harradine's amendments. In effect, we have the Labor Party voting for a physical connection test. That is the bottom line of it.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>2110</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it is important that the Democrats put on the record where we stand in all of this. There is no doubt that the Labor Party's amendment is preferable to any of the others which have been proposed, at least in terms of the government and the Harradine amendments, and that would be about as far as the Democrats were prepared to go.</para></talk.start><para>The principle that we keep enunciating is that the registration test should include a physical or a spiritual or a cultural connection. We cannot see that Senator Harradine's and the government's position are very different. Certainly, in theory, Senator Harradine's amendment seems to be an improvement on the government's position, but we do not see that it is sufficiently an improvement to really attract us. Let me just say why that is so.</para><para>The problem with both the government and Senator Harradine's amendment is that the onus of proof is very much on people who are the victims of dispossession—in one sense not only of dispossession but also of attempted genocide. It seems to me that justice cannot be delivered when what most of these people have experienced has been without their knowledge and without their consent. I pointed out before that in Queensland particularly there has been a practice of destroying documents which could in fact establish some of the connections that either the government or Senator Harradine are talking about, but because of the loss of that documentation it is very doubtful. I have not heard Senator Harradine give me a guarantee that it could 
 obtain. It is very doubtful that we could proceed down the road of the government or Senator Harradine's amendment and arrive at any justice for the people we are talking about.</para><para>We have information that suggests that people who have been dispossessed, or in fact stolen, in terms of the stolen children, may still have a cultural place held for them within the system of native title holding; not in any white law system, but certainly in terms of how Aboriginal people view it. That certainly is true of the Maroochy Barambah case that I detailed before dinner. Are we going to deny those people their connection? I believe that we cannot take that risk. Why should they have to have the onus of proof to prove their position over and against what was an immoral and an illegal action by governments and other people?</para><para>Just one more example, and I will close with this, is that in Victoria, from 1886 onwards, so-called half-castes were no longer permitted to live on mission stations. Yet they were set firmly within their own native title country. In a sense, it is a policy based on eugenics, I understand, Senator Brown, and we cannot place our trust in that kind of policy. So that is the position that we are left in and that is why we would prefer to deal with Senator Harradine's amendment first. But we are aware of how the numbers go in this place.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>NaN:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2110</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to put it on record, though, and seek leave to deal with Senator Harradine's amendment N4 first.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Reynolds)</name></talker><para>—Senator Harradine, would you be willing to move the amendment if leave was granted?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2110</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I suggest, Madam, that we proceed according to standing orders.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—That means we have to set aside the government amendment, Minister, and we must deal first with opposition amendment N36, if that is the wish of the committee.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>2111</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Temporary Chair, I do not think we are in any way or form breaching standing orders; we are just asking.

But in my view this does not go far enough, given the fact that many of the victims of those policies and incidents, due to the scandalously low life expectancy of indigenous people, are no longer alive. Hence, I am moving this additional amendment. I am doing so by adding an extra generation to the government's physical connection test.

What has happened here is, firstly, that Senator Harradine's amendment removes all avenues for a connection with the land other than a physical one being a reason for a person to move towards a claim. It adds that a claim is taken to include a reference to a parent of a member of the native title claim group.</para></talk.start><para>That is a slight advance on the government's position, but it leaves out uncles, aunts and grandparents—all previous generations. What we see in this amendment is what is left, but we should be looking at what has been taken out. Beyond that, it very clearly does away with the spiritual connection, the cultural connection and the traditional connection that people have with the land unless they have a physical connection argument to put forward. It is just not good enough.</para><para>The dynamics of this are that, in December last year, the non-government participants in this debate agreed to have the spiritual, cultural and physical connection test available. All other components of the non-government benches except for Senator Harradine hold firm to that. That is for him to wrestle with. The Greens cannot go along with this further removal of the ability of indigenous people to make a claim that the land is theirs when it is.</para><para>Senator Minchin might talk about all the processes that are in between, but that confuses the matter. Let us be straight about it. If we stop people at the outset, we stop them at the finish; if we stop them at the gate, we 
 stop them getting anywhere. The problem here is that, as Senator Woodley has put it, Senator Harradine's amendment is very close to the government's amendment. It is certainly much closer to the government's amendment than it is to the next Greens-Democrat amendment. That will be the real test here.</para><para>Senator Harradine's amendment has gone, as I said before—the numbers are not here for it.

 see more of it. If `obdurate' is a word that Senator Harradine wants to levy, I will accept it.

We are talking about the difference between the Harradine amendment and the government's position. Earlier I mentioned the Wangkangurru people of the south-east corner of the Simpson Desert in western Queensland. They were removed in the 1940s. As I said earlier, they know their sites. They are a very traditional people. They have a traditional connection to their country. They are imbued with it. They associate themselves with it. I am informed that in all cases their parents have died. So, under the government test, they would not be able to pursue their claim; under the Harradine test they would. That is why I have been saying consistently that there is a big difference if you were to take it back one generation. It is the difference between two decades or maybe five, six or seven years. That in itself demonstrates, I think, the difference between the two tests. They are not the only ones. Earlier, we mentioned people from Great Keppel, and I am sure there are quite a number of similar circumstances.</para></talk.start><para>As I said earlier in the debate, our preferred position was the one that we moved and the one that did not get the support of this place. But in the same way that we have been trying to make incremental gains on what passed the parliament last year, trying to resist erosion of 
 those gains or of the position that might have got through last year, in the same way that we make a commitment to ensure that the principles we pursue now we will pursue in government, I say to the committee that though this may not be the preferred option of some—obviously, our preferred option was the one we moved—I think it would be an enormous injustice to possibly a whole generation of people if we were not to pick up the amendment.</para><para>Senator Woodley, I think you have picked the right point again in terms of stolen generations. In a sense they are covered by the `locked out' provisions, but people have been locked out in more than one way, they have been driven out in more than one way. If we acknowledge that, I think we really have to acknowledge the Harradine position. Though I would maintain that it does not cover all situations, it does cover a whole lot more than the government's does. That is the reason we are supporting it.</para><para>Question put:</para><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine's</inline> ) be agreed to.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>20:59:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.	</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.

If the registrar is considering relying on material adverse to the claimant, the claimant must have a chance to respond. If after that there is a factual dispute the registrar must not consider the adverse material further under section 190B. The government's amendments seek to apply the new, more onerous registration test to all claims currently on the register of claims. We believe it is an unnecessary task. The National Indigenous Working Group proposed amendments focused on those instances where registration via a low threshold test may have caused problems—for instance, in overlapping claims in response to section 29 notices.</para><para>I indicate that because we have just passed amendments, including government amendment No. 73—and of course we have had discussions backwards and forwards on whether it is an amendment that has been moved or now the bill—it now means that the Greens-Democrats amendments need to be altered a little in line with the new situation. Therefore, where our amendment originally was to delete sections 6, 7, 8 and 9, I believe they will need to be renumbered 5, 7, 8 and 9. I am happy to be advised if that is not the case. This does give all participants in this debate a chance to reasssess the removal of the physical connection test. If it is believed, and it has been strongly argued by Senator Bolkus—I have to say that his arguments for his own amendments were not his most convincing—by the majority of members of this chamber that the physical connection test is not fair to indigenous people, this is the chamber's chance to address that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>2120</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek some clarification because I am a little confused.

If we do that, then we need to be sure as to what we will replace it with. If we are knocking out the physical connection, it does not seem to me that the Democrat-Greens amendment will replace it with all that much; in fact, I do not think there is a replacement there for it.

Government amendment 4 rectifies a gap in the confirmation of extinguishment provisions by 
 enabling a state or territory to confirm the effect of previous exclusive possession acts and previous non-exclusive possession acts that took place over land that now forms part of that state or territory but did not at the time the grant was made. Amendments 5 to 7 make minor amendments to section 47A to ensure that that provision, which enables certain extinguishing acts to be ignored when a native title claim is being determined, applies to areas which have been granted or vested, whether on trust or otherwise, expressly for the benefit of indigenous people.</para><para>Government amendment No. 8 replaces the word `declaration' in section 47B with the word `dedication', simply to ensure that the terminology used in 47B to refer to land reserved for a purpose is consistent with the terminology used elsewhere in the bill when referring to reserved land.

We think they should be supported by the Senate; the confirmation regime was passed through the Senate last time.

The government here has undertaken a speculative exercise of attempting to predict what the courts may decide about the extinguishing effect of inconsistent grants of interest on native title.</para></talk.start><para>The government describes this section as confirmation of extinguishment, implying that these provisions merely confirm the common law position. However, it is clear to all of us on this side of the debate that these provisions 
 do in fact overreach the common law and in themselves are legislative extinguishment of native title. The government, for instance, says that people have assumed that such interests as freehold, all types of leases, public works, et cetera, extinguish native title. But I think it is clear to say that the Wik decision left this assumption in a very unclear situation. The government says it needs to make clear which interests extinguish native title. However, this is very much a bad description of the effect of its legislation. It is misleading.</para><para>The process, for instance, by which the government has unilaterally determined what will extinguish native title is shoddy. It was exposed as such by parliamentary committee after parliamentary committee, and the process will result in the extinguishment of native title throughout the country with consequent compensation implications for the taxpayer. This is a provision that also rejects the principle adopted by Wik: the principle of coexistence. In terms of the general outline of this provision, what we have here are bucketloads of extinguishment: we have them by way of division 2B for instance.</para><para>The only justification for a legislative extinguishment regime is to allow development and interest to be granted over land without having to consider native title at all. To us, that is unacceptable. Extinguishment is not necessary for validation of titles or protection of the existing valid interests in the land. These interests do prevail already over native title; case after case has indicated that as well. What we have here is legislation with a sole purpose of ensuring that future interests can take place unimpeded in any way by native title. What we have here is not just extinguishment; we have discriminatory extinguishment. We have extinguishment also when, as I said, the common law leaves open whether it is suspension or extinguishment.</para><para>As I said, the principles of the Wik case are overturned by this particular part of the government's 10-point plan. The government, for instance, has attempted to ensure that native title will be partially extinguished by the grant of a non-exclusive possession act, a pastoral lease. Recognising this injustice, the Senate voted last December in favour of the 
 amendments by Senator Harradine which confirmed the position at common law—namely, that native title is suppressed and not extinguished by the grant of a pastoral lease. We continue to support those amendments. When one looks at what extinguishes native title, when one looks at what the government has tried to ensure extinguishes native title, one finds a long, exhaustive list of interests such as rifle ranges, Defence purposes and water tanks. It is amazing to what extent the government has gone to find ways of extinguishing native title.</para><para>We say now that there still needs to be a focus on the government's approach to legislative extinguishment. We say the government still exceeds the common law. The claim that division 2B is intended to reflect the common law is still wrong. For instance, section 23J gives that game away. Section 23J says that compensation is payable where the legislation goes beyond the common law and extinguishes native title. It is a safety net provision but one that basically is a confession by the government that they go in excess of the common law.</para><para> In relation to the schedule of extinguishing interests, Senator Minchin says there are some 60,000 leases in division 2B, many of them in the schedule. Yet the way that schedule was drawn up, the way people's native title rights were extinguished on such a massive scale behind—as we found out—closed doors was in direct violation of the methodology made painstakingly clear by the High Court in the Wik decision. The judges of the court said that, when you are dealing with people's property rights and asking the extinguishment question, you must look carefully, firstly, at the legislation which authorises Crown grants; secondly, at the individual lease documents given to land holders to ascertain the precise rights; and, thirdly, at the native title rights which the local people assert over the land.</para><para>It is only then that you can come to a conclusion about inconsistency and extinguishment. But the Native Title Act left the extinguishment question to the courts and the common law to decide on a fair and just basis according to law. This government's proposal has ignored the detail of what was demanded 
 by the court. Basically what we have here is a check list which will, I am sure, throw up error after error.</para><para> The other important aspect in this debate is the question of constitutional validity. Eminent lawyer after eminent lawyer has told parliamentary committees that lack of notification associated with division 2B acquisitions of property was a matter of constitutional concern. If indigenous Australians are not notified before their property rights are acquired and they are not given an opportunity to object, how can the bill be said to provide just terms and pass the procedural aspects of the just terms constitutionality test?</para><para> We continue to say the government's earlier overreach is a concern. The government, as Senator Minchin has said, is moving amendments. Some amendments will curtail the overreach in one of two ways. Subsection 9 of 23B will be widened so that it excludes all the appropriate forms of beneficial land ownership and trust or for the benefit of indigenous people, and areas created by divesting or grants to protect the national environment such as national parks have been excluded. These are beneficial amendments. As a consequence, we will support them.</para><para> Our amendments still go to the protection against overreach, for instance, in the definition of previous exclusive possession act. We also go to the question of 23B and the extinguishment as well. I say at this stage that the Greens-Democrats amendment to oppose division 2B is one that we will support when it comes up for a vote. We supported it last time, but, as the Senate knows, we were beaten by the numbers in that respect.</para><para> I also say that we have taken the government and the High Court at their word in respect of factors that are relevant in terms of section 23B and defining acts which the government says extinguish native title. Proposed subsection 9B excludes from the definition of a previous exclusive possession act a category of act which, in our view, cannot be included on any fair or reasonable basis. It excludes leases which exceed 25,000 hectares. The High Court said in Wik that the size of the lease in question was a very relevant consideration in deciding whether a 
 particular grant extinguishes native title. In fact, even the government agrees. It lists size as one of the 10 relevant factors in its explanatory memorandum.</para><para> Taking the government and the High Court to word, we say that 25,000 hectares is a very large area in anyone's language. It is impossible how anyone could argue that every lease of that dimension would necessarily require exclusive possession in order to give effect to the grant. Excluding such grants does not mean that individual lease holders of large properties are prevented from proving in court that their particular grant necessarily implies exclusive possession. It simply means that we want to protect against the government sweeping every one of these very large grants indiscriminately into the extinguishing category.</para><para> There are other amendments as well which we will pursue, but, as I say, there are both constitutional and fairness problems in respect of the government's proposals put up the first time and also put up this time. We will be pursuing amendments once again to ensure that we protect the position that was passed in the Senate last year.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>2128</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition's amendment is quite ridiculous.

If it is an exclusive possession, it is exclusive possession. Exclusive possession is not determined by the size of the lease. I think they have simply plucked a number out of the air. If there is one lease in Queensland that is 25,000 hectares exactly and there is another one that is 25,000.82 hectares—0.82 hectares is about the size of a normal household block; and the person that is sitting on the 25,000 hectares is probably out too—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BOLKUS</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name></talker><para>—Twenty-five thousand hectares is a normal block?

They are a long way from the 25,000 hectares that the government has decided to put in the category of native title.</para><para>I think it is a quite silly and stupid amendment. I do not know how the figure of 25,000 was reached. Perhaps Senator Bolkus might tell us the way he reached it. Did he look into a crystal ball or did he come up with it some other way?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>2129</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There is some clarification I need from Senator Bolkus in relation to opposition amendment N3. There is some conflict with Greens-Democrats amendment 12A. I would like to ask him—and I hope he has time to answer—what is the effect of opposition N3? What would be the reason for not supporting our 12A instead? N3 seems to be extinguishing crown to crown grants on titles that come under a number of categories, including residential and other categories. I wonder if Senator Bolkus can explain the rationale for not supporting 12A instead of his N3.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>2129</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Very briefly, as Senator Margetts rightly said, N3 is a modified version of an amendment which passed the Senate last year. It is an amendment which again corrects the overreach in the definition of a `previous exclusive possession act'. It excludes, for instance, grants of an interest between different arms of what is the same basic entity—for 
 instance, crown to crown—whether it be a statutory authority or a state or federal government. It applies the same exclusion of the criteria of vesting of an interest in land in the same entities. Proposed subsection 9A of 23B also contains an appropriate protection where the land is subsequently put to residential, agricultural or commercial uses. At this point the exclusion no longer applies.</para></talk.start><para>The amendment also leaves it to the common law to determine what effect on native title those transfers between different arms of government—crown to crown—have. It is something that I think we pursued last time. We did not want to preclude a non-extinguishment capacity by adopting the extinguishment principle adopted by the government. It also maintains consistency with the current Native Title Act, which excluded these interests from the automatic extinguishment category.</para><para>So the advice is that, in essence, it does what we set out to do last time, but it has been amended probably more in style than anything else to pick up some of the technical problems with it. Given the fact that it is 45 seconds before 9.50 p.m. now, I should take on notice any further information which would clarify the modification. As I say, the substance is the same. It is an amendment which was developed by the indigenous working group lawyers and ourselves in consultation with other parties. My understanding is that, in essence and in substance, it does no different to what was passed last time. If I can talk for five more seconds and take the rest of the answer on notice for tomorrow morning, that would probably be a fair conclusion to the day's proceedings.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>2129</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

 take a couple of minutes of the Senate's time tonight to speak of a great Australian who passed away recently. The former mayor of Mount Isa Franz Born died during the week of 27 March and was buried in Caloundra. He was the mayor of Mount Isa from 1975 to 1985 and was involved in a number of significant community projects, including the construction of the Mount Isa Civic Centre and library and Lake Julius.</para></talk.start><para>Through the auspices of the <inline font-style="italic">North West Star</inline> newspaper I have learnt of some of the tributes paid to the late Franz Born by friends and community leaders, including the current mayor Ron McCullough, Mr Fred Binzer and Mr Joe Schmider who gave some overview of the work that Mr Born did in the north-west during his time. Franz Born will be remembered as a great citizen of Mount Isa and of the north-west. A perfectionist in all he did, Mr Born came to Mount Isa in the early 1950s, travelling on a motorbike via dirt roads, after he had emigrated from Germany.</para><para>Attracted by the employment prospects, he took up a position as an underground miner and quickly progressed to foreman before leaving the mine to set up Mount Isa's brickworks—the first in Mount Isa. The business still survives in that city. He also built the Sunset Shopping Centre, which he used as a base for his smallgoods factory. That factory enabled him to draw on the skills he had learned as an apprentice butcher in Germany.</para><para>Mr Born was instrumental in the establishment of the Concordia Club in Mount Isa, which celebrated the strength of the German-Austrian migrant community in that city. His community service was recognised with the presentation of a Class 4 badge of merit by the Federal Republic of Germany during his time in Mount Isa. His entry into local politics as mayor of that mining city in the north-west was a logical progression of his community commitment.</para><para>I first met Franz Born in the early 1980s. Regrettably, I met him only very briefly when he was elected to the Liberal Senate team in Queensland at that time. He was not successful, being a little way down the ticket, but I often think that it was probably because of the influence that he and his supporters in the 
 north had at that time in getting him on to the ticket that eventually led to my election, coming from the north, to lead the Liberal Party Senate team from Queensland.</para><para>After Franz Born left the mayoralty of Mt Isa, he moved to Caloundra in semi-retirement but continued his interest in local politics there. He was involved in the Caloundra Shire Council for several years. I am told he spent two terms there and my colleague Mr Peter Slipper, the member for the federal electorate that takes in Caloundra, has told me that Mr Born was well remembered for the distinctive and attractive design work that was done in Bullcock Street, one of the main city centre streets in Caloundra. A smallgoods manufacturing plant that he started on the Sunshine Coast is still operating and, despite changing hands, has maintained its original name of Franz Smallgoods.</para><para>Mr Born is survived by his wife Cobi and children Sonja, Brigitte, Martina and Frank. I think that the Senate should recognise the work of a great Australian, a person who did a tremendous amount of work in the north and north-west for his community and for the region generally. I extend, I am sure on behalf of all Queensland senators and, in fact, on behalf of senators generally, my condolences to his wife and family.</para><para>Madam President, in the couple of extra minutes of time left available to me, I would like to mention to senators a matter that I know will be of great importance to them—and I am sure they already know about it—and that is that 21 March of this year marked the 50th anniversary of Australia's research expeditions to Macquarie Island in the Great Southern Ocean.</para><para>Macquarie Island is a sub-Antarctic island located in the Southern Ocean at a latitude of 54 degrees 30 minutes south and 158 degrees 57 minutes east. It is 1,500 kilometres south-east of Tasmania and 1,300 kilometres north of the Antarctic continent. Macquarie Island is 34 kilometres long and five kilometres wide at its widest point. It has a total surface area of 128 square kilometres. It is part of the state of Tasmania and is a state reserve managed by the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service.</para><para>Discovery of the island is attributed to Captain Frederick Hasselborough who on the brig <inline font-style="italic">Perseverance</inline> sighted it whilst on a sealing voyage out of Sydney in July 1810. It was named after the then governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie. This discovery was to lead to extensive exploitation of the local fauna and by the end of that year bases had been established on the island to take fur seals for their skins and elephant seals for their oil. These commercial activities had a devastating effect on the seal and penguin populations, with some species still recovering.</para><para>During Sir Douglas Mawson's visit from 1911 to 1914, the first scientific station was established on the island and, in addition to conducting geomagnetic observations and mapping the island, studies were made of the island's botany, zoology, meteorology and geology. The Macquarie Island expedition also established the first radio link between Australia and Antarctica by setting up a radio relay station on Wireless Hill that could communicate with Mawson's main expedition group at Commonwealth Bay and also with the Australian mainland.</para><para>The island was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1933 and, with the establishment of the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1971, became a conservation area. It was upgraded to a state reserve in 1972 and in 1978 was renamed the Macquarie Island Nature Reserve. The Howard government nominated Macquarie Island for inscription on the World Heritage List in June 1996 and the nomination, which was made jointly with the Tasmanian government, was actually inscribed on the World Heritage List on 3 December 1997.</para><para>Macquarie Island is the oldest continuously occupied ANARE station below 50 degrees south.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Robert Ray interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—I know you are very interested in this, Senator Ray.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—I am; I am paying attention.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—We as Australians can be proud of the work that is

It was with some pride that,  on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian people—by telecommunications, because I was not there myself—I unveiled on 21 March 1998 a plaque commemorating the 50th anniversary of the station. I commend the great work that all the expeditioners who have worked for Australia over those years have done in that very remote place. It is one of the places that we are very proud of, and I am sure all senators join with me in congratulating all of those who have served on Macquarie Island over the past 50 years.</para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economics Legislation Committee</title><page.no>2131</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>2131</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This morning, there was a special hearing of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to consider whether or not a senior officer of the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Derren Gillespie, had deliberately misled the committee in August last year. Before asking the committee to consider the matter, I provided the relevant material to the Clerk of the Senate and received the following advice:</para></talk.start><para>. . . the extracts from the evidence which you quote appear to indicate that there is ground for concluding that at least contradictory evidence was given, and perhaps that misleading evidence was given at last year's hearing.</para><para>He advised that there were two options: the committee could seek by further inquiry to clarify the apparent contradiction in the evidence; or the matter could be raised as a matter of privilege.</para><para>I chose the first option as the most appropriate step. Unfortunately, this morning's proceedings have failed to clarify the situation. However, before deciding whether I wish to take this matter further, I will consider the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of this morning's hearing when it is available. The evidence in question was given by Mr Gillespie to the economics committee 
 on 18 August 1997. For the information of the Senate, I will go through the relevant sections of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. On page E82, Mr Gillespie said:</para><para>I think the plain fact of the matter is that within the portfolio of Transport and Regional Development there is a contract let to some work, the details of which I am certainly not alive to.</para><para>I note that Mr Gillespie uses the term `alive to' to mean `aware of', and we had established that in the hearings of the committee. To continue, in evidence given to the same committee earlier this year, we were told that Mr Gillespie attended a presentation to the department on the first ACIL report in 1996.</para><para>We now know that a presentation was given by an ACIL representative on 9 September 1996. Departmental officers present at the briefing were Dr David Rosalky, Rex Hoy and Derren Gillespie. Mr Gillespie now tells us that he thought the questions were about the terms of the contract not the work to be done. That is, he thought the questions were about the actual terms of the contract signed by the consultant, however we already knew that information. That is how we found out that ACIL was doing this work. The Department of Transport and Regional Development had provided that information in answer to a question on notice about consultancies it had let. In August last year, Mr Gillespie was asked:</para><para>To your knowledge does the ACIL plan fit within the terms of the Workplace Relations Act or does it contemplate action outside the legislative framework?</para><para>He replied:</para><para>I do not have any insights into any of the work that ACIL may have done under that contract.</para><para>Again, how does that fit with the fact that Mr Gillespie attended the presentation by ACIL on its work on 9 September 1996? How does that fit with Mr Gillespie actually reading the report in the offices of the department? The Department of Transport and Regional Development has now advised that on 23 December 1996, Mr Gillespie was permitted to access the report and a room in which he could peruse the document was provided. Officers did not permit him to copy the report or to remove it from the area.</para><para>Any reasonable interpretation of this evidence suggests that his claim to have no insight into the work that was done under the ACIL contract just cannot be accepted—not how much the contract was worth, not who did the work, but what the consultancy actually involved and how that fitted in with the work he was doing. I remind the Senate that Mr Gillespie received a full briefing by the ACIL consultant—I assume David Trebeck—on 9 September 1996.</para><para>Mr Gillespie also participated in a meeting called to discuss the government's waterfront strategy on 16 December 1996. That meeting was attended by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, and representatives from stevedore companies. I find it hard to believe that the details of the ACIL report were not discussed at that meeting.</para><para>Mr Gillespie read the ACIL report in the offices of the Department of Transport and Regional Development on 23 December 1996. He was given the report and a room in which to read it. Mr Gillespie advised that he thought the questions related to the second ACIL contract. That consultancy was not completed at the time that Mr Gillespie gave this evidence. I now go to the next reference in Mr Gillespie's evidence. In August last year, he told the committee:</para><para>I am not alive to any detail of any strategy that might be being developed.</para><para>We now know that, on 27 February 1997, the minister's office was provided with a copy of what Mr Gillespie described in a  minute sent to the minister on 10 March as `the waterfront paper prepared by officials'. Later in the minute he said:</para><para>As the strategy paper noted, a dispute—of itself—would not produce desired change on the waterfront.</para><para>He also stated:</para><para>Attachment C deals with the termination of the workforce; this paper is included in the strategy document prepared by officials.</para><para>Later he says:</para><para>. . . you might identify matters that might be further worked up such as detailed strategies for achieving significant workforce change; . . .  
</para><para>That minute to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, dated 10 March 1997, was signed by Mr Gillespie as `Assistant Secretary Industry Strategy Team'. In August last year, he told the committee that he had no knowledge of any strategy that was being developed, and yet six months earlier he had provided his minister with a strategy paper. Mr Gillespie called it a strategy paper in a minute to the minister which he signed off personally.</para><para>Mr Gillespie was the officer in the department who was actually developing the strategy. His explanation was that he thought the questions about a strategy related only to work under way under the ACIL 2 contract. Of course, the questions did not. ACIL 1 and ACIL 2—as they are now known—are two parts of a single consultancy. ACIL 1 was to provide advice regarding an industrial relations strategy for the implementation of waterfront reform commenced in May 1996 and finished in August of that year. ACIL 2 followed on from that consultancy. It commenced in June 1997 and finished in October.</para><para>Mr Gillespie's strategy paper must have been built around the first ACIL report. He had been briefed on the report, he had read the report and he had attended a meeting with ministers, consultants, advisers and stevedores to discuss the strategy. It would appear almost impossible to separate out the ACIL 2 consultancy in relation to questions about a strategy, but Mr Gillespie claims that that is exactly what he did.</para><para>There is one other matter I wish to address concerning the government's waterfront strategy. It was confirmed this morning that the Department of Transport and Regional Development participated in the development of the waterfront strategy paper provided to Mr Reith on 27 February 1997. The document was developed progressively by senior officers from both departments. I have been advised that Mr Gillespie amended that strategy paper agreed with the transport department officers—I assume Dr Feeney and Mr Bills, the two senior officers in the maritime transport area—and provided it to Mr Reith (again, I assume, as an agreed paper) 
 without further discussion with or reference to those transport officers.</para><para>I have also been advised that Mr Gillespie amended the strategy paper by deleting one of the strategy options and increasing the attractiveness of the confrontationist option; the option that encouraged the use of the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act and the Trade Practices Act to achieve the sacking of the MUA work force and the financial ruin of the MUA. I have been further advised that Mr Gillespie pushed this option in the course of his participation with Dr Webster, other consultants and political advisers in many meetings with stevedores and other employers.</para><para>It seems to me that Mr Gillespie has put himself in a difficult position. He has become an active player in what is basically a political campaign by the government against the MUA and the ACTU. It is therefore difficult for me as a politician to separate him from that political process. There are also a number of people who have a detailed understanding of this whole process from the letting of the first ACIL contract on. These people are apparently keen to see the truth come out. If more information about this exercise is provided, it will quickly be exposed. In my opinion, this issue still has a long way to go.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Senator Colston: Legal Proceedings</title><page.no>2133</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>2133</page.no><name role="metadata">Colston, Sen Malcolm</name><name role="display">Senator COLSTON</name><name.id>PF4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I wish to canvass matters related to possible illegal activity by Department of Senate officials, including the Clerk of the Senate and the Usher of the Black Rod.

This technique could have been used to justify fake travel allowance claims, but seeing it has some history, one cannot imagine it had been done for that purpose. The only purpose for which I could imagine it was done is for taxation purposes. In many cases, members of parliament travelling, but not on one of the requirements to attract travel allowance, may in fact put those claims in against their own taxation forms because it is expenditure on parliamentary business, presumably—in this case probably not—and can in fact be taken off the tax.</para><para>I am going to take the weak option; I am not going to name the two members of parliament concerned, but I do think their colleagues might have a yap about and might drop broad hints that this should be taken off the hard drive, as Senator Faulkner says, and that this particular practice should cease. What will happen in the end is that they will get caught and then all people here—and none of those in the chamber at the moment are involved in this—will get the backwash of this particular scam. It is also a gross misuse of the facilities provided to members of parliament to put them to this particular purpose.</para><para>My informant has been reliable on everything else so I would not think he is unreliable on this particular matter. The matter was a subject of a complaint to the officials of the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party. The person who took that complaint is now in a 
 new job courtesy of the patronage of the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party and, therefore, would probably no longer be willing to give evidence on this particular matter but certainly raised it with my informant in great detail amongst other complaints, others of which I do not regard as terribly relevant to our proceedings here tonight. It might be a good idea in their party room at some stage for one of the whips to mention this—not to make an accusation, but to remind people that this would not be an appropriate form of action and that they should desist in future.</para><para>They can remove it from the hard drive, but there will still be evidence that it was there. We have copies of the receipts of the documents generated through this particular methodology. Really it is beyond the pale. Certainly if the Australian Taxation Office catches up with any members of parliament putting in these sorts of false claims—I assume it is for tax purposes, but I cannot be absolutely certain—then basically they could be charged with forging and uttering and a total breach of the tax act with all its knock-on consequences.</para><para>I do hope that this practice discontinues in future, that the word gets around the building that computers in the electoral office are not meant for this particular ingenious use and that taxpayers as a whole are not defrauded by people using them in such a way.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Computer Fraud</title><title>Economics Legislation Committee</title><page.no>2135</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>2135</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Thank you Senator Robert Ray for ceding me some time to speak because I did not have my name down to speak on the adjournment.

It disturbs me that this chamber is used for this sort of general accusation rather than making specific accusations with some evidence.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Didn't you hear the same thing about Labor?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—I have heard lots of things about the Labor Party, but I would not raise them in the adjournment debate at 10.20 at night.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—You wouldn't have time!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>—I only have nine or 10 minutes. Senator Ray, thank you for allowing me to do this. I want to respond to a couple of the things that Senator O'Brien said. This has been, in Senator O'Brien's eyes, a long running saga and I would say that I would have to give him 10 out of 10 for persistence and nought out of 10 for substance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the estimates committee, we spent hours while Senator O'Brien trawled over this particular area of the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business when he asked questions of Mr Gillespie for a considerable period.</para><para>It does not matter what answers are actually given in estimates; you can, if you want to, put your own interpretation on those answers which may differ from the interpretation that is put on them by either members on this side or from the intent of the answers that were given by people from the department. Not only did Senator O'Brien have the chance to question the officer concerned at length in estimates; he was also given an additional chance today to re-question the officer whom 
 he requested be brought forward before a supplementary additional estimates hearing because he claimed in a letter to the clerk that he had been mislead. He said that there were only two options open to him: one to recall the estimates committee or to bring the matter to the Privileges Committee. I have seen the workload that Senator Ray has as Chairman of the Privileges Committee and I thought, in order to save him a little bit of time, that the best thing we could do is recall estimates first to give Senator O'Brien a chance to question this officer at length once more.</para><para>Having sat through that hearing this morning, I did remark to one of my colleagues that it was a bit like going to the dentist expecting to have a filling and finding they were still using the slow moving drill, because the same question was asked over and over again, the same answers were given over and over again. In fact, as far as I am concerned, Mr Gillespie gave his interpretation of what he intended his answers to be. This was not accepted by Senator O'Brien and so he, within his own rights, pursued the matter further.</para><para>Senator O'Brien used certain terms tonight such as `I find it hard to believe' when referring to certain meetings that took place. He might find it hard to believe but that does not necessarily mean that that the officer had not answered truthfully in estimates and had not given him all the information that he was required to do. He made comments in his speech such as `I assume Mr Feeney and Mr Bills. . . ', naming two people.</para><para>Then he accused Mr Gillespie of amending advice that was given to the government. Senator O'Brien, you were told in estimates this morning that when it comes to matters of departmental advice to ministers and to the government on strategy that advice is entitled to be treated as confidential. You were told that today. So you used words like `He amended the advice'. That is quite possible.</para><para>You then said things like, `I have been further advised.' I invited you at the meeting this morning to say where you had received your advice from, because it certainly did not come from the department. You might as well say, Senator O'Brien, `I have listened to 
 rumours'. If you are not prepared to name the advice, say, `I have listened to rumours'. And if you refuse to give any credible sources of your advice, then I think it can justifiably be said that you are putting your own interpretation on answers that were given by departmental officers—not on one occasion but on two and three occasions on which they truthfully answered the questions that were put to them as far as their department was concerned, and that was confirmed by the other officers in the department.</para><para>You have a right to interpret those answers in any way you see fit, but to suggest that there was a misleading of the Senate only shows that, with time and further experience on estimates committees, you will ask other questions which might be perhaps more probing in getting a detailed response. You will find that departmental officers are giving you the replies that they feel they can officially give, especially when you consider that their role is not only giving answers to you but one of responsibility to the government. You suggested that Mr Gillespie refused to answer certain questions, and he said, `I am not in a position to answer those questions, because they are advice to government.' Tonight is the third or fourth occasion you have repeated some of the transcript of the estimates. Anybody reading the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> would know that those same questions were asked at estimates and that they were raised even at the estimates in August last year.</para><para>You have suggested that there is a lot more to come yet, but as committee chairman I felt obliged to give you every opportunity to ask Mr Gillespie any further questions that you wanted to ask him on any matter. I think that is a process of the Senate that you are entitled to use. I was very happy that we re-called the estimates committee to give you a chance to do that, because I do not honestly believe that 
 every single case where a senator feels that he may have been misled in an answer should automatically go to Privileges Committee. I think it is important that you had the opportunity to once again question Mr Gillespie through the estimates procedure.</para><para>You had that opportunity. While you may feel from the answers that were given to you that the questions have not been fully answered, or you may feel that you were not told the full truth, that is only an interpretation on your part. I do not share that interpretation, having sat through hours of estimates committees earlier this year, for another hour this morning and through the August estimates last year. I would have thought that if you wanted to pursue this matter the best thing for you to do would be to wait until we have further estimates committees. The decision is entirely up to you, but I would have thought that you have had a greater opportunity than usual as an individual senator to pursue this matter. I can only repeat what I said before: if you did not get the answers you wanted, that is not the fault of the officer, nor is it the fault of the department; it is possibly the fault of your own perception of what you had hoped to receive in the way of answers that did not come.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>22:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>2137</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.28 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>2137</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2137</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</inline> —RHQ Company Determinations Nos 1-4 of 1998.</para><para>Public Service Act—</para><para>	 Locally Engaged Staff Determinations 1998/12 and 1998/13.</para><para>	 Public Service Determinations 1998/7-1998/9.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>2138</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment</title><page.no>2138</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1078)</subtitle><id.no>1078</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2138</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 5 March 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Will a representative from Environment Australia be attending the Intercessional Meeting of the Technical Consultation on Monitoring Control and Surveillance Issues, in Suva, from 10-13 March 1998, as part of the development of a regional agreement for highly migratory fish stocks of the central and western Pacific; if not, why not.</para><para>(2) Will a representative from Environment Australia attend all subsequent technical and negotiating sessions, as a member of an official delegation, until the agreement has been finalised; if not, why not.</para><para>(3) Can an outline be provided of the efforts which will be made to ensure that the agreement fully recognises the need for ecologically sustainable fisheries management that takes into account the issue of ecologically related species (by catch) within the region in question.</para><para>(4) What efforts will be made to provide technical and financial help to small South Pacific states to effectively implement this Convention within the region once the agreement has been finalised.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2138</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) A representative from Environment Australia did not attend the Intercessional Meeting of the Technical Consultation on Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Issues, held in Suva, from 10-13 March 1998.</para><para>Fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance are standard fisheries management activities and are matters within the responsibilities of my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator the Honourable Warwick Parer.
