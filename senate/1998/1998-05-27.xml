I am advised that remittances made by cash or cheques increase ATO handling costs. Cheques, in particular, have a minimum clearing time affecting delays in collection. In recent years the commercial trend has shifted significantly towards conducting business by electronic means. In fact, financial institutions are actively encouraging the use of EFT because of the benefits it provides: better security, reduced paper flows, certainty of delivery, improved cash management, and reduced processing and reconciliation costs compared to cheques. It has been estimated that 95 per cent of large remitters are already connected to or have access to EFT.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>—Sorry, was that 95?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name></talker><para>—Ninety-five per cent of large remitters are already connected to or have access to EFT.

In most cases, it is merely a matter of extending the use of the EFT package to handle payments to the ATO. It is not envisaged that this new arrangement will place any unrealistic burden on this group of taxpayers as the approximate cost of the necessary software is between $75 and $400.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>3149</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer. I think the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer has read from advice that puts the finger on exactly what I was saying yesterday, that it is 95 per cent of large remitters, so five per cent do not. But there is no indication that there was actually a problem. The only indication of a problem in the advice that has 
 just been read out was that that was what financial institutions would prefer. That is what they are pushing everybody to do. Here we have, in my opinion, legislation being used as a kind of corporate fascism.</para></talk.start><para>The corporations would like to reduce their profits, so it is not actually to do with choice but rather it is about the fact that the banking corporations do not want to process other people's cheques. They are starting with some bits of legislation, obviously chewing the ear of the government successfully and saying, `We would like you to legislate to reduce our costs by taking away choice.' In this particular case it is choice that affects companies.</para><para>We have examples of the choices to occur in relation to analogue and digital televisions, and analogue and digital telecommunications, but I believe we are going to see a raft of legislation to take away the choice of businesses and to take away the choice of consumers, penalising people not because it is late but because they have paid by cheque, even if they are on time or early, to reduce the costs of corporations. In the end, I believe that leaves less choice for the rest of us because we will get legislation saying, `To go in line with the rest of corporate practice, we are going to legislate that everybody has to do their banking and everybody has to make their payments at some stage by electronic transfer on the basis that we assume that, eventually, everybody will have access to the Internet.' I am not using the slippery-slope thing as my major argument; what I am suggesting is that you have not given any argument, other than that the banks and the financial institutions want it, to suggest why we are actually imposing penalties on companies for not paying in the manner that banks want them to pay.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>3150</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to say that I think that you have completely missed the point here. You said, `I'm not using the slippery slope argument,' but the reality is that I think the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  will show that some 60 per cent of your comments related to the so-called slippery slope argument. The truth of the matter is that, where governments want to bring in changes, these bills will have to 
 come through the Senate, and everyone will have a chance to comment.</para></talk.start><para>The next point I would make is that these are very large remitters. This is not an individual. Under the new withholding arrangements, large remitters are those with deductions exceeding $1 million. These are the larger remitters. This is not Joe Blow in the street. As my colleague, Senator Minchin, pointed out when I was delayed outside the chamber, some 95 per cent of large remitters are already connected or have access to the EFT, and there are 5,500 of them. So the first point is that we are not talking about the small shopkeeper; we are talking about the large remitters, of which there are 5,500. There is no merit in the slippery slope argument because the truth of the matter is that, in each case where we wish to impose particular rules, the bills will have to come through the Senate, and the Senate would presumably have a view on it.</para><para>The final 40 per cent of your argument is that this is being driven by the banks. It is not being driven by the banks. We believe this is the most efficient way to do it. It is more efficient from the Tax Office's point of view and, frankly, we believe it is more efficient from the corporations' point of view. But it is not being driven by the banks—it is being driven by us. It is better for the Tax Office and better for efficiency to do it this way, and 95 per cent of the people believe it. So you are wrong on the slipper slope, wrong that it may attack small individuals, and wrong that it was driven by the banks. It is driven by us.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>3150</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would suggest that the minister look at the actual notes. Basically, the only positive reason that was given was that the financial institutions would prefer it. I was simply echoing the very statements that were made. I wrote down the words that were mentioned by the minister. I did not say that I was not using the slippery slope argument; I said I was not using it as the mainstay of my speech. However, I can give you any number of examples—for example, tax file numbers. What did we hear the first time that tax file numbers were proposed? We were told, `Oh, it's only about this. It's only for 
 ease.' Eventually, tax file numbers will be used for just about every element that is involved with people's personal, financial and other information.</para></talk.start><para>The reality is that, with this so-called easy way of slipping information—whether it is financial information; whatever the real security issues are, whatever the choices are, for whatever reason—those five per cent of large remitters have chosen to continue their bank remission. They are choosing that themselves. What you are saying is, `You may not choose it any longer and, what's more, if you do choose it, we are going to slap a fine on you. We are going to say you are breaking the law.'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>3151</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last night, when this debate was drawing to the witching hour, there was some ambiguity in the position of the opposition in the sense that I said I was disposed. Let me clarify the ambiguity: I support the proposal of the government and I do not support the proposal of the Greens. I have great admiration for the tenacity and fighting spirit of Senator Margetts. It is on display again this morning, and one should admire and respect that. However, from the opposition's point of view, large remitters are not downtrodden people and are, by definition, large organisations remitting big licks of money to the Australian tax system.</para></talk.start><para>The time value of that money that is remitted is important and cannot be swept aside in this argument. If it comes by way of cheque, the Tax Office does not actually receive the money until it is cleared, which may be several days or a week or more after the cheque has been signed. That might seem to be a small point. Given the volume and amount of money concerned, it is actually quite an important point. To transfer these funds in an efficient way is what the amendment is about.</para><para>I do not think that anyone will argue that large remitters lack the capacity to do this. In fact, the government has just announced that 98 per cent of them do have the capacity to do this, and I do not think we are imposing an unfair imposition on the other two per cent 
 by doing it this way. In any case, it is with the approval of the Tax Commissioner. Therefore, one imagines an interactive process between the larger remitter and the Tax Commissioner so that the efficiency elements are best dealt with having in mind the capability of the company concerned. But on what side of the argument do you fall—for it or agin it? We fall on the side for the government's position because we do not see the particular imposition. We do think the time value of money is important. This guarantees that that issue is best addressed here.</para><para>We are moving forward, too, in terms of electronic commerce. This is an element of electronic commerce that is being implemented through the tax system. If anything, one praises the tax system for being aware of modern technological and business practice and in moving with the times in this amendment, not against it. We therefore support it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>3151</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can read the numbers quite clearly. That was one of the reasons for continuing to clarify the reason this morning; giving the ALP time to make that clarification. I thank Senator Cook for making that clarification, even if I am rather concerned about the outcomes. I want to ask one final question. I know Senator Kemp has been involved with the discussions in relation to the multilateral agreement on investment. Because it is to the corporate benefit in terms of banking, if there is overseas investment in the banking corporations, I wonder whether by making this choice it is now illegal to pay by cheque. If there is any problem with this particular change in legislation, under the multilateral agreement on investment we would never be able to change our mind because it would be imposing an extra cost on the large corporations as opposed to some of those other remitters who may not necessarily be international corporations.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>3151</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to say that this debate is ranging very far and wide.

A lot of the arguments were canvassed in the earlier debate. The penalty of $500 is set at a level above the cost of acquiring an EFT facility.

 designed to influence a large remitter—again, we are talking about very large remitters, those of $1 million and over—into acquiring the necessary EFT facilities.

We had discussions with the government, which we appreciated. As a result of those discussions, we decided that our intention was probably not appropriate.</para><para>We still believe that this is an area where there are problems. We are aware that tax acts come before us regularly. We give notice to the Senate that we will still consider measures in this area which we hope to be able to 
 discuss with the other parties of the Senate. We would make sure that those principles we are pursuing would not allow the rorts that the government has rightly sought to stop with this legislation, an action we support it in. The amendments we would seek would not unduly penalise and discourage more flexible employee share ownership arrangements. So we will be looking at that further, but we thank the government for its advice and assistance in the matter.</para><para>If I can now turn to the savings rebate amendments we are putting, I would remind you that in our remarks during the second reading debate we indicated our support for measures to increase Australian private savings. That is almost a motherhood statement; I cannot imagine any politician or political party or organisation which would not say such a thing. But the objectives of savings are obviously to reduce overseas borrowing requirements, increase the financing of Australian business and infrastructure development and, indeed, improve our entire national economic health.</para><para>We must, however, now move to criticism. We, and I think other parties in the Senate, believe that the savings rebate intended by the government will not achieve the aim of increasing savings. Treasury considers that the rebate would actually reduce net national savings, because high income earners will be rewarded for doing what they are already doing and low income earners will generally be unable to save money anyway.</para><para>Savings initiatives we think should be directed towards increasing medium-term and long-term savings. With this in mind, ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Service, did suggest four principles for making the rebate more effective and equitable. I will repeat these to the Senate because we thought they were particularly helpful.</para><para>ACOSS thought the rebate should be restricted to long-term financial savings, such as through superannuation and financial institution accounts that are maintained for at least five years. ACOSS thought that the rebate should be linked to contributions and deposits rather than interest so as to make savings of smaller amounts worthwhile. It 
 thought that the rebate should be added to the account rather than paid to the taxpayer directly. They thought that the rebate should extend to compulsory superannuation so that low and middle income wage earners can significantly benefit or, at the very least, be restricted to long-term financial savings, other than superannuation, and be strictly income tested.</para><para>We take the view that those principles should be borne in mind by the two major parties competing for who will be in government next time and, hopefully, they will have regard to them when they review the very important issue of trying to improve our Australian savings.</para><para>The tax rebate we are considering is a very expensive measure. The 1997 budget projected losses in revenue of $350 million, $1.4 billion and a massive $2 billion over the next three financial years, which is a great deal of money. We thought, frankly, that the government should have conceded that they got this policy wrong, but they have not. Therefore, we believe that the rebates must be means tested and that is what this amendment is about.</para><para>The Australian Democrats said before the 1996 election that a savings rebate should be targeted towards longer term savings and be means tested. The coalition's 1996 pre-election commitment means tested the savings initiative, phasing out between net taxable incomes of $35,000 and $39,000.</para><para>Our amendment, in fact, presents the coalition's pre-1996 policy of means testing and, in so doing, it would head off a tax windfall for those on higher incomes—who are going to be doing what they are doing anyway—and would save $1 billion a year which hopefully the government might like to put into education, health, legal aid, rail infrastructure or industry policy. I am sure senators could all give a long list of matters in that regard.</para><para>We are also attempting to introduce what we thought was Labor Party policy. Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 14 May 1997 in a question to the Prime Minister said:</para><para>Since the Prime Minister has said that he will not accept the $450 savings rebate, will he then join me in supporting an amendment that I will move to his legislation to ensure that all people at our level are income tested out of this?</para><para>In other words, this is means testing. On 17 May 1997, Ian Davis of the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>  reported:</para><para>Mr Beazley repeated his warning that the opposition would attempt to amend the government's savings rebate announced in the budget so as to means test it, while Mr Howard continued to defend the government's failure to test it.</para><para>However, we were a bit dismayed—and quite often it seems there is conflict—to discover that the shadow Treasurer said on 1 April 1998 in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> :</para><para>. . . Labor's general position that governments are entitled to their major budget measures, however wrong-headed those measures might be. Accordingly I do indicate now that the opposition does not propose to oppose this measure. We think it is very bad policy. We think it is a disgrace, certainly, compared with the company-contribution regime that it replaced.</para><para>So, Labor continued to have the view that it is a terrible thing, but the shadow Treasurer seemed to be saying he would not do anything about it. I would have thought from the minister's perspective that he would prefer a consistent approach from the opposition, even where he did not agree with it. Certainly, we would prefer that.</para><para>I make a plea to the Senate to support this amendment. We think it implements the policy of the coalition, which we thought was a good policy; we think it implements the intention of Leader of the Opposition, with which we agree; and most importantly of all, it will save about $1 billion, which could be far better used than giving it to the wealthy and better off in our society.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>3155</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens (WA) will be supporting Democrat amendments nos. 1 and 2 on sheet 973.

I know it is odd and strange that the government has not given prominence to its own budgetary centrepiece from that budget—not of this year, but of last year—by not bringing this legislation into this chamber earlier and fiddling around with it, but it is nonetheless a budget measure and we do not wish to play an obstructionist role in opposing central measures from a budget such as this.</para><para>However, it is an uneasy decision for us to make because there are two competing principles. They are principles that were enunciated by the Democrats in explaining their legislation, and supported by the Greens (WA), and the principle about budget measures. We opt to take the principle of budget measures as a superior reason in this circumstances. That is not to say that we out of sympathy at all with what the Democrats have put and, indeed, the arguments that they have made for the very good reason that the arguments they have made are sound.</para><para>While a centrepiece of 1997-98 budget, this is nonetheless a measure which has received considerable justifiable criticism by economic commentators and political parties, not the least of which is the Australian Labor Party, as an ill-targeted and unfair measure and one that will not do anything—or, if it does, very little indeed—to improve the level of national savings in Australia.</para><para>The budget that has just been brought down this month by the government deals with national savings and in the debate about national savings the government trumpets all of the time the measures it believes it has taken to bring public savings into credit. It has done that, and one acknowledges that.</para><para>In making that acknowledgment, I do not for one whit acknowledge the very specious 
 arguments that the government puts about the budgetary position created under Labor. That is the most specious, big lie approach to political posturing that I have encountered in recent years, and I do not accept that. But, having drawn a line around that qualification, nonetheless the budget is back in surplus and public savings are therefore returned to surplus.</para><para>If you look at the budget papers you will see that aggregate national savings are falling, and that is a serious economic problem for Australia. Private citizens in this country do not save and their propensity to save is declining, which means that we do not generate the level of national savings necessary to make Australian owned investments in our development as a country. We borrow from abroad, from foreigners, to help develop our nation. We invite foreign investment to make up the shortfall that we ourselves are unable to meet because we do not generate a sufficient level of national savings.</para><para>This measure was trumpeted as a means of lifting national savings. The problem with it is that no-one believes it will. Even those generous economic commentators who speak on this point—generous to the government's point of view—say that, if it does lift savings, it will be only very little.</para><para>The costs, which have been pointed out to the chamber by the Democrats, are set out in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill explanatory memorandum. As to the financial impact, the measure will cost revenue $350 million in the financial year 1998-99, $1.37 billion in the financial year 1999-2000 and over $2 billion in the financial year 2000-01. So at the cost of $350 million, $1.3 billion—nearly $1.4 billion—and $2 billion to the taxpayer the government under this measure will be trying to provide an incentive for people to save money by giving them a tax rebate, in effect. The conditions for that tax rebate are such that really only the wealthy will qualify. So I have considerable sympathy for and have argued the equity point of view myself strongly. That is the overriding position of the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>It has to be said that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself has recognised the 
 unfairness of this measure by admitting on the day after the 1997-98 budget that he would not be claiming the rebate. We were a bit surprised and taken aback when he said that. He was made to look a bit of a goose when the Australian Taxation Office advised that such a change to the legislation to allow the Prime Minister to opt out of claiming the rebate would cost about $1 million, and that he could not opt out. So even the government is uncomfortable with this measure.</para><para>The most telling and damning part of the equity argument is that high wealth individuals will be the beneficiaries. People like Senator Parer, who has profited from tax minimisation, will be the beneficiaries. This is a spectacle of a government making the rich wealthier at the cost of ordinary taxpayers. That is, in summary, what the equity argument is about. I wish I could vote for this amendment. It is a central budgetary measure. On that basis, we recognise that the government has some rights in this field and that its basic budgetary measures should be supported. So we will vote for the amending bill and not for the Democrats' amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>3156</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I must say, I am a little surprised.

I recall the debate after the 1996 budget.</para></talk.start><para>I supported you when you voted against the R&amp;D tax concession, the superannuation high income earners surcharge and changes to HECS, all of which were major budget items. I would think that the Treasurer (Mr Reith) is absolutely joyful listening to you over there because I think you have just given him the GST. Surely if the GST comes through as a budget measure you will then be obliged on your principle to support it. I am starting to get into an intellectual and political morass here which I cannot find my way out of. I would have thought it was the job of an 
 opposition to oppose bad policy and to support good policy.</para><para>If I can offer you a lifeline, Senator Cook, one of the things which perhaps you as the Deputy Opposition Leader could do would be to assure the Senate and the people of Australia that if you return to government you will introduce means testing of this measure and change the law as soon as you can to restore equity—and not give away a billion dollars in what may be loosely described as a rort for the wealthy and better off, who do not really need it and who do not deserve it in this instance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>3157</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Perhaps while Senator Cook is thinking of his well rounded response, which will set us in train for knowing what the opposition is likely to do in the future, let alone now, I would like to give a broad picture of what we are dealing with when we are looking for extra national savings. Keep in mind that we have a large number of unemployed people. The government is not making it any easier for unemployed people. The indications are that the government wants to remove the disincentive to be employed. So basically it is going to be tighter and tighter for the unemployed, especially when we have a higher percentage of working poor.</para></talk.start><para>Obviously, the classic economic theory is that if we want to look throughout society to see what is available for national savings, we need to have an idea what people are earning, how many people are earning what, and what their costs of living are compared with what they are earning—and see whether they have the capacity to save. We have just had the debate on the social security youth allowance and the government and the opposition got together and said that people on social security measures who are on student assistance cannot actually save $3,000 at the beginning of their year in order to be able to survive the year. We are talking about a wide range of people who are not able to—in fact are legislated against—actually have any savings. It is an irony, isn't it, to be legislated against having any savings backup even to the point of $3,000 at the beginning of the university year. </para><para>In that particular instance, you can see a pattern; a higher and higher percentage of people in Australian society in dissavings, in debt: bankcard debt, debt to their parents, debt to their friends. What are the options when the debt lines close up if impositions occur and people are in desperate straits? There is the old adage, if you have to eat, if you have to pay the rent and so on, you have three options: beg, borrow or steal. Then we are going to have a law and order election, of course.</para><para>The issues are about how Australians are saving and what proportion of Australians are saving what. When we have a situation where more and more Australians are either on the margin or in dissavings—that is, they are in debt—we are going to see, with that blind or very tunnel vision, more and more goodies, benefits or kickbacks being given to the rich in our society to get more of their money into savings. I do not know whether that is internationally competitive savings, I would have thought that is internationally uncompetitive savings.</para><para>The reason we have got to this position is we have concentrated so much on being internationally competitive and have forgotten about what is happening with the rest of our economy, with the rest of our society. The ability of people to purchase goods and services from local markets has been forgotten altogether. We have concentrated so much on being internationally competitive but it is only the rich that are getting rich enough to be able to put any substantial amount of money into savings. I think we have got to address that instead of continuing down this path of continually throwing the rest of taxpayers' money at the very richest in Australia to try to get them to save their money.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>3157</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been asked to explain the Labor Party's position on two things, given my earlier remarks. The first is the GST and the second is what we will do—should the election that everyone is speculating now will be in August result in a Labor victory and we are in government—about 
 amending this measure to provide greater equity. Let me answer both those questions.</para></talk.start><para>The issue of the GST has been raised by the Australian Democrats because, on the amendment now put by them to the savings rebate, we are saying that was a centrepiece of the budget by the present government in 1997-98 and, as a centrepiece of a budget measure, we are not going to oppose it. The GST, however, is in a different category: it is quite distinct, it is clear and reasonable that it is a different category.</para><para>This government is fond of saying the Australian tax system is broken down and needs wholesale review. We say the Australian tax system from time to time needs routine maintenance to keep itself focused on the principal issues of simplicity, equity and transparency and, because there is a major industry out there about tax avoidance, which constantly tries to find loopholes through any system, a prudent government maintains scrutiny to find where those loopholes have been opened up and close them down as quickly as possible.</para><para>We do not think the wholesale change to the taxation system is necessary. We do think maintenance is necessary and, at some points of the system, renovation of the system is necessary. Kim Beazley said on the weekend in broad outline that the structure of what we are looking at is a form of negative income tax to overcome positions in which people are caught in poverty traps—if they earn more money they lose a level of entitlements and, therefore, there is an in-built disincentive in the system to actually find work for a category of Australians. That is something that ought to be changed.</para><para>We have a very firm position on this tax debate. The government, however—and it is a matter now of notorious record—has got a secret tax committee in the Department of the Treasury which keeps no minutes, publishes no reports, makes no explanation to this parliament through the normal forms of estimates and is operating in secret. The chairman of it said to an estimates committee that there are no records, he keeps them all in his head. We asked the reasonable question, `In a complex issue like tax, how do you 
 know what all of those issues are?' and so forth. He is confident of his memory, he said. This is cloak and dagger stuff. This is something that Australian taxpayers are paying for but they are not told about and it is operating on the instruction that the only option it can look at is a GST option. It is the only one. It cannot look at a non-GST tax structure; it can look only at GST options.</para><para>In 1985 when we were in government we undertook reform of the taxation system. We published a major report which we put out there for public debate. It had a number of options in it. The debate raged far and wide in this nation evaluating the options and it culminated in the national tax summit in which all of the interest groups in Australia came forward, put a viewpoint and, on the basis of that viewpoint, we exercised tax reform. That is what we think is the appropriate course for a government to take on an issue as fundamental to Australia's well-being as taxation.</para><para>Contrast that with this secretive manoeuvre by the government in which nothing is in the public domain for scrutiny or evaluation. The inspired reports are now saying that the Treasurer may bring down his tax package around 28 June. The newsletter <inline font-style="italic">Inside Canberra</inline> reports that major accounting houses have been cued by the government to be ready for a tax lockup—that is, to have confidential access to the tax papers in advance of a government announcement on or around 28 June this year.</para><para>Everyone says that there is very likely to be an election in August. What we are looking at is an ambush of Australia by the government with a complex series of tax changes. It will tell everyone it is for their benefit but not give them the chance to read the fine print and come to an understanding about what the options are for them. It will present a singular option—the GST option, in whatever form—which is not an option at all. It will not canvass any other alternatives, so people will not be able to compare that option with a non-GST tax structure or some other version of the tax structure. It will be a singular option. We do not think that is democratic government; that is electoral ambush. We do 
 not think this is giving the taxpayer of Australia a fair shake or a chance to understand what is being proposed.</para><para>This will be sold with all the glitter and PR publicity that the government can muster. The reports today are that the government has put out a contract for public relations companies to bid for to market its tax package. This is going to be bells, whistles and Hollywood glitter to get into your minds a few headline points without knowing what the fine print is about. Our position is that if we are not successful at the election we will oppose a GST in the Senate, and I said that in this place on the Thursday after the budget came down, in response to the budget. That is bottom-line clear. There is no doubt where the Labor Party stands. That is where we stand.</para><para>If the government is not prepared to take the Australian people into its confidence, give them a chance to look at the details of the fine print and understand what it means to them and then run an election; and if we are not successful in the election, we will oppose a GST in the Senate. I think the better option is that we win the election so that it does not arise in the first place. That is far and away the better option.</para><para>To those pundits who have said that this is a defeatist approach by the Australian Labor Party, I say this: when we said earlier that we would support it because the government would have a mandate, we assumed the government would do the right thing and disclose what its intentions were. That was not defeatist. When we say we oppose it, that becomes defeatist. The only constant thing is that we are defeated in both propositions. Of course the intention of the Labor Party is win the next election, and I think we have a very good chance of doing that.</para><para>So, to the first question put to me in this debate—where do we stand on the GST?—that is where we stand and that is why we stand there. There has to be a process of scrutiny, democratic evaluation and real choice by electors, not tax change by ambush and, I might say, change which will introduce a regressive tax—a tax that imposes on the rich and the poor the same charge.</para><para>The second question put to me is: what will we do about this particular item of legislation, and will we amend it to introduce greater equity? That question invites me to say what our policy will be in the whole area of taxation. I know it is not put as some subtle way of creeping into the Labor Party policy machine and invoking an answer about an important detail of policy ahead of time. I know it is put in the context of, `You have said this today. What will you do when you come to government?' That is an honest question.</para><para>I have to say that we will announce our policies in detail at the opportune time. We have started to unveil some of those tax policies now, and I refer to what the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, Kim Beazley, said on the weekend about a negative income tax. It is no disrespect to the Australian Democrats that I will not answer that question in technicolour cinemascope on the wide screen right now. But what I will say is that we think this measure is inequitable. It will cost taxpayers in the year 2000 over $2 billion and it will benefit the wealthy, not the poor. We do not think that is equity and whether we amend this law or repeal it in its entirety is a matter for our policy.</para><para>I cannot go into exactly what we will do, but I cannot emphasise strongly enough that we consider that this does not, firstly, do what it says it will do and improve national savings overall for the nation. We are bolstered in that point of view because it is one that economic commentators, independent of our party, also hold with considerable unanimity across the board. It is not us making a political point; it is objectively true. This scheme will not significantly, if at all, increase national savings. Secondly, there is a consensus of view that it does benefit the wealthy at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer. Those two policy principles are foremost in our mind, but I cannot go into the detail of what we will do. I trust that is an explanation in the circumstances that is understood and appreciated by the Australian Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>3159</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just wish to briefly

These are the estimates that we have received, and others may not accept them, but no alternatives have been put out to show where we are wrong. As I said, this is a fair and equitable measure and it provides an incentive to save. I think it will inevitably have the effect of encouraging private saving and that is what the government has stated.

We have had a reasonable opportunity through the Senate legislative committee process to hear the evidence from the government to justify why this agency should be privatised. In the time given there was a lot of evidence received. Some of it, you might say, was from the usual suspects in favour of privatisation, as you would expect, while others expressed concern about it. The main concern that a lot of people raised was the lack of information provided by the government as to why the agency should be privatised and what the advantage was to the national interest in its privatisation.</para></talk.start><para>The government itself could not answer those concerns other than, in our view, by stating an ideological position that it was a good idea to privatise for the sake of privatising. The government mentioned that when the agency was sold, the money would go to pay off public debt. When we asked for any idea of what the agency would bring when it was privatised, the government's Office of Asset Sales said, `Those are estimates we do not want to divulge because it could effect the price we receive.' But, even when asked for a broad range of figures, they still would not give them to us. We even offered to have in camera briefings of the committee to find out that information. Again, that was not forthcoming.</para><para>Other people have speculated that the agency may bring $200 million, $180 million or $250 million. That is not a large amount of money, and its contribution to paying off public debt will be minuscule indeed. The savings on the interest at the present bond rate of about six per cent would be only a few million dollars at the very most. Compare that 
 to maintaining in public ownership what is a national asset. The community, through various governments of the day, including previous coalition governments and Labor governments, has invested many hundreds of millions of dollars to build a national network right across Australia with something like 1,500 transmitters and translators available for our national broadcasters—the ABC and the SBS—and, where appropriate, for commercial broadcasting services and community broadcasting services.</para><para>This is a national infrastructure. The government should be assisting in the provision of services to all the community on an equitable basis. A commercial sector would never have built a national transmission agency with a national infrastructure, providing a service to all Australians wherever they live. You would have got them building transmitters in each of the capital cities, but you would not have got them building transmitters and translators out in the rural and regional areas of Australia. Both governments—Labor and Liberal—have, in the past, made that contribution.</para><para>Yet, for some reason, out of the blue, this government, without justification, has decided to privatise. There is no demand in the community that this agency should be sold off. It is not being sold off because it was not performing or there was a deficiency in its performance, or because the Australian public said, `The National Transmission Agency is useless; let's get rid of it.' No arguments like that came from anywhere. One might say, `Well, a lot of people in Australia may not be aware that there even is a National Transmission Agency in existence.' I think many people probably believe that the transmitters and translators that the ABC and SBS use are actually owned by the ABC and SBS and do not understand that there is a separate, dedicated, corporatised agency providing that service.</para><para>But, nevertheless, even if they did believe that the ABC and SBS owned the transmitters and they were not performing properly, there would still be issues raised at the political level, at the parliamentary level, that this service was not up to scratch and ought to be 
 changed—that something should be done about it. There was no justification given in the hearings by the government that the National Transmission Agency was inefficient and not performing. In fact, the evidence was to the contrary. Even Mr Hutchinson from the Office of Asset Sales agreed—and the government, DoCA and the finance department agreed—that there had been a substantial improvement in efficiency in the National Transmission Agency since the early 1990s, since it was given a new structure and administrative arrangements under legislation introduced by the previous Labor government. 	Those estimates are in the report. It is not disputed that there was a 40 per cent improvement in the efficiency and the productivity of this agency in public ownership.</para><para>If any organisation, public or private, had a 40 per cent improvement in half a decade in the delivery of service, you would give it a big tick. But why would you want to sell it? The only reason is that this government sees it as an ideological position that they want to support. I think it is also part of their view that selling the National Transmission Agency also justifies the ideological position that they took over the major privatisation issue of Telstra.</para><para>It is no surprise that the Labor members of the committee—Senator Lundy and I—have put in a minority report which opposes privatisation. I also note that the minority report of Senator Lyn Allison of the Democrats is along similar lines to the Labor Party's submission in that it opposes the privatisation. Again, we and the Democrats have a similar view.</para><para>I want deal with three or four of the major issues from our minority report that did come forward in the hearing, even though the hearing was short. Quite rightly, we did not object to this matter going to a legislative committee. First of all, I want to deal with the community service obligation. It is clear from this legislation that it is a big ask for the Australian people to believe that the community service obligations in this proposal are going to be substantive enough to guarantee that in the future the National Transmission Agency, or whoever buys it, will provide 
 services, particularly to non-metropolitan Australia. Service may be provided for five years while the ABC and SBS have to continue to use the privatised National Transmission Agency. But after that five years is up, it is really buying a very big pig in the poke in terms of what is going to happen to the provision of these services in regional Australia.</para><para>What has been occurring in the administration of the National Transmission Agency is a natural and proper cross-subsidisation. The administration costs of the provision of services to the regional areas of Australia has in effect been subsidised by having a national agency. There is no doubt that a private operator will start getting into full cost recovery, and that means that in the bush, after the five years are up, operators, whether it is the ABC or the SBS, will start being charged differently. The ABC and the SBS could then say, `Well, we are off. We are not going to have a contract with you mob. We will go and maybe provide our own transmitter or do a deal with somebody else.' What that then means is that a national infrastructure is shredded or broken up into different parts, which means a different level of service to different parts of Australia. That is the logical conclusion of selling the National Transmission Agency.</para><para>We do not believe the legislation in any way guarantees appropriate community service obligations. We do not believe that there is a mechanism in this legislation to ensure that the higher cost of providing a transmission facility in the rural and regional areas of Australia is adequately dealt with. The minister will get up and proclaim that it is and will say, `Trust us. It will be okay in the future.' People in regional Australia no longer take those promises about the provision of services—the promise of `Trust us. The service will stay the same'—from any government. They have seen too many examples, both in the public and the private sector, that services to regional and rural Australia are the first to suffer when you put in full cost recovery.</para><para>I also want to point out some other issues of national interest. In our report we comment 
 on the submission from the Friends of the ABC. I know this government thinks that the Friends of the ABC is a bunch of left-wing radicals whose aim is to carry out a political campaign against this government. The Friends of the ABC is actually one of the most moderate organisations of people I have met. They are overwhelmingly Liberal voters. When you meet the Friends of the ABC you are not meeting a left-wing branch of the Labor Party; you are meeting upper middle-class, middle-aged woman and men—overwhelmingly women—who are concerned about maintaining the ABC. The Friends of the ABC are not what this government might choose to call left-wing suspects, et cetera. They are overwhelmingly supporters of the coalition and have been historically for a long time.</para><para>They raised their concern on the national interest that in the long run these facilities may well be fully controlled by some foreign interest. Having your national transmission facilities run by somebody from another country is an issue. You do not want to be xenophobic about it, but it is an issue that in the national interest this ought to be controlled by Australians, because it is a national structure of communication across the nation. It is the fabric which keeps the nation together. Providing this communication, we can ensure that a government announcement in a time of emergency is distributed right across Australia. Again, the government might say, `Under the Defence Act we can in times of emergency call on those powers to get our message across,' and so on. But I think this goes wider on a day-to-day basis. This is an instrumentality which does provide, under Australian ownership, an infrastructure that is important to all Australians.</para><para>I now come to an area where I think the government is really asking us to buy the very biggest pig in a poke. It is the so-called compact between the government and the ABC and SBS regarding future funding for transmission. When this bill was being discussed before the committee, we asked the government, `Have you reached agreement with the ABC and SBS on how much money you will provide to them over the next five 
 years to pay for the transmission costs when you are forcing the ABC and SBS to buy those services from a privatised national transmission agency?' The government could not give us any information that an agreement had been reached. When we asked the ABC and SBS, when they turned up, still all we could get was, `Well, discussions are proceeding.' If the government cannot, here in the second reading debate or in the committee stage, outline to the Senate what is the actual financial commitment that the government has given for the next five years to the ABC and SBS to cover the costs of transmission, it really will be an awful outcome. Once the agency is sold and the ABC and SBS have not got a contractual arrangement locked away that the money will be made available, the government can do what it likes to the ABC and SBS and can cut the transmission funding.</para><para>Normally you might not be too worried that a government in good faith and goodwill will reach an agreement, but you would not trust the this government as far as you could throw it in its dealings with the ABC. This very morning the minister for communications, Senator Alston, is not here debating this bill. Guess where he is? He has gone up to the ABC board meeting in Sydney to beat them around the head over allegations of bias against the coalition and to demand changes within the ABC on programming to overcome the minister's so-called concern on bias. The minister is there abusing the ABC this morning, not down here explaining to us how much money has been committed by the government to the ABC and SBS to pay for the transmission costs.</para><para>At the very least, the government should have the ethics and the morality to come in here and say, `Yes, we have reached agreement with the ABC and SBS. We are going to provide them with $120 million per annum for X number of years,' or whatever the figure is; and the same for the SBS. It has now been several months since this bill was before the committee. As far as I am aware—I stand to be corrected—no agreement has been reached. I trust Senator Brownhill, the parliamentary secretary at the table, and I ask 
 his advisers from the department, `Have we reached agreement with the ABC and SBS? Has there been an announcement made? If there has been agreement reached, why has it not been made public before the second reading stage of this bill has taken place?' If it has been made public and I have missed it, I apologise, but I do not think it has been reached.</para><para>Perhaps I am being too harsh on Senator Alston. Perhaps he has gone to the ABC board this morning to say, `By the way, I can tell you that this is what we have reached agreement on and I'm signing off with you here today. We are going to provide you with an appropriate amount of money for the transmission costs of the ABC and SBS.' I have to say, in view of this minister's track record, that that is a very big ask indeed.</para><para>The next issue, about why this agency should not be privatised, is: irrespective of the running costs of the National Transmission Agency that the ABC and SBS have to pay, what money is available for the digitisation program? We in the opposition believe you cannot divorce the cost of the digitisation program now that it has been put on the table by the government in another bill on the digital program for introducing digital television and digital radio to Australia. In the budget, this mean-spirited, mealy-mouthed government promised the ABC $20 million and then said, `If you are good and if we like what you do in your programming, we may give you some more.'</para><para>It is blatant blackmail by this government to intimidate the ABC as we lead up to the next election. Never before has a coalition government acted in such a disgraceful way as this minister has, egged on by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello). It is blackmail of the ABC to say, `We will give you $20 million now. Sell all your other property and introduce full outsourcing of programming, and then we may give you some more money for the digitalisation of the ABC for its equipment.' We all know that, early next century, if the ABC's equipment is not digitalised it will go out of existence as a national broadcaster. That is exactly what this minister and this 
 Prime Minister want to happen to the ABC—to destroy it as a broad based national broadcaster, independent of government, providing factual and broad ranging views to the Australian people.</para><para>It is ironic that, today, this bill for the privatisation of the National Transmission Agency and its major impact on the ABC are being debated when the minister himself is at the ABC board, up there abusing them, accusing them of bias—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWNHILL</name><name role="display">Senator Brownhill</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

He said it in this place in the last two weeks. He said himself, on the public record, that the ABC is biased in the covering of a number of national issues and, `We don't like your coverage.' He accused the ABC of bias first, then wrote a letter to the chief executive of the ABC demanding a response to his allegations of bias. He should have at least written first if he had concerns and, before he made the allegations and charges and public abuse, then made some comment. He did it round the other way.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We know what he is there for. He said it himself. He is going to raise these issues of what he sees as bias. It is intimidation and this sale of the National Transmission Agency is another way in which this government is aiming to destroy the ABC as a national broadcaster in this country. That is why, above all else, we will never vote for the sale of the National Transmission Agency. We believe it is a very important national infrastructure that all Australians would support. I commend to the Senate the opposition's minority report and hope that the Senate has the good sense to defeat this bill in the second reading. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>3165</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As we have heard, the purpose of the legislation that is now before us is to provide for the sale of the national transmission network. The Democrats do not support the sale of essential government infrastructure unless it is proved to be in the public interest. We are not convinced that this is the case with the national transmission network, especially as it stands at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>I am sure government members will remember—certainly I remember and I know Senator Schacht will remember—what was announced in the <inline font-style="italic">Better Communications</inline> policy document, which came out just before the last election. It stated that the coalition would increase the national broadcaster's responsibility for the transmission of their programs. On page 7 of the document, the government states:</para><para>. . . the Coalition sees no valid reason why the national broadcasters should not have control over their transmission facilities. After all it is the national broadcasters who are criticised whenever their sub-standard transmission quality or breakdowns occur. . . Accordingly, and in line with an increasing trend around the world, the Coalition will fund the ABC directly for its transmission costs on the strict condition that national coverage and existing service commitments to rural and remote areas are continued.</para><para>How on earth the ABC is able to keep up proper transmission to rural and remote areas with no money to do it, I do not know. Of course, that is what is happening at the moment. Senator Boswell will tell you—Senator Boswell has—that there is a real problem with the ABC's transmission in the bush. That is an absolute, direct result of a lack of funding to the ABC. I hope everybody listening in rural and remote areas realises that. I am sure they do. The coalition's policy also commits to the same outcome for SBS. That is on page 9 of their policy. Unfortunately, though, that is where the good policy stops.</para><para>The national broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, have sought control over their transmission facilities for a very long time. But the Democrats do not believe that the way to achieve that outcome is for the government to sell off the transmission facility, the national 
 transmission network. We would much rather see the national broadcasters properly funded for the costs of their transmission facilities, not as a separate line item in the budget but directly and as part of their total funding appropriation. That way, the ABC and SBS would be able to enter into direct commercial relationships with a number of transmission service providers, including the NTN, commercial providers and others. That may even have the effect of challenging the way the National Transmission Agency, which operates that network, operates.</para><para>The national broadcasters and the National Transmission Agency have not always had a very convivial relationship. That is not the fault of either of those organisations but the effect has been that, over a considerable period of time, neither the ABC nor SBS has developed a particularly sound working relationship with the NTA, and that has negatively affected all of them.</para><para>But that problem should not be resolved by selling off one arm of the government's business to the private sector. Time and time again, successive governments have laid claim to the fact that transferring the operational capacity of a government agency to the private sector will produce the scope for greater client focus and responsiveness which flows from commercial practice, and of course that is just not the case. The Democrats reject the notion—and this is something that we hear all the time from this government—that everything in the public sector is inherently bad and inefficient and everything in the private sector is inherently efficient and cost effective. It is <inline font-style="italic">Animal Farm</inline>: four legs are good and two legs are bad.</para><para>Selling the transmission facilities does not necessarily set the scene, as the government claims, for a greater degree of competition in the transmission services market. The national transmission network currently operates as a sort of monopoly, with the national broadcasters the only guaranteed customers. Competition is only likely to take place between the National Transmission Agency and a commercial provider, and then only on the eastern seaboard or other coastal regions of Australia. That is where the population is.</para><para>At the very least the Democrats believe that, if the bill passes the second reading stage in the Senate and the sale proceeds, the government should use the funds to pay for the digitisation of the ABC, SBS and some community broadcasters. And if they cannot find the $1.6 million elsewhere, then they can use some of the funds to immediately reopen the Cox Peninsula shortwave transmission facility.</para><para>In the latest budget, the government has costed the proceeds of the national transmission network into forward estimates. That is a courageous move on their part. In its submission to the inquiry into this sale bill, the Department of Communications and the Arts stated that the proceeds would pay for the cost of the ABC and SBS contracts for transmission; the cost of funding providers of Radio for the Print Handicapped services and commercial broadcasting licensees in declared remote areas for increase in transmission costs resulting from commercial charging—</para><para>very noble; discretionary funding to the ABC and SBS for minor transmission enhancements; and the costs of planning and administering transmission services by ABC and SBS. Since the government would have had to fund these programs regardless of the sale of the NTN, why is the department apparently double counting those proceeds?</para><para>The sale does not result in the government suddenly receiving the money it requires to fund these transmission services. The government simply wants to eliminate, as far as possible, its activities in the direct provision of telecommunications infrastructure, and it is slowly going about doing just that. That is why we recommend that any proceeds be used to fund national broadcasters in their transition to digital technology, and our amendments reflect this. We also make provision for a proportion of the funds to be used by the community broadcasting sector's transition into the digital environment.</para><para>As Senator Schacht told us just a moment ago, the ABC is being given $20.8 million. That sounds like a lot of money, but it is minuscule. If you talk to the commercial broadcasters, they believe they needs hundreds of millions of dollars to change over 
 into digital processes—hundreds of millions. This government is `generously' allowing the ABC $20.8 million to try to change over with. I have spoken to the minister about this and he tells me that it is really only part one and, depending what happens, then maybe they will get part two as well, and goodness knows what part two will be—$½ million, $1 million. It will not be anything like the hundreds of millions of dollars that they need—or that the commercial broadcasters tell us that they need.</para><para>The national transmission network's 550 transmission facilities are used to carry television and radio signals for the national broadcasters. Some commercial and community stations access the national transmission network, which also provides the transmission for emergency broadcasters and for Radio for the Print Handicapped. Telstra, Optus, Vodaphone and paging and data services also use the NTN.</para><para>In his second reading speech, the minister stated that the government recognised the importance of safeguarding important broadcasting policy objectives, including the maintenance of existing ABC and SBS coverage and service quality. We were pleased to hear this. But we do not think that the community service obligations contained in the bill provide adequate access to certain broadcasters. We have the community sector in mind here particularly.</para><para>The emergence of digital broadcasting will pose special and significant broadcasting challenges, some of which cannot yet be determined, and we believe the bill should at least try to take some of these into consideration. Naturally, emergency service operators, Radio for the Print Handicapped and government and non-profit self-help re-transmission broadcasters deserve special attention, and we are pleased that the bill recognises that. Commercial broadcasting licensees in declared remote areas are also defined as nominated customers in the bill, and they should receive guaranteed access to sites and transmission towers. But the bill cannot guarantee that these services will continue to receive special treatment after the initial five-year contract period of transition from the public 
 to the private sector. Too much remains unclear and undetermined, particularly after that five years.</para><para>The national broadcasters are of the view that the sale should proceed. That is not because they are of the view that the privatisation of the network is a good idea—they have no view on that—but because the contracts and the compacts have enabled the national broadcasters to negotiate a more suitable arrangement for the transmission of their television and radio services to Australians than is currently the case. The government, in line with their election commitment, should have enabled the national broadcasters to undertake contractual arrangements with service providers regardless of the sale of the network. If the government were truly serious about competition, it would have found other ways to introduce it, not merely by selling a monopoly provider to the private sector. This in itself does not guarantee a competitive outcome.</para><para>The compact with the government and the contracts with the future owner or owners, the ABC and SBS believe, will provide adequate protection for both broadcasters and the viewing and listening public. In particular, the contract with the future owner will ensure that coverage and service levels for the current services are maintained. While the national broadcasters should not be doubted—as I am sure they have been really cautious in their approach to this whole situation and, of course, they can be trusted—I sincerely hope their predicted outcome is right.</para><para>The contracts and the compacts will be signed by all parties for an initial five-year period and will be subject to renegotiation for a period of up to 14 years in total. Those measures are designed to protect the broadcasters against higher possible costs from the post-sale arrangements. We hope that is the case, but being subject to the funding whims of this government in particular, nothing can be certain.</para><para>The Democrats also have concerns about the sale process itself. During the committee process, the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing was not able to provide details of the anticipated sale price 
 or details about the intended purchasers. The Democrats are concerned about a possible conflict of interest if the owner of the network is a commercial broadcaster. We believe that the new owners ought to be specialist transmission providers, not broadcasters.</para><para>Channels 7, 9 and 10 are all part of the consortiums who have bid for the network. With all the uncertainty underpinning the future of broadcasting as one of the reasons the government wants to back out of transmission service provision, it appears that commercial broadcasters understand the importance of owning national broadcasting transmission infrastructure at this crucial time much more than the government does.</para><para>We would certainly hope that, in the event of transmission failure, the commercial interests would not override the public interest and that all broadcasting services would be afforded equal importance. Transmission cannot be left to the market to decide when the national broadcasters are dependent on a concept of the public good. The Democrats note that the access regime for the national transmission network is similar to that put in place for the telecommunications industry but only for certain nominated customers. The access regime is designed to guard against any imbalance in power which might lead to an essential transmission service or facility being available.</para><para>In dealing with the latest Telstra bill, the Democrats have become aware that some provisions in the access regime do not benefit all the players in the marketplace. Those provisions are also designed to ensure that not all services are available at monopoly prices. To invoke the cliche, there is no level playing field in the telecommunications industry, particularly with the strength that Telstra has in the marketplace, and it does not look to us as though there will be in the near future. How can we expect the provision of transmission facilities to guarantee equal access to all broadcasters, particularly the smaller ones?</para><para>The Democrats have drafted amendments to safeguard access and to provide for a better community service obligation scheme, assuming that the bill gets past the second reading stage. We would prefer that the national 
 broadcasters, the ABC and the SBS, achieve control of their transmission facilities from means other than the sale of a government asset, especially one which provides an essential service. We also reject the government's notion that everything in the private sector is efficient and the public sector is inherently inefficient and uncompetitive. The government could have made a number of policy decisions which would have given the national broadcasters control of their transmission facilities, it would have given them secured funding for broadcasting and for their digital conversion, but that is not what they have done.</para><para>In response, the Democrats have formulated a key amendment to the bill which will see the proceeds of the sale given to the national broadcasters in order that some of the infrastructure development funding they require can be secured. Securing funding for the national broadcasters is far more important than the government's argument about debt retirement or their ideologically position, straight out of <inline font-style="italic">Animal Farm</inline>, of four legs good, two legs bad.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3168</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—(11.17 a.m.)—The national transmission network carries television and radio signals for the ABC, SBS, some commercial radio and TV stations and vital community services, such as Radio for the Print Handicapped.

There is also a large number of other transmitters housed for radio communications, police and emergency services and other services.</para></talk.start><para>Due to expansion over the last few years, the agency has the potential to reach 18 million Australians, which significantly includes rural and regional Australia. The national transmission network is part of the National Transmission Agency, a separate cost centre operating on a commercial basis outside the department of communications. From all accounts, the NTA is an efficient operation. Over the last few years the NTA 
 has undergone extensive changes in its operations. Telstra held a monopoly over this outsourced operation and maintenance role of the network, but under competitive tendering it now shares the work with Broadcast Communications Ltd, a division of Television New Zealand Australia Pty Ltd. BCL is the forerunner to acquire the NTN. A company from the United States, Castle Group, has also emerged as another frontrunner in the bid to acquire the national transmission network.</para><para>Tendering resulted in savings of $20 million in 1995-96. Once again, we see an Australian owned enterprise, which is efficient, about to pass into foreign ownership. It is also worth noting that there was a scoping study done for the sale of the NTN by the government, the results of which have not been released. The sale is not in our national interest and will not lead to any economic or social efficiencies. As Stewart Fist pointed out in his article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> earlier this year, the fee and budget estimates match, meaning little real long-term gain, only short term, which is a way of borrowing against budgets of future governments who will have to bear the cost.</para><para>At the public hearing on 5 February 1998, the Office of Assets Sales and Information Technology Outsourcing and the Department of Communications and the Arts were unable to provide specific examples of any efficiencies that would occur as a result of the sale of the NTN. The bill outlines that transmission coverage for the ABC and the SBS will be funded by the government for the next five years for the purchasers of the national transmission network. The onus, therefore, is on the broadcasters to ensure quality of coverage. There will be a direct commercial relationship between the ABC and the SBS and the transmission carriers, where previously the link was mediated through the government. The government is ridding itself of responsibility to all Australians, particularly those in rural and regional areas.</para><para>On Monday of this week, representatives of the ABC and the SBS came to my office to speak to me about this bill, to tell me that they support it. I listened to them as they outlined the reasons for their support. The Senate legislation committee which examined 
 this bill heard from representatives of the SBS, witnesses who stressed that the sale of the NTN facilities provided them with the more flexible delivery opportunity that they had been seeking for a number of years. It is okay for our national broadcasters to support this sale. Access to transmission services for them is guaranteed in the bill. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for our community and self-help broadcasters. The question arises that, once the NTA is privatised, will the ABC and the SBS have to have an additional sum of money to pay the new privatised owner the recurrent cost of running the services? There may also need to be an additional fee to cover the capital cost, the amount that these companies will tender to purchase the network. Has any research been done into this issue? Does the minister responsible have any comment or response? I eagerly await his reply.</para><para>What guarantees are there for the maintenance of existing services and service quality, particularly after the five-year contractual agreements have run out? There is an option for the bodies involved to renew for two terms of five years on terms and conditions to be negotiated. How much will our national broadcasters have to pay for transmission services? Will they be priced out of the market? Perhaps this is a long-term objective of the Howard government: a great way to save money, to starve the ABC of funding by then starving the ABC and the SBS of ready access to government controlled transmission of services and then forcing them to close, saving even more money.</para><para>The ALP dissenting report points out that there is also the problem of a conflict of interest should a commercial broadcaster purchase the NTA. Commercial programming and services could be prioritised by the potential commercial broadcaster to the detriment of ABC and SBS services. Also there are no guarantees that the ABC and the SBS will continue to receive sufficient funds to maintain and improve their services.</para><para>Following on from this, the national transmission network sale has particular importance for rural and regional communities, where often the ABC and SBS are the main 
 media and information links with the rest of the world. The NTA annual report for 1995-96 states that almost 90 per cent of the value of transmission assets has been provided to serve regional Australia. That clearly is a big investment on the part of federal governments over the last six years.</para><para>In its submission to the Senate legislation committee, the Department of Communications and the Arts said that the access regime provisions in the legislation would ensure that residents of remote areas would continue to receive the same level of broadcasting service after the sale of NTN as being received currently. Yet the bill itself contains no guarantees regarding maintenance of service in regional and rural areas. Also, there is uncertainty over the role that the future owner of the NTA will have in the planning of transmitting facilities in rural and regional Australia.</para><para>A great deal of the argument being used against the full privatisation of Telstra and the potential flogging off of Australia Post can be used for this sale. Many Australians in rural and regional areas now rely on new technologies, such as the Internet and e-mail, to keep in touch with the rest of the world. An article which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> earlier this month outlines the problems that may arise with the full privatisation of Telstra. Even though only partly privatised now, many claim that maintenance services have been reduced already. This serves as a dangerous example for the transmission of radio and television under a privatised national transmission network.</para><para>The real fear, of course, is that there will not be any expansions or upgrades in our rural and regional areas, as a private sector transmission company will be more interested in metropolitan areas as they will be more profitable. This will lead to a decline of services over time with the possibility that, if something goes wrong, if there is an outrage when broadcasting goes down, it will take a long time to be fixed or it will not be fixed at all.</para><para>The last few years have seen an expansion of the network into regional Australia. In 1996-97 the ABC's youth radio network, 
 Triple J, was extended into an another eight regional centres. This extended the audience by 3.7 million, and makes Triple J accessible to 80 per cent of the Australian population, or 14.5 million people. The expansion program of Triple J has been an ongoing one. Announced in the 1993-94 federal budget, the then Labor government said that it would bring the youth service to 44 regional communities via the NTA transmission network. Prior to this, Triple J was heard only in the six state capitals and Darwin, Newcastle and Canberra. Now people in Geraldton and Kalgoorlie, Mackay and Mt Isa, and Broken Hill can listen to Triple J, bringing young people and the young at heart in these rural areas into contact with the pre-eminent youth radio station in the nation.</para><para>But it is not only our younger generation that have benefited from the NTA's expansion of services and transmission. ABC TV, Radio National and local radio were brought to new audiences by way of 33 transmitters in 1996-97, and SBS was extended to two major regions. Radio National now has 235 transmitters compared with the nine it had in 1981. Even up until January of this year, the network was expanding due to transmission being extended in Queensland, with further expansions expected into rural New South Wales and Victoria.</para><para>Further, another two NTA translator facilities were installed in Tasmania under the Tasmania broadcasting development program; the ABC's Classic FM was extended to Warrnambool; and agreement was reached with a pay TV operator to share NTA facilities in Tamworth. While on the subject of expansion of the network, the NTA also has a role to play in testing, development and improvements in the quality of service and transmission, more recently running trials using the latest technology, digital radio broadcasting, in conjunction with the Department of Communications and the Arts.</para><para>The future roll-out of digital terrestrial television has been delayed due to the prospect of the sale of the network. Trials were to begin last September but have been pushed back to June 1998. This is one of the major challenges that will face whatever is left of 
 the NTA after the sale. Up until now the network has had the opportunity to provide the best transmission services for rural and regional Australians. Now it will be dependent on the profit motive and money saving, rather than on providing services. That must be a major disappointment for all Australians but particularly for those who live in regional and rural areas. Community organisations, such as community television and radio, need the current services to be maintained, or they will be unable to keep on operating if fees for transmission are increased. This is a real threat.</para><para>From the 1995-96 annual report of the NTA, about one-third of the broadcasting transmitters on NTA sites are used to broadcast services other than the ABC or SBS. These are not all community self-help or emergency services; there are some commercial broadcasters involved. They utilise 522 of the 1,719 transmitters across the network. Commercial services utilise 418 transmitters; community services, 24 transmitters; and self-help systems, 61 transmitters. What this indicates is that there are a number of transmissions, other than those of ABC and SBS, that will be seriously affected by the sale of the network.</para><para>The Minister for Family Services, the Honourable Warwick Smith, assured the parliament that self-help groups, emergency service operators and remote commercial satellite service providers will be protected by the access regime. Capped charges and contracts or supplementary funding will ensure that they are not financially disadvantaged. This is lucky for them, but not for all the other community providers and broadcasters. Community broadcasters will be the hardest hit. They will be the first ones to feel the pinch when access and transmission fees are increased, and the least able to afford to continue broadcasting.</para><para>The ALP dissenting report indicated the grave concern that the community service obligations contained in the bill are more limited than those currently in existence. There are no guarantees on charging and access issues and community broadcasters are concerned that they will be forced to close 
 down if they are charged market rates. Also, the legislation has ignored the needs of the hearing impaired.</para><para>While the member for Bass talked about capping, there is no guarantee on how long it will last. Senators can rest assured that the capping or supplementary funding will expire and these other broadcasters—and I am particularly concerned about the community broadcasters—will be left in the lurch. They will be abandoned and unable to serve their communities because of the Howard government which is intent on selling off everything to the detriment of our rural and regional communities.</para><para>The sale of the national transmission network could only have a detrimental impact on broadcasting, particularly in rural and regional Australia. Again, the Australian people are faced with another sell-off of a national asset that may not be as well-known as another of our communications facilitators, Telstra, but is just as important to those in our rural and regional areas.</para><para>This government appears oblivious to community and social concerns about the importance of the provision and quality of these services; services that will no doubt be downgraded or lost when the NTA is sold. The sell-off of the national transmission network is just another sign of the mantra of the Howard government. It has major implications for regional and rural Australia, which again, despite the rhetoric of the Howard government, suffer the worst effects of its policies.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>3171</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As my colleague Senator George Campbell has outlined, the Labor Party will be opposing the National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997 and the associated consequential amendments bill.</para></talk.start><para>There is a very good reason for us opposing these bills, because these measures seek to sell off what is an essential and crucial part of Australia's telecommunications and communications infrastructure; infrastructure that provides metropolitan and regional Australia alike with their broadcasting services. These bills seek to sell off the assets of the National Transmission Agency, assets which are 
 currently owned by all Australians and managed for the good of all Australians.</para><para>The National Transmission Agency can be held up as an impressive organisation and is in fact one of the world's largest broadcasting facilities. The assets of the NTA include 1,197 transmitters used to broadcasting the ABC and SBS radio and television services right around the Australian continent. Perhaps that gives us an insight as to why this government is selling the network. With what they are doing to the ABC and SBS, perhaps there will not be anything of substance to broadcast soon.</para><para>The relationship between the cutbacks to our national broadcasters and to this sale of the National Transmission Agency cannot be ignored. This relationship represents a commitment by this government to an ideological agenda of deconstructing the communications services provided through taxpayers' funds for the benefit of all Australians.</para><para>The NTA facilities also accommodate 503 transmitters belonging to licensed broadcasters and more than 1,000 radio communications transmitters. Why is it that Australia has such an impressive and large broadcasting infrastructure network? It is because, unlike this current government, some former administrations had the foresight, commitment and understanding as to why it was so critical for such a vast country as ours to have a well-defined, efficient and extensive physical infrastructure.</para><para>A network that is managed by government to ensure that broadcasting services are available to all Australians is what we require. We know, because of what has happened with Telstra and the reduction in services that can be largely attributed to a change in Telstra's priorities as a public organisation—now a partially private organisation—that there is a relationship between that commitment to services to all Australians and ownership. We also know that the intent, will and philosophies of the government of the day also determine the quality through the level of the funding afforded to those services.</para><para>Out of all of NTA's assets there is one component that is absolutely invaluable and cannot be quantified, and that is the people 
 who work there. In this government's rationalist quantifying of government assets and the sort of dollar it hopes to reap from its sale, it cannot quantify the corporate knowledge and experience of the workers, many of whom have spent their whole professional lives working for this organisation. There are people within the NTA that have seen it grow, develop and provide a remarkable service that they are very proud of as employees of the NTA and the Australian Public Service. They are also very proud of the actual technical capacities that they have been able to achieve.</para><para>It is because of the dedication and commitment of the people who work there that we have seen the NTA go from strength to strength, with improved and more efficient services as well as clocking up some singularly identifiable and impressive achievements. It is particularly because of the NTA's excellent performance over recent years that there can be no argument and no justification for the government to be bringing the bills before this place. There is no argument or justification from the government as to any inefficiencies. There is no argument from this government as to why it can justify the sale of the NTA in any form.</para><para>Evidence of this lack of justification, I believe, can be found in the government's refusal to release its scoping study. That scoping study would canvass and seek to quantify the economics behind the structure of the NTA and the services it provides, the cost to government and the returns to government in the form of service. How is this parliament to decide whether the government is proceeding down the most appropriate route in maximising the return to the Australian taxpayers and seeking to protect the public interest without this information being available? Does the government expect us to do it on trust?</para><para>I believe this government has lost the trust of the Australian people with its short-sighted measures. These short-sighted measures over the last two years and a bit have meant that Australians cannot trust what this government has to say. When that lack of trust is highlighted by a refusal to provide basic informa 
 tion to allow proper parliamentary consideration of these issues, it reinforces the view.</para><para>The opposition has concerns with many areas connected to these bills. I would like to go through some of those specific areas. Although the bill guarantees access to the NTA facilities for the ABC and SBS for the next five years, there is very little information as to what will happen after those five years. In the midst of a time of great change, of great technological progress, and indeed political consideration of the management of that technological progress, particularly with respect to digitisation, what sort of fiasco is the government trying to establish here? Imagine the difficulty that the national broadcasters are going to be in when they seek to negotiate with a company, or perhaps a series of companies, of corporate entities, which will have a clear monopoly over transmission facilities and the transmission networks.</para><para>Here is one of the first fundamental contradictions of this whole process. Here we have a government whose rhetoric waxes long and rather lame on issues of competition, of achieving efficiencies, through that means. Yet this proposal is a transfer of what could be construed as a public monopoly to a private monopoly. In the eyes of competition policy, the latter is the far worse result in terms of consumers and certainly in terms of the public interest.</para><para>I am quite bewildered as to how some senators on the other side of this chamber who purport to represent regional Australia are supporting these bills, considering that they contain no guarantees regarding the maintenance of services in rural and regional areas. We see speculation currently in the context of the Telstra privatisation debate that the only way this government can protect services for regional areas is not through a process of asset sales, of deregulation, of competition in the private sector, but through re-regulation to force those corporate entities to provide a prescribed minimum service in areas that don't `turn a quid'. And let's face it—because we are such a big country, because we are so vast, some areas of this country in the telecommunications context will never turn a quid. In this fact lies the 
 very foundation of arguments supporting the retention of public ownership, not only of our telecommunications service provider Telstra, but also of authorities like the National Transmission Authority.</para><para>While some members of government have made certain claims that the contract with the purchaser of the network would look after these matters, this guarantee should appear in the bill if this parliament is to have any faith that the government and the new owner will meet these obligations of looking after those in the bush. Over the last two years, time and time again it has been the Australian Labor Party highlighting the concerns of regional Australia. The cuts to the ABC and the sale of Telstra, which I have already mentioned, and the cutting of Radio National are all examples of the diminution of services in the communications area to regional Australia.</para><para>Here is another bill that does nothing to protect or support, let alone enhance, those critical services. I ask: where are those supposed to be the voices of rural Australia speaking up when this government is making decisions that will hit people hardest out there in rural and regional Australia? We do not hear them in debate because we are dealing with the Liberals' ideological agenda. The National Party representatives in this place are not to be seen when it comes to slashing, funding, cutting and selling off our telecommunications infrastructure.</para><para>There is nothing in this bill that guarantees that the current policy objectives of the National Transmission Agency will be maintained. While the bill does contain some limited community service obligations, these are far more constrained than those which are currently in existence. How ironic it is that when the government is deciding to sell off Australia's broadcasting infrastructure it actually reduces the community obligations on those who will control the transmission network.</para><para>With respect to the ABC and SBS, the minister claims they will draw up a compact with the two broadcasters which will seek to spell out what the coverage and quality expectations will be for those who own the national transmission network. Well, how is 
 that for a gesture? The same minister continues to cut the funding of our national broadcaster with each consecutive budget and, with respect to technological progression, an issue which is fundamentally linked to the services that the National Transmission Authority provide, they have restricted the capability of the ABC through lack of sufficient funding for their digitisation strategy.</para><para>The government claims that in return for this compact it will be covering the costs of the transmission contracts for the next five years. Let us see, does that relate to the timetable for the digitisation strategy? It comes close, it is a big longer. How does it relate to the out years funding commitment by this government to the ABC? All these things must be reviewed alongside each other. Five years does not afford the protection to the national broadcaster that is required to make what is fundamentally an irreversible decision to sell the authority. I think it is also a reasonable thing to say that I can assume that undertaking is about as good as Minister Alston's undertaking a couple of years back to actually guarantee ABC funding.</para><para>It is very difficult for anyone to claim that the NTA is an inefficient organisation. To what degree the government will lean on this, I expect we shall hear. The NTA over the last few years dramatically expanded its network, resulting in the substantial expansion of radio and television services to regional Australia. In fact, the expansion of the network since 1992 has facilitated an extra 1.3 million Australians having access to national radio and television services. ABC services alone have been extended to a further 468,000 Australians over the last six years, with 453,000 Australians also now having access to SBS television.</para><para>This growth, this improved access to these services, has got to be attributed in some way to the dedication of the team at the NTA and the former Labor government's vision and commitment to expanding the network. This vision and dedication is lacking from this government and I am yet to hear how this vision will emerge in the private sector. This government stands up here and says that a corporate entity which purchases the NTA 
 will arrive with such a vision, with such a commitment to expanding the opportunities of all Australians to access such services, with an underlying philosophy of equity of that access.</para><para>I want the government to tell me how it will do that, because experience shows us that the only way governments can enforce a commitment to those issues by corporate entities is through a re-regulation, through a strident compliance regime that in turn starts to eat into any perceived deficiencies that they hope to attain through the sale in the first place. And with a compliance regime must come penalties, there must come a disincentive if that corporate entity does not conform with the desired requirements of the government.</para><para>Here is the second greatest contradiction: the government is floating these concepts up against the rhetoric that we hear from it about free market enterprise, about how the private sector always does it better than the public sector, but it starts to ring very hollow and is exposed as not being an argument of substance when it comes to the selling off of public infrastructure in this way.</para><para>Like many senators on the other side of the chamber, I too am a keen listener of Triple J and one of the greatest achievements of the National Transmission Authority was its expansion of the network that has facilitated the broadcast of Triple J to thousands upon thousands of young Australians. Triple J has been revolutionised as a result of regional broadcasting and has not only acted as a wonderful new service to young people in rural and regional Australia but has brought metropolitan young people and rural people together. It has provided a unique unifying factor amongst the youth of this country. Where is the vision going to emerge from this government and what are their solutions to address these concepts? Triple J's series of `Unearthed' concerts have been great examples once again about how we bring rural and regional Australia together with metropolitan Australia, sharing their culture, sharing their voice.</para><para>These are the tangible examples of what I am talking about when I talk about equity and 
 access and how our communications and telecommunications infrastructure are so critical to all Australians. It is not just about switching the TV on or the radio on and being able to get a service, it is about the quality of service that provides. That point takes me back to an earlier point in that you cannot address these issues unless you look at the big picture, the funding issues relating to the national broadcasters that use the NTA. It is all linked and it all points to how critical the retention of public ownership of these services is because that allows philosophies of parties like the Labor Party to shine through and allows these services and the opportunities that they subsequently provide to continue to be a feature on the Australian political landscape. In conclusion, I would once again like to recognise the dedicated work of all the employees of the NTA over the years. They are a group of people who have much to be proud of.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>3175</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In listening to the debate so far today, I have been very cheered to see issues of public interest brought up continually, in particular by the ALP. I took particular interest in that because for some time, in fact since before 1995, we have been dealing with the issue of competition policy, that is, the major shift in policy that has occurred—and we know that it is supported by both major parties—where everything that can be done by the private sector and everything that can be opened up to the market will be opened up to the market. This is an ongoing process. What happened in 1995 is not the be-all and end-all. We are involved in this process as we speak and in the end, by legislation, we will be required to open sectors up to the market unless there are exemptions, and I have not seen any.</para></talk.start><para>I find their contributions encouraging but also concerning because public interest was never a strong point of the 1995 competition policy legislation. Whether it is opening up markets, opening up public provision of services to the market or, as in this case, privatising what is currently a public asset, we have no legislative guarantee that the public interest will prevail. It is all very well for the 
 Labor Party to rail against the ignoring of public interest in this regard, but they did not listen in 1995. They are still resisting and, in fact, they told me they would not vote for an inquiry—a long overdue inquiry—into the social impacts of competition policy. That motion stayed on the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for weeks—in fact, probably months—waiting to see whether there was some iota of support in the Labor Party for looking at the whole gamut of issues involved with competition policy to see if we can responsibly assess, as a community and as a parliament, whether we are going in the right direction and whether we have put public interest in the right place in terms of public policy. And they have resisted it.</para><para>We know the government is likely to resist it. We know that in 1995 there was a Labor government and a different Prime Minister, but there is time to reassess that now. It is no good saying, every time one of these issues comes up, `The government of the day is not acting in the public interest' when we had the chance, and still have the chance, of assessing whether we can put public interest more strongly into the competition policy regime.</para><para>I will move to the Greens (WA) position in relation to the National Transmission Network Sale Bill. The Greens (WA) are not convinced that the sale of the national transmission network is ostensibly in the public interest. The plan is to sell off the range of assets currently contained in the National Transmission Agency. Essentially, the assets consist of transmitters used to broadcast ABC and SBS television and radio programs throughout Australia. The government's argument is that it will enhance customer service through competition. In addition, the government proposes that the sale will benefit the public by retirement of debt.</para><para>Going back to the debate we had in 1995, what we could find out in 1995 from both major parties was that public interest equals competition equals public interest. It was a circular argument. There were some exemptions but they were very limited. We find these arguments less than convincing. Competition and debt retirement seem to be the government's catchcry and pet argument 
 whenever they cannot think of a rational reason to pursue their endless privatisation and deregulation agenda. We heard it with Telstra and the banks, and the same line has been pushed again in relation to the national transmission network. It is highly questionable whether increased so-called competition and debt retirement are in the public interest in this case. While these things are not necessarily bad in principle, it is necessary to look at the costs associated with going down this track. It is also necessary to look at alternative means of achieving the same results.</para><para>The national transmission network, under Commonwealth control, is an extremely efficient network. As mentioned by other speakers, in the last few years it has dramatically expanded its network and, in doing so, has performed an admirable role in extending radio and television access. A lot of that has come, I have to add, by parliamentary pressure. It could be pork-barrelling and it could be before elections, but parliamentary pressure has added to that. Pressures within electorates, we know, have added to that.</para><para>The national transmission network has spent a lot of money keeping its equipment up to speed, despite funding cuts. Over the last few years, the national transmission network has not only updated and expanded its services but has also managed to implement significant savings in its recurrent costs. As the NTN is already providing excellent and efficient service to its customers and the community at large, the claims of efficiency through competition—another of the famous catchcries of government, despite any evidence to the contrary—does not hold much water. When you cream off the profit margins here, who is getting more benefit than they got before?</para><para>The Greens (WA) have major concerns about the continuation of national coverage and customer service obligations in regional, rural and remote areas. We have already heard of the plans to make digital telephones and television services compulsory and to cut off the access to analogs. This is another situation where, in the future, technology itself may cut off access, and what direct implications does that have for parliamentary input into the provision of services?</para><para>Facilities in the bush are faced with yet another threat by this sale. The community service obligations are a watered down version of what is already in existence, and we have seen that before. Whenever there is a government asset for sale, in order to push up the price, they reduce the compliance for those networks. So instead of having more oversight and more regulations, as they would usually do in America when there is a public service provided by a private provider, they are actually having less; and I find that extraordinary.</para><para>The government is making noises along the lines of `she'll be right, mate'. The government plans to ensure national coverage through the contract with the purchaser of the network. This is clearly an unsatisfactory arrangement. Any protections or assurances of access in the bush should be in this bill so that the parliament can determine whether or not they are adequate. Will the contract ensure quality of access? Will it even ensure current access? What about the price of continued access? What about those rural and regional areas that do not have current coverage? There are no promises made about extending coverage to those people who do not already have access.</para><para>Remember that, under corporate law, the primary obligation of the corporation which purchases the national transmission network, whether they are from Australia or from overseas, is to their shareholders. They will do whatever is best to enhance the profits of their shareholders. If that means cutting, reducing or limiting access to services in remote and regional areas in Australia, under corporate law that is what they must do unless there are laws to tell them otherwise. We note that commercial broadcasters will be provided with a grant to operate in declared remote areas. This grant should be extended to national and community broadcasters.</para><para>Long-term access to transmission facilities for the ABC and SBS is another issue that is still up in the air. The bill assures access for the next five years, but what will happen after that? Will we be assured by another wink and a `she'll be right' from the government? The ABC and SBS will undoubtedly be in under 
 dog positions when it comes to doing their own bargaining when the five years is up. They will be bargaining with owners in a distinct monopoly position. As the government has acknowledged—and, indeed, is proud of—the ABC and SBS will be in a direct commercial relationship with a provider. A direct commercial relationship comes with all the power imbalances that come with any monopoly provider and with all the pressures to make direct commercial decisions and not public interest decisions.</para><para>Another concern is that the national interest objectives of the ABC and SBS will be undermined. The Friends of the ABC are concerned that working in a commercial context could put unwanted and unwarranted pressure on the ABC and SBS to cede to commercial interests, especially when the five years are up. On top of that, the ABC and SBS are reliant on the government to fund their access to the network. How long will that last? Promises of funding have been made and broken in the past. The promise of maintaining funding in real terms to our national broadcasters has proved to be hollow. Our national broadcasters have had to feel the pain and have been made sacrificial lambs every year when the knife comes out at budget time—of course, this is less so in an election year. Not only are the ABC and SBS faced with the uncertainty of  continued access but also they will not know the price of access or whether the government will provide adequate funding.</para><para>The government claims that the ABC and SBS want this direct commercial relationship and that it is just playing fairy godmother in making that wish come true. Obviously I have heard from representatives of the ABC and SBS, as have many other players in this debate. They said to me quite clearly that they want to have some aspect of control of the network. Will this do it for them? I think the government misstates the position of the ABC and SBS in this regard. What they really want is, as I said, greater control of the transmission network. This does not necessarily mean the sale of the national transmission network. We would argue that, with the sale of the network, the ABC and SBS potentially may 
 have less control through public accountability. So, yes, they do want some control of the network and to have a greater say in transmission. I am not entirely sure that, in the current commercial environment, this is necessarily in the best interests of consumers in remote and regional Australia—that still has to be argued. Does the sale of the network give them greater control? This is yet to be proved.</para><para>The government could have allowed the ABC and SBS greater control by directly funding their transmission costs and providing them with control of the radio communications spectrum used to broadcast their services. The sale of the national transmission network does not have to be a step towards giving greater control; in fact, it may lead in the other direction. Although I imagine that it would be heresy if the government extended the funding to the ABC and SBS when it was something it could flog off to service debt, it is something that should be considered.</para><para>Community broadcasters are also under threat. These energetic and colourful broadcasters do not, under this bill, receive any kind of supplement or real guarantee of access to transmission facilities. The government is showing a complete lack of understanding of the role and importance of community broadcasters. They play an important and unique role that cannot be replaced by commercial broadcasters. They present a diversity of views and opinions that provides a unique service which caters to local people. Many community broadcasters would go under if they had to pay full prices for access to broadcasting services. This would be a grave loss to the community and a significant reduction in diversity. But maybe it is in the interests of the government to have those voices silenced. Is this the kind of vision that the government has for the future of Australia?</para><para>Another concern relates to who will buy the national transmission network. There are no limits on foreign ownership, for a start. Also, the bill makes no provision for potential conflicts of interest if a commercial broadcaster bought the network. What are the implications there? Will there be any restrictions in 
 the legislation? No. For instance, if there were a breakdown in the network, the commercial services would be repaired ahead of the national broadcasters.</para><para>All in all, the Greens have not been convinced that the government has provided enough assurances to the Australian community. We have been asked to stand at the abyss and to take a leap of faith that things will work out better not only for the bottom lines of broadcasters—the ABC and SBS—but also for the provision of services to the Australian community. We are talking about short-term budget bottom lines as opposed to long-term interests. I have strongly argued that we have never assessed long-term Australian public interest in relation to competition policy; the Labor Party has resisted us doing that. Now that we have more and more examples of where this is going wrong without any real control by the parliament, maybe the Labor Party will agree that it is time to go back and look at public interest and the social impacts of competition policy. The benchmark should be community service, not an ideological agenda.

Can I say from the outset that I share with Senator Margetts an interest in the approach of the Australian Labor Party to these issues. We saw, as Senator Margetts will remember, an approach by the Australian Labor Party in government which—and I believe to former Prime Minister Keating's great credit—embraced competition policy. We saw a move to bring the benefits of competition to the Australian economy, and I praise the former Prime Minister for that. Although he had many failures as a Prime 
 Minister, one of his great achievements was to bring competition policy to many parts of the Australian economy that had not previously be exposed. He did so in a sensible, practical and workable way.</para><para>The Australian Labor Party in government had that approach to competition. They also, as Senator Margetts will recall, had an approach to privatisation—the privatisation of great Australian icons. In government, of course, having promised at the 1990 election that they would not sell the Commonwealth Bank—and Ben Chifley would turn in his grave—they sold the Commonwealth Bank.

Their plans to sell Telstra, in fact, were well afoot. Their plans to privatise the <inline font-style="italic">Yellow Pages</inline> and a range of other parts of Telstra, and indeed Telstra itself, were well in hand at the time the Keating government was defeated. The first tranche of the Australian Labor government's telecommunications privatisation program was the sale in 1991, as I recall, of Aussat.

The point I was making, of course, was that the Australian Labor Party in government was pretty gung ho about selling major bits of infrastructure, and Aussat was clearly a part of that. A substantial part of the telecommunications infrastructure of Australia was sold and, of course, it could only have been sold if the Senate had passed the Aussat repeal bill in around 1991.

 issue of securing our financial future. When I was a youngster going from primary school to secondary school, Australia's financial situation was in a very good state. For young people of my generation—and I include you in that, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds—the world was our oyster. There were opportunities galore and jobs galore. But gradually, over a period of time, those opportunities have been whittled away, particularly over the 13 years that Labor was in government.</para></talk.start><para>On 12 May 1998 Peter Costello, the federal Treasurer, announced a budget surplus of $2.7 billion for the financial year 1998 to 1999. Further budget surpluses are projected to reduce net debt from a peak under Labor of about 20 per cent of GDP to around 1.5 per cent of GDP by 2001-02. That is an extraordinary achievement. I am often asked why this government is so determined to reform the economic management of this country and reduce debt. The reason we are so determined, firstly, is that there are a lot of older Australians that I have met as I moved around the country doing consultations for the International Year of Older Persons who are alarmed that the legacy they left us, the inheritance they left us, was being squandered and that the inheritance of the next generation was being spent by this generation—and basically by Labor when it was in government for 13 years. What we were doing was using up the inheritance we had, and we were borrowing against the inheritance of the next generation.</para><para>Debt does not exist in isolation. When you have debt, as all of us who have mortgages or have bought something on time payment know, interest must be paid on the debt. When government debt grows, as it did under Labor, it must also be paid for through interest repayments. Those interest repayments represent opportunities forgone. In the terms of economists, what you spend on interest you cannot spend on other things. I remember a lesson I learnt when I was a youngster. I wanted to buy a dress. In those days people used to go door to door selling clothes on time payment. My mother warned me about buying this dress, but I wanted a new nylon 
 dress. They were the days when nylon had come out.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Sandy Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Still got it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—No, I have not still got it. But I decided that I was going to buy this dress, and I was going to pay two shillings a week on this dress. My mother was right because, by the time I had finished paying for the dress, the dress had worn out and was out of fashion. I learnt a very big lesson from that about buying something on time payment. I also had to pay interest, and I paid a lot more for that dress than I should have. It was a very good lesson. Thank heavens it was only on a dress that I learnt that lesson.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7E4</name.id><name role="metadata">VANSTONE</name><name role="display">Senator Vanstone</name></talker><para>—Not on the national accounts.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—Not on the national accounts. My mother let me have my head, and I am glad she did because I learnt a very good lesson; a lesson which people on the other side obviously have not learnt.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If you have a debt on the national accounts, you have interest repayments which could have been otherwise spent. As Senator Vanstone said, it could have been otherwise spent on improving Australian schools, housing and hospitals—and all the other things that people come into our offices telling us we ought to be spending money on. These repayments grow with the debt, and eventually higher interest rates are needed to attract the necessary funds. Higher interest rates affect all Australians. They affect farmers, who find it increasingly difficult to keep up with repayments on their properties. We saw in that time of high interest rates under Labor banks foreclosing on farms and people moving off the land.</para><para>Families face higher mortgage rates, and a significant proportion of families' income is taken up on paying mortgage rates. The goal of trying to purchase a home by young people is getting further and further out of their reach. Small businesses have difficulty raising funds and meeting repayments. When that occurs the first thing they do is reduce their number of staff. Rising debt and increasing interest rates quickly become a cycle and lead 
 to unemployment. As I have said, businesses are forced to lay off staff to keep up with the repayments of debt.</para><para>Another factor which occurs is that funds from overseas investors fuel land and price speculation, and they take these things out of the reach of ordinary Australians and again push up inflation. While inflation may give the impression of growth in wages and other benefits, this growth is illusionary as inflation is typically accompanied by high interest rates and rising prices for basic commodities like bread and milk. Successive Labor governments oversaw the cycle of debt, high interest rates, high unemployment and high inflation. I think we constantly need to remind the Australian public that under Labor the budget deficit each year was running at about $10.3 billion. That is, every year we were spending $10.3 billion more than we had, more than we were receiving in taxes. We were living off the next generation's inheritance. For grandparents who are listening, we were spending your grandchildren's money. For parents listening, we were spending your children's money. We were $10.3 billion in excess. Government debt reached $96 billion, or more than $5,000 for every Australian. Home interest rates peaked at 17 per cent, and small business interest rates reached 20.5 per cent. Unemployment climbed to 11.2 per cent, and inflation averaged 5.7 per cent.</para><para>It took the Liberal-National Party coalition to break the cycle. As announced in the federal budget of 12 May 1998, we expect to achieve a surplus of $2.7 billion for 1998-99. We also anticipate that by 2001-02 government debt will have fallen from $96 billion to $9.6 billion, representing a decline in government debt from 20 per cent of GDP to around 1.5 per cent. As I have said, when you do not have that debt, you are not paying off the interest and you can afford to do other things.</para><para>Flow-on effects from this sound financial management have seen home loan interest rates fall to 6.7 per cent, the lowest rate since—as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) constantly reminds us—man first walked on the moon. Unemployment is now well down on the rate reached under Labor, and inflation is 
 running at minus two per cent—and that is the lowest that has been seen since the sixties.</para><para>With debt having been brought under control by this government, we can now implement initiatives for the benefit of all Australians. As many of my honourable colleagues in the chamber know, one of my particular interests is in older Australians. As a result of our behaving in a financially responsible way, we have seen benefits being able to be given to people.</para><para>We have extended access to the Commonwealth seniors health card to an additional 220,000 self-funded retirees. Many of these people are on reasonably low incomes; some of them just above the pension. However, they have not been able to get benefit. So we have given them a sense of security in that, after they have purchased 52 scrips—I think it is—at $3.20, they then, like pensioners, can receive the rest of their medication for free. This is something which has been asked for by self-funded retirees.</para><para>But it was never given by the Labor Party when it was spending money willy-nilly, borrowing $10.3 billion a year—never given to those people who really wanted the security of knowing that, if they required an extensive amount of medication, it would be free after having reached a certain number of scrips. When Labor was in government, the cap was so high that it gave self-funded retirees a great degree of concern.</para><para>We have allocated $280 million to the government's staying-at-home care and support for older Australians package. Again, as we have moved around Australia talking to people, one of the things they say is, `We want choice; when we are frail and need assistance, we want the choice of either staying at home or being cared for in a residential setting.</para><para>Because we have been more frugal than the Labor Party, the other thing we have been able to do is offer gold card access to qualifying World War II veterans. This has meant the spending of about $500 million, but World War II veterans who have faced hostile forces will now be entitled to a gold card. That, I know—and I have already talked to some veterans about it—gives them a great 
 sense of comfort. But the other thing it does is take off the state bill a number of those people who would otherwise have been in public hospitals around the state, receiving public benefits from, say, dental schemes and puts them onto the Commonwealth bill. So it gives also relief to some older people who will now have space and beds in hospitals and access to dental programs which were being taken up by those veterans. So there is a double effect for the public: first, that those veterans now will be paid for; and, secondly, the spaces they may have taken up will be able to be used by others.</para><para>Education, training and job prospects for Australian young people are being improved and mutual obligation principles enhanced through a $350 million funding package. What we are saying through a lot of our policies is that there is a obligation, that we have a responsibility to care for those in need, for those who are unemployed, but that those people also have a responsibility back to the community. Many young people are responding in a very positive way to the challenge being put to them that they have a responsibility along with the rights and privileges they enjoy as members of Australian society.</para><para>The investing for growth industry statement has been announced, with $1.3 billion being allocated as part of our extensive industry reform agenda. Another $180 million has been allocated to addressing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, on top of the $1.25 billion already allocated to the National Heritage Trust by this government.</para><para>All of this is being able to be done because we have behaved in a way which is responsible, and we are not borrowing to fund these initiatives. The initiatives of previous Labor governments were undertaken with borrowed money—money borrowed from the next generation.</para><para>Today, in here, I heard Senator Cook saying, `We're going to oppose your tax reform policy because you haven't brought it to the people in time, and they should have time before an election.' He continued, `So, if you get back in, even though it might be a budgetary measure, we're going to oppose it.' Senator Murray challenged him and asked, 
 `Well, what are you going to do on the issue of tax?' Senator Cook then replied, `We're not going to tell you, and we'll tell you in good time in due course.' I believe that section ought to be taken out of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and given to a first year philosophy student for an exercise in logic. You are saying, `We're not going to support you if you get into government because you haven't released your package,' but you are saying to the Australian public, `If the Labor Party gets into government, it will be okay, but we're not going to give you the details of our tax package or any other package.'</para><para>Why should we have to give the information out any earlier than the Labor Party? The fact is that the Labor Party is demanding of the coalition more than it is prepared to give to the Australian public. This seems a very odd argument: we were going to support your tax reform; now we are not because you have not released it in time. Come out and tell us what your policies are; come out and tell us what you are going to do about tax reform. Anyway, even if the Labor Party were to tell us what they would do about tax reform, would the Australian public believe it?</para><para>I remember the 1993 budget. Mr Keating got up here and said, `I will build these personal tax cuts into l-a-w, into law.' He said, `It's not a promise; they are tax cuts written into law.' He told the Australian public that they could rely on it because it was l-a-w, law. And what happened after the election?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RD4</name.id><name role="metadata">BROWNHILL</name><name role="display">Senator Brownhill</name></talker><para>—Mr Beazley was there too.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—Mr Beazley was involved in that too—Mr Beazley and Mr Keating—`This is an l-a-w promise.' But it was b-r-o-k-e-n, broken. That was a promise that was written into law which was broken.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Not only that, they ran around telling pensioners that all pensioners would be taken out of the tax system by 1995. What hypocrisy. How terrible. Five days after that election Mr Blewett came out and said, `Oh, that was wrong; we shouldn't have had it in the policy.' How cynical. And within two years of that budget, sales tax on cars went up from 15 per cent to 22 per cent, the Medicare levy 
 went up, pharmaceutical charges went up, company taxes went up from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, wholesale sales tax—that hidden tax that you can slide up without the public knowing—went up 2 per cent, excise on petrol went up and excise on leaded petrol went up even more, which again affected the battlers because they are the ones who cannot afford new cars on unleaded petrol. So if anybody thinks that they can believe the Labor Party on taxes and tax reform, let me remind them of their record. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Prime Minister </title><page.no>3187</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3187</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I want to talk about a number of matters relating to the actions of this Prime Minister. Firstly, I want to talk about the manner in which the Howard government has gone about its waterfront strategy because that should not surprise anyone. Nor should it surprise anyone that the Prime Minister has been personally involved in this plan from day one. His involvement has been ongoing. Mr Howard ticked off this plan as it was developed from early last year. The Prime Minister is involved in everything because he trusts no one. One assumes with hindsight that the waterfront plan might be renamed `operation Titanic' because it has succeeded only in sinking the political machismo of Mr Reith and his hapless Prime Minister.</para></talk.start><para>Even in his own office he leaves nothing to chance. This is especially the case since the departure of Graham Morris. There is a simple reason for this. Within his own party this Prime Minister has always been an after-thought. He has always been the party's second or third choice as leader. A look at the Prime Minister's path to the Lodge makes this point clearly. In the lead up to the 1983 election Mr Howard saw himself as the heir apparent. But senators will recall that the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, had a very different view. Mr Fraser called Andrew Peacock the morning after the election defeat and told him he was prepared to do anything to prevent Mr Howard taking the leadership. His leader dudded Mr Howard and Andrew Peacock got the top job.</para><para>Senators will also recall that in 1985 Mr Peacock called a meeting of the party and 
 declared all leadership positions vacant. Mr Howard had been working on Mr Peacock's demise and the opposition leader decided to take the matter head on. Mr Peacock called on Mr Howard to declare he would never ever run for the leadership but Mr Howard refused—of course, he said he would never ever have a goods and services tax. So Mr Peacock pulled on a vote to force Mr Howard's hand but Mr Howard did not have the confidence to nominate; he refused to nominate. Mr Peacock was re-elected but his running mate, Mr Moore, was not. The party decided it wanted Mr Howard as deputy leader.</para><para>Senators will also recall the extraordinary scenes that followed, with Andrew Peacock declaring a vote for Howard was a vote against him and he promptly resigned. So Mr Howard, who would not throw his hat in the ring and would not even nominate after there had been a spill of positions, found himself as leader of the party. Then Mr Howard lost the leadership to Mr Peacock in 1989. Remember the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>—`Mr 14 per cent—why does he bother' The Prime Minister had another shot at the top job in 1990 but lost convincingly. He tested the water again after the 1993 election but did not have the gumption to run against John Hewson, who had just lost the unlosable election. He finally returned to the leadership position of the Liberal Party on Australia Day in 1995.</para><para>So, as I said, Mr Howard has always been the party's second or third choice and hence he trusts no one. Not only does Mr Howard not trust his ministry or his party he does not trust the Australian community. He is far more comfortable with the politics of division than the politics of consensus. It is a political strategy the Prime Minister has applied on a number of occasions. In August 1988 Mr Howard expressed the view that the number of Asians coming to this country was too great. He made this statement in the context of a debate about multiculturalism and its place in Australian society. On the ABC <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program, Mr Howard was asked:</para><para>. . . Mr Howard, is the rate of Asian immigration into Australia too fast?</para><para>Mr Howard responded:</para><para>I think there are some people who believe it is.</para><para>He was then asked what he thought and he said:</para><para>. . . I wouldn't like to see it greater . . . I do believe that if in the eyes of some in the community, it's too great, it would be in our immediate term interests, and supportive of social cohesion, if it were slowed down a little . . . </para><para>And what was his view on multiculturalism? He said that it was an aimless concept. In 1988 he was happy to take the political course of creating division within the Australian community in pursuit of his political agenda. It was a simple message: there are too many Asians coming to Australia.</para><para>In his <inline font-style="italic">Future directions</inline> document released in December of that year Mr Howard said he wanted to see `one Australia' not an Australia of individual groups. Another simple message: if you want to live in Australia you have to behave like a white European middle class heterosexual. One could be forgiven for thinking that the member for Oxley is a plagiarist.</para><para>I must add that Mr Howard was more than happy to let the member for Oxley and her motley crew run their campaign of division and bigotry. This was despite the best efforts of many—including John Laws of 2UE—to get him to speak out against her as the Prime Minister of Australia. John Laws was rightly concerned about the damage she was doing to the social fabric of this community. He wanted the Prime Minister to take a stand. John Laws asked him to act like the Prime Minister of Australia and he would not. And why, because he did not want to—he saw political benefit in remaining silent. So Ms Hanson and her acolytes parade the misnomer of one nation. It begs the question: what do we call the Howard Liberals? Half a nation?</para><para>The manner in which the Prime Minister dealt with the debate over the native title issue provides further and clear evidence that Mr Howard's approach to the Australian waterfront is true to form. On the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline> on 4 September last year the Prime Minister said that the problem with native title is:</para><para>. . . that the pendulum has swung too far in one direction, particularly after the Wik decision . . .  
</para><para>He then held up a map of Australia and said:</para><para>Let me just show your viewers . . . This shows 78 per cent of the land mass of Australia—coloured brown on the map. Now, the Labor Party and the Democrats are effectively saying that the Aboriginal people of Australia should have the potential right of veto over further development of 78 per cent of the land mass of Australia.</para><para>He then told the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>  viewers:</para><para>Now that is a very simple message. I think the Australian people will understand that message.</para><para>It was a very simple message, delivered via a map coloured brown. He was saying to the community that if we are not careful the blacks will take over the place. It was almost identical—and just as misleading—to the crude but effective campaign run by the Western Australian Chamber of Mines in the 1980s. The only difference is that their map was black, not brown.</para><para>And now the Prime Minister has turned his hand to demonising the wharfies. He has decided to be a more sophisticated person in his approach to this matter. First, he had to create the image. How was this achieved? Through his ministers he appointed Liberal pollster Mark Textor, the principal of Australasian Research Services. Mr Textor, it should be remembered, is closely associated with the technique of push polling. This first appeared on the Australian political landscape in the 1994 Northern Territory Election. Voters were asked if they would change their vote if they knew the following facts. They were then told that Territory Labor planned to introduce two sets of laws—one for blacks and another for whites. The Country-Liberal Party employed Mr Textor in the lead up to that election as a polling adviser. The Liberal Party also employed the same technique in the lead up to the Federal by-election for the seat of Canberra. Mr Textor was the pollster for the Liberal Party for the 1996 election campaign.</para><para>Last year Mr Howard, Mr Reith and Mr Sharp commissioned Mr Textor to attack not their political opponents but an industrial union. The work was channelled through the ACIL consultancy. Mr Textor then organised a number of focus groups. He showed them parts of a <inline font-style="italic">60 Minutes </inline>program and other material designed to colour their view, including edited `highlights' of an address by the 
 Secretary of the ACTU, Bill Kelty. He was paid over $40,000 for his trouble.</para><para>Despite his best efforts the waterfront and wharfies were not considered to be so-called `top the mind' issues. There was strong concern about waterfront efficiency, international competitiveness and any hindrances to exports. The Textor research was then provided to a second consultant—long time Liberal Party election strategist, Jonathon Gaul. The Gaul plan was to use the Textor research to paint the wharfies as the privileged elite—$100,000 for 14 hours a week and then they all nick off anyway. That is the sort of line we have been hearing from this government and that is the line that was created by Jonathon Gaul.</para><para>As with the Asians in 1988, the Aborigines and the Wik message, it was both simple and divisive. Madam Acting Deputy President, you would know that the average wharfie is like any other Australian worker. He has to work long hours to make ends meet. He has a family to support. And in many cases he does achieve world's best practice in his workplace. At the port of Burnie in my state, Tasmania, the waterside workers achieved an average rate, I believe, of 33 containers per hour in the week before they were dismissed. In the state of Queensland, your state, Madam Acting Deputy President, Townsville is a port of hard working and highly productive workers. What did the Prime Minister say of their fate? The Prime Minister was interviewed on <inline font-style="italic">A Current Affair </inline>two days after Chris Corrigan implemented what the government thought was the final part of its grand plan to smash the MUA. He was asked about workers in ports like Burnie and Townsville and why they were sacked along with their colleagues in Sydney and Melbourne. He said:</para><para>They are all part of the one union.</para><para>Guilty by association.</para><para>This country has changed dramatically under the leadership of John Howard. There is now mistrust in the community. There is now a high level of insecurity about what the future might bring. Mr Howard has achieved all of this in just over two years. His is already a remarkable record. I, together with many Australians, hope the legacy of this 
 Prime Minister, as Prime Minister, is a short one.</para><para>The Senate would recall that the last time Mr Howard lost his job he mocked the suggestion of a possible return by claiming that that would amount to Lazarus with a triple bypass. We now know that we have Lazarus with a triple bypass as our Prime Minister. The question that must be answered and will be answered, and in the hearts of many Australians has already been answered, is: has John Howard got the ticker for the job that he now has? The facts show that he has not.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Whistleblowing: Heiner Inquiry </title><page.no>3190</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>3190</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to talk on a matter of public interest affecting my state of Queensland that has considerable relevance to the outcome of the state election. I am referring to the shredding of the Heiner inquiry documents and further evidence that has come to light and been prominently featured in the media in recent days. All senators know that this is a matter that I have spoken on on quite a number of occasions. Indeed, I referred the matter of whether or not the Criminal Justice Commission may have given false and misleading evidence to the Senate select committee into unresolved whistleblower cases in 1995 to the Senate Privileges Committee on 5 December 1997 for further examination. In making this speech, I am not showing any disrespect to the deliberations of the Privileges Committee, but there is fresh disturbing evidence relating to the shredding that I believe this chamber and certainly the people of Queensland ought to be aware of and fully comprehend its significance.</para></talk.start><para>Before I do that, I want to put on the public record something that has personally disturbed me ever since the unresolved whistleblower cases committee tabled its report in October 1995. In that report we described the shredding as `an exercise in poor judgement'. I have given that view very careful consideration ever since and I now wish to disassociate myself from that description and suggest that it was quite inadequate. In my opinion, in light of the facts and the emerging evidence, it was a very soft political view that can no longer stand. I believe that we sent our 
 Australian community a bad signal by not facing the cold, hard facts that a so-called desirable, political objective may not always be lawful. That precise scenario is what the Howard government and Patricks may be facing in the courts in respect of the unacceptable sudden sacking of 1,400 MUA members supposedly to achieve a more efficient waterfront. I remind the Senate that Justice Wilcox said in the appeal court ruling that noble objectives cannot be achieved by ignoble means.</para><para>It has been argued that the shredding was done to protect people from suing each other over evidence given to the Heiner inquiry because of the way it was established. At first glance this looks fair enough, but standing between that objective was the lawful right of citizens to access those public records or, at the very least, to test that right in court through judicial interpretation of the relevant statute. Indeed, the known would-be litigant, Mr Peter Coyne, and his solicitor were deceived by the Crown into believing that the evidence was secure while, behind the screen of expectation that the Crown would act with the utmost probity, the documents were shredded to stop their use in that foreshadowed litigation. It is my view now that we should have taken greater consideration of the views expressed by now High Court Justice Ian Callinan QC, who represented Mr Lindeberg, that arguably the decision to shred the records seriously breached the criminal law.</para><para>In moving my motion to have the Lindeberg matter referred again to the Privileges Committee, I indicated that it appeared that what was shredded was evidence of possible child abuse. My worst fears appear to have been realised by the most extraordinary of circumstances. I refer to recent headlines in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of 25 May 1998 that former Queensland Police Commissioner Noel Newnham, a man for whom I have the greatest respect, carried out a three-day investigation for Mr Lindeberg into what was told to Mr Heiner. I remind the Senate that the current opposition leader, Mr Peter Beattie, has described the Heiner inquiry as `a spat 
 between public servants' in an attempt, I guess, to downplay its importance.</para><para>However, in his inquiry Mr Newnham found that Mr Heiner was given evidence of possible serious child abuse of detainees. He found that children as young as 10 and 12 had been handcuffed to water grates in the open air all night, with one child, who was told that snakes came out of the grate, being found the next morning with his blanket stuffed down the grate because of his fear. Others, it is alleged, were handcuffed to beds for extended periods. It is also alleged that there was inappropriate use of suppressant drugs for other than medical reasons, and that there was also psychological and physical abuse.</para><para>I want to add of course that I am not apportioning blame to anyone. That needs to be done by a proper investigation. I am indicating, however, that very serious evidence of possible abuse was given to Mr Heiner, and it was shredded. Undoubtedly, anyone accused had a right to clear their names, but the electorate also has a right to know what was going on behind those closed walls. The shredding prevented this.</para><para>Mr Newnham points out in his report that the use of excessive or unnecessary force against people in lawful custody amounts to criminal assault. He says:</para><para>In the case of minors such assaults by custodial officials, directly or indirectly, must always be regarded as extremely serious.</para><para>He further says:</para><para>. . . Australia has international treaty obligations regarding the treatment of people in custody and of children. It appears plain that officials disregarded some of those obligations.</para><para>He also said that it was an absurd notion to suggest that the Crown had to shred these documents to prevent people suing each other. I happen to agree with Mr Newnham. It is absurd to suggest that the Crown cannot handle documents containing such evidence and that its only remedy was to destroy them.</para><para>This fresh evidence obviously opens up very serious questions that, I suggest, the Privileges Committee may not be able to ignore, especially in the light of other revelations involving the CJC's handling of this 
 matter. Mr Newnham suggests that it is quite inconceivable that the Goss government would have been unaware of these allegations when deciding what to do with the Heiner documents.</para><para>But it does not stop there. It turns out that a youth worker who gave evidence to Mr Heiner on these matters has been in contact with the CJC since 1994 by phone—and as late as October 1997 in writing—wanting the CJC to investigate these matters. The CJC has dismissed his concerns, the same complaints it now wants to investigate following the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>'s pressure and the intervention of Mr Newnham. All of a sudden the CJC now has an interest in the matter. The CJC never told the Senate of these contacts, leaving us to believe that all of the Heiner witnesses were relieved to see the so-called defamatory evidence destroyed. I believe that is gross deception on the part of the CJC.</para><para>On Monday, 25 May 1998, the CJC announced that it was going to investigate these 1989-1990 complaints, after considerable media uproar. It is quite inappropriate for the CJC to come within cooee of this matter. It cannot assure anyone of its impartiality. The fact that the CJC did not see any ethical or conflict of interest barriers to its taking on the task is something of even greater concern to me, and merely confirms that the CJC has lost its plot.</para><para>I believe that the CJC is an institution which must remain in the state of Queensland. It is critical that it do so. But it is a patient that is sick. It needs to take its medicine, it needs to get well and then perhaps it can get on with the job. The problem I have is that the CJC has not told the public about its glaring ethical impediment to its involvement now and that its deception is of the highest order. It is impossible to dissociate the shredding from what was actually shredded. They are both sides of the same coin.</para><para>We have already seen what happens to other people who go to the CJC on matters associated with the Heiner inquiry, and now it is inviting more public servants to face potentially the same fate. We have seen Mr Lindeberg disgracefully ridiculed in public by the CJC over his efforts to see the truth 
 emerge. I hold a genuine fear for other people who might believe that the CJC comes to this matter with clean hands for I believe they could suffer the same fate as Mr Lindeberg. I am sorry to have to say that, but the CJC's credentials in relation to the shredding and anything to do with the Heiner inquiry are very much in doubt.</para><para>Mr Lindeberg made it quite plain in evidence to the Senate inquiry that he views the CJC's handling of his allegations as biased and contrived to obstruct the truth coming out. Mr Lindeberg's serious assertions, in my view, should be heard by the new Parliamentary Commissioner for the CJC, Ms Julie Dick SC, as soon as possible.</para><para>When this new evidence emerged in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>, the Queensland Premier, Mr Borbidge, publicly suggested that barristers Messrs Morris QC and Howard had looked at the Newnham revelations. That is quite untrue. Mr Morris QC has also dissociated himself from the Premier's comments. I must say that either the Premier was being unacceptably dismissive of them or he is so misinformed as to be out of his depth on this matter—as he is on many matters, I might add—and that is very sad indeed. The Premier further suggested that the Newnham revelations had gone to the Queensland Director of Public Prosecutions. That also is untrue.</para><para>As for Mr Beattie, he wants the CJC to look into the matter. I am afraid that is a joke, and a sick one at that. The CJC is so compromised in this affair that any investigation into the shredding and related matters, including the fresh revelations, must include the CJC's handling of the Lindeberg allegations.</para><para>Finally, the scale of the corrupt tentacles associated with the shredding is so vast and so serious that it warrants the appointment of a special prosecutor who can take and hear evidence in public under oath and prosecute where necessary. Really we can have nothing less. The system itself is on trial. This matter touches the office of Governor in Council; the office of Cabinet; the office of Crown Law; the FOI Commissioner; the Queensland audit office; the Queensland police; the CJC; senior public servants, retired and serving; a trade union; and goes as far as a credit union. The 
 time to act is long past. Justice has been delayed for too long for people like Mr Lindeberg. The Australian Democrats have continued to be the only political avenue for Mr Lindeberg to pursue justice in this matter. Both of the major parties have failed Queensland and Mr Lindeberg, and that failure continues to this day.</para><para>If we condone the shredding and ignore these recent revelations by further inaction, dithering and dodging, it will show that we have lost the plot about what a decent society means. We will have reduced ourselves to a state of ridicule and anarchy. This is above party politics. The Australian Democrats demand action to get to the truth of this matter immediately and in full.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>New South Wales Electricity Industry </title><page.no>3192</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>3192</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If ever proof were needed of just how strong a hold the union movement has over the Labor Party, one need look no further than the debacle over the attempted privatisation of the NSW electricity industry. This is a matter of public importance that I will address in this debate.</para></talk.start><para>The issues involved are immense. The Carr government claims the New South Wales industry is worth $22 billion. However, the more realistic figure puts its value at $28 billion. This valuation is more realistic because it uses current Victorian sell-off prices which have been adjusted for interest rate declines. In blunt terms, this puts the industry's worth at between 15 and 20 per cent of the state's GDP.</para><para>At present NSW has crippling debt of nearly $20 billion. That would be wiped out and the resultant interest savings of $720 million a year would go to schools, hospitals, police and other necessary services. And a report by the Australian Council for Infrastructure Development released only weeks ago says privatisation of the power industry will create about 167,000 jobs. The study, prepared by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research, also points to a 10 per cent cost saving from privatisation.</para><para>The arguments for full privatisation are therefore compelling. The reality is that, if the 
 taxpayers of New South Wales knew how much they had at risk in the New South Wales electricity industry, there would be mass demonstrations calling for its privatisation.</para><para>All of this must also be looked at in the context of the tax regime in New South Wales. Since Bob Carr came to power in 1995, the state has gone from having the lowest tax growth rate to becoming the highest taxed state in Australia. Tax revenue has risen by $2½ billion in just three years. There have been 13 tax increases, and they include three new taxes—one of which is the iniquitous land tax on people living in their own homes—that have been imposed on the people of New South Wales.</para><para>During the Carr years, government expenditure has risen unaccountably by more than 20 per cent. On top of this, Bob Carr is looking to a piecemeal sale of the power industry. Even that stalwart of the Labor Party, Graham Richardson, recognises the need to privatise the whole industry. Writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> recently, he said the coalition would go into the next election promising to sell off the power industry. Here I quote Mr Richardson:</para><para>This will enable Peter Collins, the New South Wales leader of the Opposition, to promise substantially lower electricity prices for businesses and households. He will also have the luxury of deciding how to lavish upon the electorate something like $20 billion which he will reap from carrying out the privatisation policy already espoused by Carr. There is now a competitive market for electricity in Australia and by corporatising the various entities in electricity generation and provision, New South Wales businesses are paying only 40 per cent of what they paid for electricity when Labor came to office three years ago.</para><para>This makes those entities tremendously attractive to private buyers who would vie with privately owned competitors in Victoria. They will pay top dollar and Peter Collins will promise to retire state debt, fix the schools, fix the hospitals, fix the trains, fix the buses and put police back on the streets. Against all this, Bob Carr will offer his best wishes and his hopes that this party might one day reconsider its position.</para><para>How humiliating for Mr Carr to have a Labor Party heavyweight publicly acknowledge the Premier's impotence at the hands of the unions over plans to privatise the $28 billion power industry. Although he claims his gover 
 nment is committed to a full privatisation, the latest move from his bunker this month was a half-baked plan for partial privatisation of the New South Wales electricity industry, only, of course, if his union mates agreed to it.</para><para>Under this latest proposal only the power generators would be privatised and the electricity distribution and retail companies would remain under public ownership. But how did Mr Carr arrive at this bifurcated approach? The answer is he was trying to appease his union mates, those same union mates who constantly rebuff him and put at risk huge sums of money which would help the people of New South Wales by retiring state debt and freeing up capital for infrastructure and social projects.</para><para>The latest round of privatisation talks have highlighted the power two right wing unions—the Municipal Employees Union and the Electricity Trades Union—have over the New South Wales Labor government. The plan to sell off only the three generators for $10 billion is tailor made for the right wing unions as most of their members are in the six distribution companies. What a surprise!</para><para>The New South Wales government has sought to sell off the power industry and both right and left wing unions have bluntly told Mr Carr they will not let that happen. What right they think they have to take such a position against the public interest beggars belief.</para><para>Recently, the left wing Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union broke off talks with the Carr government and walked out of meetings. They took their bat and ball and refused to play, and Mr Carr was powerless to do a thing about it. Not surprisingly, many CFMEU members are employed at the three generators. Mr Carr is unashamedly playing union politics with one of the state's great assets, its power industry.</para><para>What all this means is that New South Wales is suffering accelerating losses through the Labor Party's stubborn refusal to acknowledge the inevitability of a privatised power industry throughout the area covered by the interconnected electricity grid. A partial privatisation is a nonsense and simply will not 
 work. However, under a New South Wales coalition government there will not be this nonsense as the coalition has stated clearly and often that it will sell the power industry as a whole.</para><para>One of the primary reasons for the privatisation of the New South Wales electricity industry is to provide a capital boost for the state, as well as lower prices for consumers. The capital boost of more than $20 billion will help to retire debt and rebuild the state's economy with infrastructure projects that will also create jobs.</para><para>The real benefit is that in retiring debt, the privatisation of the electricity industry will save the New South Wales government, and therefore the people of New South Wales, $720 million in interest payments each year. That $720 million will enable the New South Wales Liberal government to make significant and lasting gains for the people of New South Wales. It will leave the state almost entirely free of debt. That means it will leave a state which future generations can enjoy without crippling taxes and other charges now being imposed upon them to pay the interest debt racked up due to years of Labor mismanagement.</para><para>So what is it that the unions object to and which tie Bob Carr's hands? The unions have thrown up the usual arguments of possible job losses and erosion of conditions as a result of the sale. Some opposition to any sale rests purely, no doubt, on so-called ideological grounds, but both objections miss the whole point. Electricity supply and generation is now a competitive business, and it will become more so.</para><para>If the New South Wales electricity generation industry is to remain competitive in the current deregulated market, it will need a substantial injection of funds to ensure it is in the race with other states. No government can really justify such an injection of taxpayers' funds and this, in itself, highlights the inevitability of privatisation.</para><para>It was the coalition government under former premiers Nick Greiner and John Fahey that first realised this and stepped in to begin the process by putting electricity transmission 
 on a commercial footing. But this has stalled because of the Carr government's impotence.</para><para>What the next coalition government will do is to privatise because New South Wales needs the money and it makes good business sense to do so. Frankly, New South Wales has come to a dead end in terms of raising new taxes, and the sale of non-core assets is the rational solution to this revenue crunch.</para><para>Also, there is no economic justification for the government to run non-core assets. There are very few utilities or services that need to be run by the government to operate efficiently and fairly and to deliver an essential service.</para><para>The notion that governments should own utilities is largely a hangover from the now defunct theory of natural monopolies. This concept refers to an industry in which technological imperatives preclude competition from smaller players or new entrants. Given that only one player could gain sufficient scale in any one market, it was thought then desirable that that player be owned by the government, which could be trusted not to exploit its position.</para><para>This is all lost on those in the Labor Party who still have their head in the sand. They fail to realise that the privatisation of the electricity industry will create a number of utilities providing competition and better service for consumers. In economic terms it makes absolutely no sense to have billions of dollars of taxpayers' money tied up in an industry that has become highly competitive since it was opened up in May last year. The fact is that the government has no say in the price of electricity, which is set by market forces. In New South Wales, the publicly owned generators and distributors compete against each other and interstate rivals to see who can deliver the cheapest power. What is happening is that, because it will not or cannot sell these businesses, the New South Wales government is unlikely to see a meaningful dividend from this industry for several years. So, while the government's dividend income from ownership diminishes, it is at risk of losing billions of dollars of shareholder value. </para><para>In a report published in <inline font-style="italic">Company Director</inline>, accountancy group KPMG writes that there is likely to be a large field of bidders, given the Victorian and other recent electricity sector sales. But it warns that there are unique risks, and questions how long the current situation of oversupply is sustainable in the market. In other words, the time to act is sooner rather than later. This is the point of my speech today. This is highlighted by the recent United Energy float in Victoria, which closed three times oversubscribed. Significantly, the blueprint for the United Energy privatisation closely resembles that outlined by consultants Deutsche Morgan Grenfell to the committee of inquiry last year into the sale of New South Wales power assets. The Carr government could have and should have acted then.</para><para>Separately, a KPMG analyst said that the longer the government waited to sell the power industry, the greater the risks involved as the assets depreciated, and international interest could weaken. He said also that the longer the government waited, the greater the drain on the state's economy through interest payments on unpaid debt.</para><para>What the unions refuse to realise is that the window of opportunity to sell power utilities at huge prices is limited. One reason for the high prices being commanded at present is that there is intense overseas interest in the electricity industry. Adding to their high value are low interest rates and high market valuations. The shareholders are benefiting. For instance, AGL, which now owns Victoria's Solaris distributor, has seen its share price surge from $8 to $12.65 in just six months. That is a price-earning multiple change from 3.7 times to 21.7. Utility stocks are on a roll across the share market, trading at a valuation multiple above ordinary industrial stocks.</para><para>But this will not last forever. When the New South Wales coalition government is elected in March 1999, as it surely will be, one of its first priorities will be to deliver to the people of New South Wales the benefits from a full privatisation of the electricity industry. It will also enable the people of New South Wales to share in the bonanza by becoming shareholders in utilities. All that is being denied to them now, during this twilight 
 period when the unions have decided to refuse their neighbours and their families the benefits to be had. Not even Mr Carr can manage to backflip on this one, and present and future generations of people in New South Wales will only continue to be adversely affected.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Information Superhighway</title><page.no>3195</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>3195</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In <inline font-style="italic">Sleepers, Wake!</inline> , the Hon. Barry Jones, MP, a former Labor minister for science and technology, wrote that capital, land and labour, the three factors of production, have been joined by a fourth: knowledge. Information and knowledge are the empowering tools of today's society but, as my colleague puts it: is this information a free good? If so, what levels of responsibility should government take in providing an accessible information superhighway as opposed to a tollway? As knowledge and information are integral factors in production, control over the carriers of information becomes increasingly paramount to our future. If information is a right, then access to the information highway should be freely available and affordable to everybody.</para></talk.start><para>By contrast, there are those, like this government, that believe information is a private or commercial commodity that should be sold or licensed. Whilst there are sectors that can legitimately apply an added value in the transmission, it can be said that what we are dealing with here is something that is a resource to this country as opposed to a consumer commodity. By ceding control to the corporate sector the government is, in effect, selling off one of the means by which all Australians can enter and participate in the electronic society.</para><para>Fair and equitable participation in this new paradigm of communications and information sharing is something that Labor holds true to its philosophies and principles, but something that remains very distant from the philosophies being espoused by the government. As the Howard government begins the process of selling off the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, it is fundamentally important that we assess information technologies not only to find out 
 where they are taking us but also to analyse who is being left behind.</para><para>One of the largest groups marginalised in the IT revolution and changes to the information and communication paradigm are rural and remote Australians. If you live off the main road then you are literally out of sight and out of mind of this government. Likewise, the information superhighway is bypassing anyone not connected to the main road. Rural people know only too well what it is to be forgotten. The decline in rural banking services is just one example. One in three major bank branches in rural areas closed between 1993 and 1996, rendering 600 rural communities without access to proper financial institutions.</para><para>Rural residents do not have the same access to support structures that metropolitan citizens enjoy. They must survive without the networks that underpin city life. If you live on a remote or distant property you do not have the same sort of access to support or help to manage your computer's file management problem or if your hard drive crashes. There generally are no local training courses, localised help desks or even computer stores that can offer sales and post-purchase service that the rest of us can access quite freely.</para><para>Unfortunately, it is not just rural residents who are unable to ride the superhighway. Older Australians, Australians with a socioeconomic disadvantage and, in particular, Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are in a similar boat. Statistically, we know, as a result of an ABS survey late last year, that these factors are significant in explaining the inequities to access to the new information technologies. About 60 per cent of Australians on rural and remote settlements are Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, and their telecommunication needs are not being addressed.</para><para>I recently came across a report that reaffirmed that rural Australians need a world-class telephone system. But they also need world-class television, radio, fax and e-mail services and a quality postal service just to remain a part of society, to have current and relevant connections with society. I know many rural people will laugh at this, but many 
 of them are struggling because they are still struggling just to have a standard telecommunications or telephone service. E-mail and the Internet are pipedreams at the moment. Yet the Internet and enhanced information services can deliver essential information about their primary industry, the weather reports, legal services, the stock market and new product and marketing opportunities.</para><para>With the recent developments in electronic commerce, being on-line means overcoming the lack of commercial and retail services that rural communities and small towns cannot offer. This in turn introduces a whole range of social challenges and regional economic issues that will have to be confronted. To ignore the ramifications of some of these changes in this context is certainly at the government's peril. The principle goal of any government should be to ensure that rural consumers and rural citizens have the same telecommunications and information services as city residents.</para><para>One of the more interesting developments in this area is the current pricing regimes between the carriers providing Internet services to rural areas compared to metropolitan areas. I watched with interest the pricing disadvantage that currently exists between the two groups in this country, and relate it back to how those rural people are, on the one hand, being encouraged quite stridently by government to participate in this new on-line revolution but, at the same time, the government is choosing to ignore the means that they have at their fingertips to ensure price equity and access equity to the services.</para><para>We often hear too from this government about its commitment to small business. The recent electronic commerce summit here in Canberra highlighted access issues for small business, particularly those in rural and regional areas. The pricing inequities that currently exist between the two metropolitan areas and the rural areas show that Telstra at that time provided a significant disadvantage to rural consumers. I note with interest in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that Telstra's Internet product, Big Pond, has joined the rush to provide flat rate Internet access. This is quite an intriguing development, given that the 
 major carriers and certainly the major providers of ISPs moved away from flat rate Internet access quite early on in the development of that market on the basis that industry analysts and their own economics in providing that service demonstrated that that was unviable in the long term.</para><para>So what do we see now? We see, once again, competition perhaps playing a role in the provision of these flat rate services, given that another provider of Internet services, OzEmail, instituted the same regime just recently. What we have in two major metropolitan areas is a response from Telstra to a move by OzEmail to instigate, once again, a flat rate Internet access pricing package. What we do not see is a rural centre being offered the same service or the same pricing regime. What we do not see are those non-competitive areas in this country getting offered a cut-price or discount regime or access to the Internet.</para><para>What we do see are the metropolitan areas that are well serviced, that have a profit margin that is worth it for these private companies to actually pursue market share and to extract a profit from, being the sole beneficiaries of the competitive pressures that are existing. What is happening is that rural and remote Australians do not even get subjected to the competitive pressures that could lower the costs that are currently being imposed on them for Internet access.</para><para>I also note with interest media speculation on this specific area, where it talks about the contemplation by the government of enhancing the regulatory regime to actually ensure that somehow the services are maintained to rural and remote Australia. This comes back to quite a powerful contradiction that is underpinning or, I suppose, upstaging to a large degree the government's whole rhetoric about their move to full privatisation of the carrier Telstra.</para><para>The government cannot guarantee the delivery of adequate services, either on the Internet or even in telecommunications generally, to rural and regional Australia without enhancing the regulatory framework to enforce it. Why? Competitive pressures do not exist where there is no profit to be made out 
 of a given market. Because Australia is such a big place, there are several areas in this country which will never make money on behalf of a carrier, an Internet service provider or anybody else.</para><para>How will the government put pressure on the various Internet service providers, for example, to lower their costs for those regional subscribers? How will they ensure that OzEmail, Big Pond or regional ISPs actually want to compete in rural and remote communities? The fundamental flaw in the government's plan is that that will not happen. The only way it can deliver a base level of service is to regulate and to provide for compliance measures and, hopefully, penalties that will stick.</para><para>To go back to the earlier points I made about inequities between rural communities and metropolitan communities, and the value of knowledge and information in our society: we have a grave situation emerging where the information poor and the information rich will be divided, not just along socioeconomic lines, but along geographical lines as well. At a time when we on this side of the chamber are so mindful of these widening disparities, these social inequities, we have a government that consistently ignores the structural ramifications of its policies in relation to privatisation and to playing with the regulatory structures in regard to competition policy.</para><para>All of these arguments lead to a fairly straightforward message. The existence of information rich and information poor, and the widening gap between the two, is not an argument in itself against the privatisation of public assets. But the implications of that policy extend far beyond economic considerations and public and private revenues. They extend far beyond a comparative benefit to shareholders or potential shareholders, and the public interest. What they go to is how we will cohesively, as a society, progress and develop—how we will cohesively take advantage of the information revolution, this new paradigm that we are already embracing but that many Australians have no opportunity to participate in.</para><para>To deal with these issues in isolation is to deliver the largest proportion of Australians 
 to exclusion from these developments and changes. This, obviously, is an act of gross negligence on the part of this government. We have seen so many examples of efforts on their part to demonstrate to the Australian community that in some way they have tapped into the information revolution.</para><para>We saw a very belated establishment of the National Office of Information Economy. It is now struggling to play catch-up with critical issues that have been affecting other economies in other countries for a number of years. We see a conference on electronic commerce come over two years into the government's term. Was it preceded by a conference on the social implications of this information revolution? Was it preceded by a conference on just what it meant to be excluded from the information revolution? No, straight to the business aspect, straight to the economic angle.</para><para>Unless this government puts people first in its consideration of information technology matters, these inequities will only increase. It is an imperative. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.57 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>3198</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment Services</title><page.no>3198</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3198</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Ellison, Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training.

There is no requirement to issue a new passport in a couple of working days. The minister could have waited a couple of months and considered the matter properly. This was a sensitive matter. A passport alert had been issued. Thousands of Australians had lost their money and a minister is entitled—indeed, obligated—to give the matter proper consideration.

Mr Evans could have and should have given the matter better consideration.</para><para>Secondly, former Senator Evans and Senator Bolkus have been out there claiming that section 7 of the Passports Act in effect only allows a minister to refuse a passport if a warrant has been issued for the arrest of the applicant. Now, that is just not true. They 
 failed to mention section 7D of  the Passports Act. Senator Bolkus failed to distribute section 7D to the media, which entitles a minister to refuse to issue a passport if somebody already has a valid one, unless there are special reasons.</para><para>Mr Skase had a valid passport on which he could have travelled back to Australia, but of course Mr Skase told everybody he was too sick to travel.

Mr Downer cancelled Mr Skase's passport. Why didn't Mr Evans do the same?

The meeting was once again an opportunity to speak frankly about the issues confronting the gold industry at this time and develop joint strategies to address these issues. The meeting heard of the gold low price and some uncertainty, particularly in respect of Korea, which is placing substantial pressure on exploration and new supply.</para></talk.start><para>There was also general acknowledgment of the need for targeted consultation on a number of key issues. By far the most significant issue raised was the effect of native title and their palpable anger with the Labor Party. For example, in Western Australia the average time now taken for the grant of a mining lease is more than double that of 1994-95 and many of the applications have now been outstanding for more than two years. Delays in granting exploration titles are being experienced across the whole country, particularly Queensland, Western Australia and parts of New South Wales. They place an enormous burden on the nation. They increase costs to industry, costs to government and administration, and costs arising from court actions. The bottom line is they cost jobs. 	Again, in Western Australia over 4,000 mining lease applications cannot be granted because they are held up in the native title process, while in Queensland there are 700 applications for exploration permits and over 400 applications for mining titles currently held up as a result of the Native Title Act and the Wik decision. Yet, the Labor Party continues to frustrate the government's sensible and fair proposals for amendments to the Native Title Act. This has not gone un-noticed in the community. Writing in the latest annual report, Mr Ryan, the President of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies—which, I might remind the Senate, represents the battlers in the industry—made a statement which sena 
 tors will want to listen to, particular the Western Australians. He said:</para><para>The federal Labor opposition has lost its way on native title and has been remarkably recalcitrant in addressing the nation's interests, rather than matters of ideology and short-term political gain.</para><para>Labor is also speaking with forked tongue. It cannot be trusted. Last year, Senator Crane and I went to Kalgoorlie, but just before we arrived there, guess who was there? Mr Beazley and Mr Smith were there and do you know what they told the miners? They said they could relax because they were going to support our native title amendments. That is what the miners told us. What hypocrisy. They either misled the miners or they were rolled by the left, Senator Faulkner.</para><para>Madam President, do you know what they have done in Queensland because there is a state election on? They have told their shadow ministers that any statements on native title will have to be cleared through Wayne Swan.

I also pointed out that the governors of the BBC state that the new charter has more specific provisions relating to the governors' responsibility—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Are you going to amend the charter?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

I also pointed to the national media archive, which is an experiment in Canada which I think does provide a very sensible basis for trying to achieve some objectivity of measurement.</para><para>It was a very important meeting. The government is very much committed to ensuring that the ABC is strong, independent, balanced and impartial. I note that the Friends of the ABC think that the ALP has been silent and has avoided a commitment to the ABC since the 1980s. That is what they say in their newsletter when they point out that Senator Schacht has remained particularly quiet. All I can say is that we are very committed to ensuring that we have the best possible outcomes. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3209</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask a supplementary question, Madam President.

As I said, it was lodged on 30 March, some 59 days ago. It is one day short of being double the time provided for under the standing order. It is also an important question because it goes to possible breaches of Mr Howard's ministerial code of conduct and the code laid out in the cabinet handbook by the Minister for Resources and Energy, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Trade. To quote the cabinet handbook:</para><para>Ministers at meetings of the Ministry, Cabinet and Committees, must declare any private interests held by themselves or members of their immediate family in matters under immediate discussion where those interests conflict or might conflict with their public duty as Ministers.</para><para>It continues:</para><para>Ministers should adopt a broad interpretation of the requirement that they take into account the interests of family members and all the interests of their own in considering whether there is a conflict or a potential or apparent conflict which should be declared. General declarations should be made in all cases where an interest exists which could not be said to be shared with the rest of the community.</para><para>It seems that Mr Anderson read the handbook when he became a minister. When he was interviewed on the ABC's <inline font-style="italic">Countrywide</inline>  program in early May 1996, he said he would absent himself from both the discussions and votes of cabinet where the matters being considered could place him in a conflict of interest. Let me quote exactly what Mr Anderson said. He said:</para><para>I think my requirement is that I satisfy the Prime Minister and Cabinet that there is no conflict of interest and in any particular situation that might arise where a decision has to be made then I can declare my interest. I would always do that and if necessary refrain from debate and even voting. 
</para><para>Former Senator Collins, who was pursuing the matter at that time, asked whether or not Mr Anderson, as a farmer, would receive a rebate under the diesel fuel rebate scheme. In reply, Senator Parer said that Minister Anderson was a farmer and, as a result, he would get the normal diesel fuel rebate that applies to rural producers.</para><para>But did Mr Anderson absent himself from the expenditure review committee and the cabinet deliberations on the future of the diesel fuel rebate scheme? He did not. In a press release issued on 13 August 1996, Senator David Brownhill, the then parliamentary secretary to Mr Anderson, welcomed the announcement of the retention of the diesel fuel rebate. Senator Brownhill said:</para><para>I know the persuasive arguments put to the ERC by the National Party Deputy Leader, John Anderson, and his role in ensuring the scheme retention cannot be overemphasised.</para><para>In a press release dated the same day, Mr Anderson said:</para><para>I have consistently argued the case for the DFRS.</para><para>Madam President, the diesel fuel rebate scheme is not an interest that is shared by the whole community. It is a benefit available to a relatively small sector of the community, including Mr Anderson, Mr Fischer, Mr McLachlan and Senator Parer.</para><para>The question on notice that the government has had before it for 59 days asks what financial benefit these ministers—who were all in the cabinet room arguing for the retention of the diesel fuel rebate scheme—received. The Senate and the public have a right to know. The public record shows that Mr Anderson breached the cabinet guidelines by participating in a cabinet debate where there was a clear conflict of interest. I will be interested to hear whether Mr Fischer, Mr McLachlan and Senator Parer ignored the rules as well. I note that I am to receive an answer by the end of this week. I await that answer with great anticipation. The commitment has been made that I will get it this week.

They had a contract which commenced on 21 August and concluded on 3 October, and received for that the principal sum of $151,375. As at 12 November we were told that by Dr Feeney. But he did say at that time that he had not received all of the invoices; there were a few to come. We were 
 told that the Corrs Westgarth contract was worth $89,956.28 and the Webb contract had a return value of $23,871. What did BGC Media get?—$8,857.3. The contract with the National Institute of Labour Studies returned them $15,375 exactly.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The process involved in letting those contracts was far from normal, as senators would recall. It was highly unusual to let one contract not through the proper tender process but simply at the direction of a minister. But as Dr Feeney told us, the Department of Transport was directed by the then Minister for Transport, Mr Sharp, to engage Dr Webster because that was what he was told to do. Then, apparently, Dr Webster was given authority to hire anyone he liked, and Mr Sharp, of course, was going to pay for this.</para><para>I want to quote from Dr Feeney's evidence at the estimates hearings because this is an important point. When I asked about the contracts that were let at the request of Dr Webster and whether they were let specifically at his request, the answer was: `Yes'. When I asked whether this was at the direction of the minister's office, the answer was: `Yes'. He also added that the approvals were subject to the minister's office approving them. So Dr Feeney said that Dr Webster told the department who he wanted, and the department signed them up.</para><para>Senators would be aware that originally Dr Webster had been employed as a subcontractor to David Trebeck under the ACIL consultancy. Apparently they did not get on so he refused to work with this former Liberal Party policy director. He was able to get one of his friends, a Mr Peter Wilson, who worked in Mr Reith's office, to organise a contract of his own. That led to a payment to Dr Webster of $95,000. Dr Webster then organised a contract for one of his old colleagues, Dr Davies, and he received $96,000. It is nice to have friends in high places.</para><para>So there was no tender process for all this money to be paid out. He just picked who he wanted. The department was required, at the direction of the minister's office, to sign them up and to put them on the payroll. So it is doubly important in this case that there be proper scrutiny of exactly how this consul 
 tancy money was spent. Given that this money has been spent, we also ought to be able to look at the process and see that proper process was not followed in the appointment of these consultants.</para><para>The Senate and the community do have a legitimate right to be satisfied that a million dollars worth of taxpayers' money was spent on what the contracts required them to be spent on. We also have the right to be satisfied that we, as taxpayers, got our money's worth out of these deals. That is what question No. 1118 goes to.</para><para>In relation to all of these consultancies, and any others we do not yet know about, we want to know the details of each contract. We want to know whether there was an actual written report. If there was a report, we want to know how comprehensive it was. We want to know what the subject matter was so that we can be satisfied that the terms of that contract have been met. We also want to know what happened with each of the reports that arose from the consultancies. Lastly, we want to know what the final cost was.</para><para>We have already been provided with information about contract costs in these matters, but there now appears to be some confusion over the costs given to the Senate to date. The minister, I am sure, would be aware that the proposed cost of the first ACIL report—the ACIL 1 report as it is being called—was to be $60,000. We have been told that that blew out to $80,000. Now we find, in response to another question on notice—the answer to which appears in the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 14 May—that the cost of the ACIL 1 contract is now out to $118,761. It is about double the original estimate, and $40,000 more than the so-called final cost that we were given.</para><para>In relation to the Minter Ellison consultancy, we were told last November that its cost was about $151,000. That there were a few invoices for some minor costs still outstanding was the codicil added to that response. The estimates committee was then provided with an answer on notice advising that the final Minter Ellison cost was $158,283. Then we received another final costing for that contract and it had gone up to 
 $162,567. It is clear that it is in the public interest that the minister provide the Senate with the amounts of money spent on all these contracts. It is also clear that in the public interest the cost of any other consultancies and the nature of those consultancies—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Madam President, I take a point of order.

Again, those are matters of legitimate public interest.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want now to go to the question of Minister Reith and his actions in refusing to answer question No. 1129. The cost to the taxpayer for the employment of Dr Webster and Dr Davies was something approaching $200,000. Dr Webster's consultancy ran from 30 July to 3 October but we are told he commenced work before that date. He was paid $1,000 a day and in addition he was paid expenses.</para><para>The contract with Dr Davies commenced on the same day as that of Dr Webster; that is, on 30 July. He apparently received the same daily rate and apparently the terms of reference for both consultants were the same, but Dr Webster was the leader and Dr Davies was the assistant. We also know that, in addition to the $1,000 a day consultancy fee, there 
 were other costs including travel costs and incidentals. We are also able to know that Dr Davies paid his bills and was reimbursed while Dr Webster submitted invoices. We know that the payment of incidentals was subject to a review by the department. In fact, we do know that Dr Feeney personally vetted these claims.</para><para>So the information sought by question 1129 was clearly in the knowledge of the Department of Transport and Regional Development and is now, I assume, still with Dr Feeney, but in the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business. I believe that the Senate is entitled to be satisfied that the money paid out to the two consultants was properly spent. The money was paid by the department of transport because it was directed to do so by the minister. After Mr Sharp was directed by Mr Reith to engage Dr Webster he was told by ministerial staffer Mr Wilson to sign the contract.</para><para>Question 1129 asks the minister to provide all invoices that relate to these contracts, because that is the only way the Senate can be properly satisfied that this money has been properly spent. The question also seeks information about the relationship with the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business. As the Senate was told on the last occasion I raised this matter, I do not chase answers to questions on notice in every case when the time elapses that is allowed under standing orders for the question to be answered. I do so when the matter is important.</para><para>I believe I have demonstrated that this matter is important. There is a significant amount of information which is clearly available to the department and can be provided. As I indicated earlier, these questions have been outstanding for 57 and 49 days respectively. There is no good reason why the answer should be withheld from the Senate. In terms of providing the information, it is clearly information which the department must have in order to have been able to pay these moneys and there can be no good reason advanced as to why the questions should not have been answered. Hence, I propose in my motion that the minister be directed to table his answers tomorrow, 
 because there is no good reason why he should not be able to do so.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">LIGHTFOOT</name><name role="display">Senator Lightfoot</name></talker><para>—Madam President, I take a point of order.

I would have thought, with respect, that this is a matter of substance and that it would be appropriate to give some clarification for the benefit of all senators in the future. I do not seek that clarification today.

It is clear that the issue of tax reform will be a central element at the forthcoming federal election. Tax reform, of course, encompasses a range of issues: the GST; the appropriate mix between tax on income and tax on expenditure; the role of tax in savings policy; and the role of tax as a driver or initiator of change 
 in the productive side of our economy. Equally, levels of taxation for individuals, corporate entities and other legally sanctioned arrangements such as trusts should, and one presumes will, be part of that overall debate—in that context, the future role of trusts is part of the continuing debate. There is nothing magic about trusts—nothing new. Family trusts have become a very popular tax minimisation device in this country in the last eight or nine years.</para></talk.start><para>The previous government was moving to eliminate many of those artificial and contrived arrangements when it was derailed by the previous opposition in late 1995. The current government went a small way to eliminating some of those abuses with the Taxation Laws Amendment (Trust Loss and Other Deductions) Bill of late 1997 and early 1998, but it did not seek to remedy the critical problems in trusts, and two defects spring readily to mind. Firstly, trusts, properly structured and utilised, can be used to minimise tax exposure, particularly for those who earn a substantial part of their income from investments. Secondly, hundreds of thousands of people have sought to use family trust arrangements to change their tax profile. All too often people simply use the establishment of family trusts as a device to alter their status as PAYE taxpayers and hence enjoy the lower tax regime enjoyed by trusts.</para><para>This avoidance, minimisation, re-arrangement—call it what you will—naturally has a serious impact on government and its role in the community. It inevitably leads to arguments about the appropriate tax mix, the breakdown of the tax system, haemorrhaging of the tax system. This, in turn, is used as justification by the government parties, the corporate sector and elements of the welfare lobby for the introduction of new and additional taxes on consumption. It is a very simple equation that is put in this debate: middle and high income earners use trusts to reduce tax payments; the scale of such use is sufficient to imperil the existing taxation system; to maintain the integrity of the new system we impose a new tax, a GST on consumption; and finally, everyone is treated 
 equally because all goods and services are taxed equally at point of sale.</para><para>What is so bad, so offensive and so inequitable about this trust/GST mix is the wholesale transfer of tax liability and tax responsibility from high income earners—high net worth individuals; those with significant income producing assets—to those at the bottom end of the food or taxation chain. When redistribution occurs, there is indeed a progressive tax system, but it is the reverse of common understanding. The redistribution is from low and middle earners to high income earners. For want of a better description, it is a perversion.</para><para>Who are today's low income earners, we ask? Low skilled workers, many single income families, many single income parents, welfare and pension recipients, casual and part-time employees. All of these groups currently spend 100 per cent of their income on consumption. Net household debt, figures suggest, is approaching 200 per cent of income through borrowing. The government proposal is to whack these people with another tax—a GST on every dollar they spend—and in one fell swoop reduce their disposable income by 10 per cent, 12 per cent or 15 per cent via the GST. Why? Because so many hundreds of thousands of individuals use trusts to alter their tax liability. They alter it so much, we are told, that the future of the entire taxation system is in peril. Because so many do not pay a share—their fair and equitable share—the system haemorrhages and insufficient revenue is received by government to fund necessary government purposes, and because of that we have to re-jig the whole system. Deliberate evasion, deliberate minimisation, avoidance through family trusts—now in excess of 300,000 or 400,000.</para><para>(Time expired)</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3234</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak to the motion moved by Senator Conroy in respect of answers to questions without notice. I found it quite amazing that Senator Cook and other Labor Party senators would ask questions of Senator Kemp on cracking down on tax avoidance because, as you would 
 know through your own experience in our time in opposition, the Labor Party seemed to speak a lot about cracking down on tax avoiders. Every time they tried to say how they were going to balance some future budget—something that they were singularly unsuccessful in doing in 10 out of 13 years in government—they would have this sort of magic pudding, called `the cracking down on tax avoidance magic pudding.' They were always saying, `Somehow we will balance our budget by cracking down on tax avoiders.'</para></talk.start><para>Labor were very unsuccessful because they were either lazy or incompetent in government. They always spoke about cracking down on tax avoidance and now, in opposition, they are saying, `We would have got around to doing that in the 14th year,' and `Look at the legislation we brought in in the dying minutes.' It was not even five minutes to midnight. As you would recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that legislation was brought in at about 30 seconds to midnight, just before they were turfed out of office.</para><para>You have to look at Labor's record on tax reform and attacking tax avoidance; they really did nothing. They talk about trusts, and Senator Bishop from the state of Western Australia has said that these trust structures became very popular over the last eight, nine or 10 years. I remind him that, even though he may not have been a part of the previous government, the Labor Party was in power for all of that decade, and that during that time they did not do anything about trusts—not in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 or even 1990. They did not do anything about them in 1991 or, as I recall, in 1992. In 1993, as I said, at 30 seconds to midnight in December, they said, `Oh, all of a sudden we've got this bill.' The bill, of course, was too little and too late as far as the Labor Party's credibility on tax reform is concerned.</para><para>Can I say what the Labor Party's concept of tax reform really is? It is well and truly on the record. The Australian people do need to understand what Labor means when they talk about tax reform. It is very hard for Labor to get a policy up because every now and then one of their spokespeople will raise a policy and have it quickly knocked off because they 
 realise that it has not been discussed or because suddenly it is unpopular.</para><para>Labor's form over the years is well documented in terms of the new taxes they brought in. They promised not to tax capital gains, and of course they taxed them. They promised no changes to the tax system and no increases, and they had this trifecta or whatever it was—that tax would not increase as a proportion of GDP. But they drove it from 22 per cent up to 27 per cent in a short time and still managed, with all of the tax increases, to continue increasing the deficit.</para><para>Labor's records on deficits, tax and interest rates go hand in hand. They drove deficits up. Their record on deficits averaged $12.2 billion in current dollar terms. This was not for one, two or three years; the Labor Party in government ran $12.2 billion deficits for 10 years out of 13. The average deficit that Labor ran was $12.2 billion. It is a remarkable achievement.</para><para>Labor Party people may wonder why they get tagged as the high interest rate, high deficit, high tax party. It is because they have got so much form. If you had the sort of form that these people had on deficits, interest rates and taxes, you could pick them in every race. You would not have to get the form guide out; you would not have to get advice from anyone; you would not have to go around and talk to other punters, the trainers and jockeys. You would say, `These guys are absolute, guaranteed winners in the race for high interest rates, high debt, high inflation and high taxes every single time they enter the race.'</para><para>Senator Faulkner wants carbon taxes and environmental taxes; other Labor people want bed taxes—Premier Carr has already introduced that. The jobs levy was a beauty, a really good idea—let's put a levy on jobs. Brian Howe wants polluter pays and congestion taxes; Wayne Swan wants some luxury taxes; Lindsay Tanner wants inheritance taxes; Martin Ferguson wants more wealth taxes; and Gareth Evans says `let's have some higher taxes.' They are very good on taxes; they increase taxes massively. They had the biggest deficits in Australian history and, as we know, they had the highest interest rates 
 in Australian history. They really have nowhere to go.

There are also some significant limitations to the report. It was commissioned in December 1996 and finalised in April 1997, it does not therefore reflect the current position of jurisdictions. The report also limited its examination of the level of compliance of jurisdictions with the National Agreement on Firearms Control to State and Territory legislation in place 
 at the time, however some legislation was not yet completed and further amendments to legislation were foreshadowed.</para><para>The report does not consider any administrative practices or procedures that jurisdictions had put into place as part of their implementation of the National Agreement on Firearms Control. There are also a number of omissions in the report, which combined with current administrative practices, present a very different level of compliance by some jurisdictions. Given these issues, the complexity and lack of direct comparability of firearms legislation in each of the States and Territories, this report should not be seen as a definitive statement.</para><para>It is relevant to note that the Prime Minister intended to raise the issue of State and Territory compliance with the National Agreement on Firearms Control at the Premiers' Conference on 20 May 1998. However abandonment of that meeting by the States and Territories has resulted in a number of initiatives being pursued.</para><para>In March, the Government amended the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations to further restrict the importation into Australia of semi-automatic firearms.

This amendment proposes to the Senate that the reporting date be 23 June in order to enable the Senate to have the opportunity to debate this bill this session.</para><para>This bill does contain a number of amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which were recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in a report it made on the 1996 election nearly 12 months ago. That report was handed down on 16 June last year. Of course, the proposals in the report were thoroughly debated by that committee in the lead-up to the tabling of that report and have been in the public arena now 
 for nearly 12 months. In the two-and-a-bit years since the previous election, these matters have been debated thoroughly, have been in the public arena and have been debated by all the parties represented in this chamber. As I said, the committee's recommendations have been in the public arena for all of that time.</para><para>The government does not really see, in light of those facts, any real need for this bill to go to a committee, but we accept that that is sought by at least one party in the chamber and therefore it will occur. We do think the reporting date should be relatively soon. All these matters have been on the public agenda for quite some time and we think 23 June is an appropriate reporting date for a legislation committee. That will ensure that there is the opportunity, time permitting, for the bill to be considered by the Senate in this session. I commend that amendment to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>3242</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I oppose this amendment and take this opportunity to briefly address the Senate on the question before the chair and the very much related issue of the motion that stands in the name of Senator Ian Campbell to propose to exempt this particular bill from the provisions of standing order 111. I think it might save the Senate some time if I try to briefly address both of those issues and indicate that the opposition, for its part, will not support the cut-off motion for this bill. It might save debate on that particular motion to make a contribution at this point because, of course, this is the related issue of the reporting date of the committee on the <inline ref="s162">Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>We do not accept the paltry arguments that the government puts forward in relation to the urgency for this bill. We wonder why, if it is so urgent, it has taken so long for this particular piece of legislation to come before us. I think that this bill contains some measures that are highly politically partisan and they are, in the view of the opposition, motivated by an attempt to gain clear political advantage before the calling of an election—hence the rush by the government to deal with this 
 particular matter in this session of the parliament.</para><para>We have made it very clear that some of the provisions of this bill—like, for example, the proposal to increase from $1,500 to $10,000 the amount above which a donor to a political party must furnish a return for the financial year—are not acceptable to the opposition. Of course, it is the Labor Party in this country that has led the charge in relation to improved disclosure laws. We cannot accept the proposal of the government to increase from $1,500 to $5,000 the amount received from a person or an organisation that political parties are required to disclose during a financial year. Again, we think this is very much a retrograde step and very much against the spirit of what the Labor Party has long embraced in relation to disclosure.</para><para>We are particularly concerned about the issue of the Greenfields Foundation, which is not adequately addressed either in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  or in any proposed government amendments to that bill. We view this use by the Liberal Party of the Greenfields Foundation to launder funds as one of the most serious breaches of the spirit and letter of the funding and disclosure regulations that we have seen. It is up there with the Liberal's use of the Free Enterprise Foundation. Sadly, this bill does not do anything to address this very important issue. We are concerned that the government has been complicit in allowing this rort to exist, and we intend to pursue—and pursue very vigorously indeed—amendments to ensure this multimillion dollar loophole in relation to the loan from the Greenfields Foundation is no longer able to be exploited by the Liberal Party before, during and beyond the next election.</para><para>We think that there are some very important issues here. Many of them are very politically sensitive. We think they come to the Senate with, unfortunately, the motivation being an attempt at partisan and serious political advantage on the part of the Liberal Party. We think this requires far more mature consideration. When you are going to change the electoral laws so significantly in a country like Australia, by and large, it should receive 
 a fair degree of bipartisan support. That is the spirit with which the Labor Party is approaching these issues, and that is why we oppose the amendment that has been moved by Senator Minchin and will not be supporting the proposal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>3243</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have concerns about this legislation as well, particularly the components of the legislation which pass on information details of electors, including their date of birth and salutation—the title they use—to members of parliament, to senators and to registered political parties.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">CAMPBELL</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Campbell</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order.

When and how the committee deliberates on that is important to me. It is important to me because these are matters of fundamental, democratic rights. In particular, there is a need for us to ensure that prisoners are well placed to come back into civil society. We are not talking here about axe murderers; we are talking about prisoners who have short-term sentences up to five years. People who are imprisoned for more than five years already have the right to vote taken away from them. I do not think it is good legislation for the government to be moving to strike all prisoners off the roll because it believes that that is going to give it a voting advantage or for whatever other reason it might have.</para><para>I am also concerned about the move to make it more difficult for the public to peruse who gives money to political parties and who 
 is, therefore, influencing political parties through their donations because this raises the donation level which is required for reporting when people make donations to political parties. It is very important legislation. It does need proper scrutiny. I and the Greens have considerable concerns about the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>3243</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to foreshadow an amendment but I have not yet had a chance to put it in writing.

That is one of the reasons I want to reconsider some aspects of this bill. It is not true to portray this as a necessarily bad bill.

I hope that you are not going to try to get that through a cut-off 
 motion this session, because it is quite a remarkable figure. It is in some ways linked, because you always look for all the electoral reform that is being brought in. I found that figure of $45 million fascinating, because it is basically saying that political parties over those three years will receive donations of beyond $100 million. If you take what the company tax rate is and you take what the personal tax rate is and try to average it out, bearing in mind that some donors already giving money will benefit from it, over three years something like an extra $80 million will float into the political process. I hope that is not a start to say that we will do that rather than public funding, because that would lead to a very inequitable position.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>JX4</name.id><name role="metadata">MINCHIN</name><name role="display">Senator Minchin</name></talker><para>—Your members on the committee agreed to this.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Yes, they did.

 more extensive reporting date and actually get the job done than to get a quick reporting date.

In cases where there is not unanimous agreement on such motions, the opposition will not be agreeing to formality. We take the view that foreign policy motions should not be decided without debate. Our position on motions to suspend standing orders to debate such motions, of course, will be determined on a case by case basis.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition believes that formal motions are not an appropriate instrument for formulating or conveying positions on foreign policy. They are a blunt instrument: senators may either support them in the form in which they are put before the Senate or oppose them; they may not amend them. The nuances and the subtleties of foreign policy issues and the impact on Australia's relations with other countries need to be carefully considered and 
 debated. The procedures for formal motions in our view preclude such important considerations. </para><para>Senators will know that formal motions are conveyed by the President to the governments of the countries to which they are directed. These countries do not always distinguish between a formal position of the Australian government and a formal resolution of the upper house of the Australian parliament. So, unless there is general agreement on such motions, and there are many examples of these—those that might recognise national days and such like, which the opposition does believe it is appropriate for the Senate to support through the mechanism of the granting of formality for notices of motion—we will not be granting formality.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>3246</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I wish to make a brief comment on the announcement by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.

Unanimity means the lowest common denominator; it means that government or opposition will be able to determine in their own good time what motions will be put forward—to the exclusion of the Greens, the Democrats and the Independents in this place. That is the dynamics of it.

The Greens do this, as does Senator Harradine, very well in terms of responsible actions and responsible decisions. I would be very concerned about any action that might reduce or restrict the ability during notices of motion not just of us to speak but for the community, whom we represent and whom supposedly everybody else represents, to have a voice to make statements and for those statements to be potentially voted on or debated within the parliament.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think I see some elements of would-be government with the Labor Party's response—`We were government' or `We would like to be government' and `we find this inconvenient'.

I am researching at the moment to find out exactly what the situation was. But I recall that on a fairly regular basis there were suspensions of standing orders. We do not have that so much now. This may well happen again if what the Labor Party is suggesting is to be the case. Then perhaps they will come in and moan about how many suspensions of standing orders there are. The government changed the process to allow formality of motions so that motions could be put to the vote or otherwise.</para><para>Maybe we all have to get together and communicate better. Maybe that is the nub of the question. It is being said that people perhaps are not communicating as well or are not listening to the sides of the argument before a motion is put.

That is because procedures have 
 evolved in such a way that there are fewer opportunities now. We used to have an open-ended adjournment. Then we moved to restricted times, mostly because of staffing considerations in this building. But we left Monday night as an open-ended adjournment so that everyone could have half an hour in which to make a speech to put their views. When we went to extended Monday night sittings that opportunity disappeared. So if Senator Margetts takes her turn to speak on the adjournment, she will get one speech a week only. I think we have to look at that and look at making one of the adjournments open-ended so that every senator can make a contribution. It was a great safety valve for this chamber. It is one that was removed, not through design or maliciousness, but almost by accident. That is something we should look at.</para></talk.start><para>Until the last three or four years, the device of formal notices of motion was rarely used. It was intended to be basically on non-controversial matters. Then when the trend came to using them for controversial matters, governments were faced with two choices: they either just voted or took them all on and therefore had suspension of standing orders which, before the most recent change, had unlimited time—now they are limited to half an hour. You could have that debate proceed and lose a whole day's sitting—and that was not satisfactory. The tendency of government was to say, `We can't afford to cost ourselves the program, we'll take this controversial matter and just have a vote on it.'</para><para>From their perspective I think you can see that that is a sensible management problem, but they have the same problem as we have in many ways. This is why we are not trying to knock off formal notices of motion or have motions carried in this chamber on foreign policy. We are simply saying that, on these complex foreign affairs issues, we simply cannot put the motion through with no debate and no consideration, and with no flexibility to change it—albeit Senator Brown's offer that we can come round to his office and he might amend it. Quite often they are double bunger motions. Yesterday was an example. Part of it was to release Gusmao. Maybe the 
 majority of the Senate wanted to vote for that, but Senator Brown tacked on a view, that we may not share in geostrategic circumstances, concerning the independence of East Timor. We are left in the position that, not liking half of it, we have to vote against the lot of it. At least if it is debated, everyone can give consideration to that and amendments can be moved.</para><para>We are not saying that this chamber should never carry a foreign affairs motion. What we are saying is, if it is of great import, unfortunately we are going to have to find the time to debate it. We are not going to tick them off, put them through on the knock, when they have repercussions. The fact is that foreign policy in this country is primarily the responsibility of government and the executive—that is part of the traditional breakdown. We are responsible for scrutinising their behaviour on all occasions and using all the devices in the chamber to criticise them and suggest alteration.</para><para>Senator Faulkner is correct: it does create a lot of confusion out there when a foreign government gets a message from the Senate. It is not their lack of sophistication, Senator Brown, through you Mr Chairman, but it often creates confusion. I come back to the point that foreign affairs issues are often complex. They often have a whole variety of nuances and just to put a motion through on the basis that we want to save debating time is unacceptable to us. It is not that we have changed our mind overnight. Senator Brown is wrong in what he says on the Indonesian situation; some of us have believed it for a year or two or longer, and we have finally been—if you like—given a consideration to take action on it.</para><para>We are not saying that on every occasion you, Senator Brown, or any other senator, moves a foreign affairs motion we are going to gag you. We are not. But we are not going to say that it can be automatically put up for a vote without debate. That is simply unacceptable to us. If that has alienated the Greens and others, that is the price. We think we are adopting not a pragmatic position but a principled position. We believe it goes to the 
 essential relationship between the legislature and the executive.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION </title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>3249</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Woodley</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the general business order of the day in relation to the Privacy Amendment Bill 1997 be discharged from the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> .</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INDIA: NUCLEAR TESTING</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>3249</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>3249</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In full recognition of what is going to happen, I ask that general business notice of motion No. 1120, standing in my name and relating to further underground nuclear testing by India, be taken as formal.</para></talk.start><para>Leave not granted.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>3249</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Community Affairs Legislation Committee</title><page.no>3249</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Extension of Time</title><page.no>3249</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Calvert</inline>, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knowles</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That the time for the presentation of the report of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service Reform Bill 1998 be extended to 23 June 1998.</para></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Scrutiny of Bills Committee</title><page.no>3249</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>3249</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3249</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator Cooney, I present the 6th report of 1998 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.

This week, all Aus 
 tralians can show a commitment to reconciliation, inform themselves about the indigenous perspective and participate in reconciliation activities. National Reconciliation Week is marked by two very significant dates. Today, 27 May, is the anniversary of the referendum in 1967 which empowered the Commonwealth to make laws for Aboriginal people. The concluding date of National Reconciliation Week is 3 June, the anniversary of the High Court's Mabo decision.</para></talk.start><para>The theme this year is `Communities Working Together'. All over Australia, local councils, churches, business and community organisations will be acknowledging the cause of reconciliation, and I urge everyone to join in their local activities. Australia's traditional values of a `fair go', of tolerance, of acceptance of diversity and of looking after each other in times of need provide the context for successful reconciliation. In 1991 we were happy to support the establishment of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. We continue to support the council's objective, which is to promote reconciliation based on an appreciation of indigenous cultures, achievements and the unique position of indigenous people in Australia.</para><para>There are three major elements to a successful reconciliation process. We should acknowledge the realities of our shared history and its continuing effects. We should, in line with the theme for National Reconciliation Week, work together towards a common future in which we share equally and in which we appreciate and respect our varied traditions and cultures. Finally—and this is the key—we need an ongoing commitment to address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage.</para><para>This is one of our major policy priorities. There can otherwise be no meaningful reconciliation. We look forward to the day when indigenous people share equally with all other Australians in the social, economic and cultural life of this country. We look forward to the day when indigenous people are able to leave behind welfare dependence and take control of their own lives and communities. We know that this will not be achieved if indigenous people continue to lag behind in 
 the key socio-economic areas of health, housing, education and employment. The Government's efforts have been concentrated in these areas, and I believe we are beginning to see results.</para><para>In the recent budget, I issued a ministerial statement which, for the first time, puts on record exactly what the government is doing to meet its goals. It shows that we spend almost $1.9 billion annually on indigenous-specific programs, and over 70 percent of this is in the key areas I mentioned. Since coming to government we have increased indigenous health spending by nearly 40 percent. The Prime Minister announced in February a project to address the severe eye health problems in indigenous communities. In a country with all of Australia's advantages, it is intolerable that so many indigenous people should be afflicted with avoidable blindness. The measures we are putting in place will make an appreciable and early difference. We are also providing an immunisation program for influenza and associated diseases which are a major cause of ill health and death in indigenous communities. It is by practical, realistic and effective measures such as these that we aim to achieve significantly better outcomes for indigenous people.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, we acknowledge that there is a huge backlog in the provision of adequate housing and health related infrastructure in indigenous communities and, unfortunately, the available funding is not unlimited. We have decided that our priority should be those communities that are particularly needy and which, because of their location in remote areas, cannot access mainstream programs.</para><para>The innovative ATSIC-army community assistance program, which we initiated shortly after coming to government, has already had some excellent results. Seven priority remote communities have been identified and the army is providing housing, sewerage and better, cleaner and safer water supplies. More significantly, it also has community members who are trained by army personnel to maintain the new infrastructure so that the value of the asset will be preserved, and the benefits in terms of improved health will be sustained. 
 Indeed, during a recent trip by the Prime Minister and me to the Northern Territory to visit Aboriginal communities, we were able to see the very real improvements which will be made to the community of Elcho Island under the program. These include the construction of 10 houses, the provision of solar power and the upgrading of water supplies.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, these results demonstrate that this program is delivering real benefits to indigenous people in the most needy of remote communities. And today the Prime Minister has announced that the government will commit an additional $5 million to extend the program. I will be consulting with ATSIC to provide matching funding as it did under the pilot program.</para><para>I particularly want to express my thanks to army personnel who have contributed so willingly to the success of this program and the productive consultation processes which they undertook with local communities. Indeed, the program is an excellent example of this government's approach to the reconciliation process, particularly in light of the very constructive relationships which were formed between army personnel and the indigenous communities.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, indigenous children suffer particular disadvantage in educational outcomes. The comparative participation figures are very telling. Indigenous children have a secondary school year 12 retention rate of less than 30 per cent, compared with some 70 per cent of other Australians. Only nine per cent of indigenous young people are attending tertiary institutions, compared with 22 per cent of the non-indigenous population. Twenty-five per cent of indigenous students leave school before year 10. For other students, the figure is only two per cent. In terms of educational attainments, 75 per cent of indigenous students in primary schools have significantly low levels of literacy and numeracy, compared with 33 per cent of other students. The situation is exacerbated by the remoteness of many Aboriginal communities which have no educational facilities and are located a considerable distance from the nearest schools.</para><para>This government is committed to assisting indigenous students to reach their full potential and has provided increased funding, including to the indigenous education strategic initiatives program. I am pleased to note that the government will be providing a package of initiatives of more than $15 million under this program for new equipment and facilities, including computers, school buses and accommodation for teachers in remote areas. The additional funds will also be used for curriculum programs aimed at improving the reading and writing skills of indigenous children, particularly in those vital early primary years. This funding will go to schools, both government and non-government, preschools and vocational and training institutions. It augments the $20 million announced by this government in December for similar facilities and projects for indigenous students in non-government schools and pre-schools.</para><para>Mr Acting Deputy President, we are also very supportive of the community development employment projects scheme. It may not be very well known that indigenous people have been working for the dole for the last twenty years under this scheme—which was introduced by the coalition government in 1977—both to gain work experience and to improve community amenities. Demand for places has always been high despite some disincentives in terms of reduced welfare entitlements and taxation rebates. In the last budget we removed those anomalies, and we will provide CDEP workers with the same allowances available to mainstream work for the dole participants. This will bring more money into indigenous communities to assist in their economic development.</para><para>An appreciation in the wider community of the unique culture and heritage of Australia's indigenous people is also integral to reconciliation. I am pleased that I have been able to take the Prime Minister to the Torres Strait Islands and eastern Arnhem Land. The pride indigenous people take in their traditions, the enormous effort that is put into maintaining these traditions and the important role of the family in indigenous communities are to be much admired. Over recent years many Australians will have enjoyed outstanding 
 work by indigenous people in the visual and performing arts.</para><para>Understanding the importance of land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians is essential to an appreciation of their culture. We have a profound respect for the deep spiritual attachment of indigenous people to their traditional land, and we support the principles of native title as set out in the Mabo and Wik decisions. But of course other Australians have attachments and rights to land as well and a balance must be struck. I believe we have achieved that balance with our native title amendments. If no single group is entirely happy with the outcome, I hope it will be acknowledged that the result is the best compromise amongst varied interests. The other key element is understanding our shared history and recognising that this history continues to contribute to today's disadvantage.</para><para>Last December we announced a $63 million package of practical measures clearly targeted at the most urgent and pressing need identified in the <inline font-style="italic">Bringing them home </inline>recommendations—getting family members back together. The funds we set aside will be used by ATSIC to establish `link up' centres in each state and the Northern Territory to assist people wanting to trace missing relatives. Substantial funds were also allocated to provide new and enhanced counselling services in recognition of the trauma and distress that many families have faced.</para><para>Reconciliation is, however, also about the future; it is especially about the future. It is about determining common goals and building enduring partnerships that will take us together into the next century. We are an egalitarian people, we are a fair and tolerant people. I believe we have a real commitment to those elements of the reconciliation process that I have talked about: acknowledging the past; appreciating indigenous culture; working together; and, most importantly, addressing those disadvantages that prevent indigenous people taking their rightful place in contemporary Australia. We are entering an exciting time in our history and, with mutual trust and respect, the process of reconciliation will be one of the great successes of that history.</para><para>I congratulate Evelyn Scott and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation on their efforts in coordinating this week's activities and again urge everyone to enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of reconciliation.

It involves reconciliation between our cultures and reconciliation with our shared history. Reconciling with our shared history involves acknowledgment, acceptance and mutual respect. It must involve a shared sorrow and regret for the events, attitudes and policies of the past that brought so much pain then and has left a legacy of personal and social distress with indigenous people today.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister has told us that we must acknowledge the realities of our shared history and its continuing effects. We wholeheartedly agree with that. But is this the same Prime Minister who so enthusiastically moved to entrench the expression `the black armband view of history' in common use? Is this the same Prime Minister who said:</para><para>Call an end to the self-flagellation, the introspection, the willingness to accept unfounded criticisms?</para><para>Is this the same Prime Minister who, when speaking to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>  newspaper, said:</para><para>We can look any people in the eye and say we have done right by our citizens?</para><para>Is this the same Prime Minister whose response to the racist diatribes in the maiden speech of the member for Oxley in the House of Representatives was to triumphantly announce to the Queensland Liberal Party in particular and the world in general:</para><para>The pall of censorship of the Keating years has been lifted?</para><para>That brings us, of course, to the coalition's major contribution to National Reconciliation Week: its decision to direct preferences to One Nation in Queensland. Such exquisite 
 timing! They were no doubt mindful of One Nation's Hervey Bay spokesman's acute observation. He said:</para><para>There's nothing wrong with Asia that an `A' bomb and anthrax couldn't cure—</para><para>when deciding on this crucial reconciliation issue.</para><para>The Prime Minister noted that National Reconciliation Week will end with the anniversary of the Mabo decision. The opposition applauds his assurance that the government accepts the outcome of the Wik and Mabo cases. What a pity that the Prime Minister's actions have failed to reflect those words. The Mabo decision was central to and critical to reconciliation. The pride and reassurance that flowed to indigenous Australians from this recognition of their prior rights in this country is real and measurable; measurable in their willingness and ability to pursue the logical benefits of these discovered rights in public and in the courts. It truly affirmed them and gave many of them confidence that our system of justice can recognise and protect them.</para><para>The response of certain elements in the community, including most of those who currently form our national government, was to attack the decision and deny its legitimacy. Furthermore, they embarked on a deliberate campaign in regional Australia to spread misinformation, fear and panic. Whatever the short-term political results may have been, we will all live with the resultant racial disharmony for years to come.</para><para>And they did not stop there. They attacked the High Court as well. As Gerard Henderson remarked yesterday, `Neither Ben Chifley in 1949 or Robert Menzies in 1956, despite High Court decisions that cut to the core of their political agendas, ever did such a thing.' Not only did the coalition let loose the more lamentable specimens from the dark corners of their own backbench but also they assailed the court from the frontbench as well after both the Mabo and Wik decisions.</para><para>The Keating government, in the context of the coalition's campaign of fear and loathing, framed a legislative response to Mabo in 1993. They did so in the face of total non-cooperation from the coalition. The conserva 
 tives did not seek to deal with this newly discovered right; they sought to deny and suppress it. In government their response to the Wik decision was to draft a systematic winding back of the right of indigenous Australians that the High Court had recognised. The Wik decision was about coexistence and the primacy of property rights granted since European settlement. It could have been a major instrument of reconciliation.</para><para>Confronting truth and understanding past mistakes is a public policy issue. Expenditure programs for indigenous Australians in health, housing, education and training are welcome and necessary. However, if such programs are predicated on the assumption that we are simply dealing with a group within an homogenous wider community that suffers from material deprivation, and that such deprivation can be redressed by targeted spending, then we are all doomed to further disappointment.</para><para>Australia's indigenous communities continue to bear the scars and the pain and the disabilities that come from a history of dispossession, social dislocation, destruction of their language and culture, and the systematic destruction of families. Public policy makers in this country must accept that reality and respond creatively to the challenges that this understanding brings to effective program and policy delivery.</para><para>Great numbers of indigenous Australians and many health and education professionals tell us that progress must start with healing and that an apology—an expression of regret—from authorities that have represented oppression and pain is central to that healing. Why in the name of good government, if not in the name of humanity, should this government deny them such a simple, symbolic gesture? The Prime Minister can't apologise.

There is no doubt that the Democrats are committed to reconciliation. We have put that on the record on many occasions and we will continue to work for reconciliation.</para></talk.start><para>But I must say that reconciliation has to be based on justice and there is not much justice in this place, certainly not this week. It is distressing, during National Reconciliation Week, to hear reports of the most anti-reconciliation party in this country, One Nation, rising in the polls. In fact, One Nation is perhaps the most unbelievably misnamed political party in the history of this country, for it represents neither one nor one nation. It is not one because it is in fact many parties, individuals and extremist groups, and it is not for one nation, because if it gains any seats in 
 coming elections it will totally divide and fracture this nation of ours.</para><para>The Democrats also believe that the Prime Minister of this country must take responsibility for the rise and rise of One Nation. Mr Howard defended the member for Oxley almost from the beginning. In that atmosphere—I suppose one must call it tolerance; I cannot think of another word, although it is a misuse of tolerance too, I think—the One Nation party has survived and thrived.</para><para>Today, as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has said, we hear that the coalition in Queensland has given One Nation its stamp of approval with its second preference. In other words, the coalition in Queensland would rather have One Nation members of state parliament than Labor members. That is shocking, sad and very cynical. We wonder if the federal coalition will follow suit and declare its support for One Nation. I guess that may happen at the end of reconciliation week.</para><para>We believe that the conservative parties are playing a very dangerous political game. By creating that atmosphere of tolerance, the Prime Minister may have dug his own political grave. One Nation now appears to present a formidable electoral threat to the coalition, federally and in Queensland. This is the cost to reconciliation in this country from the rise of the One Nation party.</para><para>But there is a bright side: the people's movement for reconciliation is growing larger every day. That is wonderful news. Yesterday in Canberra, hundreds of people were turned away from many of the events which were held to celebrate and, by way of ceremony, say sorry to the indigenous people of this country.

That is wonderful news.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Reconciliation is about mutual respect between people. Mutual respect means people can say sorry to one another; that is the way that mature relationships develop. Having said sorry, we can then go on. The movement around Australia of grassroots people who are saying sorry to the stolen generation is acknowledging their pain and suffering, sharing their grief and then moving ahead. The Democrats were happy to personally offer our apologies to the stolen generation in the sorry books. We know that admissions of guilt are not being sought, but we know that saying sorry allows this nation to grieve, to heal and to move on.</para><para>I believe, as we note with alarm the rising popularity of the One Nation party in Queensland, it is significant to note the equal rise in popularity for the reconciliation movement in Australia. Sorry Day activities in Canberra yesterday were booked out, so it is not all bad news.</para><para>I conclude by referring to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> today about the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. There was a suggestion of criticism of the chair of that council, Evelyn Scott, and that article quotes me. I want to place on record my unqualified support for Evelyn Scott as chairperson of the council and my support for her as she seeks, through the council, to advance the cause of reconciliation in this country.

The sadness relates to the lack of understanding that jumps out from the pages of the document that has been presented. The very first paragraph says:</para></talk.start><para>. . . confirm the government's strong commitment to the cause of reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.</para><para>The Greens (WA) have always had some concern in relation to the concept of reconciliation. Our concern relates to the fact—and it 
 has been expressed to us by many indigenous people throughout Australia—that reconciliation tends to sound like a `kiss and make up', a `if only we can come together again, then things will be okay'. That superficial element of reconciliation, or some superficial understanding of reconciliation, tends to come from this page. The following statement is made in paragraph 4:</para><para>The theme this year is <inline font-weight="bold">Communities Working Together</inline> . All over Australia local councils, churches, business and community will be acknowledging the cause of reconciliation . . .</para><para>What does that mean? I argue that it means nothing because it basically does not acknowledge the need for the healing in the first place. `Acknowledging the cause of reconciliation' is meaningless. It does not give any indication of the need to recognise the physical, psychological and sexual abuse and discrimination that have occurred and that need to be acknowledged for the healing to take place. It does not acknowledge the systematic disenfranchisement, the removal from land, and the ignorance and disrespect for indigenous culture and values. That must be acknowledged. Without acknowledgment, we will not learn and we will not progress.	  Even so, reconciliation is only a word if it does not mean more, if it does not mean actual actions.</para><para>We basically have an indication that the government believes that the situation many indigenous people find themselves in is of their own making. The document states:</para><para>We look forward to the day when indigenous people are able to leave behind welfare dependence and take control of their own lives and communities.</para><para>Wouldn't that be wonderful? But self-determination is not actually on the government's agenda. So basically this government is saying, `Leave behind your culture, forget what we have done, forget what successive generations have done and pull yourself up from the situation you find yourself in.' We see that further on it says:</para><para>It shows that we spend almost $1.9 billion annually on indigenous-specific programmes . . . </para><para>Very interesting. It goes to state and territory governments, in the main. Yet what is the 
 centrepoint of this reconciliation statement? It is dunny based paternalism. The only example this government can give is sending the army in—without actually asking indigenous Australians whether that is what they want to happen in that manner. It is using a special appropriation but requiring that ATSIC put up money from their already stretched budget to provide matching funds. It is not providing extra money but requiring that ATSIC give up some other program, some other priority, in order to match the funds that people in indigenous communities were not asked about in the first place.</para><para>What kind of dunny based paternalism is this? It basically misses the whole point. Why were state governments not required to put in that portion of the $1.9 billion of federal taxpayers' money that people pay to state and federal governments to provide basic services—basic services that mean public housing that is more than concrete and wire pens like you get in many remote and regional areas of Australia. Would this be accepted in any other portion of the Australian community, especially when, to receive basic health and education services, people have to be forced to sign up to mining agreements, for their basic human rights? So the great contribution to reconciliation by this government is actually to take $5 million off ATSIC from their other programs, or sit and wait to see whether or not they will accept taking $5 million out of their other programs.</para><para>Is the army the best or most appropriate means of providing the service? I do not know. Have ATSIC been advised? Did ATSIC get a choice? Did Aboriginal communities get a choice? Is this their priority? Is this a way to move towards self-determination? Quite frankly, I think the issue of sovereignty must be brought back onto the agenda. We know that it has never been decided by the High Court because they cannot. The High Court of Australia cannot decide on sovereignty because at the very moment those words come out of their mouths they themselves no longer exist.</para><para>If Australia cannot deal with the issue of sovereignty in that way, we have got to deal with it in another way. The other way is to 
 actually deal with self-determination: work towards a meaningful treaty process, work towards agreement with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations of Australia and work towards finding real self-determination. If this dunny based paternalism is the best the government can do, we will continue to be in the state we are now, with total lack of understanding of what the real issues are, total lack of understanding of the need for recognition and total lack of understanding that in any program you put together the very least you need to do is find out whether that is what the communities are wanting and, if so, how they want it delivered.</para><para>This is more than sad; this is tragic. I really think that the people in other countries are looking with great distress and sadness at what this government is doing. I do not personally believe that the big racist problem in Australia is a particular minor party or individuals standing for parliament. They are reflecting the environment that has been created by a political scapegoating, divisive mentality. This government is seeking to gain from that mentality. It is seeking to gain from the distress within the Australian community that has been created by the combined major parties in this parliament. Until we start addressing those, we will always be attacking one or other minor party.</para><para>I believe there is blame to be had for the simplistic arguments that are put up by those people who are specifically standing on racist platforms. Of course that is not to be applauded. But the government and the Labor Party bear some responsibility for that level of distress that exists within the community. Until we start looking at the cause of this distress and until we start looking at the reason why scapegoat politics and wedge politics and divisive politics are in such a fertile environment in Australia, attacking those people who are gaining politically from it will not address the problem. We have got to start healing this country as a whole. We have got to start helping indigenous Australians to be part of the healing process, but we also have to start healing this nation.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>3257</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment, Education and Training References Committee</title><page.no>3257</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>3257</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>3257</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Beyond Cinderella: towards a learning society</inline> .

For example, the Australian Electoral Commission has utilised a range of adult and community education providers to assist in the delivery of both long-term and short-term public education and information initiatives.</para><para>Many campaigns such as national public health awareness campaigns are undertaken in conjunction with State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments also undertake public education or awareness activities independently of the Commonwealth. Consequently, the recommendation to `undertake a precise analysis and costing of the public education activities of government departments and agencies' raises issues that should 
 also be considered by State and Territory governments.</para><para>The Commonwealth also believes that the complexities involved in undertaking a precise analysis and costing of public education activities could mean that the costs involved may outweigh the benefits obtained. Additionally, project management practices already require Commonwealth Departments and agencies to analyse the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of such campaigns.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>3267</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>This is the government's response to the Senate Employment, Education and Training report titled <inline font-style="italic">Beyond Cinderella: towards a learning society.</inline>  Yet again, I note that this government response is almost a year overdue, and I might begin my comments with the observation of just how disappointing it is that the government has taken so long to produce a report which effectively says so little. It is a disappointment to me, and not just to me, I suspect, but to the 400,000-odd Australians who are currently involved with the adult and community education sector in this country.</para><para>The report <inline font-style="italic">Beyond Cinderella: towards a learning society</inline> was the second report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee. The word `Cinderella' in this context refers to the fact that this particular sector, although it involves such a very large number of Australians, is treated badly by all levels in government. It is regarded as the poor relation of the education industry in this country.</para><para>Despite the fact that some 400,000 people participate in the various programs run by the adult and community education sector, the Commonwealth expends about $685,000 a year—in 1997-98 it spent about that amount of money—through the various international programs. Of that amount, about $185,000 goes to the peak body, the Australian Association of Adult and Community Education. Additional moneys are provided through the National Centre for Vocational Education Research and some assistance is provided through a tutor task force on adult and community education. DEETYA does do some very limited work in this area.</para><para>As the committee report itself observes, what is frustrating is that everybody involved in the education debate in this country acknowledges the worth of the adult and community education sector. Everybody will tell you just how worthy these organisations are and the importance of the work that they are undertaking. Again and again the concepts of lifelong learning of all types are acknowledged in the official reports of government in terms of the benefits provided. This report here today acknowledges again the importance of lifelong learning as a principle. It is also indicated by the national vocational education strategy documents that have been developed over the years by governments at all levels. The various Australian national training authority officials will come before the Senate and equally explain how important this sector is. But what we see again and again is that that is about as far as it goes.</para><para>Very limited sums of money are provided. As I said, $185,000 through ANTA is an appallingly small amount of money given the significance of this area of education. We spend something like $3 billion a year on public education for the vocational education and training sector in terms of TAFE and various other measures, but a very small amount of that $3 billion actually finds its way towards this particular sector.</para><para>The recent ministerial council, held on 22 May, on the national strategy for vocational education and training for the period 1998 to 2003 also identified the worth of the adult and community education sector. But no commitments have been made and no priorities have been established to ensure that adequate levels of funding are provided for people who undertake this work and who provide what are extremely important facilities to many of our older Australians. Mature aged people who are seeking entry back into the education system and a second chance, people who have not been able to enjoy the benefits of a formal educational setting through the primary and secondary education system, those seeking English as a second language programs, those seeking self-fulfilment and enrichment programs and all of those people who enjoy enormous benefit 
 through the adult community education system do not have access to adequate levels of public support, despite all the pious remarks that are made by governments.</para><para>The essential problem is demonstrated again in this government's response, which says, `This is not our worry, this is somebody else's problem. We are going to get a big mirror and have a good look into it yet again, but we are not actually going to do anything about it. We are going to shunt this problem off to the states to deal with.' These are national issues of national concern and matters that require a national response.</para><para>What we really have is a fundamental problem that exists within the government's thinking about the relationship between education and training. The fundamental problem that arises is the confusion that exists between the priority that should be given to what are narrowly defined as vocational programs and the broader concerns about the importance of providing lifelong learning and the wherewithal to ensure that education allows for the effective participation of all citizens through the formal and informal educational systems that do exist, to ensure that there is effective citizenship and that people have the opportunity to maximise their personal goals, and to ensure that they can develop the skills to allow them to operate at the highest level of participation, both in the world of work and in society more generally.</para><para>We have a failure to build the necessary infrastructure through community organisations and through our formal educational systems, be they TAFE or schools, to ensure that there is an opportunity to build creative, productive and socially satisfying relationships that will lead to people securing the necessary skills, habits of thought and ways of looking at the world that will allow them to achieve those objectives. There is a fundamental problem in so far as the government has failed to acknowledge the importance of this sector by putting its money where its mouth is. What this report demonstrates to the Senate yet again is that this failure will continue.</para><para>What we on the committee argued for was that a more comprehensive national approach 
 be taken to the adult and community education sector that acknowledged just how important it was for this society to provide the wherewithal, through the adult and community education facilities that are available, to provide at minimum cost the opportunity for in excess of 400,000 Australians every year to secure outcomes that allow them to achieve full participation. This is a consideration that goes beyond a more narrow vision of vocational education and is obviously wanting in all aspects.</para><para>It is a simple fundamental fact of life that in Victoria and a few other states there is a commitment—and I acknowledge this in terms of the Kennett government; these are measures that have continued since our time in government—with the particular acts of parliament, to ensure that there is protection for the adult and community education sector. But it does not happen too often. It has happened because of the forwarding thinking of the Labor government in the 1980s.</para><para>What you have are the simple facts such as the failure to acknowledge just how much money is actually spent by all governments on this particular sector of education. There is no reliable statistical basis to identify what the unit cost of education is in this particular sector. There is simply not the attention given to the adult and community education sector that would allow us to develop this in a more effective manner than currently exists. I must say that I am deeply disappointed with this response. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>3268</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on this report on adult and community education. This is the second report to the Senate this decade. The adult and community education issue is something that the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee has taken a great interest in through the 1990s. In 1991, we brought down the landmark <inline font-style="italic">Come in Cinderella</inline>  report. That was the very first report we did on a sector of education which has contributed an enormous amount to education in this country.</para></talk.start><para>The adult and community education sector is the so-called fourth sector of education—the first being primary, the second being 
 secondary and the third being tertiary, university and TAFE. What a lot of people do not realise is the actual massive size of this sector. For example, in the state of New South Wales, there are a million people doing adult and community education courses of some description. There are more students at any one point in time in adult and community education than in the universities and TAFEs put together. The difference, of course, is that these are not three- or four-year long courses. A lot of adult and community education courses are quite short. They might go for a few months or they might even go just for a few weeks. But they are very important components in learning, and they do an enormous amount for education in this country and for the community generally.</para><para>People pick up very critical and important skills not only for their lives in general but often these are little building bridges towards other levels of education. A lot of people, particularly those who have experienced failure in the primary and secondary system and do not want to go anywhere near a university or a TAFE because of that, often gain confidence by spending time in one of these short courses and then going on to higher education. It is the most cost effective sector of education. Quite often courses are run on shoestring budgets and with a lot of dedicated people assisting. It covers a very wide range of areas in the community, and during our inquiries in 1991 and 1997 we went and saw this. We went to diverse places. We went into rural areas, migrant communities, mental hospitals and prisons, and adult and community education had a very major role in these areas.</para><para>In terms of the response to the reports by governments, it is interesting to see how this has changed over the years. In 1991, the view initially was that adult and community education was something that should be handled at a regional or state level and the federal government should not get very involved at all. In the very first report, <inline font-style="italic">Come in Cinderella</inline>, there were 33 recommendations to the committee and the last Labor government only ever implemented 11, and they did not put very much money into it either.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Which is a lot more than what your government is going to do.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>—As a matter of fact, the last Labor government set up an office relating to adult and community education in the federal bureaucracy, and during one estimates hearing, Senator Carr—I do not know if you were in the Senate at that time—I asked a question on it and they looked around for the officers to answer and they could not find them. The minister at the desk at the time was Senator Schacht, I think, and he said, `Gee, have we actually lost a whole division?' That whole division was the equivalent of about one or two people.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So let's get it in perspective, Senator Carr. When you criticise this government about what we are doing in response to the report, let's look at what your government did in response, which was very little indeed. You instituted a number of new measures, brought it in a new direction and did start to put a federal focus, and given that today you have paid tribute to Jeff Kennett and the work he has done in this area in Victoria, I will also pay tribute to that start you made. But let's be serious about it, Senator Carr—you did not really put many resources into it at all.</para><para>We come to the report that we are dealing with today. I suppose the disappointing thing, looking back on the approach of the committee, was that we were moving towards saying that the whole thing was a matter of reorganising the bureaucracy. I regret that we actually took that approach. I thought, having developed a very good report the first time and having started off in a new direction, that we should have extended that a little bit further rather than just putting bits of bureaucracy together.</para><para>I think the hope for people in adult and community education is in the way in which the job market structure is changing at the moment and the way in which intensive assistance works in the FLEX 3 where people can, as part of intensive assistance, get extra education and training. They do not have to go to the TAFEs or the universities; they can actually go to adult and community education providers if that is appropriate. These are very effective providers. They are very cost-effec 
 tive providers. I am sure that, under this new regime that this government has set up, the adult and community education sector which is flourishing will continue to flourish.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3270</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to make some comments about this report. First of all, it is very disappointing that we had a unanimous report from our committee that has been so significantly dumped on by the government in this response. I think it is insufficient for Senator Tierney to say that we made recommendations for more bureaucracy and nothing else. That is certainly not the case. I think anybody in the Senate would acknowledge Senator Tierney's commitment to adult and community education. I would like it if sometimes he practised something of the same kind of generosity and acknowledged the initiatives of the Labor government to get adult and community education onto the political agenda at all.</para></talk.start><para>The whole point of this report was that, given that adult and community education was on the political agenda, and given that there had been a very significant report, the Cinderella report from Senator Tierney and his committee, five years down the track we should have a look and see what was happening. You would have thought that the government would have been assisted in the whole approach to adult and community education by our reflecting on the state of play. The Labor government, in supporting adult and community education, particularly focused on the vocational education training end of adult and community education. This report was saying, very importantly, but you have forgotten one large part of adult and community education, and we want to recommend that it not be overlooked.</para><para>There are a number of reasons why. My colleagues have spoken about it, and the report spells out the importance of adult and community education for people who missed out the first time through in education, for people who got through school without being able to read and write, for people who went through school and now need to upgrade their skills. Their education was all right for them when they left school but it is no longer 
 appropriate. We hear again and again of the importance of education for employment these days. Many people are able, with adult and community education, to come back and access education in a very affordable and accessible way.</para><para>We think this is a critical part of adult and community education. We know its importance, we know its success. It is hugely welcomed by the community and very largely participated in. Our report stressed the importance of it, and this government has chosen to give a big flick to the majority of this report. I find that very depressing. In particular, the committee was interested to note that people from western suburbs and people from lower socioeconomic areas of the country were much less likely to access adult and community education than people from better off areas and from the eastern suburbs.</para><para>Secondly, a very large number of participants were women, far more than men. It would be interesting if the government had picked up on our drawing this to their attention, by saying that we think adult and community education should have a universal application and accessibility. So will you please find out why it is that men, and particularly men from working class or lower socioeconomic areas, are not making the same access and use of adult community education as others. It is a very important point.</para><para>For some of my colleagues age has begun to weary us, and it is important that we recognise another very important point from this report: that is, the importance of continuing intellectual activity of adult and community education for preventing the onset of Alzheimers. I am not at all sure that this is proven yet, but there is some nicely documented evidence that if you do your daily crossword and regularly play bridge you can hold off the onset of senility.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">COONAN</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name></talker><para>—And eat Freddo Frogs.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—I am not at all sure what contribution that makes to this discussion, but I take it that it is meant well. It may be that we do not necessarily have to play bridge and do the daily crossword, but it is very interesting.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The evidence brought to the committee is quite clear, and it is of great concern to us that, as more and more Australians are going to live to a ripe old age, it is important that more and more of those Australians feel as though they have something useful to do with their lives, something to contribute to the community. One of the best ways they feel that they can participate, keep up with events going on in their community, interest themselves in whatever, is if they have access to adult and community education. I note that the government is somewhat grudging but at least a bit sympathetic to the notion that we should look at the impact in terms of health, particularly the health dollar costs, of the points that I have made.</para><para>People may smile and say, `We are not sure that it is true about bridge and the daily crossword,' but we do know that the relationship between intellectual activity and good health is an issue that is beginning to be addressed. I do appreciate that this point has been taken up. The trouble is that it does give weight to the notion of adult and community education being something for old people to do to keep themselves gainfully distracted. That is not what adult and community education is about at all. I certainly hope that because of this report, through its support at least of that recommendation, the Commonwealth will establish a dedicated research program to examine this. I am not sure that they will do that, but they are certainly going to look at the connection between health and intellectual activity. I would hate this to be taken as any way skewing adult and community education to old people and the basket weavers in our community. It does no credit to what adult and community education is about.</para><para>I am disappointed that there was no support for the recommendation regarding the capital needs of adult and community centres, particularly those in the neighbourhoods and in the community. One of our recommendations says that we would like to see educational facilities like schools more available for use by other community groups, and adult and community education might be an entirely appropriate group to use such facilities. 
 However, we also know that not all community groups can move or want to move. They are differently accessible for people, and I am very disappointed that the government sees no need to try to support the capital needs of community and neighbourhood adult and community education centres, in particular, that of supplying a computer. The government has a lot of requirements in terms of data and reporting back but no appreciation that to provide that kind of data centres will need the assistance of some capital money, in particular, for a computer.</para><para>The final point I wish to make is the overwhelming rejection of this report. That has to be a disappointment for all of us but, I would have thought, particularly for those government colleagues who have actually been belted out of court by their own government.</para><para>I find it particularly disappointing that, in rejecting the principal recommendations, the government points out that there is a significant difference between ACE and VET. The whole raison d'etre of this report was to say that we recognise that, in picking up adult and community education, the previous government had done that very well, but the focus and the large amount of money had gone to the vocational end and ignored, or somewhat minimally supported, the ACE end. The whole report was about putting those two together, but the government sees fit to continue the separation. In particular, they go on to say:</para><para>Anyhow under the new labour market assistance there is a potential for a new role to ACE. ACE providers will be able to become contracted employment placement enterprises in their own right and/or provide labour market training to the clients of employment placement enterprises (EPEs) and that meet the specific requirements of the EPE and its client.</para><para>We have heard already of the unmitigated shambles called the establishment of the new Job Network under this government. There are thousands of community organisations possessing previously gained expertise and skills that have been totally disregarded. Why anyone would think that an undercapitalised community centre for adult and community education might now be able to leap in to become a contracted employment placement 
 enterprise without that backup and support is, I think, drawing a very long bow or, in fact, sheer folly.</para><para>While I would hope that people who attend any such centres may be able to get assistance with their employment, the suggestion that you can reject the thrust of our report by suggesting that adult and community education centres become employment placement enterprises is unlikely to happen. And it completely misses the point of why we reviewed adult and community education with the <inline font-style="italic">Come in Cinderella</inline> report. What it means, of course, is that this task remains for the return of a Labor government.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>3272</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>3272</page.no><name role="metadata">Parer, Sen Warwick</name><name role="display">Senator PARER</name><name.id>KI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Resources and Energy</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the government's response to the first and second reports of the legal and constitutional reference than committee on its inquiry into the Australian legal aid system.

If it is fair enough for a judge to have to do that, I think the Senate perhaps ought to seriously consider whether or not the Attorney-General should be asked to give cause as to why it takes him 14 months to prepare a one-paragraph response and 11 months to prepare a five-page response to eight recommendations. Those eight recommendations, might I say without being insulting to the rest of my committee colleagues, were quite substantial but, nonetheless, they were not going to be a great draw on the government's budget.</para></talk.start></continue><para>They were serious and well considered recommendations. Indeed, most of the recommendations that were made were actually agreed to by my government Senate colleagues on the committee and they went through them in their minority report—a minority report, I might add, that stated a qualification as to why it was a minority report. It said in the second paragraph:</para><para>Whilst Government Senators were prepared, albeit reluctantly to provide unanimity for this inquiry's first report, such support cannot be forthcoming on this occasion due to the partisan nature and commentary of the Majority Report, for example paragraph 3.24.</para><para>How we became very partisan in paragraph 3.24 I do not know. For those sensitive colleagues of mine it reads:</para><para>When considering the implications of Australia's international obligations, the Committee considers that the approach of the Commonwealth to quarantine its responsibilities to Commonwealth matters only is unrealistic, impractical and inappropriate.</para><para>I think that my colleagues are pretty thin skinned if they say that that is partisan. But my colleagues did go on to agree to the majority of the recommendations that were contained in the report.</para><para>I started this contribution by saying some rather unkind things about the first law officer, the Attorney-General, the Hon. Daryl Williams MP. Despite his long involvement 
 in the legal system of this country and his intimate involvement, in his previous life before he became a member of parliament, in the legal aid system—and there were many in that system who were dependent upon his knowledge and expertise in the system to try to bring some fairness into it—he has no appreciation even now. That is illustrated in this response to this report but it was also made very public when the Attorney appeared at a symposium organised by the Law Society of Western Australia on 4 April last year. The Attorney, in defending the actions of his government after he had given some 12 months notice of what was going to happen—that $100 million was going to be taken out of the system—stood up publicly and made this statement:</para><para>We have got 8 per cent unemployment and we have got 20 to 30 per cent youth unemployment.</para><para>That is what Mr Williams said. He went on to say, and this statement drew laughs from the assembled audience, which included the chief justices of a number of the courts in Western Australia:</para><para>Let's just put it fairly and squarely on the table. Is it legal aid or is it jobs for kids?</para><para>It is neither: $100 million has gone from the legal aid system, the unemployment rate is still at eight per cent and youth unemployment is actually rising. Despite the cuts that have been made to the legal aid system youth unemployment is actually rising. Mr Williams ought to do the decent, respectable thing: he should not sack just the individual who prepared this government response, he himself should accept responsibility and present his resignation to the Prime Minister. Clearly, he is just not quite up to the job of first law officer of the Commonwealth. He, by his actions, and the actions of the cabinet and in the budgetary consideration are putting the legal aid system into crisis. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</name></talker><para>—The time for debate has now expired.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee</title><page.no>3275</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>3275</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>3275</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the government's response to the ninth report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties entitled <inline font-style="italic">Amendments to the Bonn Convention</inline> .

Membership of the committee will be drawn from all agencies with responsibilities relating to the conservation and management of both ecologically related species and fisheries.</para><para>CCAMLR is another critical fisheries forum in which action is being taken to conserve albatrosses. In 1994 the Commission formed a Working Group on Incidental Mortality of Albatross in Longline Fishing.

AFMA is a member of the Threat Abatement Team, formed to develop the TAP.

Further, it seeks to maintain current observer coverage on foreign vessels operating in the Australian fishing zone (AFZ) and is considering its introduction on domestic vessels.</para><para>The cost of this initiative is substantial (up to $1 million per annum if applied to the pelagic longline fleet).

related information. The Authority is also examining who should pay for each aspect of the observer program through the application of the Commonwealth Fisheries Cost Recovery Policy (March 1994). The review is scheduled for completion during 1998.</para><para>Under its current observer program AFMA regularly employs (under contract) observers with scientific training and expertise in seabird biology and field experience in pelagic longline operations, to complement the information gathered by regular observers.

A smaller body of evidence suggests that catch rates of target tuna species are largely unaffected by night setting. It is this latter point, and the associated safety aspects of night setting, that would be the focus of night setting trials.</para><para>Preliminary discussions with representatives from both the domestic and Japanese tuna fleets, scientists and managers on night setting trials occurred during August and September 1997 under the aegis of the CCSBT. However, a major issue as to whether not to proceed with the trials is the development of the TAP which is considering compulsory mitigation measures (including night setting) for domestic and foreign longline vessels operating in the AFZ. The draft TAP also proposes provisions to enable domestic operators to work cooperatively with AFMA to design new mitigation techniques and refine existing measures. The Authority supports this approach.</para><para>Australian vessels rarely fish the high seas for more than a short period. Further, conducting trials from foreign (most likely Japanese) vessels on the high seas is a complex matter, although it could be pursued by the Government through the CCSBT. A more practical approach currently being considered is to have the trial conducted on Japanese or domestic vessels or a combination of the two in the AFZ.</para><para>Overall, AFMA in association with Environment Australia and the fishing industry will assess how night setting trials should be progressed in the context of the development and implementation of the TAP within the AFZ. It is possible that the development of the TAP and experimentation on mitigation measures such as night setting can continue in parallel. 
</para><para>The Government is aware there has been active discussion in the CCSBT forum of the benefits and impacts of night setting. Night setting is one focus of Australia's discussions within the CCSBT and in other relevant fora. At its first meeting the CCSBT's Ecologically Related Species Working Group clearly identified night setting as the single most effective seabird bycatch mitigation measure. This view continues to be held, although there are insufficient data at present to determine whether this affects the catch of SBT.</para><para>The Government will actively pursue the introduction of mitigation measures such as night setting in the CCSBT and other suitable international fora.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>3278</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Watson)</name></talker><para>—The President has received letters from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate seeking variations to the membership of certain committees.</para></talk.start><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston</inline>)—by leave—agreed to:</para><para>That senators be appointed to committees as follows:</para><para>Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee—</para><para>	 Substitute member: Senator Evans to replace Senator Carr for the consideration of the 1998-99 budget estimates.</para><para>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee—</para><para>	 Substitute member: Senator West to replace Senator Quirke for the consideration of the 1998-99 budget estimates.</para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3278</page.no><id.no>r437</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>3278</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Alston</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>3278</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>3278</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table revised explanatory memorandum and I move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.

He had to rely on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell). We had one of these strange times where a parliamentary secretary, representing a minister who was absent, was actually filibustering on his own bill to fill the in time so he would not have to go into the committee stage of a bill where there were some technical amendments to be dealt with. Again, this certainly in no way reflects on the President of the Senate. It certainly reflects on the 
 incompetence of the minister and the government in managing their own bill that the minister is away abusing the ABC board and leaves the parliamentary secretary here not well briefed. So we have to have a filibuster at the close of the second reading debate to fill out the time until a quarter to one and then the opposition is told: `You are wasting time. You are holding up the government's program.'</para><para>It was a very poor performance today on this issue. This was an important bill. It is the privatisation of the National Transmission Agency, which the government has made great play of. It is poor that the minister was not present.

I do not have any direct criticisms of the Australian National University as an institution, far from it. I think it is one of Australia's leading universities. What I am saddened by is the situation that is revealed in this report. The report notes on page 7 that the university has suffered greatly as a result of the six per cent cutbacks in funding by this government—a six per cent reduction in funding to the year 2000. It says that in cash terms that is a cut of between $12 and $15 million annually.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is an extraordinary assault upon one of Australia's leading education institutions, and for that this government ought to be condemned. What you have got is a government that is dedicated to the reduction in the effectiveness of our higher education institutions right across this country, not just at the ANU. But it is particularly noticeable at the Australian National University.</para><para>The substantial reduction in the priority given to education by this government has seen a reduction of some $4.3 billion right across the portfolio of education. In higher education, there are 21,000 fewer places as a result of public investment in education and as a direct result of this government's reduction of six per cent in the operating budgets provided to the universities of this country. This has resulted in a reduction in the facilities that are made available. Hundreds of jobs have been lost as a result of budget cuts at the Australian National University. In the departments of art history, modern European languages, history and political science, there has been a reduction in courses available. There has been an increase in industrial action as 
 the university has had to try to make up for the reduction in public funding made available by government.</para><para>Protests by students and teaching staff have highlighted the failure of this government to provide adequate resources to the university sector. Professor Dean Terrell, Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, said in a memorandum, `I consider it to be essential that the general public is made aware of the financial difficulties and associated budgetary challenges facing higher education.' All of this is revealed in the annual report of the ANU and I think the university authorities should be thankful that it is being drawn to the public's attention. What were once regarded as some of the best university programs in the country are under attack as a direct result of the reduction in funding to the university itself.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">RAY</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—One of the board members just walked out.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—That is the point.

I note on page 17 of the report that hundreds fewer staff are being provided to the university as a result of those cutbacks. What have we heard from this government? Not a word. It is an appalling situation which I think the Senate ought to be very concerned about. I hope that as a result of the discussion of this annual report, there is broader understanding in the community about the impact on one particular university of cutbacks to universities across the country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is a model that we have seen in a number of places, particularly at regional universities in the smaller regions of provincial Australia.

 the ANU's annual report, which sets out the activities of the Australian National University for 1997. At the beginning of the report the mission statement is set out, which states:</para></talk.start><para>The mission of the Australian National University is to be one of the world's great research institutions, distinguished by outstanding teaching, guiding students to the frontiers of knowledge and the best standards of scholarship.</para><para>These may seem lofty ambitions indeed, and it is extremely saddening to see how such aims have been frustrated by the drastic underfunding of higher education by this government. The previous speaker has referred to some of the drastic funding cuts we have seen over the last two budgets.</para><para>The impact of such underfunding is made abundantly clear in the report. The `review of 1997' states:</para><para>Financial constraints caused by reductions in Commonwealth funding to the higher education system made 1997 a difficult year for The Australian National University.</para><para>The year 1997 was the year in which the Australian National University began to feel the effects of the six per cent reduction in government funding, resulting in a reduction of $12 million to $15 million per year. Combined with an unsupplemented staff increase of nine per cent—this is the first time that the government has not supplemented such an increase—the university has been under tremendous pressure to maintain its high standards under these severe financial constraints.</para><para>Thus far, administrative areas have been the hardest hit. This has seen administrative staff, already under strain trying to cope with the changes to HECS introduced in 1997, placed under even greater pressure. The university anticipates that its future will see course offerings and research equally adversely affected.</para><para>To date—and I notice Senator Carr referred to staffing cuts—the university has lost 61 staff from its faculties: 31 academic staff and 30 general staff. The Institute of Advanced Studies, a world-class body, has lost 15 academic staff and 100 general staff, resulting in courses like archaeology and natural 
 history being discontinued at a particular level.</para><para>Earlier this year, the arts faculty discontinued Russian studies, and many of us in Canberra would have seen the student protests on the news. Last week, further staff redundancies were announced. Target loads for the university have fallen from 7,110 in 1996 to 6,180 in 1998. The undergraduate load has gone from 6,080 to 5,965 in the same period. This has caused a reduction of about $950,000 to faculties, so they are actually losing money as a consequence.</para><para>The reduction in the target load is such that the university anticipates funding fewer postgraduate positions. The university council has therefore resolved that unless the situation changes and adequate funding is restored, it will charge fees for all postgraduate students from the year 2000 onwards. So we are going to see further up-front and full fees charged as a consequence of this government's actions.</para><para>The arts and science faculties are under particular strain, and they are projected to run deficits this year. The library, of course, is one of the first places to suffer from funding cuts and indeed it is at the ANU. There was a 13 per cent rise in the cost of serials last year, and a loss of about $600,000 in purchasing power due to the decline in the value of the dollar relative to the US dollar and the pound has seen many of the serials cancelled.</para><para>The library has also had to reduce its staff levels from 157 to 138, and it has shortened opening hours as well. This has been especially problematic for mature age students and part-time students who face difficulty in accessing the library after hours and on weekends. Students without access to information technology have also been affected as they no longer have sufficient access to library computers. However, despite considerable pressure from government on universities to compensate for the funding shortfall by introducing up-front fees, I am proud to say the Australian National University has thus far resisted such pressure. The Democrats commend them for that decision.</para><para>This report highlights the situation many higher education institutions around the 
 country find themselves in as a result of this government's brutal slashing of the higher education budget. Like many other institutions, the ANU is struggling to fulfil its high aims despite the ever tightening constraints imposed by a government which fails to appreciate the many benefits which flow from the provision of readily accessible, publicly funded and high quality education.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3283</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the same report, the annual report of the Australian National University. I am a member of the council of the Australian National University. Each month I have the opportunity to sit and hear the deliberations of this truly great Australian university.</para></talk.start><para>It was interesting to listen to the previous comments, particularly in light of the general response to the initial budget savings under this government. If I recall, it took up about three minutes of the time of the council at that time. But I think what Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Carr forget is the way in which the previous Labor government tried to bring down the Australian National University in many ways. The reason was that it is a very different type of university. Senators will remember that, when Mr Dawkins was the minister, he brought in what he called the `unified national system'. It was his eastern Europe-Communism type approach: his one type of model and `let's have it all pretty much the same' type approach.</para><para>The ANU stuck out like a sore thumb in all that because it is not your typical Australian university. It has something called the Institute of Advanced Studies, which is a major research section in this university. It has a world-class research centre. The John Curtin School of Medical Research, which is part of the Institute of Advanced Studies, boasts two Nobel prize-winners in just one school of the Institute of Advanced Studies. This is a world-class research institution; a world-class university.</para><para>Let us look at what the previous Labor government tried to do to it. I was a deputy chair of the Senate Employment, Education and Training Committee that inquired into what Labor tried to do to the John Curtin 
 School of Medical Research. This was the first chink in taking the Institute of Advance Studies apart and trying to make the ANU like any other university. The then government actually moved the funding for the John Curtin School of Medical Research—this first-class research school—out of the ANU and put it under the Department of Health; it was not even under the Department of Education. Our report severely criticised what the Labor government did and was the mainspring for the action that eventually led to the restoration of the John Curtin School of Medical Research within the Institute of Advanced Studies. So the Senate had a major role in keeping the integrity of the Institute of Advanced Study in place.</para><para>The other little thing the previous Labor government tried on the ANU was to combine it with the University of Canberra, claiming that in this area there perhaps should be only one university. That would have been a major mistake. I think history has shown that both universities have very different missions and fulfil very important roles in the Canberra and southern New South Wales region. So we have the ANU at this point in time.</para><para>It is claimed in the responses to this report that the ANU has been greatly affected by budget cuts. The cuts have had some minor effects—Russian has disappeared, for example—but from where I sit on the council I cannot see these effects as being major. I am sure they are not as severe as were the cuts in the Dawkins years when university enrolments in this country expanded by 40 per cent. The commensurate finance did not expand anything like that, and therefore the universities were left struggling.</para><para>It is interesting that Senator Stott Despoja—who, like many of the Democrats, is in fantasy land—talked about `fully funded public higher education of high quality'. It is almost a contradiction in terms because the reality is that, in the current budget situation, the government cannot do that. There just is not enough public money to fund universities to the extent that is needed. Even the Labor government recognised that. Who brought in fees? It was the Labor government—a long 
 cry from the Whitlam era when universities were to be totally free.</para><para>I was in the system at that time. What actually happened in the universities during the Whitlam era, as there were no fees, was a scaling back of resources and staffing, a lengthening of the hours staff worked and a run-down in general facilities. Why? Because there was not enough money there. The Labor government was finally run over by reality. It brought in fees, encouraged universities to raise money in other ways and introduced foreign full fee paying students—all of which we applaud. That is what they should have done, and that is what we are continuing. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3284</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>ACT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to put forward some comments in relation to the annual report of the Australian National University. Listening to Senator Tierney advocate his view in relation to university funding it is quite interesting to note that, nowhere in the rhetoric that we have just heard from Senator Tierney, do we find any commitment to equity of access to higher education in this country. In fact, what we are hearing from Senator Tierney is exactly the opposite: that universities should remain open only to the elite or those who can afford to fund their access. That is the message contained within the Liberals' contribution to this particular debate. We have seen through the massive cuts to the higher education sector the manifestation of that philosophical view.</para></talk.start><para>I would like to turn my comments to the ANU and its role in our local region. As senators would know, the Canberra community has suffered many times over from cuts by this government. They are cuts that have affected our community in the harshest way, in the form of jobs and job losses. We have just heard from Senator Stott Despoja the degree to which people have lost their jobs at the ANU as a result of these cuts. Add to this the cumulative effect of public sector cuts and the flow-on to the private sector and we have a severely damaged regional economy. Education in the ACT and region represents over 30 per cent of our economy. We are very proud of our education base and it is one of our 
 great strengths in this region. The ANU is very much a centrepiece of our education infrastructure.</para><para>The ANU also plays a critical role in technological developments in areas such as AARNet and the introduction of new information services to students, and indeed to the whole network of universities around this country. At no point has this innovation and commitment to these areas been recognised by this government in a way that will sustain and enhance the role that universities have played in improving access to new information technologies. The relationship between the ANU and an absolute myriad of cooperative research centres, associated particularly with the information technology area but also a wide range of other areas, positions the ANU soundly in the structure and affords it the status of being an education leader both in our region and in Australia.</para><para>Since I was elected to this place just over two years ago I have attended many demonstrations and rallies organised by both staff and students at the ANU demonstrating against the actions of this government. The cuts are not just to university funding, affecting academic and non-academic staff. We are still feeling the effects on almost a day to day basis as the university announces cut after cut forced by those funding arrangements. But students are also affected by cuts to Austudy and changes in arrangements. My electorate office was absolutely deluged as a result of the monumental stuff-up in relation to Austudy early last year.</para><para>If these attacks on support for students and funding levels for universities continue, the upshot will be less opportunity for young Australians. The upshot, of course, will be a diminution of the status of our higher education institutions in this country. That will result in a decline in general investment in areas like research and development and commercialisation. That, in turn, will undermine our economic growth prospects. There is no denying that these cumulative effects of cuts on universities will affect these longer-term issues.</para><para>The last point I would like to make is: think of what you are doing to the morale of the 
 students in that place. Students now are facing increased fees. They are facing fewer opportunities as a result of this government. Start linking cross-portfolio areas about youth affairs and higher education. If you address the issue in the context of young people's morale, you start to see a very desolate picture being presented by this government. It has no compassion. It is not committed to the youth of Australia. What it is doing in higher education is a graphic example of that neglect. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Antarctic Science Advisory Committee</title><page.no>3285</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>3285</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the documents.</para><para>In speaking to the report <inline font-style="italic">Australia's Antarctic Program Beyond 2000—a Framework for the Future</inline> , I also want to refer to the government's response to that report which I had the pleasure to present to the Senate on behalf of the government. When the coalition government was elected, my predecessor, Senator Ian Campbell, instructed the government's Antarctic science body, the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee, to look at Australia's Antarctic program beyond the year 2000. They presented the report that is before the Senate today entitled <inline font-style="italic">A Framework for the Future</inline> . It is a significant report and one which I congratulate the Antarctic Science Advisory Committee on preparing and presenting. It is a document that I recommend that all senators who have an interest in Antarctic matters should read.</para><para>The government's response has been presented after a long consultation with people involved and interested in Australia's Antarctic program. Last Monday at the headquarters of Australia's Antarctic Division in Kingston, Hobart, I released the government's response to the staff of the division. The government's response maximises opportunities for undertaking Antarctic scientific research and it will enhance Australia's leading role in the Antarctic whilst minimising infrastructure and logistic support costs. The government has accepted ASAC's advice that a strong and 
 efficient Australian Antarctic program needs more flexible logistics and infrastructure to be able to respond more readily to changes in future needs and priorities.</para><para>I have instructed the Australian Antarctic Division to immediately commence an examination of options for a transport system that is more flexible and efficient than the present one ship system. The examination will include a multi-ship operation that would allow one vessel primarily to be devoted to the conduct of important marine scientific research. I have also instructed the division to prepare a scoping study for intercontinental air transport options for Antarctica. As part of these studies, the division will look closely at the environment and the cost considerations and at potential opportunities for cooperative cost-sharing transportation and supply arrangements with Australia's Antarctic neighbours.</para><para>Whilst accepting ASAC's advice on the importance of a cost-effective intercontinental air transport capability for `an innovative and responsive future Antarctic program', the government is determined to ensure that this capability is provided in a manner that meets the highest environmental standards and does not cause serious adverse impact. No decisions have yet been taken on how this desired capability would be provided. These decisions will be taken in the light of the scoping study and other developments, including developments in establishing cooperative international transport arrangements.</para><para>An intercontinental air transport capability will not only increase the program's scientific output but also provide potential for Australia to more effectively conduct surveillance operations in the Southern Ocean, thus providing greater environmental protection. While the government accepts the broad thrust of ASAC's report as an appropriate basis for a focused and effective program, we also carefully considered a range of public comments received and, as a result of those comments, the government has decided not to accept two aspects of the ASAC report.</para><para>I am pleased to say, in our response, that the government has decided that all four permanent Australian Antarctic research stations will be retained for the medium term 
 at least. We have ruled out the option of making the stations available for tourist use and we have confirmed our view that tourism in the Antarctic should continue to be ship based.

For some time now, there has been ecumenical prayer for mothers and unborn babies in Tasmania. Tomorrow, 28 May, a new milestone will be reached in ecumenical prayer. At 10 a.m. at Saint Therese's Catholic Church, Moonah, there will be the 300th week of the prayer. For the past six years there has been weekly prayer for mothers and unborn babies in Moonah's Anglican, Baptist, Catholic, Salvation Army and Uniting Church churches.</para></talk.start><para>This could be the longest continuing ecumenical prayer in Tasmania's history. The prayer lasts for about 20 minutes. People of all ages and all Christian faiths attend. Occasionally, there have been interstate visitors. Five Metro buses carry large paid ads for the prayer. The prayer has a very positive focus: that God will keep all Tasmanian mothers and their unborn babies safe and well.</para><para>This prayer has had great results. The advantages are of course that the prayer is ecumenical, that it is persevering, that it brings continuing help to mothers and unborn babies, that it is very gentle and non-confron

People who have an interest in the environment are always very quick to criticise and very slow to recognise good works and to congratulate those involved. The instance I want to talk about is one that I only became aware of when I recently visited the Torres Strait area, and Thursday Island in particular. Since my previous visit to Thursday Island a couple of years ago, two huge windmills have been constructed above the Thursday Island township.</para></talk.start><para>I was rather surprised that I had not heard of it. I was also surprised that the so-called people with an interest in the environment here—they are pretty limited in this Senate, but the two Greens senators do claim that and the Democrats sometimes suggest they are interested in the environment—had not mentioned it. The Labor Party, regrettably, these days seems to have no interest in the environment whatsoever. But no-one has ever mentioned these here, and none of that limited few with an interest in the environment has congratulated the Queensland government on the establishment of these wind generators.</para><para>The Queensland Minister for the Environment, the Hon. Brian Littleproud, deserves congratulations on this great environmental initiative. His colleague the Minister for Mines and Energy, the Hon. Tom Gilmore, who had a significant role in their establishment, and the Far North Queensland Electricity Board all deserve congratulations as well for their part.</para><para>These two huge windmills have been established at a cost of $2.5 million, and they supply about 10 per cent of the island's power. In doing this, they save about 359,000 litres of diesel fuel annually. That is worth about $250,000. I am told that they will pay 
 for themselves in about nine years. Although these wind generators are the latest state-of-the-art technology, previous use overseas has been fairly rudimentary.</para><para>I make no comment about the visual pollution on Thursday Island. Overseas there is also a noise pollution element, although I am told by locals on Thursday Island that noise is not a problem with these two wind generators. The two generators at Thursday Island progress the technology quite enormously, and the cost efficiency of wind generators as a power source can only improve by this initiative taken by the Queensland government and other initiatives in the like area. I congratulate the Queensland government. They have done this very significant work in the environmental area and they join with the current Commonwealth government as well in encouraging research into the use of natural resources like the sun, wind and waves for energy. So a big tick to the Queensland government for their work in the environment area. As I say, it is an initiative that, surprisingly, has not got the sort of publicity and the sort of exposure that I would have expected for it, and I am very pleased to be able to say to the Queensland government, `Good on you for this tremendous environmental work.'</para><para>While I was in the Torres Strait recently—and I was there in conjunction with the local member for the area, Mr Warren Entsch, the Liberal member for Leichhardt—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Still looking for the man with the red hat?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—In fact, that is what I am going to talk about, Senator Schacht, but I just want to say first of all that Mr Entsch, the local Liberal member for Leichhardt, does a tremendous job in his electorate generally but he is doing a very useful job in the Torres Strait area. He is very well regarded there. He has done tremendous work for the Torres Strait Islanders and he has a succession of ministers up there. Senator Herron is a regular visitor. I was up there on this occasion with Mrs Bronwyn Bishop, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. She was inspecting the 51st regiment and she was very well received. She is one of the first ministers to do the trips 
 around the islands and to actually speak with and inspect the various patrols on each island. I must say I was very impressed with the quality and standard of the patrols. The local people who form the patrols of the regiment come from all over the Torres Strait area. Many of them travel by boat for quite considerable distances to attend their regular patrol exercises.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Whilst I was up there on this occasion, I again went to Saibai Island, which is the island in the Torres Strait closest to the New Guinea mainland. We spoke there with Councillor Terry Waia, who is the chairman of the Saibai Island council. Councillor Waia is a former navy man himself, I might add, and has a good understanding of the real issues. He is a very deep thinker as well. He indicated the real problem in the islands with drug trafficking, which Senator Schacht referred to. I regret to say that when Senator Schacht was the minister he did nothing about that problem, and that is quite scandalous. The obvious trade is there. I drew that to Senator Schacht's attention many a time, but he was either incapable of or not interested in addressing this vile trade.</para><para>Councillor Waia indicated to us that the real problem is that marijuana grows very easily in New Guinea; it grows in the jungles. People in the southern New Guinea area live in abject poverty. They look with envy across the two or three kilometres of water at Australia and the Australian social service and health system and they really want to be part of it. They have no jobs, little means of getting any income and little means of providing for themselves and their families. So the easy thing for them to do is to grow the marijuana, which really grows wild, and then to transport it across the Torres Strait. Then it gets into Australia, one of the reasons being the inefficiency or couldn't-care-less attitude of the previous government. It comes through, and it is a vile trade that needs addressing. It is difficult to address, but just before I was up there, the Hon. Warren Truss, the minister for customs, was up in the islands looking at that and other issues and taking some initiatives—much more than the previous minister did, I might say, in all of the time he was there.</para><para>The thing that I did want to pass on to the Senate and to the Australian public for consideration was Councillor Waia's view that you will never really stamp this out until you do something about New Guinea. His suggestion was that Australia should really target its foreign aid to that southern New Guinea area to try to lift the living standards of the people there. At the present time they have no alternative but to engage in this vile trade. The suggestion by Councillor Waia was that if we directed and targeted our aid into that area it would lift the living standards, and their need to be reliant on that trade would be less. He sees that as one of the only really effective ways of stopping this particular problem. It is something that he explained in some detail to Mrs Bishop and myself, and to Mr Truss the previous time.</para><para>It is something that we will be taking up with the Hon. Alexander Downer, the foreign affairs minister, and it then becomes a matter of foreign aid and how that all evolves, which is not quite as simple as Councillor Waia would suggest. But it is something that really needs to be looked at. It is, as I say, a vile trade and it is one that is very difficult to stop. We really need to look at new ways. I appreciate that Councillor Waia thinks about this. He knows the damage it does to his people and to all Torres Strait Islanders, and it is useful that he has made this suggestion. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation </title><page.no>3288</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>3288</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I speak on the adjournment tonight on matters that both directly and indirectly arose out of remarks the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) made today in the Senate and elsewhere in press releases on issues relating to the ABC. Today, on several occasions during question time, you called me to order because of my robust interjecting. I accept that, under the standing orders, that was the correct thing for you to do. But I would point out that, on one occasion, the minister said during his answer to me—I think off the top of his head—in passing to Senator Sandy Macdonald, `And while you are doing that you can explain why 
 you leaked a copy of that Senate report on Telstra to Steve Lewis of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> .'</para></talk.start><para>I made a personal explanation at the end of question time, completely refuting the accusation that I had leaked the report to Steve Lewis before it had been tabled in parliament.

I accept your advice of calling me to order.</para></talk.start></continue><para>He also made another remark, and again this is a tactic of this minister that I have noticed over the last couple of years which will force people to interject and react. He said that he was meeting the ABC board this morning, which we know was correct, and that during the meeting, when he mentioned my name, there was a dead silence as though this was some sort of comment about me made in a derogatory manner.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—They'd never heard of you.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—They had never heard of me, right. That was a private meeting he had with the board members. The only way I can verify whether what he said was correct—because he used it to attack me personally—is to go and contact the ABC 
 board members and ask them, on the record, whether that event actually occurred. They will say, of course, that the meeting of the board was a private meeting and that the matters of the board are held in confidence. I accept that. But, when a minister knows that he can make those accusations and use throwaway lines and that he cannot be corrected or cannot have them verified, he leaves the person he attacked in a position where they cannot verify whether it is accurate. I believe that is unethical.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I believe that, if you are going to use and repeat private conversations which the person you are using that information to attack has no way of verifying, you will get a reaction. That got a reaction from me today. It is not the first time this minister has done this to members of the Senate and elsewhere. Unfortunately I suspect it will not be the last but, when it happens, there will be a reaction in this chamber from those of us who are the victims of that tactic.</para><para>I also want to point out that today the minister, both in his answer and in the statement he issued about his meeting with the ABC board, has now raised a number of issues about the future of the ABC and the way this government treats it. He put out late this afternoon a detailed statement about what he would like the ABC to do to overcome the alleged bias. He has suggested it should look at arrangements the BBC has and the Canadian Broadcasting Commission has as examples that he thinks they should copy.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">MACDONALD</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Do you agree with him?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—I do not agree with him at all. I believe that these issues have been raised by this minister at this board meeting just prior to the election to put pressure on the ABC—to intimidate the ABC with allegations that they are biased—to the advantage of the coalition in the coming election.</para></talk.start></continue><para>For example, he suggests that one of the things the ABC could do is to take on an example from the BBC. He says there is a BBC editorial policies unit which employs a chief political adviser to provide advice on programs dealing with political issues. The 
 BBC has probably got a dealing with the government, previously even the conservative government and now the Labor government, which has left them at arm's distance. But can you imagine what this minister would want? What he would really be after would be to put pressure on the ABC to appoint somebody who would carry out the wishes of the coalition in the coming election.</para><para>He also suggests that these matters are in the legislation carried by the previous Tory government in Great Britain and that the charter of the BBC is an example. I asked him today, by interjection, if he was going to recommend changing the charter of the ABC to carry out these wishes. That is the thing he should do—put it before the parliament. The Mansfield report of over 18 months ago made recommendations to change the charter. This minister has not responded to those recommendations to either say yea or nay or to ignore it. He does not want to go near the charter; he wants to go through the back door and intimidate the ABC in a sleazy way.</para><para>The statement from the minister, and the attachment to it raising all of these suggestions, has only one aim—to intimidate the ABC. Yet this is the minister about whom only recently, if he is looking at his own performance, the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> wrote an editorial—the newspaper that is backing this government on every aspect of the economic policies of privatisation, deregulation and tax reform introducing a GST—saying that Alston should be sacked for the way he has handled the introduction of new digital television in this country.</para><para>Today in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> there is an article by Terry McCrann—not noted for being a supporter of the Labor Party on any policies we put forward—which, over several columns, points out the hypocrisy of this minister in allowing the digital licences to be given free to the free to air television yet at the same time makes the comment that the minister was promoting himself about the spectrum option sale that took place only a few days ago. Terry McCrann's article is extremely critical—and quite derogatory—of Senator Alston's performance.</para><para>In a statement which was quoted in the question today by the minister, I raised the bizarre suggestion by the Premier of Victoria that the performance of the ABC regarding its editorial content should be referred, and is going to be referred by the Premier, to a Victorian state parliamentary committee—the economic committee, I understand. It will inquire and report, according to press reports, by March next year. This is another example of the Liberal Party's obsession with attacking the ABC. I pointed out that Mr Kennett should have it explained to him that the reason there are problems with the ABC in Victoria on content and programming is the $55 million cut that Senator Alston made to the ABC budget. Why doesn't he raise that with Mr Kennett? He did say in his statement today that he has spoken to Mr Kennett twice on this matter. He did not say whether he told him to pull his head in or whether he agreed with this further attack by the Liberal Party on the ABC.</para><para>This minister's performance is incessantly about destroying the independence, the morale and the content of the ABC and its role as a broad based, comprehensive, national broadcaster. His performance with the ABC is intimidating and bullying—that is the only method he knows—and the way he goes about it is a disgrace for the minister with the statutory responsibility to represent the ABC in this parliament. His final comment was, `I supported his right to go and raise issues with the ABC. I certainly do as the minister with the statutory responsibility.' But he should not abuse them first before he writes the letter. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Kundun</title><page.no>3290</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>3290</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I would like to talk about the new Martin Scorsese film, <inline font-style="italic">Kundun</inline> . This is a film about the life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Chinese invasion of his birth country, Tibet. It was written and co-produced by Melissa Mathison, who I understand wrote <inline font-style="italic">ET</inline> . So on a lot of levels, this is an important film.</para></talk.start><para>The film opened in the United States and Canada on 16 January this year. In Australia, the original distributors, Village Roadshow, 
 did not want to screen the movie and there were fears that we would miss out on viewing this most important film on the life of the Dalai Lama. Happily though, independent distributor, New Vision, has taken up that challenge. The national release of the film is next week—the week beginning 1 June.</para><para>The release of <inline font-style="italic">Kundun</inline> in the United States has been surrounded by controversy. China is reportedly not pleased with the Disney Corporation's support of <inline font-style="italic">Kundun</inline> and has made it clear that such support could damage the company's attempt to expand into the Chinese market—and that could include film and video releases, merchandise and probably a Disney theme park in Shanghai. So heated has the pressure been that Disney has hired former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, to advise it on the handling of the issue with the Chinese authorities and to ensure that the release of the film in northern America was low key.</para><para>The Chinese government say they believe <inline font-style="italic">Kundun</inline> is `intended to glorify the Dalai Lama' and is `interference in China's internal affairs'. This is the standard response of the Chinese authorities when dealing with issues relating to Tibet and the Dalai Lama. Their attempt to displace international criticism by claiming international interference only adds to the criticism. If China had remained silent on the release of this film, I am sure very little negative attention would have been directed towards them. After all, we all have a right to access these stories, especially one which details the events of the life of a spiritual leader as important as the Dalai Lama.</para><para>Disney has released <inline font-style="italic">Kundun</inline> in only 439 cinemas in the United States compared with 2,500 for <inline font-style="italic">Seven Years in Tibet</inline> and 2,767 for <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline>. We are told that this release to 439 cinemas is typical for an art-house release film. But <inline font-style="italic">Seven Years in Tibet</inline> could itself hardly be considered mainstream. It had an art-house release here in Australia, but it was released through nearly five times the number of cinemas. Then, of course, there is the alternative theory. That suggests that Village Roadshow's decision not to distribute the film here, and Disney's limited release in the 
 United States, have more to do with commercial interests in China than with the telling of an important biographical story. Interestingly, <inline font-style="italic">Kundun</inline> was nominated for four Academy Awards, including best art direction, cinematography, costume design and original drama score.</para><para>So what is the film about? Why would it be considered to be so contentious by the Chinese? <inline font-style="italic">Kundun</inline> is a Tibetan term for the Dalai Lama, and, literally translated, means `presence'. The film chronicles the life of the Dalai Lama from his childhood through the Chinese occupation and his journey into exile in India. Through the charting of such an extraordinary life—and it really is quite an extraordinary life—we see a young, playful child grow into a figure who raises the world's consciousness about the Buddhist spirit and society, the plight of Tibet and the sufferings of the Tibetan people. The Dalai Lama has stood tall on the world stage, refusing to sacrifice the Buddhist principle of non-violence throughout his country's long resistance to Chinese rule. Those who appear in the film are not actors. They are Tibetan people who know the suffering of their own people inside Tibet and the human rights abuses they have endured. In this very credible film, we are exposed to the religious and cultural persecution of some of the world's most peaceful people.</para><para>To help understand the importance of this story, I will just give a brief outline of the history of Tibet since the Chinese invasion of 1949-50. Mao Zedong's communist government invaded Tibet in 1950. A treaty was imposed on the Tibetan government in May of that year, although it is considered invalid because it was signed under duress. In 1959, a national uprising saw the Dalai Lama take flight into India where he and the Tibetan government-in-exile now reside. The international community reacted with shock at the events in Tibet at the time. The question of Tibet has been discussed on numerous occasions by the UN General Assembly, which has passed three resolutions condemning China's violation of human rights in Tibet, and has called on China to respect those 
 rights, including Tibet's right to self-determination.</para><para>The destruction of Tibet's culture and the oppression of its people has been brutal. Approximately 1.2 million Tibetans, one-fifth of the country's population, have died as a result of China's policies. Many more languish in prisons and labour camps, and more than 6,000 monasteries, temples and other cultural and historic buildings have been destroyed. Chinese authorities continue to refuse to meet with the Dalai Lama.</para><para>The dialogue called for by the international community, including Australian governments—successive ones I am proud to say—is designed to resolve the question of the status and the rights of Tibet and its people. Constructive dialogue should not be seen to be threatening in any way. Indeed, China would receive greater respect from the international community if they entered into such a dialogue. In recent years the situation in Tibet has deteriorated. One of the principal factors is the large influx of Chinese into Tibet, particularly into its major towns, where they now outnumber the local Tibetan population by up to three to one. Such intense transmigration has a significantly negative impact on the cultural and the religious life of Tibetans and adds to the political and military control of the Chinese authorities inside Tibet itself.</para><para>In many ways the screening of films like <inline font-style="italic">Kundun</inline> is one of the few motivations for the community to discuss issues relating to Tibet but, more generally, to discuss issues relating to the persecution of one group of people by another. Looking through the eyes of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people, perhaps we can all gain a sense of our own spirituality, of our own sense of justice and the importance of recognising the universality of human rights. The common interests between Australia and China are such that the release of this film will not do any long-term damage, or probably short-term damage, to our two countries' relations.</para><para>After all, Australia is a democracy, and we have the right to see movies which present points of view which might be contrary to the government's point of view. Can we imagine what this country would be like if we did not 
 have a strong rule of law? Can we imagine what the country would be like if political censorship meant that we were not able to see films produced by such a noted filmmaker as Mr Martin Scorsese, no matter what their particular subject matter? As a democratic and independent nation, we should not permit such outrageous censorship to occur. I am so pleased that in this case it has not occurred.</para><para>The Australian Democrats congratulate New Vision for the courage of their decision to screen this movie in Australia. I am hoping that <inline font-style="italic">Kundun</inline> will be screened here in Parliament House so that all of those who work in this place will have the opportunity to see it. I have contacted the presiding officers, Madam President, on this matter, and I understand that you are considering it. I sincerely hope that the screening does go ahead. If it does, I would encourage all senators to attend. I most certainly look forward to seeing this film.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legal Aid</title><page.no>3292</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>3292</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bourne has spoken about the essential nature of the rule of law; that society does not go well unless it is underpinned by the rule of law. Parliament makes the law, together with the courts in certain circumstances. The executive carries them out, and the courts interpret them and apply them in specific cases. It is in that situation that the courts make some of the law under which we live. As Senator Bourne has pointed out, the three arms of government are absolutely essential for the wellbeing of society. It is in that context that I want to make some remarks about the response of the government to the report brought down by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, about which Senator McKiernan spoke so well this afternoon.</para></talk.start><para>The three arms of government can work only if they have proper infrastructure to support them. The magnificent work that the parliament does, in the Senate in particular, led so well led by its president, is able to be carried out only because of the staff that you yourself have often praised, Madam President, and because of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, the clerks and so on. You really do need an infrastructure to make 
 things work well. Again, with the executive, it has the Public Service to help it carry out its proper function. Similarly, courts need an infrastructure. They need cases properly presented. They need people to know what they are about. They need people who are either charged before them or who have a case before them to be properly represented.</para><para>It is in that context that we should see the importance of the provision of legal aid. We often think in this society that legal aid is an attachment to social security services rather than integral to the system of law under which we operate. I think it is that concept that has misled whoever wrote the answer to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report. That report is a considerable contribution to the legal aid debate in this country. Unfortunately, the person who put in the answer to this report has failed to see the essential nature of what the report is saying.</para><para>The report is saying that the judiciary, the rule of law, is important. We need to make sure that the infrastructure that supports the courts, that underpins the judiciary, is proper and efficient. To see that done, proper aid must be given to those who cannot otherwise properly present their case. Unfortunately, the report has been written without that in mind. It has been written in very economic terms, and that is a great shame because the provision of legal services to people who need them in this community is one of the fundamental duties of society to provide. Unfortunately, they are not being provided properly at this moment.</para><para>Madam President, I perhaps should declare an interest in talking about the provision of legal services. I have a daughter-in-law, Emma Hunt, who is a community lawyer in North Melbourne; my son Sean, up until recently, was on the Committee of the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights Centre; another son, Jerome, up until a little while ago, gave voluntary services in a community legal centre; and my wife, Lillian, as a practising lawyer does give freely from time to time of her, may I say, outstanding abilities for nothing. I declare those interests in this area. </para><para>Nevertheless, the point remains that the profession, as was acknowledged by the attorney, is outstanding in terms of the pro bono or free work they have given to uphold the rule of law. We have community legal workers who do the same. We have legal aid systems which are under extraordinary strain. With their considerable altruism, they are all giving of their time and their ability entirely in the interests of making sure that people get what are their fundamental entitlements in this society.</para><para>I am a bit concerned that this reply has not addressed those issues. One reason for my saying that can be seen from a particular recommendation and its response. That recommendations reads:</para><para>The Committee recommends that the Government give consideration to establishing a high level representative task force to advise Governments on the legal aid system and its place in Australia's justice system.</para><para>The response following reads:</para><para>The Government is satisfied that existing mechanisms for provision of research and policy advice to the Government are sufficient to allow the Government to foster reform and ensure more cost effective service delivery and greater national equity in the provision of services.</para><para>As I said before, the whole culture of this answer is an economic culture when it should be a culture of justice and human rights. It is essential to take economic factors into account in any situation where governments must make a decision—but they should not override the priority that should be given to human rights in the rule of law.</para><para>In this response, there is no mention of an exercise which at the moment is being carried out by the federal government—and that is an exercise trying to determine just what the legal aid needs of Australians are. The government itself is conducting that inquiry, and that inquiry is being undertaken now. This response makes no mention of it.</para><para>Moreover, if the government is carrying out this inquiry, how can it be so assured in its response that everything is being done as it should be done? How can this response contain the statement that all seems to be going well? That is the impression we get by reading this document—yet the government 
 itself is carrying out research at this very moment to find out more. One would think that at the very least what should have been done was that the attorney give a reply but, additionally, he now also should undertake to give a further reply when he receives this research.</para><para>The last point I want to make is this: the provision of legal aid is taken very, very seriously by other nations. I did want to continue with a point about British legal aid under former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, but I see that I have run out of time so I will stop there.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>19:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>3294</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.57 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>3294</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>3294</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Antarctic Science Advisory Committee—Australia's Antarctic program beyond 2000: A framework for the future—</para><para>	 Our Antarctic future: The Howard Government response, May 1998.</para><para>	 Report, October 1997.</para><para></para><para>Australian National University Act—Australian National University—Report for 1997.</para><para>Maritime College Act—Australian Maritime College—Report for 1997.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>3294</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Export Control Act—Export Control (Orders) Regulations—Livestock Export (Merino) Orders (Amendment)—Export Control Orders No. 1 of 1998.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</inline> —RHQ Company Determination No. 5 of 1998.</para><para>Public Service Act—Foreign Affairs and Trade Determinations 1998/4 and 1998/5.</para><para>Sydney Airport Curfew Act—Dispensation granted under section 20—Dispensation No. 3/98.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>UNPROCLAIMED LEGISLATION</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>3294</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following document was tabled pursuant to standing order 139(2):</para><para>Unproclaimed Legislation—Document providing details of all provisions of Acts which come into effect on proclamation and which have not been proclaimed, including statements of reasons for their non-proclamation and information relating to the timetable for their operation as at 1 May 1998.</para><para></para></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>3295</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Export Finance Investment Corporation</title><page.no>3295</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1091)</subtitle><id.no>1091</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3295</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, upon notice, on 11 March 1998.</para></talk.start><para>Can details be provided including the name of the proponent, the title and nature of the project or transaction, the date of application, the date of approval, the value of the project or transaction and the value of the insurance provided of any resource project or transaction which the Export Finance Investment Corporation has approved for support since 1 October 1997, with regard to; (a) mining projects: (b) mineral shipments; (c) export woodchip shipments; (d) dams; and (e) renewable energy industries.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3295</page.no><name role="metadata">Parer, Sen Warwick</name><name role="display">Senator Parer</name><name.id>KI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Resources and Energy</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>During the period 1 October 1997 to 28 February 1998 the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC):</para><para></para><para>(a) approved a facility for one mining project: an export finance guarantee relating to the expansion and upgrading of the existing Sarcheshmeh copper smelter in Iran.
