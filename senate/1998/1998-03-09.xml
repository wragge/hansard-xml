Did I not provide you with an answer to that? I remember I had a discussion with Senator Neal about the penalty rates for breaches that we did by negotiation in early 1997. The activity test breaches include where a person who is required to satisfy an activity test fails to do so or fails to satisfy any requirements relating to youth allowance activity agreements that apply to the person under subdivision (e) of division 1; where the person has refused or failed without reasonable excuse to accept a suitable offer of employment; where the person refuses or fails without reasonable excuse to provide information in relation to the person's income from remunerative work when required to do so; where the person knowingly or recklessly provides false or misleading information in relation to their income when required to do so. It goes on from there. There is nothing extraordinary about them. They are not what you might be driving at, which I would call administrative breaches.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>567</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister, you mentioned `failed to satisfy any requirements', and that was fairly early in the list. There were some more deliberate points on the list later on, but failing to satisfy any of the requirements could be a technical breach. I know it says the third breach, but notification of a breach might not actually reach the person. How would a person know, for instance, that they had breached once or twice? For instance, if they breached once and they had been notified but their address was not accurate, could it not be possible that they could breach more than once and not know that they had breached?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>567</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator, I do not think you could have been in the chamber when this was all discussed very thoroughly.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">MARGETTS</name><name role="display">Senator Margetts</name></talker><para>âI was in the chamber.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>âNot just last Thursday but also when we were changing the requirements for breaches a year or more ago.

Even though a person lost their benefit, there may still be something which was out of the person's control. What I am specifically asking about is whether there is any discretion involved here. If there was no discretion involved in the previous applications of the term penalties or breaches, how can you say that a person will not be treated unfairly? Is there any discretion involved in the definition of breaches? Can a person judgeâeven if there are three breachesâ 
 whether or not a person has been treated fairly?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>568</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI think Senator Margetts, in talking about technical breaches, is referring to administrative breaches which are regarded as a lesser order, like not returning a form on time, for example. There is no discretion, as I understand it, as to whether something is determined to be an administrative breach, which gets a lesser penalty, and an activity test breach, which has the penalties that I just spelled out to you. It is very important to understand that there are two kinds of breaches: one is less serious and the other group is more serious.</para></talk.start><para>The officers do not have an opportunity to distinguish between those two. If it is an administrative breach, one lot of rules apply. If it is an activity test breach, another lot of rules apply. Within that area people who are not satisfied with the decision of the determining officer have the right to ask for a review, which is done by an authorised review officer, an ARO.

 took people off payments altogether regardless of their offence. We were agreeable to that. So we did as was suggested by Senator Harradine.

Yes, this connection with newstart did exist under the previous government, but the minister has forgotten to remind the chamber that there have been many changes in the industrial relations law since then.

While there may be provisions similar to clause 553A that have already been enactedâand I think an example is section 596 of the Social Security ActâI am very concerned, as are my Democrat colleagues, that this sort of provision is inconsistent both with a number of existing laws and with our understanding of internationally recognised labour laws and labour rights.</para></talk.start><para>The clear imputation of proposed section 553A is that if you are unemployed because you are involved in industrial action, then you bear the onus of proof of satisfying the department that you were not a member of the trade union. I am curious as to whether this is your reading too, Senator Margetts, but I believe this is inconsistent with the Workplace Relations Act which specifically protects the right to take industrial action in some circumstances. It is arguably inconsistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which says that everyone has the right to freedom of association with others and that that right should not be restricted. I think this provision, along with a number of others, is a particularly sinister provision and it is one we should reject in this bill.

They are slightly different words, but I am advised that it has exactly the same effect as that for the newstart allowance, which was amended with some amendments from the Democrats to that effect last year.

I look forward to hearing the minister's elaboration.</para><para>I have noticed while just looking over Senator Margetts's shoulder that there have been some arguments proffered by the government for a number of their objections on amendments. I have not actually seen thatâI am not quite sure why. Perhaps that has gone to my office and I have not had an opportunity to read it. I do not really think that designating these young people, or in some cases their parent or guardian, as crimi 
 nals by enforcing up to six months imprisonment upon them is an appropriate punitive action. A penalty unit under the Crimes Act is the equivalent of, I understand, $110. It is probably worth noting that under Corporations Law I believe the penalty is $100, but it would not surprise me that there would be a differentiation in the way we treat people who are on benefits of some kind as opposed to people at the big end of town.</para><para>First of all, I ask the minister whether this penalty for failure to comply applies not only to young people in receipt of the allowance but to their guardians and parents as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>577</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt applies to only the young person.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>577</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn some ways perhaps we could call these kinds of amendments the former Senator Christabel Chamarette amendments because, as people would be aware, in debates on every social security bill former Senator Chamarette used to stand up and make it very clear that these kinds of imprisonment penalties were very inappropriate for so-called non-punitive bills. I keep reminding the minister of this, and that you are already dealing with many people who are struggling to survive. Of course, the deaths in custody reports consistently say that these kinds of penalties are inappropriate for what might in effect be breaches due to poverty. So I go along with the changes.

Is it not sufficient to explicitly state a penalty that is not in a form of imprisonment? I cannot see how any less clear the penalty or punitive aspect could be if you stated `penalty units'; if you stated what a penalty unit equalsâif you made it clear that 30 times, I believe, 110 is a big fat penalty.

We believe our proposal is clearer to customers and it is consistent with other payments to leave that imprisonment penalty in the legislation. We certainly do not want to have the calculation of different penalties undertaken by 20,000 staff. You can imagine the difficulties that you would get with inconsistency and the concerns that Welfare Rights, for example, might have when people are not being treated consistently.

The Democrats have put on record a number of times that we believe the government's concocted ages of independence are inconsistent, irrational and a sham. That is why we seek not only to get some degree of consistency in terms of the age at which young people and students are considered independent, but also to call on the opposition to commit to their previous record, which was reducing the age at which a student was considered independent from 25 to 22. So I look forward to hearing Senator Neal's comments in relation to the age of independence for a student as well as that for young unemployed.</para><para>I do acknowledge some of the debates that took place in this chamber last week, in particular the very compelling arguments from Senator Harradine. I note that he put on record his concern at the pressure that the proposed bill would put on Australian families, that perhaps lower and middle income earners would be hit harder because they would be expected to look after their children not only in an emotional sense but also in a financial sense until these children were young adultsâup to 21 in cases to do with young unemployed and up to the age of 25 with respect to students. The Democrats have made clear our objections to that, but it was good to hear Senator Harradine's concern with not only the impact that that would have 
 on familiesânegative or otherwiseâbut also the stress and inconsistencies it would have on our taxation system.</para><para>On Thursday I learnt that perhaps some changes had been discussed between the government and the Independent senator. I am just wondering, given that I am moving these amendments now, what assurances or deals or otherwise the government has made with Senator Harradine that will alleviate the financial and other impacts of this legislation on families. Perhaps it is not appropriate for me and others to go ahead with our amendments because the changes that were debated last week between the government and Senator Harradine are so good for families and so good for young people that we do not need to alleviate some of the harshest aspects of this legislation.</para><para>First of all, I would like the minister to explain: what assurances has the government given Senator Harradine? What changes will be madeâspecifically, explicitlyâto the taxation system to make sure that families do not feel the increased burden of this legislation? Perhaps that might convince us that we do not need to reduce the age of independence. Of course, we would not actually do that. We are dead keen to go ahead with the notion that we recognise in law and tax and otherwise that young people are adults at at least the age of 18 and that this legislationâthe Commonwealth youth allowance legislation and other social security legislationâshould reflect that fact.</para><para>In the same way that it benefits the government under other legislative frameworksâbe it to do with child support and maintenance or whether it is to do with the family tax initiativeâit suits the government to define young people as adults at 18, or at 16 in the case of the latter, so why not with the common youth allowance? Why is it that there is this huge gap between 18 in some cases and 25 under this legislation? Why is the government going ahead with this ridiculous notion that for a full-time student to meet the independent criteria they have to be 25 years of age?</para><para>I am looking forward to the government outlining how this will not impact harshly on 
 families and the specifics of the deal or otherwise that has been done with the Independent senator in this place that is designed, allegedly, to alleviate some of that burden and to change our taxation system. I am looking forward to being enlightened now as to how this legislation and its framework will be changing as a consequence of the government's deal last week.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>580</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have some questions to add to that for the minister to look at at the same time. In addition to what Senator Stott Despoja was saying in relation to the proposed tax changes, how will it help a family which is already disadvantaged and not paying tax if they get a tax advantage, considering they may be paying little or no tax to start with? So, how could you, in a tax system, alleviate the disadvantages that these changes are bringing about?</para></talk.start><para>The Greens (WA) amendment is identical to the one moved by the Democrats under Senator Stott Despoja so we will be supporting this. It reduces the age of independence to 18 for both students and unemployed. This makes sense. It makes sense for young people to be considered as independent while they are developing their independence, not after it. The current definitions of `dependent' and `independent' are confusing to understand. The minister has, just this very morning, spoken on the mantra of consistency. On a number of occasions the minister has said how we confuse social security offices if we are inconsistent. Here is the government's chance. In relation to the age of independence, there is no consistency at all between government departments let alone with the norms of society.</para><para>In their submission to the Price Report, the Sydney University Students Representative Council stated clearly the contradictions of the current system. They said:</para><para>The government continues to force citizens, who in every other respect (voting, health, insurance, licenses, alcohol etc) are seen as full citizens, to be relegated to the status of "dependent" if they happen to choose tertiary education. Our case work overwhelmingly shows that the majority of students are financially self-supporting from age 18 even if they live in the family home. 
</para><para>Given that a person on attaining the age of 18 is considered to be an independent adult for the purposes of all other laws, it is illogical that students be considered financially dependent on their parents. For instance, you can put them into prisons with adults, can you not, Minister? It is illogical that students be considered financially dependent on their parents. The age of 18 is also the time that people become responsible for their own debts, including HECS debts and the Austudy supplement.</para><para>So the government and the ALP are saying that it is okay to create a debt to the government independent of your parents, but not acceptable to receive assistance from the government independent of your parents. This is double standards of the worse kind. We understand that the idea of reducing the age of independence to 18 may be a pretty radical idea to some in the chamber. It is the position of students and welfare groups, those having to deal with the consequences of government policy, not those who sit in their ivory towers and create policy.</para><para>But I do make an appeal to the ALP as the potential government to seriously consider supporting the call from young people and the young parties to support this entirely sensible and consistent amendment. Up until 1996 it was the ALP's stated position that the age of independence be set at 21âwith many ALP politicians stating in education forums that 18 was the desired figure in the long term. However, the ALP's policy position seems to have been omitted from their amendments. While we strongly argue for the age of independence to be 18, we ask the ALP, at the very least, to stick to their policy in government; that is, for the age of independence to be 21 for now with a view to lowering it to 18 in a progressive fashion.</para><para> We will get to those other amendments later. At that stage I will talk about various past inquiries and studies into the age of independence, with a view to gaining some understanding of contemporary opinion on the matter. So when we get to the next amendment I will go further into that. If members of the ALP are going to stand up in public fora amongst young people who count and who 
 vote from the age of 18, then put your money and your vote where you mouth is and support the Democrats and the Greens (WA) amendment to reduce the age of independence consistently to the age of 18.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>NaN:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>581</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe effect of this amendment is to make the age of independence 18 for both students and unemployed. You might recall that the opposition argued quite strongly last week that those who were unemployed be treated as adults and given the same benefits as other adults even though they are between the ages of 18 and 20. But this amendment goes substantially further than that. It also brings down the age of independence for students to 18. That is a step we cannot take and the opposition will not be supporting this amendment.</para></talk.start><para>There will be some further debate about the exact age of independence for students.

I assume that you are all very well aware of it.</para><para>There is some difficulty arguing that a person who is not seeking work but has made a decision to opt out of work to take up the advantages of higher education should receive an income from taxpayers. There is some concern in the community that the taxpayers, as well as paying for some substantial part of their education, should be paying them an income from the time they leave school. That is why we are having to weigh it up with demands in other areas like health and education and with demands from people in very dire circumstances. We find it very hard to justify saying that from the age of 18 students who are having the advantage of tertiary education should also be receiving that sort of benefit almost immediately.</para><para>As to the exact age of independence for students, during our time in government we were moving to a point where we saw the age of independence for students as being 21 and we were moving gradually over time to reach that point. We still believe that we should be 
 moving over time to that point but have some concerns about adopting that position immediately. Senator Carr will be discussing that issue more when he moves the opposition amendment in that area.

I am happy to reiterate what I deliberately asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate on the last occasion I had a questionâI was going to say `without notice', but I will say deliberately that I had a question to direct to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>That question was deliberately asked of the Leader of the Government as representing the Prime Minister in this place. In effect, the essence of the question was, should not essential income transfers within a family be also recognised within the taxation system, and is it the intention of the government to include in its restructuring of the Australian taxation system a measure to give further recognition to the functions of parents in raising sons and daughters, Australia's future taxpayers?</para><para>That question was quite deliberately asked on the basis that we had been given quite definite statements by the Minister for Social 
 Security on behalf of the government, and indeed by other ministers in the government, publicly earlier last week that, if there were substantial amendments made by the Senate to this legislation, those amendments would obviously need to go down to the House of Representatives. The government had no intention of supporting those amendments in the House of Representatives. Under those circumstances, they would send the bill back to the Senate and, if we insisted, the bill would in effect go into limbo.</para><para>Under those circumstances I think we in the chamber needed to consider those matters, and the question was, when did we need to consider them? You might argue that it could have been a good idea to send the bill back there and give a bit of a chance to deal with the matter. But the problem is that, had we done that, we would have disadvantaged some 27.5 or 28 per cent of current youth allowance recipients who stood to gain from the legislation.</para><para>As I understand it, 64 per cent of youth allowance recipients would not in fact have their youth allowance changed, six per cent would incur some sort of reduction in their youth allowance and two per cent would lose the youth allowance altogether. The other 0.5 per cent would not be eligible because they would take a deliberate decision not to be involved with this measure. Under those circumstances, I did deliberately ask that question of the minister, having, as some of you may have seen, spoken to the Prime Minister. The government leader stated quite categorically:</para><para>I can, therefore, assure Senator Harradine that in restructuring the Australian taxation system, to which this government is committed, the government will give further recognition and help to Australian parents concerning their responsibilities in . . . raising sons and daughters, Australia's future taxpayers.</para><para>I am aware, and others will be aware, that there are some in government who may not wish to see that situation, but the Prime Minister is committed to it and he committed his government, not just himself, not to consider further recognition but in fact to give further recognition and help, to use his words,

So let me explain precisely what the government has done to date on this issue. I notice once again that Senator Schacht is left floundering on the subject. When we gave our commitment to regional Australia on 25 November last year I announced measures to minimise both consumer costs and the potentially disruptive effects of the remote area broadcasting services digital conversionâobviously a very important issue for those in remote areas.</para></talk.start><para>Those measures included funding of $11.2 million, which was administered through the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. That enabled the Commonwealth to 
 provide a contribution of $750 towards a new digital decoder for households with direct to home satellite reception and $2,500 towards the replacement of each existing decoder in remote Aboriginal and self-help community retransmission sites.</para><para>The retransmission arrangements in Western Australia have also resulted in the availability for the first time in remote and regional areas of a local satellite delivered SBS television service and new radio services, including Triple J and the Parliamentary News Network. As a result of the government's initiatives, remote area viewers will gain access to significant new services for the subsidised cost of a digital decoder. The important thing to remember is that the government does not control the way in which privately owned networks operate. I know you believe in simply telling people how to run their businesses. That is what you want to do with Telstra. You want to keep a ministerial power of direction there. You want to fundamentally undermine the commercial operations of privately owned businesses by telling them how to do it. The fact is that they make those decisions.

In other words, the matter is squarely within the responsibility of the ABA at this point in time. If you think that Hendy Cowan scoring a few cheap political shots should be regarded as somehow providing a policy solution, then you have no idea about the difference between politics and policies. Mr Cowan was simply trying to capitalise on the fact that, much in all to our regret, that signal went off air.

 publication of this report. I would have thought ATSIC, a body that is now led by a man whom I think we all respect, should welcome the fact that the facts relating to native title are now on the table. Why on earth would ATSIC want to hide the truth about the hopeless operation of Labor's Native Title Act?</para><para>The truth is that the current act simply is not working; and our amendments are a fair and balanced package to fix the problem that we were left with by the Labor government. The truth is, as ATSIC acknowledges, without a decent registration testâand there was no registration in the act left to us by the Labor Partyâwe have, as ATSIC has admitted in its report, an enormous problem of massive numbers of unresearched, overlapping ambit claims covering vast areas of Australia. As is indicated in the report, there are 42 single claims in the Western Australian goldfields area alone, and they all overlap; every one of the 42 claims overlaps.</para><para>Our bill does provide a sensible registration test. But where is the Labor Party? You are not supporting it, are you. You will not support a decent registration test.</para><para>The truth is, as revealed by ATSIC, that the right to negotiate process is having a disastrous impact on Australia's mining industry. Ninety per cent of proposed Western Australian mining tenements are being held up under the Native Title Act. As the ATSIC report says, the bottom line is that, before the WA government started using the right to negotiate process, about 2,800 tenements were in the system at any one time; after using the process, the number has increased to 7,400. More than double the number of tenements are now caught up in the process, damaging the national economy.</para><para>Our amendments streamline the right to negotiate process in a fair and sensible way, and the most important thing is that they ensure equal treatment for Australian farmers and native title claimants on pastoral leasesâsomething the Labor Party refuses to support. The truth is that our bill implements the Wik decision and recognises and protects native title on pastoral leasesâand that is also 
 admitted by ATSIC in this very important report.</para><para>ATSIC also revealed, quite interestingly, that only 30 per cent of the 700 native title claims that have so far been lodged have gone through representative bodies. So the representative bodiesâwhom we support and want to fix up with our amendments; and we do think they should handle the claimsâhave had $130 million of taxpayers' money since the act came into effect, they are only handling about 230 of the 700 claims, and only two have come out the other end. So that works out at about $600,000 of taxpayers' money for every claim that has been lodged through the native title representative bodies. And what do we have? Nothing to show for it.</para><para>This ATSIC report is very important. It demonstrates the unworkability of the current act, which would be made worse by Labor's amendments. Labor is trying to gag Father Frank Brennanânot a supporter of the government on most issues; you are trying to gag him, using Peter Yu of the indigenous working group, because he thinks your amendment on the Racial Discrimination Act is a lot of nonsense.

This is a very important issue. As I have said, our bill does guarantee equal rights for farmers and native title claimants. And the most glaring and appalling proposition put by the Labor Party is to ensure legalised racial discrimination on Australia's farms. You want to entrench discrimination 
 against Australian farmers, based on race.

An important element of Employment Nationalâwho has the responsibility for the screens in Centrelinkâwill be that they are out getting jobs from all over the country to be on the register. Previously, unemployed people would go to the CES offices and would find that most of the jobs were not there.</para><para>It is very important that people who are mobile like the defence forces have access to a good range of jobs from right around the country.

The coalition government is proud that on 27 February this year, about two weeks ago, the National Environment Protection Council agreed to a national pollutant inventory for Australia. This is the first of the national environment protection measures to be made by the National Environment Protection Council. It will be tabled on 
 10 March 1998. Honourable senators will be aware that this was a mechanism to provide for cooperative environment protection laws across Australiaâbeing supported by laws of both the Commonwealth government and the state governments.</para></talk.start><para>The history of this process is interesting. The Labor Party talked about the national pollutant inventory in 1992 and they were still talking about it when they went out of government in 1996. They commissioned some six-odd reports on the subject matter but were never able to bring it to a conclusion. In fact the NEPC legislation was passed in 1994. But, by the time we came to government in 1996, Senator Faulkner as chairman still had not been able to call the first face-to-face meeting. So after two years there had not been a face-to-face meeting of ministers. It was left to the coalition government to stop the talking and get on with some action for a change. That is what we have been able to do.</para><para>We are pleased that this first NEPM has now been announced. It will provide an information base for all Australians on the pollutants that are released into our environment. The community will be better informed as a result of that. Furthermore, as a result of the community being better informed, it is a reasonable assumption that industry will respond with better practicesâbetter practices in reducing the levels of pollutants and better practices in managing pollutants that are created. That is a good start.</para><para>The second NEPM, on ambient air measure, should be completed by the middle of this year. A third NEPM, dealing with the transfer of hazardous waste across state boundaries, should be completed also by about that timetable. So during the course of this parliament there will be at least three of these cooperative environment measures introduced for Australia as a wholeâa clear indication that this government is able, in the environment area, to get on and provide the sorts of protections that Australians want; to provide them in a cooperative way that includes all governments; to provide for consistency of environmental laws, which is not only good for the community but also good for business that has to comply with such obligations; and, 
 most importantly, to lead to better environmental outcomes.</para><para>We are pleased that finally Australia is governed by a government that is doing less talking in these important areas, providing a little more action and bringing some of these important matters finally to conclusion.

Let us get the record straight about what this government is saying. You have to listen to the words very carefully. The minister has said that nobody will be turned 
 away from an agency, that nobody will be turned away from a provider. But he does not say what type of service they will actually get when they go to that provider.</para><para>I can tell you what the story is, because I think you need a bit of a lesson over there about what is happening with the employment services market. If you did not, why would Mrs Bishop have given you a briefing at Thredbo about the difficulties she was encountering when she went around Australia, particularly in relation to the defence force personnel spouses, in selling this particular policy of Dr Kemp's? Let us be quite explicit about what is happening here.</para><para>The first thing is FLEX 1, which is job matching and that involves, as Senator Newman gave us the usual old run-down, touch screens, et cetera. Dr Kemp says that anybody has access to that. Let me point out to you an example. On Thursday Mrs Lawrence, in the House of Representatives, pointed to an example in Western Australia where somebody was unemployed, not on benefit, wished to apply for a job as a fitter and was told that he would have to pay $220 for thatâjust for being matched to a job. This person was not on benefit, was a retrenched worker and wanted to apply for a job but is told that he would have to pay $220 to do that.</para><para>What is unusual about this example? It is illegal in Western Australia to charge for unemployment services. But where it is not illegal it is going to become routine. It is not illegal in Tasmania; it is not illegal in the ACT; it is not illegal in the Northern Territory; and it is not illegal in South Australia. In fact, in South Australia you can be paid retrospectively. That is the story of FLEX 1âthat is, job matchingâyou will have to pay.</para><para>Let us move on to what is called FLEX 3âthis is intensive assistance. This is where the weasel words really come out. In fact, Senator Ellison in estimates the other day said, `Dr Kemp has not actually said anything about intensive assistance.' Intensive assistance is what you get if you have been unemployed for 12 months or more. Under this new regime, if you have been unemployed for 12 months or more and are not on benefit you will not get a cracker. That is the reality. Who 
 says that? Not just the opposition but also Employment National.</para><para>At estimates last Friday Employment National was asked the direct question: will you be providing, for nothing, intensive assistanceâthat is FLEX 3 assistanceâto long-term unemployed people who are not on benefit in keeping with Dr Kemp's own promise? What was their response? I can recall it very well; it was noânot even an embellishment, just no. So then we asked: so you are not one of the providers who has actually gone to Dr Kemp and said that you are happy to provide services for nothing? They said, `No, we're not.'</para><para>Employment National, in case people on the other side have forgotten, has 40 per cent of the market share of intensive assistance. So in one fell swoop we have the government's own Employment National saying, `We will not provide any intensive assistance for long-term unemployed people who are not on benefit.' That is a complete repudiation of the government's position. As I said, Senator Ellison came in and said, `Dr Kemp did not actually talk about intensive  assistance; he was really talking about job matching and touch screens, et cetera.'</para><para>The bottom line about this whole systemâand people in the government know itâis that it is a mess. Day after day we actually come up with examples of maladministration of this so-called probity exercise, which actually created the likes of Mr Roude. It is a mess. I for one am absolutely amazed that you have done it in the way you have actually done it. What you are about is putting 400,000 Australians on the unemployment scrap heap and making sure they do not get access to services. In fact, the resources that you have allocated bear no resemblance at all, as far as I can see, to long-term employment. You have made a mistake.

Let's look at some of the results of your 13 years. You had a situation where, in the six years from July 1990 to March 1996, you had a net increase in employment of 16,000 people. Wow!

You did not come within a bull's roar of achieving your target, Senatorânot a chance. And it was because of the failed programs of the previous Labor government. Under our schemes we have set up incentives for people to be employed. People are out there in a market driven system with the incentives to employ people and they do not get paid their full money unless the people find a job. That is far better than your system. Working Nation was a failure; the Job Network system will succeed. And in the two days to date you 
 have come up with nothing.

That is an abbreviated statement of what they said but they were not prepared to bring it back.</para></talk.start><para>Then at estimates last week we were told, `We can talk to you about the general principles of this tendering out process but of course we can't talk to you about the detail because that is commercial in confidence. So not only are we not going to bring this matter through the parliament, we are going to hide the individual cases. If you can penetrate the thicket that we have put in front of you, you might be able to come up with some problems. But we are going to hide it from the Australian public; we are going to hide it under the cloak of commercial in confidence.'</para><para>And hide it you ought to because this is a scheme that denies 400,000 unemployed Australians assistance, particularly FLEX 3 assistance. But it is not just that. Contrary to the assurances that the minister is giving the Senate and the minister in the House of Representatives is giving the House of Representatives, it will deny basic FLEX 1 assistance to many of the 400,000 unemployed people who are not in receipt of benefit. And Senator Mackay has already talked about what is going to happen. In a number of places around this country people are going to have to pay for services if they want them. That will not be true if you have special skills, just as it is not true now. Employment agencies will be willing to place people who have special skills because employers will be prepared to pay them for that service.</para><para>But let me tell you why this government's arguments on this are not believable. They are not believable because this is the coalition that for decades has built its policy rhetoric 
 on the need for incentives and rewards for hard work and the importance of the profit motive. This is the rhetoric of the coalition. But what do we have in this scheme? We have the government saying that, without a profit motive, these 400,000 Australians are going to be serviced by these businesses who are not going to be paid for providing the service. That is what they are saying. To the extent that the government can control the services provided by Employment National, they may be able to provide services. But it will not be everywhere and it will not give access to the jobs that the private providers will, in effect, control because that is the nature of this system.</para><para>The private providers will form relationships with employers so that they can channel people through their businesses into the employer's business. Employment National may well seek to do the same. But the reality is that the private providers who control those jobs are not going to allow people who are not, in effect, paid for by the Commonwealth access to those jobs. That is denying that business an income stream. What is going to happen is that they will provide them a service provided they have special skills. They will put them on their books and if they have a position they cannot fill then they will provide them a service. But the reality is that the bulk of the 400,000 unemployed Australians not eligible for benefit will not get assistance from this scheme.</para><para>So this is a scheme that will disadvantage unemployed people with working partners, the children of parents who work, the recently unemployed who are in receipt of redundancy and termination pay and immigrants with less than two years residence in Australia, who have already been penalised by this government.</para><para>This is the governmentâwe heard about this earlier in question timeâthat has presided over a system run by the private sector for providing television services. And we heard about how that scheme has led to the blank TV screens in central Australia. That particular case has been caused by the inadequacy of the action of the private provider under, effectively, a private scheme. We have 
 here the transference of a traditionally government provided service to the private sector and we are being told that this scheme will not fail. Let me tell you that this scheme has already begun to fail. We have heard about a couple of examples now, and over the next weeks and months we will hear of many tragedies and failures caused by this scheme. It is an outrage that this particular scheme has been foisted on the Australian public and it is one of the reasons that they will reject the coalition at the next election.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>601</page.no><name role="metadata">Synon, Sen Karen</name><name role="display">Senator SYNON</name><name.id>FQ6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is a shame that the ALP is coming in here again today after one week of aborted discussion on the Natural Heritage Trust: one week of ferreting, one week of zero results.

I hope that perhaps tomorrow you will be a responsible opposition and come in here with something positive.</para></talk.start><para>For the 13 years the ALP was in government the ALP presided over the creation of one million unemployed. In `the recession we had to have' 338,900 jobs were destroyed, and in the six years from July 1990 to May 1996 only 16,000 full-time jobs were created. When Mr Beazley was Minister for Employment, long-term unemployment increased by 95,000 people. Youth unemployment was 31.4 per cent in December 1992.</para><para>Working Nation was a $12 billion disaster. Non-working nation, it was called by many. The many disenfranchised young people who were forced to take training course after training course after training course called it Training Nation. It was a manipulative and deceptive policy foisted upon unemployed people by the then government. Let me tell you that my experience in skillshare, one of those programs, over many years was that there was never a capacity to provide employment assistance, intensive or otherwise, to people who were not registered by the CES and in receipt of Commonwealth benefits. So it is highly hypocritical of you to come in here today and profess concern for Defence spouses. What an irony.</para><para>I turn to our record on employmentâyour record is on unemployment, ours is on employment. There have been 141,800 new jobs created in the past five months, of which 116,000 are full-timeâthe strongest growth in 2Â½ years. Contrast this, if you will, with your 16,000. The unemployment rate in trend terms is now at a seven-year low. How do you have the audacity to come into this chamber after looking at your record and talk about unemployment? It is an absolute disgrace. I was at a conference early last year when Wendy Jarvie, the First Assistant Secretary in DEETYA provided some figures for the outcomes of some of the Working Nation programs. New work opportunities, which I think cost in the order of $143,000 per place, had an effective outcome of four per cent. It had an outcome of 21 per cent but, when compared to a comparison control group, 17 per cent of whom got jobs anyway, the net outcome was four per cent, for $143,000 a head. Responsible government? Jobstart had 50 per cent program outcomes on the surface of it but, when compared to the control group, 22 per cent of whom found jobs anyway, the net outcome was only 28 per cent. Jobstart cost $4,100 per place; jobskills cost $47,400.</para><para>I turn my remarks to the tender itself. For those people who were at the estimates hearing on Friday and took an interest in the matterâI might say on the record that it was after the opposition asked for an extra day, if you will, to consider the effects of the employment outsourcing tenderingâit was a cosy day because, as Senator Tierney said previously, we waited and waited for the bombshell. In fact, all three of the government members sat in there eagerly wondering what dirt you could possibly dig up.</para><para>Let me tell you about the process for the tendering of employment contracts.

Senator Mackay described it as maladministered, messy and mismanaged; I 
 cannot compete with your alliteration, Senator Mackay. I find it extraordinary that Senator Tierney gets up and says that they trawled and trawled and found nothing. I think it is horrifying what we find day by day as we go through this scheme in some detail, be it through the estimates committee process or through the half-hearted answers to questions in this place.</para></talk.start><para>I also find it extraordinary that those in the government such as Senator Synon and Senator Tierney can talk about the number of jobs they have created in government. How dare they, when we can see that the number of long-term unemployed has risen since this government first came to office. The youth unemployment rate has increased since this government first came to office. Sure, Senator Tierney can point the finger at the opposition and say, `Well, you had the highest level of youth unemployment in this country.' Indeed, that is a shame, and I think everyone would acknowledge that, but the government today has the second highest record when it comes to youth unemployment. I do not think they are records that either side would necessarily be proud of.</para><para>As for this `wide range of mechanisms' to counter the high unemployment levels in this country, I was hoping that Senator Tierney would actually elaborate on them, because all I have seen so far are half-hearted schemes like work for the dole which to me do nothing but perpetuate quite negative stereotypes about young people and unemployed people but do very little in terms of creating real jobs. I am sorry I did not get to hear Senator Synon elaborate on the tendering process. The Democrats have had serious concerns about the tendering out of employment services since this idea was first mooted. Sadly, it seems that many of those concerns are being realised; they are close to being realised if they have not been already.</para><para>We refer to the deeply flawed tendering process and its outcomes, which we believe have alarming ramifications for the provision of vitally needed services for the unemployed, in particular the most disadvantaged unemployed in our community. As part of the tendering processes, organisations were 
 required to answer certain specifications and provide evidence of their ability to provide certain services. This ties in to Senator Tierney's comments about probity. But tenderers for the more lucrative Flex 2 and 3 services were also required to tender for the less profitable Flex 1 services.</para><para>I do not know about probity, because it is extremely worrying to us that the outcomes of the tendering processes display little evidence of this information actually having been taken into account; that is in the actual awarding of the contracts.

We are trying to give them the opportunity, like the rest of us, to get up in the morning and to have a reason to face the day and, at the end of the day, to go home with the sense that they have made a contribution. That is something that has been lost in all of the slamming from the other side today: the chance for young people and older unemployed people to have a job.</para></talk.start><para>One of the things that we were listening to this afternoon was a criticism of the probity of the tender process. There was some suggestion that Working Nation had provided a better opportunity than we had to give young people a job. I think most of us know of somebodyâsomeone in our street or suburb or a friend of the familyâwho was put on a training program under Working Nation. Working Nation was a program of training after training after training. What could have been more depressing for young people, in particular, than to find at the end of four and five training programs that there was no job; there was nothing.</para><para>Working Nation was a $12 billion disaster, and the increase in expenditure did not lead to more placements in full-time jobs. In fact, Working Nation was a very costly, very ineffective program. It did not provide jobs for our young people. It did not deliver the very extravagant promises that were funded in good faith at the time by the taxpayers of Australia, in the hope that young people would find work as a result of that program. But after $12 billion worth of expenditureâand we have heard from Senator Synon this afternoon just how totally ineffective and expensive that program wasâall that those young people did was to spend their lives on a merry-go-round and, at the end of the programs, all they found themselves doingâwhen they did get up off the couch in the daytimeâwas going down to the video shop, because they were unable to get jobs in the programs they had been trained for. What a tragedy for all of those thousands of young people who truthfully believed, when they did those training programs, that a job was at the end of it. What we are about is delivering a more effective, more efficient system of providing employment for our unemployed people.</para><para>There was a very extensive and arms-length tender process, there were 5,000 tender bids for the six service types within the 29 labour market program regions and there were stated selection criteria. All of those tenderers were assessed to ensure they conformed with the process and the tendering conditions. The process was comprehensive, it was rigorous, and it was fair.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>âIt was a comprehensive foul-up.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name></talker><para>âIt was a good deal fairer than the empty promises that your government gave, Senator Faulkner, and you were judged accordingly, not only by those young people but by their parents in March 1996. A number of principles were established in allocating levels of business to tenderers and these were: competition, client choice, diversity, value for money and coverage for as many job seekers in the market as possible. Could there be any more important criteria for the unemployed in this country 
 than a really new, effective chance to have an efficient delivery of services to unemployed people, particularly young people.

To that end, it recommended that Australia conduct analyses of the successes and shortcomings of the new policies with a view to providing data for future action, both in Australia and elsewhere. It recommended that the Government design a long-term strategy aimed at the full implementation of the convention.</para><para>That an evaluation should be conducted of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, assessing its impact on women of different age groups, with different educational levels and in different occupational groups. The Government should assess whether the Act leads to increased or decreased part-time and casual work, and its impact on women workers' benefits and on workers with family responsibilities, particularly women's ability to obtain maternity leave.

 ensure that any further change in that policy did not lead to a decreased access by women, especially vulnerable groups of women, to comprehensive health services.

The Government should further assess its monitoring and enforcement responsibilities in that regard.</para><para>Noting the differing State provisions in relation to prostitution, the Government should assess the effectiveness of the varying measures in reducing the exploitation of prostitution.</para><para>That the Government collect statistical data on the participation of indigenous women in the work force, in decision-making, in politics and administration, and in the judiciary.

</para><para>The Auditor-General's <inline font-style="italic">Report No. 35 of 1997-98âPerformance auditâDEETYA International Services: Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs</inline>  highlights yet again another difficulty with that department. While the concept of promoting and expanding export opportunities in the field of education and training is one that I fully support and encourage, I do think that this is, yet again, an opportunity to highlight some difficulties that are emerging with the administration of this portfolio.</para><para>It is unfortunate that the problems that the Auditor-General has identified with this particular division are now becoming indicative of a broader problem within DEETYA. What the Auditor has established is that this particular section was not operating successfully in a range of areas which included financial planning, management of risks and cost methodology. As a result of its shortcomings in the way in which this program was administered there seems to be an accumulated cash deficit of $1.4 million.</para><para>While that may not be a particularly large sum of money in the context of this department it is nonetheless worthy of note. I want to emphasise that I actually support the expansion and promotion of Australian export opportunities in education. What I do not support, however, is the problems that are now emerging within DEETYA as a direct result of the decline in the resourcing and staffing of this department. It seems to me that the levels of staffing within this department are now such that issues surrounding overall accountability, management and monitoring of programs raise serious concerns within this parliament at large.</para><para>DEETYA is not alone when it comes to the problems surrounding these particular matters. This has been highlighted by DEETYA and senior officials of DEETYA itself before the estimates committee last Friday. What has been highlighted there is the inability to keep an accurate track of the spiralling increase in the use of consultancies. In my view, Dr Kemp has to take direct and personal responsibility for this because he has attempted to cover up the extent to which this department has become dependent upon consultants. We 
 have seen the way in which its agencies as well as the department have now used consultants in a very limited period. A small window has opened to us, through which we have been able to establish that some $7 million has been spent on consultants.</para><para>We have seen that this department has been gutted by this government. It has lost 80 per cent of its staff. This was the second biggest spending department in government. Its staffing figures, as revealed before the estimates by the secretary to the department, highlight that it has moved from 16,000 people two years ago down to some 2,500 people over the next financial year. This department has been gutted. The situation has now arisen where this government is seeking to spend millions and millions of dollars in consultancies to cover up the failure of this particular portfolio.</para><para>What we have here is a government engaged in a callous exercise of job replacement. Thousands of public servants are being shown the door and they are being replaced by consultants at an ever increasing rate of expense to undertake the work that was once done by officers of the department.</para><para>The secretary to the department has admitted some embarrassment with regard to the way in which the department itself is not able to maintain its record systems properly any more. He has been able to identify to us that three separate lists of consultants were provided to the estimates committee as a result of questions that I have raised.</para><para>The fact remains that the department still has not got it right. For this limited period of time during which we were seeking information, they were not able to distinguish between a consultant and a service provider on a consistent basis. This government has shown that its attempt to use the idea of a service provider has meant some $1 million of the $7 million can be reallocated away from the publicly declared requirements under the annual reporting provisions that are a normal part of public administration into an area which does not require public accountability at the same levels.</para><para>What we have seen is an attempt to hide the massive blow-out in consultancies by this 
 government and by this minister, who is engaged in a consultancy binge in an attempt to secure the advice that he wantsânot independent, impartial, analytical advice from a fearless, independent public service but advice that he can control in a manner which is not subject to the normal rigours of the parliamentary system. In so doing, he increasingly provides that advice to consultants or service providers depending on what day of the week it is and depending on which officer actually engages the contract. Sometimes it can only be one officer. Only one officer is now required to make up a selection panel for some of these very expensive consultancies in a manner that means that the advice can be tailored to meet the demands of government rather than provide the independent basis of advice that we normally come to expect from the Public Service.</para><para>The fact that we have had a reduction in staffing in this departmentâthe privatisation of this department by stealth from 16,000 people two years ago to 2,500 people in the space of two yearsâis deplorable. The fact that we have had to expose it through the estimates process is the bombshell that Senator Tierney is so anxious to avoid. It is the bombshell that they are so concerned about.</para><para>We have a climate of staff reductions, a department that is hideously embarrassed by the way in which these policies have been administered and a minister who shows no embarrassment, because he is shameless. We have a government that is shameless as to the consequences of its policies which will have a detrimental effect on the students and the unemployed of this country. We have an acknowledgment by the department of the inconsistent application of guidelines with regard to the use of consultants and service providers. We have clear evidence that the department's records are in a  complete shambles, despite the secretary's guidelines and despite the Public Service guidelines in terms of a procurement of government services.</para><para>What we have is the capacity now for individual officers to have the discretion to determine what consultancies should go forward and what should not. What we have 
 therefore is a government that has been working in a climate where DEETYA is not able to fulfil its obligations. There is little wonder that there have been so many scandals within this department? Is there little wonder that there have now been two ministers embroiled in the crises within this department?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">MACKAY</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âAnd how many secretaries?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>âThere have been three secretaries in this department. I thank Senator Mackay very much for that interjection. There have been three secretaries in the space of three years because of the scandals within this department, which is not the responsibilities of individual officers. It is because they have to carry the burden of government policy, which is totally inappropriate to the needs of this country. We have seen staffing reductions of 80 per cent. We have a budget demand by this government that, despite the fact that this department has 10 per cent of total government expenditure, it is required to carry 30 per centâ$4.3 billionâof the budget cuts.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Of course there will be problems and of course there will be crises as a result of the actions of this government. They have completely wiped out the corporate memory of this department. Is there any wonder that one problem after another is emerging as a result of the actions of this government which have reduced this department to a shadow of its former self.</para><para>It concerns me greatly that members opposite in this chamber express so little concern about the loss of service to the students and the unemployed of this country, so little concern about the consequences of a failure of government policy, so little concern about the loss of public moneys, so little concern about the questions of probity that are now emerging with regard to the employment market services and so little concern about the appalling failure in process that has resulted from 75 per cent of ANTA's consultancies going out in one period without a full and open tender process.</para><para>An increasingly small number of consultants are getting the benefit of an increasingly larger sum of money as a result of fewer and 
 fewer officers being made available to carry out the functions of this department. Is there little wonder that people ask why it is that everyone else in this country is required to operate on an open and competitive basis, as this government says, but the government operates on such a narrow, restricted basisâon the basis of selective invited tenders.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>614</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government welcomes Auditor-General's <inline font-style="italic">Report No. 35 of 1997-98âPerformance auditâDEETYA International Services: Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs</inline> âa very valuable report which confirms a number of management reforms that have been introduced recently by DEETYA International Services. One of the major reforms has been the adoption of a new DIS operational framework based on a cost recovery model which addresses the areas which ANAO has highlighted needs improvement. These include financial planning, management of risk and costing methodology.</para></talk.start><para>Following the adoption of this framework, DIS has revised its business plan to focus on continuing improvement links of output based budgeting and reporting, it is developing a comprehensive risk management plan and it is moving to full accrual based financial management. These reforms will further contribute to DIS's success in winning tenders and obtaining client satisfaction for services which are delivered.</para><para>The ANAO report on DIS acknowledged the vital contribution that DIS is making to export opportunities for Australian education, training and labour market providers in a number of regions, including the countries of South-East Asia, central Asia and eastern Europe. Over the last four years DIS has secured contracts worth $9.6 million in these very important export markets. The current financial difficulty in some countries in our region coupled with increasing competition and the imperative of Australian groups targeting markets carefully has been included so that DIS will work harder to improve the position to respond to current and future demands in the marketplace.</para><para>It was interesting that Senator Carr spent only a few minutes concentrating on the findings of the report and also the way in which the government has moved very quicklyâeven before the report was brought downâto institute a number of changes. It has established a relatively new organisation. It has been established in a Public Service culture, and it has to have a market orientation. Of course, this combination in the early stages does create some difficulties. It has recognised those difficulties and it is moving very quickly to reform this body.</para><para>Senator Carr's broader remarks relating to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs show a lack of knowledge of the history of DEETYA. He seems to indicate that the problems have come from the current change in arrangements. He obviously has no knowledge of the history of the sorts of things that were happening six or seven years agoâin 1991, when the Auditor-General did heavily qualify his report into DEETYA under Senator Carr's government eight years after they came into government. As a matter of fact, things were in such a shambles at that time that in the following year DEETYA appointed 40 internal auditors to try to fix up the mess in the accountability systems. Over the years since then, DEETYA has, to its great credit, got its act together and improved accountability arrangements. Over seven years I certainly have not seen any backsliding from that.</para><para>Senator Carr went on to talk about various things relating to consultancies and outsourcing. If we restructure the way in which we provide these services, which this government has done, and if we move to a more market based approach, obviously we do not need as many public servants. The test in the end will be the way in which services are delivered and the way in which people do end up being placed in real jobs. I would have thought that sort of outcome is the ultimate test that we should be looking at.</para><para>Look at the appalling record of Senator Carr's government in relation to not only the high levels of unemployment that developed during the time Labor were mismanaging this country but also the way in which they then 
 approached the problem. Sure, they employed an enormous number of public servants and committed billions of dollars to the exercise. I suppose in a way that is commendableâexcept that they did not get the outcomes, which meant they got the worst of both worlds: they wasted taxpayers' dollars and people were still in the unemployment queue. They had a totally hopeless approach to this.</para><para>In 1996 the voters in this country thoroughly recognised the hopelessness of Labor's approach in their `not Working Nation' scheme and threw them out of office. Voters wanted a totally different approach. This government has brought in this approach, and there is every sign that it will have a much better chance of success than the mess those opposite created in the unemployment area.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>615</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Crime Authority Committee</title><page.no>615</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>615</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>615</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present a report of the committee on the examination of the annual report for 1996-97 of the National Crime Authority.

It is very clear that the NCA is engaged in a quiet but very effective war against drugs.</para><para>I would like the Senate to take note of the fact that over the past three months the NCA has made a number of significant arrests in 
 connection with the drugs war. There were five networks involving the use of heroin that were smashed, with 17 people arrested, including a number of senior crime figures. There were three arrests and the seizure of 21 kilos of heroin with a street value of $32 million. There were nine arrests and an interstate heroin ring broken. Twelve people were arrested in three raids with heroin, cocaine, firearms and stolen goods seized. In another case there were 10 individuals arrested and a syndicate was cracked that operated in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. While the war against these drugs is of course ever-present and far from won, it is clear that the NCA is making significant inroads into this very sad human tragedy in Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>616</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI would like to make some brief remarks about the report by the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on the examination of the annual report for 1996-97. The annual report has been examined by the committee and found to be satisfactory for a number of reasonsâits improved presentation, its timeliness and its relationship to the corporate plan. These are indeed mostly housekeeping issues. But, more importantly for the Australian Democrats, we are concerned that where a person's name is included in a report in the context of them being charged, it is essential that, if the matter does not proceed or if the person is found not guilty, the matter be included in the annual report. The report states at paragraph 27:</para></talk.start><para>The Committee acknowledges the fine line between `suspected' and `charged' prior to the matter going to court and sympathises with the NCA, as a law enforcement body, not wishing to breach its own enabling legislation.</para><para>I can only say that the reporting of not guilty and charges withdrawn matters are absolutely essential. This approach should be reconsidered in the near future to ensure the practice does not place undue hardship on those charged and later found to be not guilty or to have the charges dropped.</para><para>I also, for the record, would like to restate my concerns about the investigation into the 
 bombing of the NCA office in Adelaide. As we all know in this chamber, this was one of the most serious attacks on a law enforcement agency in this nation's history. It occurred in my home state of South Australia on 2 March 1994. That bombing killed Geoffrey Bowen and maimed Peter Wallis. Despite the fact that this happened more than three years ago, there has been no successful prosecution of this crime. Of course, there are many questions that remain unanswered; there are many outstanding questions. This is not good enough from the perspective of our law enforcement agencies. I believe that it is the role of this parliament, and our responsibility, to make sure that we get to the bottom of this particular tragic event.</para><para>I understand that security has been beefed up on NCA recommendations. I understand, for example, that all mail is now X-rayed and other measures are in place to protect from harm these agencies and the individuals that work within them. If this is not the case, however, if there are any loopholes whatsoever, something must be done to bring the protective measures up to standard. I note that the Democrats have raised these concerns in this place on a number of occasions. We believe that those people who are in a position of authority and who are charged with the responsibility of protecting others are entitled to the maximum level of physical and other security available. The lives of those in public service are indeed valuable, like all other lives, and we must learn the lessons of this particular tragedy to make sure that nothing like it at all happens again.</para><para>I am also concerned about the coroner's inquest. After three years the South Australian coroner's office has not convened an inquest into this tragedy because the police investigation has not been finalised. I understand that is the rationale and that this is standard practice in my home state. However, given the lack of prosecution after all this timeâit is over three years, as I saidâwe should be seeking answers as to why the coroner's inquest has not even started. I believe this investigation is central to resolving this tragedy and learning the lessons so that this never happens again.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION TO VENEZUELA AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>617</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>617</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Venezuela and the United States of America which took place between 5 July and 22 July 1997. I seek leave to make some comments.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>âFirst of all, I want to congratulate the staff who wrote the report because it is a good report. It does give a very good overview of the things that we learnt, the places we went to and the people we met. The recommendations in the report are mainly from a government perspective, and it is very appropriate that that should be so. But, of course, there would be some of those recommendations that the Democrats would not agree with. For that reason, at the end of my comments I will seek leave to continue my remarks because I believe that Senator Ferris, who was also on the delegation, really should have an opportunity to reflect on the report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Some things which are in the report or which were hinted at and some things which are not in the report probably should be put on the record. I should indicate that Senator Childs would have been presenting this report today had he still been in the Senate. He was the deputy leader of the delegationâand a very good deputy leaderâbut he has since retired from the Senate. I also indicate that the leader of the delegation was the previous Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Bob Halverson, and he was a very good leader. But I do not know if I should make any comment on the fact that both the leader and deputy leader have had a significant change in circumstance since this delegation.</para><para>Let me draw attention to a couple of things in the report. One of the groups we met with was an inter-parliamentary forum on external debt from the countries of Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Surinam. They met to inform us about the very serious level of external debt in their countries and the fact 
 that huge debt servicing payments have been made without any reduction in the amount still outstanding because of large interest rates. This was actually a fairly lively meeting. There was a presentation by government members present and some protests from non-government members about the solutions to debt. I think it is good that delegations do not necessarily always agree and that we could have that kind of debate.</para><para>For that reason, I would add to the answers given by government members about how to tackle debt. There were some other solutions that were discussed by this forum of parliamentary members from these other countries. In particular, they raised with us the possibility of debt forgiveness, which did not seem to appeal to many members of the delegation but which is something that I have debated and discussed for a long timeâand I was happy to do that with them.</para><para>Another part of our delegation in Venezuela was to visit an Australian embassy sponsored social development project. I have to commend the members of the Australian embassy in Venezuela for their involvement in this. It certainly gives the other side of the picture to the usual fairly glowing reports that we get from delegations about the possibilities of trade, et cetera. What that visit revealed to usâand I need to describe it to the Senateâwas the incredible poverty in a country like Venezuela, which is not a poor country in terms of its resources, its income, its industry, et cetera. Nevertheless, it is a country with incredible poverty.</para><para>The city of Caracas is in a valley and on either side of the valley are mountains. Up the sides of the mountains are thousands and thousands of slum dwellings called barrios. The only way we could visit the school in the midst of the barriosâthe school that was being helped by our Australian embassyâwas under armed escort. It was not possible to go into those barrios without that kind of protection.</para><para>I think it is interesting and important that we see on delegationsâwhen we can talk about the trade, et cetera, which can take place between our two countries in glowing termsâthe underbelly of some of these sorts 
 of countries. We certainly saw the underbelly on that occasion. To visit a school which was surrounded by armed security police guarding every entrance to the school for our protection really must say something to us about this country.</para><para>The second part of the visit was to the United States. Part of the purpose of that was to certainly talk about the defence cooperation between Australia and the USA. We were very well received. We visited the Pentagon and a Trident submarine. The briefings we got were very fulsome and extensive, but I found it interesting that when we were being briefed in the Pentagon about weapons of mass destruction and I asked about the involvement of the United States in the distribution of arms within the world I got no answer at all. I found that very interesting.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Senator Margetts interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name></talker><para>âI forgot to ask that, Senator Margettsânext time perhaps.

</para><para>The NRS Levy Imposition Bill imposes a levy on participating carriers to provide funding for the NRS.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</para><para>The Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 is the first bill in a package of two bills about NRS funding arrangements.</para><para>The Telecommunications Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 (the Amendment Bill) mostly deals with the operation and funding of the National Relay Service (NRS). The NRS is a service that provides people who are deaf, hearing, or speech impaired, with access to the standard telephone service on terms, and in circumstances, that are comparable to those on which other Australians have access to a standard telephone service.</para><para>The Amendment Bill also includes minor amendments to make it clear that:</para><para>lines on the customer side of the telecommunications network boundary are not line links so there will be no obligation to hold a carrier licence or arrange for a nominated carrier declaration in relation to these links; and</para><para>a carrier that has been declared a nominated carrier over network units that it does not own or operate will be obliged to fulfil carrier related obligations in relation to those network units as though they owned or operated them.</para><para>The current contract for the provision of the NRS expires on 30 June 1998. Under the current wording of the Telecommunications Act 1997 from 1 July 1998 the NRS will be brought under all the universal service provisions and funded out of the Universal Service levy on an annual basis at least a year after the service is provided. Only carriers are able to undertake Universal Service provision, because providing these services would necessitate the ownership or operational control of network units.</para><para>However, the operation of the NRS is different to Universal Service provision as;</para><para>it does not involve the ownership or operation of network units to provide the service to a deaf, hearing, or speech impaired person</para><para>provision of the NRS is more like a service provider using existing telecommunications networks to deliver a product to select members of the community that have specific disability needs</para><para>NRS provision has been by a small niche operator that is reliant on regular funding.</para><para>The intention is that under the bills from 1 July 1998;  
</para><para>the provision of the NRS be open to both carriers and non-carriers</para><para>the NRS will be provided by a person, who may or may not be a carrier, under a contract with the Commonwealth; and</para><para>the cost of the NRS will be met by carriers in advance on a quarterly basis depending on their eligible revenue or timed traffic.</para><para>Publication of NRS cost estimates will enable the carriers to be levied in advance and publication of actual cost figures after the end of the quarter will enable the actual and estimated costs to be reconciled for accuracy. This information with Australian Communications Authority (ACA) participating carrier assessments will determine carrier levy contributions.</para><para>Only if a carrier is a participating carrier in relation to the Universal Service Obligation when the ACA calculates levy contributions each quarter and is the subject of the most recent ACA USO levy assessment can the carrier be liable for a levy payment.</para><para>The NRS will be provided under a new contract as from 1 July 1998. The proposed amendments require a NRS Service Plan as part of the contract with the NRS provider to include performance standards and timetables for the supply of the service.</para><para>As part of the contract the NRS Service Plan will also include how the service will adapt and implement new technology as it becomes available, such as speech to speech for those speech impaired people who find text communications difficult as well as how the NRS provider will conduct the outreach program to promote the service availability to the public, to identify and educate users and potential users.</para><para>The ACA will be required to report against the NRS Service Plan in an annual report to the Minister after the end of each financial year. This report will be tabled in both Houses of Parliament. The Minister will also be able to request the ACA to provide advice on the NRS Service Plan at any stage. Changes to the NRS Service Plan can be made through contract negotiations between the NRS provider and the Commonwealth.</para><para>Any failure by the NRS provider to comply with the NRS Plan will be addressed in accordance with the NRS contract.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>CHARTER OF BUDGET HONESTY BILL 1996 [No. 2]</para><para>The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is a major structural reform of the way in which this country presents and runs its fiscal policy. The bill fulfils an election promise by this government to make sure that the Australian accounts are presented in 
 a fair and honest manner and to enshrine in legislation a requirement which will govern our government and any future government as to the way in which it will present and improve its financial performance. This is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will be a permanent feature, making sure that Australia's economic policy is run better, making sure that the public is kept better informed, making sure that there is transparency in economic policy in this country.</para><para>This is the same bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 11 December 1996 and passed by the House of Representatives on 10 February 1997. On 28 October 1997 the Senate passed the bill with ten amendments.</para><para>These amendments were unnecessary and made aspects of the bill unworkable.</para><para>A number of amendments relate to the arrangements for costing election policies during the caretaker period. They would have made the process non-transparent by allowing the costing of unannounced policies. They would also risk turning the bureaucracy into a research centre for the opposition, inconsistent with the conventions of Westminster Government.</para><para>Another amendment sought by the Senate would require a detailed report on threats to the tax system and specific means necessary to counter these threats. This would have drawn attention of tax planners to opportunities for tax avoidance, risking larger revenue losses than would otherwise be the case.</para><para>Other amendments to the charter unnecessarily complicated the operation of the bill.</para><para>The amendments were not agreed by the House of Representatives and the bill was returned to the Senate. The Senate again insisted on its amendments and on 19 November 1997 the House again rejected those amendments. The bill was then laid aside.</para><para>The government is reintroducing this bill because it believes that the people of Australia deserve better fiscal accountability and improved fiscal outcomes. To show our commitment to this, the government has already been complying in full with the charter's requirements.</para><para>The need for the bill is clearly demonstrated by the need for improved fiscal outcomes in Australia. There have been persistent Commonwealth budget deficits over the past 25 years. This has led to Commonwealth general government net debt ratcheting up, reaching a little less than 20 per cent of GDP by 1995-96.</para><para>The government has been repairing the fiscal mess left by our predecessors. Before we came to office, we were told the budget was in surplus. It was not. It was in deficit to the tune of $10 billion. We inherited that problem. It became our responsibility 
 to fix the mismanagement and the way in which the then government sought to hide it.</para><para>As a result of the government's fiscal consolidation program, the budget is expected to move into surplus by 1998-99. Continued surpluses are projected until the turn of the century. This year we are paying off debt. We expect to halve the level of Commonwealth general government debt  to around 10 per cent of GDP by the turn of the century.</para><para>The bill will help to ensure that the fiscal profligacy of our predecessors is not repeated. It aims to ensure that all future governments are more disciplined, transparent and accountable in operating fiscal policy.</para><para>Fiscal discipline will be enhanced by requiring government fiscal policy to be formulated according to principles of sound fiscal management. Transparency and the accountability of government will be substantially increased through improved disclosure of fiscal policy intentions and the regular reporting of information on fiscal developments.</para><para>Further, the charter will prevent future governments going to an election on the basis of outdated and misleading information on the fiscal and economic outlook. In short, this bill will ensure that at all times this government and all future governments can be held accountable for their fiscal and economic policies and thereby provide the basis for a sounder economic performance for the economy as a whole, sustainable job opportunities for our people and greater accountability of government to the electors whom they serve.</para><para>I would like to highlight some of the main features of the fiscal framework that will be established by the bill.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Fiscal Policy Formulation</inline></para><para>The bill will reform fiscal policy formulation through introducing principles for the sound management of fiscal policy against which governments must develop their fiscal strategy. These principles will focus attention on a range of issues that must be addressed if fiscal policy is to be sustainable over time.</para><para>The principles take account of the need to address short-term issues, such as cyclical economic downturns, while recognising the importance of medium-term issues such as the sustainability of government debt and national saving. The presentation of a government fiscal strategy as required by the bill will also increase public awareness of a government's objectives and establish a benchmark for evaluating fiscal performance.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Fiscal Reporting</inline></para><para>The charter of budget honesty will also ensure that up-to-date information is available so that a government's performance can be assessed against its fiscal objectives. To achieve this, the bill 
 establishes a formal reporting structure. With each year's budget, a report will be released setting out economic and fiscal projections for the budget year and three forward years. These projections will illustrate the consequences of the adopted fiscal strategy.</para><para>A further report released midway through the financial year will update the fiscal and economic projections contained in the budget report. The details of fiscal outcomes for the just completed financial year will be presented in a report to be released within three months of the end of that financial year. In addition, an intergenerational report will be produced every five years to report on the long-term sustainability of current fiscal policies.</para><para>These reports will provide fundamental information that will allow government performance to be assessed against the objectives set out in the fiscal strategy statement. However, the bill also gives particular attention to ensuring that important fiscal information is available during the election period.</para><para>In doing that, we want to make sure that no other government in future behaves in the way in which the Labor government behaved in the March 1996 election. They hid the true state of the books. That is why we intend to make it incumbent for a full and open report to be made about the financial state of the books at the opening of an election campaign and not to be found out by whichever government wins at the close.</para><para>The bill requires the secretaries to the Treasury and the Department of Finance to prepare a pre-election report providing an updated assessment of the fiscal and economic outlook. Never again will a government go to an election without the public being aware of the current economic and fiscal situation. Never again will the deception attempted by the Labor Party in the last election be allowed if this legislation is enacted.</para><para>In addition, the bill provides for more equal access to Treasury and Finance costings of election commitments by the government and the opposition during the caretaker period. This will allow the electorate to be better informed of the financial implications of election commitments.</para><para>These provisions are fair and balanced and consistent with the principles of Westminster Government. The amendments to these arrangements that had been sought by the opposition are non-transparent and unworkable.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>In conclusion, the government believes that the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 represents a landmark development in the conduct of fiscal policy and reporting of fiscal outcomes. It is the kind of reform which, when enacted, will change: the way in which elections are conducted; the way in which policies are implemented; the way in 
 which future generations are brought into consideration in economic decision making; and our economic policy for the better.</para><para>The bill will provide a strong impetus towards achieving better fiscal outcomes by providing greater discipline in policy formulation, regular statements of fiscal objectives and increased accountability for fiscal performance.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</para><para>This bill proposes to amend the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</para><para>The amendments will give effect to a part of the Government's package of reforms to private health insurance. The reforms contained in this bill will:</para><para>.	 engender a positive and competitive environment in the private health sector;</para><para>.	 reduce some of the cost pressures on health insurance premiums;</para><para>.	 make contracting more attractive between the various parties; and</para><para>.	 help consumers by reducing the problem of often large and unexpected out-of-pocket expenses and multiple medical bills.</para><para>Private health insurance has been the subject of inquiries by the Industry Commission and the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The package of reforms contained in this bill responds to those recommendations requiring legislation that could be dealt with immediately and incorporates the reforms announced by the Government on 19 August 1997.</para><para>The Commission also made a number of recommendations that require further analysis and development. The most important of these is unfunded lifetime community rating which the Government is now examining to determine its feasibility.</para><para>Unfunded lifetime community rating is designed to balance the age distribution of fund membership, lower premiums and make private health insurance more affordable for young and old alike.</para><para>There are also reforms that do not require legislation. The Government has decided to establish a second tier default benefit which would apply where there is no contract between a private hospital and a fund, but where the hospital has in place arrangements for informed financial consent and simplified billing, and evidence of an appropriate level of treatment.</para><para>Australians overwhelmingly support Medicare and the universal access to public health services that this entails. Yet at the same time, over one third of 
 the population still has some form of private health insurance.</para><para>Clearly, we have a universally available public health system which is highly valued by most Australians, but also a significant number of people who see value in having access to the private health sector.</para><para>The Government sees such a choice as a legitimate aspiration and understands that the key for most Australians to such access remains private health insurance. Approximately 80 per cent of private hospital episodes are funded through private health insurance.</para><para>This Government has a focus on the total health systemâpublic and private. The private hospital system is an essential ingredient in the nation's health care mix. The community needs to have access to the existing range of beds and services across both the public and private sectors.</para><para>And it is a matter of common sense to maximise the use of our existing acute capital stockâboth public and privateârather than simply commit billions of extra dollars to funding new public hospital beds.</para><para>The Government's message is loud and clear: that the private sector is a vital complement to the long term viability of Medicare and the public hospital system. Importantly, this is not just idle rhetoric. Active and positive steps are being taken to ensure that private health insurance is a realistic choice for those Australians who wish to maintain it.</para><para>This bill introduces reforms to private health insurance that build on the Government's Private Health Insurance Incentives Scheme and the adjustments to the Medicare levy for people on higher incomes who have chosen not to insure themselves privately.</para><para>I will now outline the main elements of the reform package.</para><para>The first set of reforms will make contracting between funds, hospitals and doctors more attractive.</para><para>The private health insurance legislation introduced by the previous Government relied on contracting between funds and doctors to address a number of issues affecting private health insuranceâincluding the incidence of unknown out of pocket costs. This legislation has been a spectacular failure with only a handful of doctors prepared to enter contracts. The result is that consumers have continued to experience often large and unanticipated out-of-pocket medical bills.</para><para>Nonetheless, it is vital that we achieve greater certainty for consumers, either through informed financial consent so that they know in advance the out-of-pocket costs or even better by securing agreements for 100 percent cover for their medical bills.  
</para><para>Schedule 3 Paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 will for the first time allow health funds to pay medical benefits above the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) to doctors who have Practitioner Agreements with private hospitals. And, as is currently the case, Practitioner Agreements will only be permitted where the hospital also has a fixed cost contract known as a Hospital Purchaser Provider Agreement with the fund.</para><para>The effect of these new arrangements will be either to exclude out-of-pocket costs altogether or allow for a pre determined amount to be borne by the patient.</para><para>The level of payment for in-hospital medical services will be negotiated between the hospital and the doctor concerned. Such payment may be on whatever basis hospitals and doctors choose. For example, a percentage of the MBS fee, a retainer or some other agreed block payment.</para><para>Where doctors have Practitioner Agreements, this bill enables the 75 per cent Medicare benefit to be paid direct to the health fund. In these circumstances, assignment of the Medicare benefit by the patient to the fund will be mandatory. This will greatly simplify the billing and claiming process for patients.</para><para>In other words, doctors will no longer have to negotiate only with the fundsâa key objection that the medical profession has raised and steadfastly maintained since 1994. Agreements will be negotiated by the people directly involved in providing care to patients, who will then be able to provide services for no or known out-of-pocket costs and with greatly simplified billing and claiming procedures for the patient.</para><para>Furthermore, Schedule 3 Paragraph 4 will require all agreements offered by funds or hospitals to include a clause guaranteeing the general professional freedom of doctors to identify the appropriate treatment for their patients within the scope of accepted clinical practice. With the exception of the price arrangements entered into by the parties which will remain commercial-in-confidence and information relating to individuals, the agreements will be open to public scrutiny.</para><para>The medical profession has consistently said that their objection to such agreements was based on concerns about US-style managed care, where funds have used their market power to dictate and limit clinical decisions.</para><para>With the threat of US-style managed care removed from the equation I am confident that doctors will be more willing to negotiate arrangements with private hospitals.</para><para>I would hope that the profession sensibly understands that their cooperation is absolutely essential if the private health care sector is to remain viable, 
 which depends largely on private health insurance continuing to cover a large proportion of the population.</para><para>The second set of amendments removes unnecessary costs on funds, improves the regulatory environment and makes refinements to existing legislation to improve the operation of the industry.</para><para>Schedule 1 will tighten the definition of health insurance business to reduce the potential for new products entering the market to undermine the Government's commitment to community rating. Products have beenâand many more could beâdesigned which are risk rated, but effectively provide health insurance by extending the number and range of conditions drawing on the model of trauma insurance and basing payments on estimated hospital and medical costs. The changes to the legislation will make it clearer that products of this nature cannot be marketed other than as community rated health insurance, while leaving legitimate trauma and life products in place.</para><para>Schedule 2 replaces the provision requiring payment of benefits at an acute rate for the first 35 days of hospitalisation, irrespective of whether acute care is provided. The ensuing regulation will provide for a determination of benefits for nursing home type patients at an appropriate level and structure.</para><para>The Productivity Commission could see no sound economic basis for payment of higher acute care benefits for nursing home type patients. This adds an unnecessary cost burden to health funds and therefore adds to the cost pressures leading to increases in premium levels. This situation has arisen because of a rigidity in the National Health Act which obliges health funds to pay an acute care rate for these patients irrespective of the need for acute care for the first thirty five days. This bill will remove the rigidity in the act and replace it with a regulatory power which will allow the development of more flexible administrative and payment structures for nursing home type patients.</para><para>Schedule 4 will allow changes to reinsurance arrangements to be made by disallowable instrument and facilitate necessary changes to reinsurance that may become necessary in the future.</para><para>Schedule 5 restructures the Private Health Insurance Administration Council with a new board independent of the Department of Health and Family Services and the industry. It will include a Commissioner and two to four other individuals as recommended by the Industry Commission.</para><para>Schedule 6 contains a number of measures that will assist the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner to provide an effective and efficient operation over the next few years by which time information will be available to assess whether more substantial powers are required. The Commis 
 sioner will also be renamed the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman.</para><para>Schedule 7 Paragraphs 2 and 3 extend the maximum waiting period for obstetrics from nine to 12 months. Obstetrics has been an area where "hit and run" behaviour is purportedly severe. Extending the waiting period to 12 months will help to reduce some of the cost pressures faced the health insurance industry.</para><para>Schedule 8 will allow the assignment of Medicare payments for in-hospital medical treatment by the patient to another party as part of approved simplified billing arrangements. This will encourage the development of simplified billing arrangements for patients treated by doctors not covered by agreements with either health funds or hospitals.</para><para>Schedule 11 Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 will make it clear that for-profit organisations are on the same footing as not-for-profit organisations in terms of applying for registration as a health fund and facilitate the transition of existing non-profit funds to for-profit status if that is their desire.</para><para>The reforms in this bill have the potential to create an environment which is not only more attractive to new players but also to consumers through the development of health insurance products that truly offer value for money. They also form part of a comprehensive package of related measures to make the most of our existing health care assets, both public and private, and to ensure that Australians can look forward confidently to assured quality health care.</para><para>THERAPEUTIC GOODS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</para><para>This bill makes amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and consequential amendments to the Customs Act 1901. The changes to therapeutic goods legislation include measures designed to improve the operating environment for the Australian pharmaceutical industry, as well as ensure the availability of new drugs, while enhancing Australia's commitment to its international obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. This will be achieved through the introduction of a new data protection scheme for new chemical entities, referred to as "active components" in the amending legislation.</para><para>At present confidential information submitted to the Therapeutic Goods Administration in connection with applications to register products in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods is protected against disclosure, unless release is in the public interest, and also against use by the TGA for its own commercial benefit. Under the new "data protection" scheme to be introduced by the bill, this 
 data will now have five years of "data protection". During this time, any other company seeking to register a generic copy of the registered product containing, or consisting of, the active component will be required to seek the agreement of the originator company before the TGA can directly or indirectly access or reference the originator company's data relating to the same active component.</para><para>Applicants seeking to register generic products containing protected active components may still do so. However, they must develop and lodge their own full data package, instead of lodging an abbreviated package that demonstrates bioequivalence with a new active component. Most products that have a new active component will attract separate protection under a patent during their first five years on the market, but the "data protection" regime will provide a safety net for those products which may fall outside the norm.</para><para>The "data protection" measures are in line with those provided by the United States, the European Union and New Zealand, and the Government's decision to introduce these measures follows a review by the Government of Australia's international obligations in relation to registration data, undertaken in response to the Industry Commission's Report No. 51 (1996) , The Pharmaceutical Industry. The Commission reported that "there is potential for the availability of important new drugs to be jeopardised in the event Australia's current practice relating to confidential information does not meet its international obligations."</para><para>Provisions have also been included in the bill to close off a loophole in the current act that would enable, for example, a person who consistently fails to meet manufacturing standards and commits offences against the act to continue to manufacture goods, simply by applying for manufacturing licences through other entities such as companies. Thus, Item 6 inserts a provision that will enable the Secretary to prevent persons in control of another licensee convicted of an offence against the Therapeutic Goods Act, or a law of a State or Territory in relation to therapeutic goods, from immediately applying for and obtaining another manufacturing licence through another person, such as a new or different company. The amendment makes additions to the existing grounds for refusing to issue a manufacturing licence, and the same grounds would provide the basis for cancelling a licensee's manufacturing licence.</para><para>Regulation-making powers have been conferred upon the Governor-General to enable the administrative functions associated with the issue of import and export permits and licences which are to be exercised by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Family Services to be prescribed under 
 therapeutic goods legislation. The remaining functions will stay under Customs legislation.</para><para>The amendments to the Customs Act 1901 take into account the Governor-General's powers to make similar regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 for the grant of import or export permits and licences for therapeutic goods that remain prohibited imports or exports under Customs legislation.</para><para>This will facilitate a more efficient and responsive regulation and the development of a risk management approach which maintains Australia's obligations under the three United Nations Treaties aimed at preventing illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse, while reducing the regulatory burden on industry.</para><para>Other measures included in the bill relate to the power of the Secretary to seek the same kind of information about the manufacturing processes used for the manufacture of listable therapeutic goods as for registrable goods. The more detailed information will better equip the Secretary to determine whether or not listable goods are suitable for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, and whether they should remain there.</para><para>Overall, this bill will benefit Australia's therapeutic industry and further enhance Australia's role as a leader in drug regulation.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr</inline>) adjourned.</para><para>Ordered that the  Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2] , the  Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  and the  Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1997  be listed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> as separate orders of the day.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>624</page.no><id.no>R346</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>624</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âThe committee is considering the Democrat requests for amendments Nos 6 and 7.</para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>624</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI will not reiterate the nature of the amendments, which relate to the various exemptions for the youth allowance for people who are disadvantaged and the reduction in the age of independence.

I am still very curious to note what has been discussed between the government and Senator Harradine and how families will find their financial and other burdens alleviated as a result of the assurance that Senator Harradine has been given.

There seems to be a difficulty with democratic processes if two parties involved in the Senate, the government and one Independent member, can secretly exchange information that affects the law-making of this chamber. If there are details that affect the outcome of this bill they should be disclosed by the government immediately.

Virtually the first thing it did when it came into government was to honour its election commitment of a $1 billion family tax initiative to relieve families of some of the costs and burdens of raising children. Senator Harradine did believe, I understand, that that was a very valuable initiative. I do not think that there is any point in belabouring that issue. I would have thought that the opposition would have seen that that was a valuable example of the government's commitment to families with dependent children.</para></talk.start><para>I also said last Thursday that the government's management of the national accounts has been such that we have had five reductions in interest rates since we came into government. This has meant that families have had, effectively, something like a $90 to $100 a week pay rise because of the reduction in the burden that they have had in meeting their family mortgages.</para><para>We have not been running around with rhetoric on those things but taking no action, like the previous government did. We have actually put those things into place which have benefited and helped families who are raising children. The Prime Minister and Senator Harradine may have had their conversationâand I am not able to help you on thatâbut I know that the Prime Minister has made it absolutely clear that tax reform is on agenda for this government and that we will go to the next election with people well and truly understanding what proposals are available for them to pass judgment on. It will be absolutely clear that one of the principles on which that tax reform is based is that we recognise appropriately the special demands placed on parents by the raising of children 
 and the need for that to be recognised in the tax system.</para><para>We have already moved to that partially with the family tax initiative when we first came into government. We have also talked about the need for compensation, where appropriate, for any change to the tax structure. I imagineâand that is for Senator Harradine to discuss if he wishesâthat Senator Harradine has found that the assurances the Prime Minister has given him are satisfactory because, and here is the crunch, Senator Neal, this legislation will be beneficial for very many young people and their families.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>B36</name.id><name role="metadata">NEAL</name><name role="display">Senator Neal</name></talker><para>âWhat about others?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>âYou might carp about things that you do not think are as good as they might beâbecause you have the luxury of that from oppositionâbut you were not prepared to move to do this when you were in government despite the fact that the welfare organisations were asking for you to move in this direction.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>B36</name.id><name role="metadata">NEAL</name><name role="display">Senator Neal</name></talker><para>âThey were not asking for us to move in that direction!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>âThey have told me that they were asking.

Senator Harradine has clearly had the opportunity to study the bill thoroughly and believes that to stand in the way of a very important piece of social policy would be

The reason it was set up that way was to try to make it look as if the gain was $1,000 when it was a lot less. The reality is that the government said they were giving $1,000 and in fact what people got in their pockets was a lot less. It was extremely complex; it is probably extremely expensive to administer as well. It was a con basically because it gave a lot less than what it promisedâand it did not help much at all people who did not pay tax.</para></talk.start><para>If the government are suggesting that they did such a good job with their family tax last timeâtheir marginal tax effortâthat they are going to do the same kind of thing again, we are on to them. It was a con last time. It was a scam to look as if the government were giving more than they did. As I recall, Senator Harradine at the time was very critical of the way the government put that together. So I certainly hope you are not going to came with the same kind of thing and add a figure on and pretend you are giving another $1,000 to Australian families because we are on to you. We have seen what you did before.</para><para>The important message that the minister is suggesting is perhaps one she took from Malthus, from a previous century, that you have to be cruel to be kind; that if you give the poor money they will only have babies. That kind of message is the kind of outdated, old-fashioned, inappropriate and cruel message that is coming from the government. The kinds of questions that we have been asking have not been answered by the government. What did happen about the explanatory memorandum the first time that suddenly meant we had an extra $100 million? When did we get the answer to that? Where are the figures from the government as to how the figures got changed by $100 million between 
 when the questions were asked and when the minister answered them and when the explanatory memorandum was published?</para><para>We are told that we should accept what the government is saying that people are going to be better off. We have had no figures at all to show that. The amendments we are asking for support for here are about the real impact on real people. The Greens (WA) and the Australian Democrats believe that it is not just a matter of definition on paper; it is a matter of whether families will be able to survive. We do not believe that it is acceptable to say, `Oh well, if you have got kids who are in school or in training'âmagically, considering the amount of money not available for schools and training from this governmentâ`you might be better off if they are in those things.' If you look at the longer term picture that is not quite true. If you look at the impact on people who are unemployed for a longer period of time the picture gets worse.</para><para>None of those questions have actually been answered. Yet we are still being asked to accept that it is all right to discriminate against young people and to pick and choose what the age of independence is depending on whether or not the government feels it can save money; and that it is all right to call a person independent if there is a chance of getting money out of themâlike their accepting debts and so on. But it is not okay to accept the age of independence as 18 unless you accept the responsibility that if those young people, like any other adult person in our society, are unemployed or need assistance with training or education they are entitled to receive it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>627</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe name Malthus has got me to my feet.

It was not a short-term thing as to what is going to happen in the next budget; I am not privy to what is going to happen in the next budget, on this or any other matter. I was more interested in the long-term outcomes for families as a result of the taxation restructuring situation.</para><para>As we all know, there is a government task force, chaired by Senator Brian Gibson, which is examining a large number of submissions. What the Prime Minister did, and this was confirmed publicly here in the chamber, was to give me that assurance in the context of the restructure. If the government ultimately goes to some sort of consumption taxâwhich I have considered over the years to be, either in fact or potentially, regressiveâyou then 
 have a look at what the Prime Minister has committed the government to. He has committed it to giving further recognition and help; not that they will give consideration to it, but they will, so that the outcome will have to be better for families than it is now, even under a consumption tax. That is a very important and significant undertaking, and I will not take it lightly.</para><para>Honourable senators will realise that over many years, both in the trade union movement and on the ACTU, I was involved in discussions, and Albert Monk actually came out as a very strong supporter of family payments and family allowances. I think it was at an ACTU congress in the early 1960s when we went through it and he came out as a strong supporter of family allowances supporting children. He was in opposition to some of those people who were on the population control bandwagonâthe population bomb bandwagonâand I pay full credit to Albert Monk for what he did in those days against the sort of pressure that was being brought to bear on him and on the rest of us in the ACTU executive.</para><para> No doubt Senator Neal will be as keen as I am to make sure that the Prime Minister delivers on his undertaking which was publicly stated here in the chamber by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. I can assure Senator Neal that I will be as keen as she is, and the opposition no doubt will be, I hope, to see, as the Prime Minister has said, in effect, that families with children will be better off under the outcome of the taxation restructuring. If we can hold him to that, I think we will have achieved a good deal. I do not for one moment consider that the Prime Minister would renege on such an assurance, because I believe that he is very firmly committed to it himself. I have come to that conclusion from the way he has spoken on this particular matter.</para><para>So there it is. I had to ask myself this question: what could be achieved through this? Here we were in the Senate, as I said before, faced with the proposition that if we amended this legislation substantially it would have no hope. It would go back to the House of Representatives, the government would 
 defeat our amendments, it would come back up to the Senate and, if we insisted, the whole thing would be shelvedâand with what result?</para><para>As I said before lunchâand I am not saying anything different this time after lunch; I have been there and done that on the RDAâthere were winners in this. I have figures from the Parliamentary Library with regard to winners and losers. The government figures were that 27Â½ per cent of current youth allowance, or equivalent, recipients would be better off; 64 per cent would remain the same; six per cent would experience a reduction; and two per cent would lose the allowance, whatever allowance they were on.</para><para>That is not a satisfactory situation, I agree. But one has to look at it squarely and think, well, what is the best outcome that can be achieved? Rightly or wrongly, I decided that it was time to respond to a request for a meeting.

On the face of it, it seems to me that this undertaking by Senator Hill does not give any sort of guarantee that that particular group of families who lose that 
 $135 million will be compensated in any way in this future tax restructuring, if the present government has the opportunity to bring that restructuring about.</para><para>Within the tax system, on nearly any interpretation that I have ever been aware ofâand I am happy for people to correct me if they believe there is an exampleâ`family' has been defined as `having children of less than 18 years'. So how can any proposal within the tax system compensate families with adult children between the ages of 18 and 20? If it is the intention of this government to make payments to families in that particular position, it is obviously a very relevant consideration and a matter that I believe the government should disclose openly.</para><para>The debates held within the Senate, I believe, should be carried out on a transparent basis. All decision makers involved, all senators, should have access to information which will affect their ultimate position on the bill. If the government says, `We have information that may affect your decision making on this issue but we are just not going to give it to you,' I think the government is treating the Senate and many senators with a lack of respect, and I do not think that is a very good precedent for this government to start with.</para><para>Certainly I would very much like to know as an individual senatorâand I am sure that all opposition senators would like to knowâwhether the government is proposing to make changes to compensate this particular group of people.

This legislation is coming in from 1 July, as I understand it. What the government does in the budget might be one thing, but let us get it very clear that we have been told by the government that we will ultimately have a completely restructured taxation system, introduced sometime in the new financial year. I assume that that is going to be put to the people. I do hope it is going to be put to the people in the election campaign. That, I understand, is the intention of the government. So it will be open and transparent.</para></talk.start><para>I was looking to an ongoing beneficial outcome to families, and I specifically mentioned parents concerning their responsibilities in raising sons and daughters, Australia's future taxpayers. I pointed out the need to recognise, in whatever taxation system that emerges, the intra-family transfers that take place. If they are going to assume that those are taking place and test the youth allowance on that particular assumption, it is only fair that the government should recognise that transfer for the purposes of minimising the tax of those parents and also helping those other parents who may, even though they are on a relatively high income, have an income tax neutral situation.</para><para>I agree with what Senator Margetts implied, that you have got to be paying tax to have something recognised in the tax system. That is one of the reasons that the word `help' is there. I do not think there is anything more that I can enlighten you on, other than to say that I look forward to assistance to ensure that 
 this undertaking is honoured, which I have no doubt it will be.</para><para>As to Senator Neal's reference to the specific parents involved in income testing, which will affect some six per cent, or eight per cent counting the other two per cent, of the youth allowance recipients, they will be covered by what was said, but it is not limited to those persons.

Just now, you listen to me. Something like 50 per cent of the families were on low to middle incomes. Some of them were not in fact paying tax and therefore they received their assistance through the social security system. I would have thought you might have pondered on that somewhat.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the things that you also continue to ignore is how most families do not have just one unemployed young person in the family; they have young people in a mixture of age groups and their young are engaged in a mixture of activities. Just let us remember thisâbecause we have been through it before and I do not want to go over and over itâtwo-thirds of the unemployed 18- to 20-year-olds will not be affected by the youth allowance parental means test, either because they are independent themselves or because they come from low income pensioner or beneficiary families. That is the first thing.</para><para>The second thing is that, where they have more than one young person in the family and the family income is below $30,700, a family with a student and an unemployed child both aged over 18 will be better off than they are now because the increase in the benefit that is paid to the student is greater than the decrease in the benefit paid to the unemployed person. Those are some of the things you are not factoring in when you are considering this measure. That is why I think you have gone off on your high horse to the wrong destination.</para><para>Senator Harradine has acknowledged that this legislation has a lot of benefits. It does have a parental means test to people that you would choose not to parentally means test. But the situation is that those families are parentally means tested now for their students of that age. There is no justifiable reason why they should not also be means tested, using the same means test, for their young unemployed. As I pointed out to you last week, DSS statistics show that the young unemployed are on average on benefits for five months, whereas the students are on assistance for anything up to five years. It is a very different commitment that parents make to their student children from what they are currently asked to make to their young unemployed people.</para><para>When there is a transfer within the family of the benefits such as I have just demonstrated to you, it is not fair or honest to suggest that these families are going to be worse off. Many of them will be better off. Although they will get a lesser payment for their young 
 unemployed person, they will be getting an increased benefit for their student. Surely we should be sending a message to young people that, if you possibly can, you should be studying to improve your opportunities in life. The way the current system is designed, you are going to do better financially if you go on the dole than if you go into study, and surely it is wrong to send that message to young people.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>631</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am totally enraged by the minister's response. There are many people who believe that education is a benefit, not a cost, and should be treated so; but it is currently treated as a benefit.

How dare you come into this chamber and express the fact that a person who is unemployed should be treated as though their unemployment is a benefit to them; that their unemployment is some sort of privilege to them and their families; that unemployment is a giftâsomething for which they have to be grateful and, if it is taken away, they should expect it.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="metadata">NEWMAN</name><name role="display">Senator Newman</name></talker><para>âWhat rubbish!

Like Senator Dee Margetts, I am similarly angered and getting rather depressed by these proceedings. I do not mean to be cynical or distrusting of governments but I am not happy with a general commitment by the Prime Ministerâor anyone else for that matterâto consider how the taxation system can perhaps be restruc 
 tured or changed in some way to alleviate some of the financial burdens on families.</para></talk.start><para>While I agree with that sentiment, I want some specifics. I want to know what is going to happen to the 4,200 young people aged between 18 and 20 who will no longer receive rent assistanceâthose who will lose at least $74.80 per fortnight or $1,944 per year in income. I want to know what will happen to the 33,600 young people between the ages of 18 and 20 who will receive a reduced level of youth allowance because they will be income tested on parental means. What will happen to the 12,800 young people between the ages of 18 and 20 who will have their benefits cancelledâthe ones whom the government does not believe need to live away from home for the purposes of study, jobsearch or training? I could go on. I want to know how these young people are going to be compensated in the short term and how the financial burden on their families is going to be alleviated.</para><para>I take on board the minister's comment that a lot of these measures, and some of the measures contained in the bill, have been badly needed for a long time. She is right when she says that there are a number of things that could have been taken on board by the last government. One of those issues is parity between unemployment benefits and student financial assistance levels. Another is flexibility and streamlining of payment arrangements. I know about thisâI was in a number of student groups that called on the former government to look into some of the more streamlined arrangements between departments such as DEETYA and the Department of Social Security.</para><para>I also acknowledge Senator Dee Margetts's interjection that a number of other issues which have been put forward by a number of community, youth, student and welfare groups have not been picked up in this legislationâwhether it is to do with the strict, harsh and restrictive nature of the parental means test under this bill or the inclusion of that absolutely ridiculous actual means testing arrangement.</para><para>One issue that I think has been debated longer than most issues in debates on this kind of policy area is the age of independ 
 ence. It is something that we have an opportunity to rectify today, certainly with the amendments before us. I look forward to a recognition from all parties in this chamberâsomewhat naively, I suspectâin respect of the age of independence for full-time students.</para><para>I remember Senator Neal's very brief rationale, before we went to question time, as to why the ALP will not support the Democrats amendment relating to the definition that the age of independence for a full-time student is 18. She said that it was because a young person in education at that time of their life is advantaged. They certainly are going to be advantaged under a government like this one where education is increasingly defined, as it was under the former government, as a privilege and not a community right! Yes, Senator Margetts, there are people who define education as a benefit and as an investment and not simply a cost.</para><para>I still do not understand the logic of the opposition, which is willing to consider a reduction in the age at which a young unemployed person is considered to be independent but not for a full-time student. This is not about being advantaged as a young person by being in the education and training system; this is an expectation under this legislation. Goodness knows what is going to happen to those young people who do not get into an education and training institution, who apply for TAFE places but are dealing with the unmet demand situation of something like 60,000 places last year alone. What happens to those young people who are not able to find some form of employment? How are they going to be compensated? I am still at a loss to understand.</para><para>I will acknowledge the positive aspects of this legislation, but I am also going to talk about and expose the harsh onesâthrowing 16- and 17 year-olds who cannot get employment, education and training onto some kind of scrap heap. I will acknowledge, too, the few exemptions that exist. I take the government's conservative estimates: 1,600 will be thrown off benefits. What happens to them and their families? I want to know what the minister suggests will happen to those people under this bill. I want to know what 
 happens to them as a consequence of the so-called assurance put forward by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) and the Prime Minister.</para><para>I am all for accepting the relevance and the appropriateness of negotiations behind the scenes, debate in committees or even discussions with individuals and party members in this place and with the Prime Ministerâanyone. But I expect those amendments, changes, ideas or proposals to be put on the floor of this chamber at the committee stage.

It is certainly completely unrelated to the legal age of adulthood of 18 years or even the old coming of age at 21. I will tell senators where it comes from: from the old Commonwealth scholarship scheme of 1951. It comes from the very early years of the Liberal Menzies government. This is very telling: while it is clear to most Australians that community values have altered substantially in the last 45 years, including as to when people are responsible for their own affairs, this government seems hell-bent on recreating the values of the 1950sâvalues to which the Australian community no longer subscribes. I call it compulsory picket fences.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is why the youth of Australia are turning their back on the government and politicians in general. Senator Stott Despoja probably has figures on the level of dissatisfaction amongst young people with the political process from some of the work she has done, but I believe the youth poll has found it runs at about 98 per cent. While the government continues to ignore the reality for young Australians, this will only get worse.</para><para>The age of independence also raises the question as to what is the government's definition of `youth'. For example, what strange biological metamorphosis occurs within the educational environment that renders a student a youth for four years longer than an unemployed person? As the National Union of Students has pointed out, the continuing definition of `youth' status for students aged 21 to 25 goes against one of the central stated aims of the youth allowance 
 scheme: to remove the disincentives to study. Can the minister explain to the chamber how making students dependent on their parents until the age of 25 while rightly maintaining the existing arrangements which allow for anyone aged 21 and above to receive a higher rate of payment on the dole removes disincentives to study?</para><para>As the National Union of Students pointed out in its responses to the youth allowance community discussion paper, the greatest transition between study and the labour market for students and unemployed people in receipt of benefits takes place when students leave tertiary education for the first time and begin to look for employment. This process of moving from study to the labour market typically takes place around the age of 21 to 24, as most tertiary students are school leavers undertaking three- to six-year courses. Given this large demographic cohort, the youth allowance age of independence is spectacularly unsuccessful in creating a simplified system and removing disincentives to study.</para><para>Remember the minister said it is about making it easier for bureaucrats. As I have demonstrated, the very people who are most likely to transfer between unemployment and educationâthat is, 21- to 24-year-oldsâwill still have to leave the youth allowance and register for Newstart or vice versa. So the age of independence for students achieves none of the government's stated objectives.</para><para>I agree with the National Union of Students submission that either the government is completely lacking in its understanding of the two systems or the government's claims of wanting to increase flexibility in the transition between education and the labour force are completely disingenuous and the whole age of independence issue is just an excuse to cut benefits to tens of thousands of young, and not so young, Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>636</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI ask the minister what the cost of this amendment would be.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>636</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI understand that to grant independence to all young people

I note Senator Neal has asked the minister for a costing as to what this amendment would mean. I just want to know for the record, if indeed the opposition opposes this amendment, why they are doing it. Just which excuse are we going to be giving the community: is it that it is going to cost too much or is it all those arguments that Senator Neal gave quite eloquently in favour of a reduced age of independence for young unemployed people earlier on in this debate? Don't those arguments apply?</para></talk.start><para>The youth allowance ages are contrary to community expectations and law, as I have said. I just want to make the point on the record that at 15 in this country you can get your own Medicare card. You can have sexâat least heterosexual sex. You can get a full-time or part-time job. At 17 you can be taken to an adult court if you break the law. You can be sent to an adult gaol if the court so orders. You can leave home without legal implications. At 18 you can vote and make a valid will. You are beyond the age of compulsory schooling and you are bound by legal contracts. You can drive a car and you can get married. According to the National 
 Children's and Youth Law Centre, `you are now in control of your life'. So why, oh why, is the age of independence for full-time students 25? As Senator Margetts said, my ambit claim was 18. Our preferred option was at least 18. It was a more realistic indication of when young people in Australia are adults. We are going for 21 now.

This is a very difficult issue for the opposition. Surely you understand that, bearing in mind the comments you have just made.

It makes it very difficult when you are yelling from your seat. There is an accepted community norm which is different from age 18 for students. I do not believe that young people who are spending their time studying are in exactly the same position as young people who have decided to go out and seek full-time employment. Our position in the past has been, and will be when we are in government, that the age of independence should be reduced from what it was left at with the previous coalition governmentâfrom 25 to 21. We were in the process of reducing that age of independence to where it should ultimately rest at the time we lost government. The coalition response, once they were elected, was to take it back up to 25. Our 
 proposition is that it should be once again reduced over time to 21.

If we had remained in government, the objective was to take it down to 21. That was the ultimate aim. An amendment was foreshadowed by Senator Carr which proposed that the age be reduced over time from 25. I understand that is somewhere in the workings still.

Our amendments would mean that people who are disadvantaged under one or other of the government's criteria would be able to qualify.</para><para>The government has to pull in its belt. In doing so, it is going to take the belt to young people. This legislation is about robbing and cheating young people of not just tens of millions of dollars but hundreds of millions of dollars. As the minister has said, it is to try to encourage young people to go into education, but at the other end governments are cutting funds to education. For example, in TAFE courses 60,000 people last year could not find a place so the increased number is going to be blocked from that avenue.</para><para>It will no doubt suit the government to continue to say, as the minister has quite erroneously said, that people who are opposed to what she is doing are in favour of rich people getting an advantage as a part spin-off from the government's legislation. The fact is that this is another effort by the Greens to roll back the disadvantage to disadvantaged young people, to make the disadvantage test less onerous. The government wants to make the disadvantage to disadvantaged young people more onerous, because it wants to take money 
 out of their pocket. It wants to force them to be mendicants on their parents, and it wants to transfer its cost cutting obligations to a more expensive life of disadvantage and therefore a more disadvantaged life for those people in our society who are least able to do anything about it. The numbers will be with the government. Senator Harradine is going to vote for this social disadvantage being increasedâfor what good reason I do not know. There are no specifics that I have been able to pick up on, but he is going to vote for this enormous impost on young people and the impact it will have on poor families.</para><para>The minister says that the difference between the government legislation and reducing the age to 18 alone for students and unemployed people being treated as adults would be some $560 million. This measure would make that figure greater. It is a massive incursion on disadvantaged people in Australia. I do not understand how Senator Harradine can support it, but he does. I do not understand how the government can glibly say this is to the advantage of young Australians because it is not. I put the amendment to the Senate knowing that it has a snowflake's chance in hell of getting through because of the cold face of people on the other side to the disadvantaged people in our society.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>641</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âA lot of the comments made by Senator Brown I feel the need to respond to.

The act is presently moot on the point of a situation where, in fact, the parents themselves do not have a home that they can provide for their children. It can be because of their adverse financial circumstancesâalthough that is probably unlikely because of the level of the means test. Alternatively, it may be that they do not have a permanent addressâpeople living in caravans, travelling around, doing a world tour. Anything of that nature would mean that the parents do not have a home they can provide for their chil 
 dren.

Young people concurrently qualify as independent when there is no parental home and the parents cannot accommodate the young person. For example, there is the situation of a woman who has to move to a refuge; she may not be able to accommodate her teenage son at the refuge. The current provisions would allow for that, and most such situations would be temporary.</para></talk.start><para>If we were to move to broadening this, as suggested by these amendments, parents have a responsibility to provide a home for their children. It is only in unusual circumstances that the independent rate would be paid. A parent's refusal, on the other hand, to have the young person live at home is not enough on its own to qualify. It needs to be assessed in the context of whether extreme family breakdown has occurred. I would draw the Senate's attention to the fact that, if we simply accepted the statement that a young person is not allowed to live at home as evidence of homelessness, we would be inviting collusion between parents and children.</para><para>Senator Harradine, you may recall that, under the previous government, there was a lot of scepticism about the way that the homeless criteria were being administered. The member for Braddon, Chris Miles, and I waged a vigorous campaign to ensure that parents were included in the assessment by the social workers in the then Department of Social Security to see whether the young person's claims were true. It may be that in some cases the young person claimed that they were homeless when, in fact, they were not; that there was a family willing and keen to care for them. In some cases, there may well have been irresponsible parents who were prepared to collude with their child because the child was saying that they wanted to leave home and could get the money from the government. I am concerned that, if we 
 are not careful about this measure, we open up these sorts of situations.</para><para>As I understand it, the arrangements as they are here in this legislation are the same as are currently for youth training allowance; they are no harsher. What has happened since this government has been in office is that we have had a very careful look at the criteria and the way they are administered. But that is simply to make sure that those who are entitled do get their entitlement, and that those who are not do not abuse the taxpayer. I believe that there was an element of that in the way it was administered previously. I do not see any justification for expanding this and making it broader so that you can have families wrongfully claiming for support when they are perfectly able to provide a home for their child.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>643</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI do not know, Minister, whether you are intentionally misstating the effect of our amendment or you really do not understand. Our amendment does not extend to circumstances where parents refuse to have children at home. That is not included in our amendment and it is not envisaged to do so.

I guess I was using a suggested response which actually applies to more than one of the amendments in this area. The amendment that is moved by Senator Neal for the opposition in fact does enable payment of the higher rate of youth allowance to young people whose parents do not have a home. Other similar exceptional circumstances include situations where parents are unable to provide a home for the young person because they themselves are homeless or in temporary accommodation because of a major personal crisis. I was referring to that earlier in my response. But extending the qualifications may encourage parents to rearrange their accommodation 
 without fulfilling their primary responsibility to house their children. Parents who choose to move to new premises or interstate are still required and expected to make arrangements for their children to remain or to go with them, not to artificially cause them to be homeless and for the taxpayer to support them in that way. Where the parental home is not conducive to study or job search, for example because the parents have an itinerant lifestyle, the young person may in fact receive the away from home rate of youth allowance. So, Senator, I am sorry if I gave you some information you are not yet ready to receive in relation to Senator Stott-Despoja's subsequent amendment, but I have now given you the government's response focusing on your amendment alone.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>644</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI really find it hard to believe that there are large numbers of parents in the community who would intentionally make themselves homeless for the purpose of avoiding the independence test for the youth allowance. It seems a preposterous suggestion. In terms of the example that the minister gave about a parent moving into temporary accommodation in a refuge, that particular circumstance is covered by the bill presently because it relates to circumstances of domestic violence. So essentially what has happened is that the government has covered one possible example of the cause of homelessness, which is domestic violence, but in my view there are many possible causes for homelessness in the parents' circumstances and I think that, whatever the cause of their homelessness, you still cannot expect that a young person will do without support because of that parental situation.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>644</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Social Security</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âPerhaps I could throw a question back to Senator Neal.

If they had to go away to study then, of course, rent assistance would be applicable. If it was purely a question of personal choice then there is no reason why they are compelled to live at home but it would not be up to the taxpayer to support that choice. They would be seen to have an alternative to live at home. That is very much a question for families to decide rather than governments. The role of government is to decide that where there is a disadvantage to young people, for instance, from living a long way from their educational centre, then that is when rent assistance should be applicable, and it is under the legislation that we have.</para></talk.start><para>If the young people are involved in a variety of activities, as I said earlier, if they are dependent and need to live away from their parents' home for education or training or because they are searching for employment or engaging in an activity that prepares them for employment, like voluntary work, then they would be eligible for rent assistance. If dependent young people had to live away from home for safety reasons because of 
 exceptionable circumstances in the parental household which posed a risk to the young person's physical and mental wellbeing then rent assistance would be applicable. It would also be applicable to independent young people living away from the parental home and to independent young people with partners or children who are living in their parents' home. For example, if a young, newly married couple with a child choose to live in the grandparents' home because it assists with child care, et cetera and reduces their living costs while one of the young parents is a student then they would be eligible for rent assistance.</para><para>We have tried to cover all the areas where one could reasonably justify the payment of the taxpayers' dollar. But if people are choosing voluntarily to incur rentals that they do not need to for study or for job search then that is something that needs to be financed by the young person themselves or by their family, not by the taxpayer. Certainly this amendment would open the door very widely to increased costs for taxpayers. It would circumvent the whole purpose of rent assistance, which is to be very much targeted to people who have a special eligibility for getting it. As it is, that is something like 88,000 young people, which is a very reasonable coverage compared with the present availability of rent assistance, which is only to those who are unemployed. The government has expanded the coverage of rent assistance so widely that to expand it any more widely would be financially irresponsible of the Senate. I see this amendment as opening the door very widely indeed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>656</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats will be supporting opposition amendment No. 10.

It did not seem entirely logical because you are restricted in your access to rental assistance by the fact that you have to be spending a minimum on rent before you can even access it. That already cuts out a vast majority of young people. I cannot see why they should be cut out just because they are sharing. It could impact quite severely on the group of people covered by the youth allowance.

It is a very fair and equitable measure when you look at the comparison between how couples getting rent assistance are placed even by comparison now with the sharers. Two single people sharing are still substantially better off in terms of the rent assistance that is coming into that household compared with a couple. It was entirely out of kilter before.</para></talk.start><para>You are adding complexity to the system. That is exactly what you are doing in a huge way.

 find it extraordinary that you would be prepared to take this step. There is no way that the government would be prepared to accept this. I find it amazing that you would try to overturn something which is established. As you said, the measure that was introduced goes very much to young people sharing, and there are a whole lot of reasons for them taking this preferred option.</para><para>The revenue implications would be substantial. I do not think I have them here tonight, but I make it very clear that we would not be prepared to add to the cost of the youth allowance package, which involves spending over several years, by opening up this door and changing the rent assistance sharers rate that you are proposing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>659</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWe were opposed to this move when it first came in a year ago.

The obvious difference I would have thought the minister would be aware of is that generally couples share a room and they have to pay only for that one room. People who are single do not share the same room generally, unless they are in particularly desperate circumstances. As such, they have to pay for accommodation that provides additional rooms for each person.

I accept the minister's claim that this adds expense; of course it does. But it does not necessarily make it more complex. Indeed, we believe that it makes it more fair, and we did oppose this. Just because it has been mandated or legislated, or whatever you might say, by the parliament previously does not mean we thought it was necessarily a good decision by this place. Indeed, the Democrats and others were outraged by the cuts to rent assistance occurring at the same time the government insisted on boasting about its budget measures 
 and the proposed introduction of a common youth allowance, which did extend rent assistance.</para></talk.start><para>I just find it extraordinary and quite hypocritical, on the one hand, to be boasting about extensions in rent assistance and, on the other hand, to be cutting back on the amount available to certain groupsâand groups that, I might suggest, are often in the least position to get quality and affordable, and perhaps convenient, housing. Once again, I think we are just hitting hardest at those least able to afford it. So I see this, as the bill currently stands, as quite a retrograde provision.

The current level is such that, even if only one parent is in employment, nearly 90 per cent of full-time adult workers are earning too much for their children to receive the full benefit.

You know as well as I do that this means test for youth allowance is in fact slightly more generous than the one that you have had all this time for Austudy. So I find it just beyond belief, Senator. It is more to be expected perhaps from people who have not been in government and are not likely to be in government, where the cost of their promises does not count. But I warn you that you will be held accountable for the cost of amendments that you make of this type.</para><para>Let me just make it clear the sorts of thing we are talking about. To increase the parental income threshold to either the level suggested by Senator Margetts, $36,000, or to the level suggested by Senator Stott-Despoja, $34,000 or $37,000, depending on which AWOTE is 
 used, would add over $100 million per annum to the cost of the program.

The current youth allowance parental income threshold applies also to Austudy and to the above minimum family allowance, and it seems strange that in all those years in government you found it was perfectly acceptable. Let me tell you that if you limited it simply to the unemployed, as you were talking about, I understand from the briefing note I have got here that it would be $30 million of expenditure purely for the unemployed, and it would be $70 million for students.

I was saying that, in fact, these are amendments that I have moved before on many occasions, including when the current position of seating in the chamber was the reverse to what it is now. In fact, on a number of occasions over the years colleagues of mine have moved similar amendments. They are amendments which attempt to help farm families. Senators will know that the current government are friends of farmers and so, no doubt, now that they are in government rather than in opposition, they will be prepared to look very kindly on this amendment which was defeated on a number of occasions over the years when there was a different government in the Senate.</para><para>It is to do with Austudy, particularly the assets test for farming families. Senators will know that, as the proposed youth allowance replaces Austudy for students under 25 years of age, this again brings into the debate the issue that under the Austudy assets test farmers can discount the value of their farms by 50 per cent. That is already in place. I note that under the new arrangements this 50 per cent discount is to be retained. I must say that I was really quite amazed at that. If my amendments 1, 2 and 3 are not passed then in amendment No.4 I will be happy to remind 
 the government of their promise during the last election.	However, I am trying to achieve a little bit more than the government promised. I am actually trying to achieve what they agreed to prior to the election, when they were in opposition.</para><para>I refer the committee to a report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee dated March 1995. It was a report on an inquiry into the impact of assets tests on farming families access to social security and Austudy. It was quite an extensive inquiry. It was held over eight months and it received 250 very substantial submissions. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy gave evidence that about 5,400 students from farming families were being denied Austudy because of the assets test. Just to remind the Senate, the problem is that many farms have a book value which is quite high but, certainly over recent years, those same farms have had negative or very low incomes.</para><para>Yet despite the fact that there have been farmers who for years have been struggling even to put food on the table, their children have not been able to access Austudy in order to continue their education because the assets testâthe book value of the farmâhas ruled them out. The phrase that is used so often is that they are asset rich and income poor. The report states:</para><para>The Committee, however, considers that the assets test applied to farming families in order to determine eligibility for AUSTUDY, is an inappropriate policy instrument that does not take into account the nature of farm assets and their relationship with income.</para><para>The majority recommendation of the committee was that farm assets should be excluded from the Austudy assets test. This recommendation was signed by the Chairman, Senator Brownhill, and also by Senators Calvert, Crane, Troeth and me.</para><para>The amendments that I am moving tonight will implement that recommendation of the committee report, that is, to exempt the farm assets from the Austudy assets test. I have moved them in confidence that the government will agree to them, as there was such strong support from those particular members 
 of the government, when they were in opposition, for the report of the Senate's Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. At least on this matter the Labor Party has been consistent in that they did not agree with that report. I presume they still do not agree.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>666</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

At a time of increasing political instability, it is salutary to focus on our defence assets in northern Australia. The Army Presence in the North project, the APIN project, stems from the 1987 defence white paper, <inline font-style="italic">Defence of Australia</inline> , and commenced in 1992 with the relocation of an armoured reconnaissance regiment to Darwin. It is a task of national importance and will significantly change the thrust of Australia's defence, particularly with the emphasis and priority given in recent years by the Howard government and the ministers Ian McLachlan and Bronwyn Bishop.</para></talk.start><para>APIN involves the relocation to Darwin of approximately 2,300 personnel, 200 armoured fighting vehicles, including Leopard tanks, ASLAV light armoured vehicles and M113 armoured personnel carriers and 500 support vehicles. A total of $850 million is to be spent on infrastructure development and relocation activities over the 10-year period from 1992. By the year 2001, Australian Defence Force numbers in the Northern Territory will stand at over 4,400. The total Defence Force `family', including dependants, will number well in excess of 10,000 people.</para><para>In addition to APIN, there are many other exciting defence related activities taking place in the Northern Territory that will have a significant beneficial impact on the local economy and population, which I will get to shortly. Major focuses for APIN in 1998 
 include the completion of APIN stage 1, which is scheduled to be completed in the first half of 1998. This will see capital works costing $198 million finished, with most of the work completed at Robertson Barracks. APIN stage 1 includes new or additional facilities being built for the following units: Headquarters 1st Brigade, 1st Armoured Regiment of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps, 104th Signal Squadron of the Royal Australian Signals, the 161st Reconnaissance Squadron, Headquarters Army Support Unit Darwin and the 7th Training Group. There will be some additional facilities for the 2nd Cavalry Regiment.</para><para>There will also be the important opening in May 1998 of a 70-place defence child-care facility at Fairway Waters, a suburb of Palmerston, greatly expanding child-care places available to all Palmerston residents. Palmerston is now the fastest growing town in Australia. It is adjacent to Robertson Barracks and is a satellite city in its own right of Darwin.</para><para>APIN stage 2, which will cost $268 million, is proceeding and expected to take until the year 2000 or 2001 to complete. In 1998 there will be the biggest single move north under APIN. The 5th/7th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment of the 1st Brigade, will be relocated from Sydney to Darwin. As the mechanised infantry battalion of the 1st Brigade, 5/7 RAR is a key component and is the largest unit in the brigade. It has a current strength of 518 soldiers and is not expected to exceed 540 this year.</para><para>Due to the fact that 5/7 RAR is a combat unit, it is an all male organisation and currently comprises 326 single soldiers and 192 married members. Approximately 675 dependants will be moving to Darwin with the soldiers of the 5/7 RAR. This important link and relocation is very important because Territorians have embraced this integration of defence families into the social infrastructure of the community, and the extra residents and expenditure they generate underpin programs in housing, health, education and recreation. I know and can say confidently that Territorians openly welcome ADF personnel and their families into the community. Additionally, the 
 capital works program spending of $143 million this year is very much alive. Additionally, we have the participation of personnel in defence exercises.</para><para>Based on these figures, a total of almost 1,200 people will be moving to Darwin and Palmerston in late 1998 and early 1999. Defence has worked very hard to ensure that the move will go as smoothly as possible and that integration takes place carefully. With the experience to draw on the move north of the 1st Armoured Regiment and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, Defence do not anticipate any problems and there is excellent cooperation with the Northern Territory Department of Asian Relations, Trade and Industry, in particular their Defence and Space Industries Group.</para><para>The Australian Defence Force will also ensure, through a community integration committee, that people will assimilate well into the community. It is a credit to the Northern Territory government that it is the first state government to create a ministry of defence support, and I note it is held by the Chief Minister. The Defence Force realises the importance of a soldier's family settling in and is taking great lengths to make sure this happens in the Top End.</para><para>In 1998 infrastructure developments will be extended and relate to fields such as the Bradshaw Field Training Area. Fifty-four million dollars has been approved to develop Bradshaw, an 8,710 square kilometre property 600 kilometres south-west of Darwin, into a live fire and manoeuvring area to be used primarily by 1st Brigade. Approximately $14 million will be spent in 1998 on Bradshaw, with the remainder being spent through to the year 2000.</para><para>At RAAF Darwin expenditure of $10 million this financial year will take place. This will see work continue on the $60 million development of operational facilities that include the provision of ordnance loading aprons for 10 FA18 or F111 aircraft, an operational and technical support facility, a base command post, additional fuel storage, a rescue and firefighting facility, and associated civil works and engineering services.</para><para>At RAAF Tindal, whose personnel did such an excellent job recently in the Katherine flood disaster, work on stage 4 of development will proceed. About $13.5 million will be spent this year out of a budget of $31 million for the whole of stage 4. This will see the completion of facilities much like those described for RAAF Base Darwin with additional deployment accommodation and apron extensions. In Alice Springs a tremendous amount of work is being carried on for infrastructure development associated with the joint defence facility of Pine Gap. Total defence capital works spending in the Territory for 1997-98 is $143 million, an increase of $37 million over 1996-97 and a significant part of the annual defence expenditure of $385 million for the 1997-98 financial year.</para><para>The Defence Force's annual program of exercises will also take place, and personnel from Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Singapore and Indonesia will participate in Australian Defence Force exercises in the Northern Territory. It is estimated that some 5,500 personnel will take part in exercises in 1998 and approximately half will be ADF personnel not normally based in the Northern Territoryâa complementary exercise to Northern Territory tourism. This is another boost of tens of millions of dollars into the Northern Territory economy.</para><para>In 1999, Exercise Crocodile 99, a replacement for the Kangaroo exercises, will take place in the Territory. Planning has commenced for this very significant operation.</para><para>There is also significant economic benefit for Darwin and the rest of the Territory derived from visiting warships. Already this year six large vessels have stopped over in Darwin. These have included USS <inline font-style="italic">Peleliu</inline>, USS <inline font-style="italic">Juneau</inline>, USS <inline font-style="italic">Blue Ridge</inline>, USS <inline font-style="italic">Fife</inline>, USS <inline font-style="italic">Port Royal</inline> and USS <inline font-style="italic">Curtis Wilbur</inline>. They carried in total over 5,300 sailors, and the length of their stays varied from a couple of days to a week. At a very conservative estimate, these visits have injected $5 million into the Northern Territory economy.</para><para>I believe the importance of defence to the Northern Territory cannot be overstated. I have described many examples in 1998 alone which will result in massive injections of cash 
 and capital works into the Territory economy. There is also the fact that ADF personnel are now an integral part of the Territory's communities. I think it could safely be said that in past years many defence personnel based in the Territory left their hearts down south and returned to what they viewed as home after their stint in the north was finished. I do not believe this is now the case.</para><para>The extension of time of people living in the north will be a credit to both the Defence Force and the Territory community. The majority of ADF personnel based in the Territory are there for the long term, and I believe they will view the Territory always as home. Their unstinting and selfless service in the Katherine flood disaster shows just how much a part of the community the ADF have become.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Waterfront Reform</title><page.no>668</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>668</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenators would be aware that the Senate supported a return to order in November last year requiring a number of documents relating to the government's waterfront strategy. The government refused to provide the material. It did so for one simple reason: to provide the material would expose the real agenda of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reithâan agenda which is not based on good public policy and an agenda which is not about improving efficiency on the docks. Mr Reith's agenda is to get the ACTU through the Maritime Union of Australia. The agenda is about getting the unions. It is not party to any micro-economic reform agenda; it is a political campaign. Mr Reith gave Liberal pollster Mark Textor nearly $50,000 to do his political research. He also employed Liberal strategist Jon Gaul to develop a political communication strategy.</para></talk.start><para>It is also a campaign designed to beat Mr Reith's own legislation. The minister included in his industrial relations legislation the right of freedom of association. But he put it in there to beat the unions, not to protect them. He finalised a plan to override that basic rightâthe right of labour to organiseâwithin weeks of the legislation being passed. That plan is to sack one work force and replace it 
 with another before the commission could move to protect the rights of the sacked workers. The Reith plan requires a trained work force waiting in the wings. Let me quote from a minute to Mr Reith from his department, a minute that appears to reflect the work done by a number of consultants, starting with Mr David Trebeck. It states:</para><para>What would be needed for the MUA's influence on the waterfront to be significantly weakened would be for a range of affected service users and providers to take decisive action to protect or advance their interests.</para><para>It then goes on:</para><para>Stevedores would need to activate well prepared strategies to dismiss their work force, and replace them with another, quickly, in a way that limited the prospect of, for example, the Commission ordering reinstatement of the current work force.</para><para>This is a key part of the Reith strategy. Without a new trained up work force, the plan would not work, would it. The failed Dubai exercise was the first failed attempt to implement this part of Mr Reith's plan by Mr Corrigan. When Mr Reith said he knew nothing of Dubai, what he was saying was that he did not know where the training was going on, not that he knew nothing about the strategy.</para><para>The strategy was agreed by the government in February last year and progressively refined through a number of consultancies. It is a plan designed specifically to dispose of workers because they are members of a union. Therefore it is a plan in breach of section 298A of the Workplace Relations Actâthe freedom of association provision. In this plan, Patricks and Mr Corrigan were only lieutenants in the exercise. That company sought to implement that key part of the Reith plan in Dubai via Hong Kong. It failed. But the NFF is now the lieutenant attempting to do the same thing at Webb dock. They are also simply attempting to implement part of Mr Reith's strategy.</para><para>There is little doubt that the waterfront needs further reform. There is little doubt that the whole transport chain needs further reform. It was the former government who, with the support of the employers and their workers, made significant gains. That momentum was lost in March 1996, when the agenda 
 switched from economic reform to a political campaign to smash organised labour in this country.</para><para>The public benefit of this political exercise has been put in context by a major user of the dock. This is the information that I have which I think completely refutes the argument that this government is putting about this particular exercise on the docks. The cost of stevedoring is around two per cent of total transport costs for a major user of the Melbourne docks and 0.2 of one per cent of the value of a container. That is the impact of stevedoring costs on the cost of a ship containerâ0.2 of one per cent. It is this company's view that the cost to the economy of the government's confrontationist approach to achieve a political outcome on the waterfront far outweighs the perceived economic benefits. I agree with that assessment.</para><para>What we have here is a risk strategy in breach of the government's own legislation which will not make the savings that have been suggested. I know that Minister Reith has suggested that the cost of moving a container across the Melbourne waterfront is $200. That might well be the case in isolated examples. But for regular users, contract users, of the waterfront the actual cost is significantly less than that. For the company that I have been in contact with, the actual cost per container is not half of the $200ânot $100âbut $70. If there is a suggestion that you can reduce the cost from $200 to $100 per container by this exercise that is being implemented by the National Farmers Federation, in fact the real cost now is 30 per cent lower to this particular user than the cost which is being touted as the savings cost which will result from the so-called reform on the waterfront.</para><para>So the argument that is being put forward, the public face of this exercise that is being put forwardâthe public face that I suggest is being developed by pollster Mr Mark Textor and refined by strategist Mr Jonathan Gaul, arising from ACIL consultanciesâis based on non-fact and on an isolated and false example of the true cost of shipping containers across the waterfront. That is the very basis of this campaignâgive out as much misleading 
 information as you can, portray the work force in a particular way, pretend that the costs are higher than they really are and that savings are available. If the costs were that high they would be.</para><para>The reality is that the real costs on the Melbourne waterfront of shipping a container for regular users is as low as $70 per container. If that is the truthâand I suggest it is because that is the information I have from a regular userâthen Mr Reith had better set the record straight. He better step in to the parliament tomorrow and tell the parliament that, in reality, the costs to users of the Australian waterfront are significantly lower than the costs he suggested apply and that the savings that are available have already been achieved and were achieved by the WIRA reform of the previous Labor government.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment Services</title><page.no>670</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>670</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âTonight I wish to place on record some of the concerns that the Australian Democrats have with the tendering out of employment services in this countryâin particular, our fear that the government has established an anti-competitive market designed to fatten up Employment National, which received the largest share of the overall market, for future privatisation. Indeed, some of this debate took place in taking note of answers after question time today. I certainly got more carried away with some of the interjections and I was not able to confine my remarks to some of the extraneous issues at hand, so I seek to do so now.</para></talk.start><para>The government has repeatedly assured and asserted to this chamber and to the community that, despite copious evidence, I believe, to the contrary, the unemployed in Australia will be better off under the new arrangements under this particular new scheme. The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) has claimed that there will be a greater choice of service providers available to the unemployed. This, so far, has appeared manifestly untrue. The number of providers of employment services to the disadvantaged has in fact fallen by 
 around 61 per cent, I believe, to only 125 providers.</para><para>One only needs to look at Lismore as an example, an area which had six sites providing case management services. As of 1 May, there will be only one site providing case management services, and that will be occupied by Employment National. We see that replicated in Grafton where the only provider of case management is, again, Employment National. So, far from promoting choice, the government has actually imposed its own monopoly in a number of towns and areas.</para><para>The government, I note, has also sought to perpetuate the view that there will be greater access to services under the new scheme. I found it very hard to see how the government can maintain such a view, given that the number of sites where the long-term unemployed can get intensive training to prepare them for work has actually fallen from 869 to 715âa drop of around 18 per cent. St Mary's, an area with one of Sydney's highest unemployment rates, will see its two local groups servicing 600 people replaced by one company with a contract to serve just 110 people.</para><para>The government has also asserted that services will improve under the new system. We are still wondering how this is actually going to be achieved, or how this can be the case. The inappropriate nature of many of the awards, whereby many organisations receive contracts for work in areas and in fields in which they have no previous or little experience or in areas where they have no record of operation, means that unemployed people face being assisted by inexperienced staff.</para><para>It is a sad fact indeed that in the last week we have seen an embarrassing number of examples of awards being brought to the public's attentionâobviously, in this place and in the media as well. Organisations specialising in the provision of services to Aboriginal people, the disabled, ex-offenders and the long-term unemployed have been overlooked in favour of organisations which, in some cases, have little or no experience. I gave the case today in my home state of South Australia where the Offenders Aid &amp; Rehabilitation Services of South Australia Inc. 
 received contracts for FLEX 1 and FLEX 2 services but not for FLEX 3, which was actually its area of expertise. The Gold Coast company Leonie Green &amp; Associates won two contracts in Botany and Chatswood even though it has never operated in Sydney.</para><para>So, despite the evidence of expertise and experience presented by tenderers to the government, it would appear that the more established and the more successful the organisation the less likely it was to actually be awarded a contract. The highly successful skillshare program, which has been debated and discussed on many occasions in this place, has seen just 50 out of its 300 service providers retain funding. In some cases, I wonder how they are going to remain financially or economically viable. My understanding is that, in its last year of operation, skillshare provided something like 60,000 placements. It had a very high comparable record of success. I think it is shameful that only 50 out of 300 service providers have retained their funding.</para><para>The failure of many of the small organisations to win contracts has also resulted in the loss of community links and local expertise that you build up over the years of service in a particular area, and which are unlikely, certainly at this stage, to be replicated by organisations which have never operated in that location.</para><para>There are also serious concerns that a number of the successful tenderers will not be ready by the starting date, by 1 May, as they are having to advertise for specialist staff, establish offices in new areas or subcontract out work. We have heard a number of cases presented to this placeâand one particularly infamous case nowâwhere this is the case. They simply cannot do this in the remaining six weeks. I ask the government how they envisage that in the next six weeks these particular arrangements will be put in place so that these providers meet their starting date requirements. In light of these issues, it is clear that the government's claim that the new system will see improvements in choice, access and services for the unemployed are demonstrably false, or certainly it will be a challenge to meet those claims.</para><para>We believe the government has been somewhat cavalier in its treatment of service providers. Many small businesses that have been providing invaluable services to the unemployed and the community as a whole will go under as a result of having been ignored by the government. A significant proportion of successful tenderers have been awarded contracts which are not for what they tendered for. They are not necessarily financially viable and we will see them struggling to compete against Employment National.</para><para>Many tendering organisations expected to be able to cross-subsidise their provision of FLEX 1 and FLEX 2 services with FLEX 3 work, yet a surprising amount of the latter work has been concentrated in the hands of only five organisations, most notably Employment National and Drake International. Employment National has been awarded 42 per cent of the FLEX 3 case management work, which represents around $700 million of the $1.7 billion allocated to this scheme. By any measure this disproportionality is inappropriate and raises serious questions about the motives underlying the tendering process.</para><para>The Democrats would like to know why organisations with previous expertise and experience lost out to organisations with little or no capacity to deliver the services for which they were contracted and why Employment National was awarded a disproportionate amount of the most lucrative work at the expense, in many cases, of the smaller providers. We believe that Employment National has been handed the employment market on a plate. We will continue to call on the minister to explain why this is so and to provide, hopefully, an assurance that the government is not merely fattening up Employment National for future privatisation.</para><para>We believe that the government's disregard for probity in its tendering processes and its repeated assertions that things are somehow going to get better under its new scheme and that everything is going to be in place to run like a well-oiled machine by 1 May are contrary to clear evidence that shows the government's contempt for service providers, the unemployed and, in this case, due process.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>22:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>672</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.17 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>672</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>672</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Civil Aviation ActâCivil Aviation RegulationsâCivil Aviation OrdersâAmendment of section 40, dated 27 February 1998.</para><para>Fisheries Management ActâRegulationsâStatutory Rules 1998 No. 24.</para><para>Migration ActâNotice under subsectionâ</para><para>	 96(1)âPool mark, dated 27 February 1998.</para><para>	 96(2)âPass mark, dated 27 February 1998.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript></hansard>
