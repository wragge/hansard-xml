In essence, what is happening under this amendment is, once again, that the extinguishment principle will not be applied; it is a suspension principle. But, in the ambit of titles that are to be protected from claims, that area is reduced so that `Aboriginal properties', for instance, is widened in its application. Basically, we will have a wider range of Aboriginal holdings that can be claimable and, as a consequence, it will be a more beneficial measure for indigenous Australians.</para><para>As I say, the core principle here has always been, firstly, non-extinguishment and, secondly, exclude Crown to Crown.

The confirmation of extinguishment—or, perhaps, in the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, `bucketloads of extinguishment'—is what we are dealing with this afternoon.</para></talk.start><para>The government's proposed division 2B, as was stated in December last year, pre-empts the development of the common law and is unnecessary. It also seeks to go beyond the Wik decision, something which the government continually says it respects. By stating that native title rights are inconsistent with pastoralists' rights is not to give the full story. Legal rights conflict with other legal rights every day of the week.</para><para>At this point I want to emphasise the term `rights'. This is the much lauded National Party's bucketloads of extinguishment. It is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander dispossession, coalition style. Throughout the government's rhetoric in this debate on the all important national issue of Wik, the chimes of certainty have rung out falsely as a kind of spin doctor's mantra from the government. We now know what sort of certainty the government is offering. It is certainty that indigenous people in this land will have their rights obliterated by a big stick approach from a parliament that disenfranchises them and a government that does not care about their station in Australian society.</para><para>Just last week as we commenced debate on the application of the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, and I commented on the Prime Minister's offer to fund litigation over the legislation which we are now debating, Senator Herron said in this chamber that `We', meaning the government, `would have to pay for it'. We simply do not believe that.</para><para>We will be moving amendments that will oppose the legislative bucketloads of extinguishment—I guess, to the great disappointment of the National Party, and especially the National Party in my home state of Queensland, because the list of tenures and uses that 
 this government has listed in schedule 4, under the state of Queensland in particular, is a very long list indeed. Rather than Tim Fischer's `bucketloads of extinguishment', we should be referring to it as a `coal truck load of extinguishment'—a very big bucket indeed.</para><para>Having referred to Queensland, though, it is true of every state listed in this schedule. There is a lot in this bill which we believe is simply a sop to the National Party. We believe that these extinguishment provisions are the worst of the lot. This is the bit that they cannot wait to wave around at public meetings in town halls throughout the bush and say, `We've looked after you.'</para><para>The government's proposed division 2B seriously pre-empts the development of the common law. It also goes way beyond Wik by actually stating that any native title rights that are inconsistent with pastoralists' rights permanently extinguish native title. This is way beyond Wik and cannot in any way encourage the correct way forward—that is, through coexistence and in a spirit of cooperation.</para><para>The Wik decision is clear: where the rights of native title holders are in conflict with pastoralists' rights, the rights of pastoralists prevail. So this proposed division 2B is also unnecessary.</para><para>There is also the question of how the list in schedule 4 was developed. I presume the answer is: behind closed doors and with a lot of input from the National Party and state premiers. I am advised that representatives of the indigenous people were handed this division and the accompanying schedule and given two hours to peruse it, prior to being asked for their view on it—two hours to consider such a detailed schedule and this horrendous division in the bill. I can only begin to imagine the horror which indigenous representatives felt when they saw this part of the bill and the accompanying schedule.</para><para>Senator Minchin said, last time we were debating the bill, that schedule 4 does not include one pastoral lease and was implying that, somehow, because of this, the schedule was therefore okay and should be supported. I do not believe that it is okay, because other parts of division 2B achieve the same result 
 on pastoral leases as is the effect on those tenures listed in schedule 4. I am referring here to section 23G in particular.</para><para>I want to refer to another part of what Senator Minchin said last time, on 28 November last year. He referred to pastoral leases in the western division of New South Wales and why the government knocked back a request to include them in schedule 4. He said, `That is entirely a matter for the courts.' I cannot help thinking that we have a terrible inconsistency here from the government, and this is precisely the problem with this part of the bill—those things which are in are against those things which are out, or a matter for the courts, as the minister described last time. It is the result of a very subjective and arbitrary process.</para><para>The Democrats maintain that extinguishment of native title from activities should be limited to the extinguishment that would occur under the common law. There is no need for the amount of extinguishment to be greater than is necessary to give effect to the act that is required to be carried out. Already, there is an argument that indigenous people are left with the crumbs after everybody else has had a go, even without this part of the bill.</para><para>If ever there was an example of why this bill needs to be subject to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, these extinguishment provisions of the bill provide that example. This is a classic case of taking away rights based on race. I believe it is also fair to ask whether this division could also be a breach of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.</para><para>The development of this division and the schedule has also been an unfair process, and we will be moving to have the whole of division 2B and the accompanying schedule struck out of the bill. In the interests, however, of not perpetrating any further racial discrimination, I urge other senators to do likewise.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2141</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last night I asked a question of Senator Bolkus regarding opposition amendment N3 and its relationship to Demo 
 crats- Greens amendment 12A, and I am grateful for his reply earlier today. Before I make some general comments about this whole issue of Crown to Crown grants, I note that there is some concern that the last clause of this amendment, which allows for Crown to Crown grants which are put to residential, agricultural or commercial uses to become previous exclusive possession acts, is a little too broad. I ask whether it would be possible to add the following words at the end of the final clause of N3:</para></talk.start><para>. . . , which would otherwise be previous exclusive possession acts.</para><para>This would ensure that residential, agricultural or commercial uses which were not previous exclusive possession acts did not extinguish native title. I realise that we are all under a lot of pressure here, but perhaps I could leave that and Senator Bolkus can get back to me.</para><para>The government's proposed confirmation of extinguishment provisions will extinguish native title wherever there has been a grant of previous exclusive possession act in the past. This would include grants from the Crown to itself or to a Crown-owned statutory authority. Proposed section 23B of the bill confirms that the grant of various estates, including of freehold, to any private person should extinguish native title. While the grant of a freehold estate to a private person extinguishes native title in accordance with various decisions of the High Court, it is unjust and contrary to the common law that extinguishment should apply to all Crown to Crown grants.</para><para>What the Senate did last year was merely preserve the 1993 provision that a grant made by the Crown in one capacity to the Crown in another capacity—for example, a transfer of Crown land from one state government department to another—does not extinguish native title. It was considered unfair in 1993 for native title rights to be extinguished forever by an administrative procedure. The current Senate reaffirmed this principle in 1997. Most fair-minded Australians would agree that the technical difference between vacant Crown land and Crown land which is vacant should not be one which destroys native title property rights. In addition, the 
 potential for such a device to be used capriciously by state governments was not lost on the Senate.</para><para>In Mabo No. 2, Justice Brennan—and this is interesting because Senator Minchin has often quoted Justice Brennan in the last day or so—expressly left open the question of whether the creation of certain Crown interests in land, such as a national park, extinguish native title. In view of the principles adopted by the court in Wik, it is likely that Crown grants to itself or to a corporation wholly owned by it will not necessarily extinguish native title. The government's confirmation of extinguishment forecloses this question against indigenous interests without any definitive ruling in support.</para><para>In some states and territories, most particularly the Northern Territory, grants of freehold to a statutory corporation owned by the Crown have been used as a specific device to prevent claims under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. This bill would compound that injustice. There is no principle whereby a national park, for instance, created by a freehold grant to the park service should extinguish native title where a permanent dedication of that land does not. The proposed amendment does not prevent interest granted to third parties within those areas from extinguishing native title if there are previously exclusive provision acts.</para><para>Proposed section 23B(9) of the bill exempts Aboriginal owned land from the extinguishing effect of the confirmation provisions. Similarly, section 23(2) of the Native Title Act, which the government has not amended, exempts validated freehold Crown to Crown grants which were past acts from any extinguishing effects. Aboriginal land is also exempted. This principle should apply to all such acts.</para><para>We know that there are many ways by which the government has allowed extinguishment to take place. We know that the actual acts and the use of this land are being used for extinguishment. We are saying that it is not unreasonable for the Commonwealth in this bill to make sure that the sheer act of granting or vesting or Crown to Crown grants per se occurs without any effort being made 
 to see whether they do or should permanently extinguish native title. We want to see justice better served. I could not say that this bill in any way, shape or form serves justice. Justice would be better served if there were an effort to find out whether the use of land does extinguish native title. I plead with the Senate to support the amendment as it is currently written. I fully back up what Senator Woodley has said in opposition to division 2B.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>2142</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Senate did pass the confirmation provisions the last time for very good reasons. They are designed to produce the degree of certainty about native title that we think is essential. What they do is have the effect of confirming the common law—that is, where a grant of exclusive procession has been made, native title is extinguished. It is absolutely and fundamentally clear that that is the common law. That affects about 21 per cent of Australia thereby, ensuring that the remaining 79 per cent of Australia is open to native title claim.</para></talk.start><para>These are essential provisions. I would hope that the Senate would reaffirm its support for them. They do ensure that, instead of the extraordinary uncertainty and legal imbroglio that would flow from every single potential exclusive possession lease being challenged, we concentrate the legal resources and all our energies on determining who holds what native title and where for the 79 per cent of Australia which is clearly open to native title claim rather than incorporating into that the remaining 21 per cent where, clearly, there have been grants of exclusive possession. It is not an unreasonable proposition. It does confirm the common law.</para><para>I make it clear that these confirmation provisions do not include national parks. Several speakers, from time to time, refer to the question of national parks. National parks are specifically excluded from the confirmation provisions. We have gone to elaborate lengths to ensure that, where native title is claimed on national parks, it can be done so and that an appropriate regime is available to incorporate and allow for claims involving 
 national parks. There is no confirmation of extinguishment in national parks.</para><para>Where a grant of exclusive possession is by the Crown to another arm of the Crown or to individuals, then extinguishment is confirmed. We will come to the opposition amendments in detail. It is patently nonsense to try to draw a distinction between the effect of a grant based on the recipient of the grant. That is a legal nonsense and one that is completely unworkable. If a grant of exclusive possession is made, it is made and it has the effect of extinguishing native title. To try to draw distinctions on who is the recipient of the grant becomes a complete nonsense.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>2143</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Margetts raised a question about whether we would see fit to add some words to my amendment N3.

I had a fair idea he was going to mention national parks again when he stood up, and he did. It is pedantic really, and it is 
 pedantic because acts that occur in national parks will have the ability to extinguish native title. So the national park itself may not extinguish native title but it is what occurs in the national parks. That, in reality, is what affects people—basically some of the changes that occur within the national parks. A whole range of issues could take place.

We do so by inserting proposed new subsection (11) at the end of section 23B of the bill. We maintain that this is the responsible way for the parliament to deal with the question which was clearly left open by the High Court majority in Wik. Our view that it was left open is reinforced by the government's own advice on that point, as provided by the Australian Government Solicitor.</para><para>It is important we do this in terms of reflecting the common law. It is also important that we do not lumber Australian taxpayers with an unnecessary compensation bill—a bill that they would be lumbered with if the government's proposal was to proceed through the Senate unamended. It would also avoid the kinds of constitutional doubts over just terms which were expressed across the board in the Senate legal and constitutional committee hearings dealing with this matter.</para><para>The amendment will also avoid inconsistency within the act by bringing those provisions into line with the government's own sections 
 47A and 48B, sections which relate to Aboriginal reserves on vacant Crown land where past acts of extinguishment will be disregarded in recognition that native title can survive so-called technical extinguishment where traditional connection has been maintained. That is RN2.</para><para>Amendment N3 is a modified version of the amendment which passed the Senate last year, which again corrects the overreach in the definition of `previous exclusive possession act'. Our amendment excludes grants of interest between Crown to Crown, different arms of government, and it applies the same exclusion in the creating or vesting of an interest in land in the same entities. The proposed new subsection (9A) of 23B also contains an appropriate protection where the land is subsequently put to residential, agricultural or commercial uses—a point we have just been discussing with Senator Margetts. This amendment also leaves the common law to determine what effect on native title these transfers between different arms of the Crown have.</para><para>Amendment N4 once again pares back the government's extremism in section 23B in defining the acts which it says extinguish native title. There has been an enormous debate about the government's overreach here. Proposed new subsection (9B) excludes from the definition of `previous exclusive possession act' a category of act which in our view cannot be included in any fair or reasonable basis. It excludes leases which exceed the 25,000 hectare limit.</para><para>We have come up with that figure because the High Court in Wik made it very clear that the size of leases in question was a very relevant consideration in deciding whether a particular grant extinguished native title. The government picked up that point in the High Court decision when it laid down its list of 10 relevant factors in its explanatory memorandum which need to be taken into account in assessing whether a particular lease extinguishes native title.</para><para>As I said earlier, we have problems with the way the government has approached this, but size is relevant—size was relevant to the High Court. What we say is not that everyone who 
 has a lease of over 25,000 hectares is excluded from coming within the definition of exclusive possession, but we maintain that it is going too far for the government to allow, in a broad sweep, people to have exclusive possession regardless of the size of the lease when it is quite clear that every lease, particularly of large dimensions, would not necessarily provide exclusive possession and accordingly suspend or extinguish native title.</para><para>We have taken the government and the High Court at their word. Twenty-five thousand hectares is a very large area in anyone's language. It is impossible to see how anyone could argue that every lease of that dimension necessarily requires exclusive possession in order to give effect to the grant. Excluding such grants, as I said, does not mean that individual leaseholders of such properties are preventing someone from proving in court their right to exclusive possession. It simply means that the government is prevented from sweeping every one of these large grants indiscriminately into the extinguishing category.</para><para>Amendment N5 is another amendment to wind back the overreach of the government's approach. It excludes from the definition of `previous exclusive possession act' any act done pursuant to law which expressly states that it does not extinguish native title. It is a case of commonsense here, I would maintain. The parliament itself has expressly said that an act does not extinguish. It is surely ridiculous if an act itself nonetheless sweeps into the extinguishment category such acts. They are the opposition amendments in respect of this point. I do hope they get majority support of the committee.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Senator Bolkus, I understand that N3 is in an amended form.

But we oppose the other amendments for reasons which were debated at length during the previous debate in December.</para></talk.start><para>In terms of N2, it remains the government's firm view, now confirmed by the Federal Court in Larrakia, that extinguishment is permanent. Justice O'Loughlin examined this question in detail in Larrakia and confirmed what Chief Justice Brennan and Justices McHugh and Dawson said in Wik that native title once extinguished is extinguished permanently, so N2 is unacceptable.</para><para>As I said before, in relation to N3, we do not see any basis in law or practice or reality in trying to draw a distinction between exclusive possession tenures as to who holds them. We regard that as a legal nonsense and, potentially, a legal nightmare. The sorts of tenures that are then opened up for potential native title claims are many and widespread. 
 Obviously, where there were claims against things like public housing, hospitals, nursing homes, government businesses, they would make a complete farce of the process.</para><para>We also oppose this proposition that there be some out-of-the-air arbitrary size limit on leases which are on the schedule. The only leases that fall into this category are a certain number of grazing homestead perpetual leases in Queensland—some 62, I am advised. Yes, it is true that the High Court in its 4-3 decision on Wik, in trying to determine whether a lease could be said to necessarily extinguish native title, took account of a whole range of factors, of which size was one, in terms of looking at the legislation and the leases granted under it. But the High Court also had regard for the questions of whether there were area restrictions on pastoral leases, whether there was a mandatory residence requirement, whether fencing was necessary, whether the lease was granted for a person's own exclusive use or benefit, and whether other parties had rights such as depasturing.</para><para>According to all those criteria, it was quite clear to the government, based on independent legal advice, that grazing homestead perpetual leases in Queensland—not pastoral leases but these GHPLs, as they are called—were grants of exclusive possession. Taking account of all those criteria, it is clear that, according to the Wik test, they are grants of exclusive possession. That still leaves, I think, over 50 per cent of Queensland claimable, even when these are taken out. But to now just say, `Oh, well, we think 25,000 is enough for these, and so every lease that is bigger than that we are going to arbitrarily declare that it is not necessarily a grant of exclusive possession,' is an outrage, and it is certainly unacceptable to us.</para><para>It means that someone with 24,999 hectares has their clear exclusive possession confirmed, but someone with 25,000 or 25,001 hectares is then open to native title claim and the extraordinary expense and concern that obviously would arise from what would flow. It is contrary to what is clear on the face of it—and on the best legal advice available to us—that they are grants of exclusive possession. So this parliament is arbitrarily saying, 
 `Sorry, it's no longer in our view necessarily a grant of exclusive possession, and we are going to subject you to all that flows from such an arbitrary determination.' That really is completely unacceptable to us.</para><para>I said we would accept N5. We do not believe that N6 is a necessary amendment. We think it can have consequences for Aboriginal people holding freehold land that can then be opened up to native title claim, which we think will cause much more difficulty than is desirable. I think 47A and 47B are important initiatives by the government to recognise the capacity for Aboriginal people in occupation of land to claim native title, but we do not believe that N6 is a sensible amendment. We think N7 and N8 are quite unnecessary. As to N9, the removal of the regulation making power, we cannot accept that. We do not think that is a sensible amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>2146</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like an answer from the minister about what the government is intending to do to stop the fiddling of the books between state bodies and Commonwealth and state bodies to effectively remove the rights of indigenous Australians through Crown to Crown grants.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>2146</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I am reminded, the confirmation provisions apply to all grants made prior to 23 December.

It is just a declaration that those grants having been made, those grants having clearly filled the criteria determined by the High Court in Wik as to what or was not a grant of exclusive possession, they are deemed to be grants of exclusive possession based on a confirmation of the common law.</para></talk.start><para>What is essential in this whole area is for the parliament to provide the requisite certainty which has never been provided since the Mabo decision by the Native Title Act as to where native title may or may not have survived. It is quite clear at common law that where there is a grant of exclusive possession native title is extinguished. There is no basis 
 in any of the judgments to suggest that because the exclusive possession is held by an agent of the Crown native title is not extinguished thereby. So we are confirming that all grants prior to this period do confirm extinguishment.</para><para>Any future grants have to follow the processes of the Native Title Act as amended. To the extent that any future grant does involve a grant of exclusive possession, then you either have to get the agreement of the native title holder or follow the non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition processes laid down in the act. This is a confirmation of the status of past grants. It does not open up opportunities for fiddling, as you call it, because any future activity must follow all the requirements of the Native Title Act and cannot be done validly unless it does follow those provisions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>2147</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am just wondering if the minister is aware that in 1993 all parties, including his own, excluded Crown to Crown grants from the extinguishment provision.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>2147</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My recollection is that we voted against the whole of the Native Title Act.

We do have an agreement on a schedule of leases. There are a small number of leases in Queensland that are over 25,000 hectares. I think one is near Herbert, one is in the Murweh shire and one is in Charters Towers. If the opposition take 
 these off the schedule and succeed with amendment No. 43 applying non-extinguishment to anything not on the schedule, we could have these freehold leases under the non-extinguishment principle.</para><para>We have been through this debate. It is very incorrect to put an arbitrary figure on a freehold lease or on a perpetual lease. The people who have 25,000 acres just fall under, and someone who has 25,100 acres is penalised. The matter of principle has been fought out and all those leases were put on a schedule. You cannot then extinguish a lease because of the size. That is just a nonsense. Senator Bolkus, it is a matter of principle, not the size of the lease.

Schedule 4 is the now quite infamous further bucketloads of extinguishment which included the thousands of tenures which have not been established by the courts as extinguishing native title, which the government has moved to foreclose. It was remembered by parliamentarians because it included such things as the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes and so on, and there was no reason why by the stroke of a pen that kind of measure should have been taken by the government. It is funny that Senator Minchin was talking about our being arbitrary, when for many native title holders and potential native title claimants this is about as arbitrary as you can get.

I just take this opportunity to make a few points, because I think schedule 4, this extinguishment section, really high 
 lights what has happened to this legislation in this place. Opposition parties and Senator Harradine have come in here with heaps of concerns about the government's 10-point plan. At the end of the process last time, something like 80 to 90 per cent of our concerns were not accepted by the Senate.</para></talk.start><para>The bill that came through the Senate last time was in no way an acceptable compromise to indigenous Australians but it was one that they were prepared to accept in order that the public debate could move on to other issues. On their part it was, in essence, copping a lot more than they would have hoped under any reasonable process of the parliament or of government.</para><para>This time again, coming back here, we are faced with the same issues in terms of confirmation of extinguishment. This is one area where the voice of indigenous Australians has not been factored into a balanced outcome. What I find enormously depressing is that, though we are on item 4 or 5 of a list of 20 areas before the parliament, we already have heard reports of the Prime Minister saying in the party room that the legislation will not be acceptable. We are on day one in essence—we are at the first stages. In football terms, we are playing halfway through the first quarter, and yet the Prime Minister has said, `Well, this is not acceptable.'</para><para>I say to the Prime Minister and to the Senate that our obligation is to try to work this through, not to be obstructive at every opportunity—not to be obstructive at every press conference, every doorstop and every meeting. People are trying to work this thing through. If they were not trying to work it through, they would not have been sitting in meetings day and night over the holiday break, over recent weeks, over recent hours, to try to resolve this. I find the Prime Minister's intervention once again to be totally obstructive and negative.</para><para>I call on the Prime Minister, through Senator Minchin—who is also engaged in a process to try to get an outcome—to butt out for the next 24 hours, please, so that those in this place who have an interest can get an outcome, can try to get some balance into this 
 10-point plan. Let them have an opportunity to do so.</para><para>The Prime Minister intervened last week when he offered to pay for a case to go to the High Court. Not only was that an abdication of leadership and responsibility but, given what we now know of the advice that the government got from the Australian Government Solicitor in respect of the outcome of the High Court case last week, it was a recipe for prolonged uncertainty. The government's own advisers are saying a number of things. They are saying, firstly, not to rely on the races power—the High Court has left this question unresolved.</para><para>Senior government advisers, including the Chief General Counsel, have made it clear that in their view the legislation is discriminatory against Aboriginal Australians. If it is discriminatory against Aboriginal Australians, how can you say that it is beneficial to them? That is basically a contradiction in terms. When advisers are saying it is discriminatory and not to rely on the races power, for the Prime Minister then to come in and play games at a very critical part in this process is at least not helpful, and at most something which is designed to bomb the process out of the water.</para><para>Despite those provocative interventions from the Prime Minister, we will continue in this process. We will continue in the way that we have—picking on words, trying to make incremental advances, trying to stop the government eroding common law rights—and we will see what we get at the end of it.

 ments, because I think it makes sense to determine what shape the government bill is in for the consideration of the Senate. Generally speaking, the indigenous land use agreements provisions that we moved last time were supported by the Senate. I think there is consensus around the chamber that the deficiency in the current act is rectified by the inclusion of these ILUAs, and the ILUA provisions, generally speaking, have met with widespread support on all sides—on the indigenous side and on the industry and state government side. But, as a result of our four months of deliberation, consideration and discussion, we have identified some areas where some improvements can be made that I think should be acceptable to the Senate. They cover government amendments Nos 11 to 23, and I will speak just briefly to them.</para><para>Government amendments Nos 11, 12, 14, 17, 19, 20 and 23 enable indigenous land use agreements about grants that may have already been made and set up a process by which such grants can be validated, if there is such agreement that that occur. Government amendments Nos 13, 15 and 18 make it clear that ILUAs can cover compensation for past acts, intermediate period acts or future acts. Government amendments Nos 21 and 22 are to section 199C which, among other things, require the registrar to remove all details about a body corporate or area agreement from the register of indigenous land use agreements.</para><para>If an approved determination of native title is made that identifies native title holders who did not authorise the making of the agreement, the amendment will mean the registrar need not remove the details of the agreement from the registrar if the newly identified native title holders accept the terms of the agreement and apply to the Federal Court for an order against its removal. It is obviously sensible that, if newly identified native title holders are satisfied with the terms of the body corporate or area agreement, the details of that agreement remain on the register.</para><para>The ILUA provisions are a sign of our commitment to the agreement's process, our belief that the agreements process, properly structured, is the most sensible and effective 
 way to deal with native title issues on the ground and activities on native title land. We have moved these amendments in good faith in a manner that improves the process in a way I would have thought acceptable to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2154</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition supports amendments Nos 11 to 19, 20 and 23.

It should be noted that the Greens (WA) do not consider agreements between mining companies and traditional owners to be the solution to native title.</para></talk.start><para>Indeed, the Mirrar people of the Kakadu region, who are currently facing tremendous problems associated with uranium mining being forced upon them on the basis of a previous agreement reached under duress with ERA and the Commonwealth and territory governments, are testimony to the dangers of such David and Goliath agreements. In addition, the Mirrar would, again, attest to the fact that income from mining royalties often causes more social problems than it fixes, and it is definitely not an adequate substitute for genuine land rights. In their case, it seems to me it has been used as an excuse by the Northern Territory government to ignore basic rights for education, health and housing within those areas on the basis that, to get 
 those provisions, the people are required to sign up for mining—in this case, sign up for the mining of uranium.</para><para>However, if indigenous communities are going to enter into indigenous land use agreements, there is really no point in having a situation where one group or individuals can be picked off, if you like, by those people who have the corporate expertise, legal advice and so on so other people feel they are forced into an agreement. Of the Democrat-Greens amendments to be moved, Senator Bolkus says he would prefer amendments Nos 162 and 163, though amendments Nos 20 to 31 would allow the representative bodies to get a look-in at agreements before they are signed off. We need to get some indication from Senator Bolkus as to whether or not that principle is supportable and if that accords with his statements in relation to those amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>2154</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to say a few words about ILUAs. Whilst I am doing that, I will also give some thought to Senator Margetts's request. We moved a whole package of amendments last time in respect of indigenous land use agreements. We support the concept of ILUAs as the preferred means of resolving native title issues. They augment the future intermediate act and past act processes of the Native Title Act. They provide simple, flexible, low-cost processes and they provide certainty.</para></talk.start><para>They also demand a very important aspect of any negotiation—that is, good faith between the respective parties at an early stage. One of our major motivations for pursuing ILUAs is that we believe that that sense of coexistence and cooperation is important and it is best instilled through an agreement process rather than a confrontationist process through tribunals, courts or whatever.</para><para>The ILUA process has been designed for maximum flexibility. There have been three types of agreements available: the body corporate agreement, the area agreement—registered native title claimants are involved all these—and alternative agreements, which also involve native title holders, claimants and rep bodies. We believe rep bodies have a 
 significant role to play in the ILUA process. Not only do we believe that but also the government does. It has enhanced the role of rep bodies under the act. Their responsibility stretches from and between a whole range of factors—making informed decisions and being able to pool different aspects of a claim together. In essence, they can provide greater certainty in the process.</para><para>As I said, we support the government amendments in this respect, but we do have a few amendments of our own as well. Our amendments expand the application of ILUAs to include the resolution of past and intermediate acts as well as future acts. For instance, we see some shortcomings in some of the provisions in the act. We welcome the cooling-off period of one month prior to the registration of a body corporate agreement.</para><para>As I said earlier, the role of rep bodies is important and our amendments go towards providing that there are consultations between the body corporate and a rep body to ensure consistency in claims. We take as a benchmark the native title registered bodies' corporate regulations, which provide for a role for rep bodies. We think in the interests of consistency that the legislation should reflect that as well.</para><para>Our amendments ensure a couple of critical points in this area. The ILUA concept has been expanded by government to some extent, but the government's policy is to ensure that ILUAs cannot be used to validate past and intermediate period acts. We would like to go further than what the government provides, but we also recognise that we do not have the numbers in the Senate to do so. Therefore, our amendments will ensure that ILUAs can cover compensation issues and the issue of extinguishment in a whole range of areas where the government does not incorporate them.</para><para>Our amendment N11 amends the government's amendment No. 12 so that government policy is given effect and corporate agreements cannot validate past and intermediate period acts but can deal with extinguishment issues. That same principle is reflected in our further amendments. Once again we say that ILUAs can be used in respect of extinguish 
 ment issues for past and intermediate period acts. We say that they can be used for compensation issues in respect of those acts as well. So that is the impact of what we are trying to do with most of our amendments here.</para><para>Senator Margetts, if I can come back in a few moments to your inquiry as to what we will be doing specifically with each of your amendments. If I can have a moment to do that, I will come back into the debate soon.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>2155</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In a general sense I want to speak about the whole issue of indigenous land use agreements. As Senator Margetts has said, there are some negatives associated with these agreements, but in most cases it is a very positive move to seek to have at a local level these kinds of disputes resolved rather than resort to the courts or to adversarial methods of resolving disputes. In Queensland there have been a number of examples of this—not all of them have been through the indigenous land use agreements or the native title bill processes, but nevertheless the whole issue of indigenous land use agreements has been a prompt, if you like, for a lot of initiatives right around Australia where people even beyond the whole native title issue have decided that they need to get together and resolve these kinds of differences.</para></talk.start><para>I think we ought to take seriously what Senator Margetts said about there sometimes being an exploitation of inequality between people in arriving at agreements. I think we ought to signal very seriously that that is not the way to go and that is not the way that indigenous land use agreements are meant to be used. Let me for a moment also speak about, for instance, the Australian Local Government Association, which deserves to be commended for its attempts to put into place and to give to its own association and particularly local councils some tools whereby, even beyond the whole issue of whether or not native title exists, they can seek to come to a positive working relationship with any Aboriginal or islander people that exist within their local shire boundaries.</para><para>I would like particularly to commend Ed Wensing, the Native Title Project Manager of 
 the Australian Local Government Association, for seeking to have an understanding of the need for this kind of agreement extended throughout the whole of the local government area. The Australian Local Government Association put out a leaflet, <inline font-style="italic">Working with native title in local government</inline>. The conclusion of the leaflet underlines what we are seeking to do here. I note that everybody agrees that indigenous land use agreements, if used in the proper way, are a good thing; and that the amendments that we are discussing, in most cases, are not in conflict, although there is certainly one conflict with Democrats-Greens (WA) amendments 162 and 163. I guess we will come to a vote on that.

I do not think that is unreasonable. With any kind of so-called agreement, that would have to be the case.

We believe that it should be left open as to whether an ILUA can deal with the extinguishment regarding past and intermediate period acts.

 arising from past and intermediate period acts. The government does not provide for compensation issues arising from past and intermediate period acts to be dealt with. We believe that they can be.

It is a wonder you did not include that.</para></talk.start><para>In fact, Senator—to deal with the allegations of some of your mates—it is sensible for the government to prepare information for people to demonstrate how wrong they are. You would know that, because the debate took about 20 hours in the Senate just a couple of weeks ago. These matters were explored at length. It is very important that families do take responsibility for their children while they are financially dependent. You decided to do that for students up to the age of 22. Now, students up to the age of 25 are parentally means tested. Are you suggesting—certainly the government does not—that people who are unemployed should not also be supported by their parents, to the extent that those parents are able?</para><para>Getting to the means test that you referred to in your question, Senator, you may have forgotten that that was the starting point of your Austudy means test. We have not only adopted it, we have made it more generous. Why should we put into place more generous proposals for those who are unemployed than for those who are students? We have given young people of similar ages and similar financial circumstances the same treatment. We are about encouraging young people to get the skills they need so that they are employable.</para><para>It is very interesting to notice that the Australian opposition are going backwards on these sorts of social policy matters except, perhaps, for one or two of your young Turks. Your contemporaries in Britain are saying this is the route to go. We cannot condemn young people to a life of long-term unemployment. They and their parents need to be encouraged to understand that skill-less jobs are disappearing all around the world. In Australia, we must make sure that our young people do acquire the skills so that they do not spend a long time in unemployment.</para><para>In addition, we believe that those who are unemployed and those who are students should have the same financial assistance. There should not be an incentive to be unemployed. If you want to talk about the youth allowance, Senator Crowley, I would be happy to talk to you about it any time. It is an excellent social policy measure. It is real reform which is badly overdue. It certainly makes it easier for families and for young people to access the entitlements that they have, because the system that we inherited from you was so complex that people fell between the cracks of their entitlement and they did not always know that they were entitled.

Over 171,000 people in that time had their social security payments cancelled or reduced—a 25 per cent increase on the same period in 1996-97—which means that we are saving $13 million more a week on payments that we do not have to make for the remainder of this financial year.</para><para>During this six-month period, 1,319 people were convicted in the courts for welfare fraud. We have increased our recovery of outstanding debts by over 31 per cent to $230 million during the first six months of 1997-98. During the 18 months to December 1997 the coalition government has recovered more than $600 million in debts owed by people who have received more than their entitlement.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PATTERSON</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—It is staggering.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BE4</name.id><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name></talker><para>—It is staggering.

If you try to claim social security payments which you are not entitled to, we not only stop the payment, we also make you repay the money you have wrongfully received. Today I want to commend heartily the efforts of the staff in Centrelink who have responded so well to this government's focus on improving compliance and stamping out fraud. Their efforts clearly demonstrate the importance of leadership by government on this issue, leadership which was sadly lacking under the previous Labor government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Our efforts are strongly supported by Australians. During the first six months of this financial year there were 27,447 public tip-offs which led to 7,400 payment cancellations or reductions. That is a 31 per cent increase on the same period last year, because Australians recognise the need for a social security system with integrity. It protects those who are genuinely in need of assistance and it demonstrates to those who fund the system, the taxpayers, that their money is spent carefully and on those who are entitled to help. For the small number of people who still have the misguided view that social 
 security is easy money, it is not a matter of if but when they will be caught. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2162</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name><name.id>5L6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

Yes, Senator Ray did make some very serious inferences, I will say, in the Senate last night. I have subsequently had a discussion with Senator Ray about that. Senator Ray puts the case that he did not specifically allege that two senators had committed fraud. But what he did say was that certain conduct had taken place and the only purpose for which he could assume it was done was for taxation purposes. So an inference or an allegation: I am happy to give way to what Senator Ray suggests in that respect. But what he has suggested is that two MPs have used their computers to generate false receipts for tax purposes. In raising these allegations in this chamber before the appropriate authorities were notified, Senator Ray has behaved in a most irresponsible fashion.</para></talk.start><para>The proper course of action for Senator Ray would have been to raise the matter with the appropriate authorities and then to remain silent until an investigation was complete. It is well understood what happens. If you say to someone who is perpetrating criminal conduct, `Hey, by the way, I've just told the cops what you're doing and they'll be round to get in a minute,' what do you think they are going to do? They are going to cease the conduct and get rid of the evidence. Senator Ray is an experienced senator in this place. He has been a minister and a cabinet minister. He understands full well the consequences for law enforcement of tipping off criminals in advance of an investigation. He understands the consequences of that very clearly.</para><para>Today I have referred these matters to the Australian Federal Police. I have some reason to believe that they have today been referred to the Australian tax office for investigation. But I might say I suspect it is too late. Senator Ray was in this place last night and he had this to say. This is all under privilege, so he does not have to worry. He would not be treated like a normal citizen. This is under privilege in what he used to refer to as the coward's castle. He said:</para><para>. . . I am not going to name the two members . . . but I do think their colleagues might have a yap about and might drop broad hints that this should be taken off the hard drive, as Senator Faulkner says, and that this particular practice should cease.</para><para>What will Senator Ray say? He will say, `I was trying to stop the criminal conduct.' As I read this, he said to people on this side, `Why don't you go and tip somebody off to destroy the evidence, to destroy some evidence.' It is an offence to incite, to urge, aid or encourage someone to commit an offence under the Crimes Act. It is an offence to destroy evidence that might be used in a criminal proceeding with the intent thereby to prevent it from being used in evidence.</para><para>I accept that Senator Ray will probably say—and it is in keeping with his normal demeanour in this place and normal commitment to the proper processes being undertaken—that he was not seeking to get people to destroy evidence so that it could not be used in court proceedings, and I would accept that. But I have to say, Senator Ray, that, if you were a normal citizen and you did not have the protection of privilege, you may well have to be arguing that in court. You would have to say why it was that you thought it was appropriate to tip the alleged criminals off and then say, `And, by the way, there's some evidence that might be key evidence. You don't have to destroy all of it, just some that might be used,' and then say, `Look, why don't you get it off your hard disc,' with all the opportunities that that takes away from law enforcement. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Unemployed Miners</title><page.no>2165</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2165</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security.

I am advised that former employees have accepted this offer and some have received their termination payments. Due to the payout of their termination payments, some ex-employees may be subject to an income maintenance period. In some cases, their existing social security payments may be reduced. However, most will have their social security payments suspended for whatever the period.</para></talk.start><para>The income maintenance period will apply from the date that the leave payments are made.

This applies regardless of whether they are Australian companies or non-resident companies doing business through a permanent establishment in Australia, and regardless of whether they are owned by resident or non-resident shareholders.</para><para>Non-resident companies carrying on business through a branch in Australia paid some $295 million in tax in 1995-96—these figures come from the ABS. ABS data on the tax paid by foreign controlled Australian resident companies is not available because those companies are included in the statistics for resident companies. In 1995-96, income taxes levied on resident companies, including petroleum resource rent taxes, amounted to some $17.5 billion.</para><para>Non-resident companies investing in Australia while not actually carrying on a business here through a permanent establishment are, unless specific exemptions apply, subjected to withholding taxes on interest payments, dividends or royalties arising from this investment. Withholding taxes levied on non-residents amounted to $1.2 billion in 1995-96.</para><para>Senator Murray raised the issue of transfer pricing in his comments, and Australia's tax law requires that transfer prices for transactions between companies doing business in Australia and related offshore entities are set on an arms-length principle. These provisions seek to ensure that manipulation of transfer prices is not used to shift profits out of Australia and so reduce income tax payable in Australia.</para><para>Senator Murray asked me to outline some of the government's actions in this area to ensure proper compliance in the payment of taxes. I can advise that, as part of the government's commitment to ensuring that all companies continue to pay their fair share of tax, several measures were announced in the last year or so which further protect Australia's tax base.</para><para>These measures include: applying the general anti-avoidance provisions of the tax act to counter withholding tax avoidance; tighter residency laws to stop foreign companies claiming tax advantages as dual residents; tighter thin capitalisation rules; measures to stop tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore; and measures to prevent franking credit trading and dividend streaming.</para><para>I think I have been able to illustrate to Senator Murray and the Senate that the government has taken steps where steps have to be taken to ensure proper compliance and to counter tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning.

The same company stockpiled 30,000 cubic metres of sewage sludge near a water authority bore on the Jandakot mound in 1995 without seeking any authority to do so.

She was then obliged to come into the Senate after question time and correct that answer because it is her own media strategy, produced by Therese Wheatley of the youth and student communications team on 25 March 1998, which highlights quite the contrary.</para><para>The recommendation that the minister has in fact received is that Centrelink will provide a dedicated officer to monitor media to advise the minister's office of appropriate responses. They will include liaising with program producers, writing letters to the editor and generally assisting the minister's media adviser. The officer will also be responsible for developing a regional media strategy.</para><para>Why is this necessary? It is necessary because, contrary to the minister's position put to the Senate, she does not have effective staff to deal with this issue. She is not effective in her capacity to deal with the media on this issue; hence the need for a sophisticated media manipulation exercise to be conducted 
 by the department through, it is proposed, a PR company.</para><para>This document reflects the government's own failure. It reflects the advice given to the government that they have a program that has in fact failed. It has failed because the key issues in this area have been highlighted in public debate through the contributions to the political process in this Senate by members of the opposition and members of the Democrats and, of course, by the Labor Party's shadow minister, Jenny Macklin. The minister has been advised by her department that there is a need to respond to these criticisms. They have failed to respond to the issue that their policy is a failure. The document says:</para><para>There has been vocal opposition to the introduction of the Youth Allowance from various interest groups. Predictably welfare groups such as ACOSS . . . NUS—</para><para>and various other welfare organisations. It goes on to say:</para><para>However, opposition has also come from church groups and organisations with religious affiliations such as Centrecare. Vocal opposition for religious groups are a concern for the successful introduction of this initiative as they will have credibility with middle Australia as well as those families affected by the Parental Income Test.</para><para>This government is now seeking to have advice prepared by public servants who are dedicated to media manipulation. It is unprecedented in the way in which governments operate for it to be suggested in official departmental advice that strategies should be produced and that ambassadors should be appointed who can match the complaints highlighting the inadequacies of this government's programs that have been put forward by the public and by a wide range of community groups. To suggest that ambassadors should be appointed from this lot over here to try to answer these criticisms in itself is a joke.</para><para>The real problem is that here they have a public servant who, frankly, is being asked to do a job that they are not up to. What do you expect the public servant to do? You cannot have a politicised public service. You cannot have public servants being required to undertake these tasks, obviously directed by the government. Is it not surprising that public servants, when required to produce policy 
 positions on media manipulation, should fail so miserably?</para><para>The document lists a number of initiatives that this government has taken, a number of negative aspects, as it says. With regard to unemployment, it says that over 18s will still be financially dependent upon their families; the youth allowance will cause more family disputes and encourage family breakdown; the youth allowance will cause young people to leave home and leave the security of family support; the youth allowance will cause more youth homelessness.</para><para>The youth allowance will produce a situation where people acknowledge that $23,000 a year is the family income. Under this proposal you will see money being taken away from Australians. All of this is identified in the document. But that is not all, and this is where the document fails. It fails to point out a whole range of other measures. And what do you expect?  As I say, you cannot ask a public servant to undertake a political function like media manipulation which is the province of experts.

It took you three years to respond to that report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us go on a few years to the time when we brought down another report, on Austudy. This occurred after a report from the ombudsman which showed 24 major problems with the administration of youth allowances under your government. We then had a Senate inquiry into it and we made 24 recommendations. And how long did it take you to respond to that one? I think we had got into government and you had not even bothered to respond to it.</para><para>So you come in here and have the hide to criticise our system, which is based on a lot of that evidence that was put before the committee regarding the way in which we should change the system for youth who are unemployed, who go into some sort of training, who move between the training system, unemployment and back again. They were heavily penalised under the last Labor government. We have fixed up a lot of measures in that system.</para><para>For example, the system required that people be asked to repay or make adjustments to their benefits where their circumstances changed. These people may have been in very poor circumstances and they may not have had the ability to repay all the money in three months. I had a case several weeks ago involving someone who was asked to repay everything that was accidentally paid to her—it was not her fault—and this was actually done, and the adjustment made.</para><para>We have made a number of adjustments since we had that system. What we have done in recent times is to improve the eligibility criteria for people by bringing in a means test. Under the Labor government, people could artificially reduce their income for taxable purposes—what they declared—and those people could then claim Austudy and other benefits. We have taken that away. We are creating a seamless web between the old Austudy system and the old unemployment benefits system, so that youth in this country get much better support. When they move 
 between different types of arrangements in terms of their education, their training and work, they will get much better support.</para><para>Payments under the system for 358,000 will remain unchanged; payments for 153,000 will increase; and only 33,000 will have their payments reduced. That is because of parental income. This is a much more integrated and fairer system. Given Labor's terrible track record over 13 years on this matter, they have got an absolute hide to get up and mention this today. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>2176</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I note that Senator Alston has not left the chamber.

That in itself is not only entirely defensible but also pretty sensible. Why are you opposing it? Why are you so upset about it? Why are you so upset about the fact that this government has actually sought to target where the real problems are with young people and unemployment?</para></talk.start></continue><para>It will encourage as many young people as possible to remain in education. It is a simplified income support system, instead of the multifarious confusing way in which your policies operated and provided very little support. They certainly blew out the budget deficit to something pretty unacceptable. It will also provide flexibility to cater for the variety of circumstances in which young people find themselves in in the transition from school, hopefully to work.</para><para>Because nobody over there seems to understand what on earth this policy is about, let me just remind you that the numbers likely to return to school or training could increase with this policy to around 27,000 by the year 2000. Around 37 per cent, that is 11,900, are likely to return to school and five per cent, that is 1,500, to vocational education and training. What is the problem with that? What exactly is wrong with policies which actually promote this sort of assistance for young people? Around 48 per cent or 15,400 would obtain an exemption from the undertaking to 
 return to full-time education or training or to be undertaking training. There is a deferment of the under 18s requirement and there is an additional special needs package.</para><para>On 28 January, the government announced a deferment until January next year of the requirement for under 18s to be in full-time education and training to qualify.

There is no doubt that this policy is receiving widespread community support. If you have a look at the measure of that community support, Senator Newman announced today that there were 27,000 tip-offs between July and December last year—in six months, 27,000 tip-offs.

He was just an ordinary bloke, a roof tiler who lived at Concord in Sydney with his wife, Cathy, and their baby son.</para><para>On that day in early April 1918, walking a few yards from his mate, Alfred Lane, George was cut down by the blast of a German shell exploding nearby.</para><para>80 years ago this month, the Department now known as Veterans' Affairs was formally established with a charter to repatriate those returning from the First World War. This act of public policy shares more than an anniversary with the personal tragedy of George Gordon's death. The story of the two men at the centre of those few tragic seconds in France has remained the very essence of our mission, our work, our goals.</para><para>Care of both those who returned and those who fell, remain our twin obligations.</para><para>With the creation of the then named Department of Repatriation, the Australian Government took its first steps into areas such as public housing and health administration. And, although the nation had developed pension schemes by the turn of the century, the return of our soldiers and the need to care for dependants such as George Gordon's widow and son hastened activity and policy development in this area.</para><para>The monetary cost has been staggering. In this financial year, $6.7 billion will be spent caring for and supporting veterans and their dependants. Yet, 
 I know it is a cost that the Australian people willingly pay.</para><para>The repatriation system is not simply a component of government. It has a complex ownership, perhaps most accurately described as a unique partnership between the ex-service community, the government and the broader Australian community.</para><para>Our young nation's willingness to offer itself so completely for the cause of freedom and justice this century—not just in the World Wars, but in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya and other conflicts—has required a repatriation system able to provide support, compensation and of course, health care.</para><para>Men like Alfred Lane came home needing years of medical treatment. To best serve their needs, in 1921, the Repatriation Department took over control of military hospitals in all States. In the same year, outpatient clinics and artificial limb factories were established.</para><para>Since most of these institutions and services were in the big cities, the Local Medical Officer scheme was set up to cater for ex-servicemen in the bush. By 1919, more than 400 doctors around Australia had been appointed as Local Medical Officers.</para><para>Today there are 16,000 LMOs.</para><para>The specialised focus on war-related medicine in repatriation hospitals proved valuable. Many developments in medical science pioneered in those hospitals have been and continue to be applied in general medicine, treating Australians, young and old, who have never personally endured the horror of war.</para><para>Similarly, the gradual shift from the old, rigid approaches in treating psychiatric conditions came about from observation of Repat hospital patients. A better understanding of the causes and effects of post traumatic stress disorder followed in depth research involving veterans of the Vietnam War.</para><para>And today, the research goes on in search of new and better ways to treat the conditions which afflict veterans and also the wider community.</para><para>After eighty years, repatriation in this country continues to evolve. Private patient care in public and contracted private hospitals has replaced the care provided through repatriation general hospitals. The Repatriation Medical Authority offers certainty and consistency in medical compensation issues. And where once our focus was almost entirely on the treatment of specific conditions, we now also confront the challenge of maintaining independence and quality of life. Coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act continues to expand, and standards of service for the veteran community are now formally set out in the Veterans' Service Charter, which I expect to release in a few weeks time.</para><para>I have no doubt there will be more change—next month, next year, next century—because repatri 
 ation in this country has always been driven by the need to provide our veterans and their families with the very best this country has to offer.</para><para>Although health care and compensation have been the more widely known faces of repatriation, some of the greatest challenges over eighty years have been securing homes and jobs for entire generations of young Australians.</para><para>Physical and mental trauma denied many the chance to even seek employment. For others, the difficulties were more subtle—one original Digger wrote "we came back to our careers as clumsy beginners, yet lacking the humility of beginners, demanding of ourselves the same skill and success as we had achieved in the business of soldiering".</para><para>Yet from 1919 until the present day, helping soldiers move into meaningful and satisfying careers outside of the services has been a priority of the repatriation system. Training in technical and other skills was provided after the First World War, and after World War II, returned personnel were assisted with subsidised tertiary education, including living allowances.</para><para>The need for employment assistance has not abated. Now a vocational retraining scheme helps younger veterans to find and retain jobs.</para><para>For many returned servicemen the soldier settlement schemes were the answer to finding both a job and a home.</para><para>The first scheme, established after World War I, was at best a limited success, when the combination of the harsh, unforgiving environment, a lack of capital and the impact of the Depression hit home.</para><para>A more realistic arrangement was devised for the scheme introduced after World War II. This gave settlers a sounder capital base, a stepped repayment program and training in rural skills for those who needed it. Lessons had been well learnt and many more succeeded. To this day, some World War II veterans remain on their farms. Other farms have been passed to children and grandchildren. Many rural settlements like Robinvale, Loxton, Beerburrum, Wandoan, Kangaroo Island and the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area would not be the communities they are today without the honest toil of soldier settlers.</para><para>Working in tandem with soldier settlement was another key principle of early repatriation policy—putting the Great Australian Dream—owning a home—within the grasp of those who had served their country in war.</para><para>The War Service Homes scheme, now called Defence Service Homes, offered veterans or their dependants the opportunity to acquire homes for modest sums with mortgages at low rates of 
 interest. The foundation stone of the first War Service house was laid in Sydney in July 1919.</para><para>During the Depression, many couldn't afford to keep up the payments so special arrangements were made—the term of the mortgage was extended, instalments reduced or even deferred.</para><para>This attitude has characterised the scheme's administration throughout its history and today 86,000 veterans enjoy home loan interest rates with a guaranteed subsidy.</para><para>Of course, for over 102,000 Australians, the chance for career, home and family was denied. They remain where they fell, becoming one with the lands where they struggled, on every continent on the earth.</para><para>Since World War I, the Imperial War Graves Commission, now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, held chief responsibility for all cemeteries for British Commonwealth war dead.</para><para>The Australian Government, through the Department of Veterans' Affairs, now shares some administrative responsibility and costs of establishing and maintaining these cemeteries.</para><para>They are special places where as Australians we can feel immensely proud of what our country stood for then and stands for now. The years pass, the distance between those men and women and ourselves grows. Yet with growing commitment, we remember them . . . . at memorials in every town, suburb and city centre, at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, at memorials throughout the world, on ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day, and in fact on any given day, when someone, somewhere, thinks of those who gave all that they had to give.</para><para>Mr Speaker, eighty years on, I believe that the Australian Government and the Australian people, through the repatriation system administered by today's Department of Veterans' Affairs, have kept faith with those to whom we owe everything. In partnership with ex-service organisations, many wounds have been healed, many families supported and many lives rebuilt.</para><para>As Australia approaches its Centenary of Federation, the duty to care for veterans of war and peace keeping is still proudly accepted by all Australians, as it was when the nation was yet young. We acknowledge the debt that is owed, and we willingly carry forward into Australia's next century the responsibility, passed to us from previous generations, of continuing to meet that debt and to commemorate their service.</para><para>It is this Government's promise—and one I know will be endorsed by the Opposition—that we will continue to serve Australia's veterans, war widows and widowers and their dependants for as long as 
 they need us. I know that we make this promise with the full support of the Australian community.</para><para>This Government is committed to maintaining the beneficial provisions underpinning the legislation which frames our repatriation system. Our commitment to supporting our veterans will not diminish with time. Only the ways in which we fulfil that commitment will change.</para><para>I genuinely believe that men like George Gordon rest peacefully in the knowledge that their sacrifice is honoured, remembered and has enriched our nation.</para><para>That their widows and children, many of whom like George's son grew up to fight again in another war, were treated with respect, educated and helped through testing times.</para><para>That their mates were given help with housing, new careers and could access the medical care they so desperately needed.</para><para>And I hope they know that as a nation we have taken their legend, their legacy, as the very foundation of our national character, so that it lives on in the soul of every Australian.</para><para>Mr Speaker, we can never fully know the human cost—of potential unfulfilled, of achievement never realised, of personal happiness and contentment never enjoyed.</para><para>No repatriation system can ever replace in full what war takes away. But in supporting, caring, compensating and remembering, each and every one of us is expressing our profound appreciation and gratitude to those who served their country in the most selfless way.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>2189</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Regulations and Ordinances Committee</title><page.no>2189</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Statement</title><page.no>2189</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>2189</page.no><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name><name.id>5F4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator O'Chee and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I present a statement on disallowable instruments and parliamentary propriety. I seek leave to incorporate the statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  and to move to take note of the document.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows</inline>—</para><para>The Annual Reports of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances give instances of breaches of parliamentary propriety in relation to delegated legislation. Some of these breaches include cases where administrators, for a variety of reasons, have failed to observe the valid provisions of legislative instruments in force or have substitut 
 ed other requirements for those prescribed by legislative instrument.</para><para>The Committee would now like to report on a related aspect of parliamentary propriety. In two recent cases the Committee scrutinised instruments where administrators had not actively substituted their own rules, but had repealed instruments or let them lapse and then dealt with the matter by means over which the Parliament has no control and about which it may not even be aware. Parliament provides for delegated legislation in the expectation that the power to make legislative instruments will be exercised whenever it is possible to do so. It is not satisfactory for administrators to avoid using provisions under which their decisions will be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny including possible disallowance and instead to use administrative means to avoid such scrutiny. Where there is a choice between making and applying a legislative instrument or addressing the matter by administrative means parliamentary propriety dictates that the former method should be used. This does not mean that wherever an Act provides for a legislative instrument that the power should be exercised immediately. It does mean, however, that where Parliament provides for legislative instruments that there is an expectation where a set of circumstances arises which is within those contemplated by the enabling Act then a legislative instrument should be made and administered. The details of the two cases where this did not occur illustrate the point.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988</inline>  provides generally for workers' compensation and rehabilitation of Commonwealth employees. As part of its general scheme the Act provides for Comcare, which is the administering agency, to recover overpayments made to a client. The Act also provides for Comcare to waive the debt, but such waiver must be in accordance with directions given by the Minister. Such directions are, very properly, disallowable instruments.</para><para>The particular provision relating to the Minister's directions came into effect on 24 December 1992 and the Minister exercised the power on 28 April 1993. This Direction remained in force for more than four years until it was revoked by the Minister in the <inline font-weight="bold">Directions relating to the waiver of debts due to Comcare, No.4 of 1997</inline> , which came into effect on gazettal on 8 August 1997. The Committee scrutinised this instrument and was surprised by advice in the Explanatory Statement that the revoked Determination would not be replaced. Instead, the Explanatory Statement advised, the discretion to waive debts would continue to be administered by Comcare in accordance with existing policy and procedures, including all the usual financial management requirements and accountability processes. The Explanatory Statement also advised that the decision to revoke the 
 Direction was made taking into account advice from the Attorney-General's Department that its validity was questionable and if challenged may be found by a court to be not authorised by the enabling Act. The Explanatory Statement explained that the reason for this was a decision in a Federal Court case four years earlier about a similar enabling provision in a different Act.</para><para>The Committee was concerned at this advice and wrote to the Minister. The Committee advised that it accepted that if the previous Direction was invalid then changes should be made. The Committee would, however, welcome an assurance that a fresh valid Direction would be made as soon as possible. The Act provides for an instrument to be made and it may be a breach of parliamentary propriety if this provision of the Act was disregarded. The concern of the Committee was that the Act provided for Directions to be subject to tabling in both Houses and to possible disallowance. The present position, on the other hand, was that this matter was in future to be effectively removed from parliamentary scrutiny and dealt with by internal departmental procedures, without the oversight or even the knowledge of parliament. The Directions in question were not trivial, dealing with the rights of welfare recipients and with the protection of the public revenue.</para><para>The Minister replied to the Committee, confirming that there was no Direction at present in force. The Minister further advised that the enabling Act did not positively require that a Direction be made or that a revoked Direction be replaced. The Attorney-General's Department had advised that, because the Act gave the Minister a discretion to give a Direction, there was no parliamentary intention or expectation that the Minister should decide to exercise this power. The Minister explained that his legal advice was that the defects in the earlier Directions could not be remedied in any replacement instrument. The decision to revoke reflected the decision for the time being not to exercise the statutory power. If further experience suggested that it was appropriate then the Minister would give a Direction within the current statutory power or ask Parliament to broaden the power.</para><para>The Committee wrote back to the Minister, advising that it accepted his advice about the nature of the earlier instrument and that in future he might decide to give a new Direction or to seek amendment of the enabling Act. The Committee advised the Minister, however, that it did not accept the advice that a parliamentary enactment providing for a disallowable instrument shows no intention or expectation that the Minister should decide to exercise the power. The Committee's position was that if an Act provides for a matter to be addressed by an instrument which is subject to tabling and 
 disallowance, then as far as practicable this is what should be done.</para><para>The second case which illustrates this general point is the <inline font-weight="bold">Federal Court Rules (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1997 No.143</inline> , virtually the sole purpose of which was to provide for rules dealing with Native Title Proceedings under the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Act 1973</inline> . The Native Title Rules were first included in the Rules with effect from 21 March 1994 with a sunset clause which provided that they cease to be in force on 1 March 1995. One day before that expiry fresh Rules extended their effect for another 12 months and again one day before this expiry new Rules extended their operation for a further 12 months. This sunset clause, however, expired on 1 March 1997 and was not replaced until 23 June 1997. The Committee wrote to the Chief Justice of the Federal Court advising that there appeared to be a gap of almost four months during which there were no Rules addressing native title issues.</para><para>The Acting Chief Justice replied, advising that the judges were aware that there would be a period during which there would be no Native Title Rules in place. The judges had decided that this would cause no difficulty for proceedings in the Court because native title proceedings were heavily case managed, that is to say, their progress is the subject of the close attention and directions of a judge. The judges had decided at a meeting in September 1996 that repeated extensions of the Native Title Rules by sunset clause was undesirable and that it would be preferable to have a permanent form of rules, even if this meant a hiatus. The opinion of the judges were that this would cause no injustice or inconvenience.</para><para>The Committee wrote again to the Acting Chief Justice noting that the Act of Parliament which creates the Federal Court provides for Rules of Court and for parliamentary scrutiny of those Rules. The Committee advised that it was concerned about the gap of four months during which there were no Rules for this important and sensitive matter. The Committee noted that new Rules, which differed only in minor ways from the previous Rules, were not made until some nine months after the meeting of the judges which discussed this matter. The Committee advised that the hiatus may raise issues of parliamentary propriety. The Native Title Rules are legislative in nature and drafted generally in a mandatory fashion, with the word "must" used dozens of times, sometimes in conjunction with "as soon as practicable" or "immediately". Further, the Rules provide for quite detailed procedural matters. The Committee asked for further advice on the practical effect of changing from detailed mandatory Rules to case management and then back to detailed Rules.</para><para>The Chief Justice replied, advising that while he appreciated the Committee's concern he had made 
 personal enquiries and could give an assurance that the gap between the Rules did not cause any problems or affect cases. The Committee accepted this advice about the practical effect of the gap.</para><para>These two cases, however, are instances of where there may have been a breach of parliamentary propriety. In the Comcare case the justification for revoking and not remaking the Directions was technical legal problems arising from a court case four years earlier. The apparently defective Direction was in fact made shortly before the court decision and had been administered in that state for those four years. The solution here should have been to make a fresh instrument as far as this was legally possible or to amend the enabling provision to put the matter beyond doubt. In the Native Title Rules case the Committee would have preferred that the matter was dealt with continuously under the disallowable Rules of Court, rather than for three years under the Rules, then four months with no legislative instrument in force, than again under the Rules.</para><para>The Committee will continue to scrutinise legislative instruments to ensure not only that provisions in force are administered and are not disregarded, but also that legislative instruments are actually made where this is appropriate. The Committee is grateful for the assistance which it has received in its present scrutiny from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, the Hon Peter Reith MP, and from the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, the Hon Michael Black, and the Acting Chief Justice, the Hon Raymond Northrop.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">Calvert, Sen Paul</name><name role="display">Senator CALVERT</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2191</page.no></debateinfo><para>Messages received from the House of Representatives agreeing to the amendments made by the Senate to the following bills:</para><para> Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997

There was some concern as to whether the opposition amendments went further than we were suggesting. Our contention is that the government's validation regime stands throughout this legislation and they get the regime that they have always wanted; but we do think it is important that there should be capacity for the compensation aspects to be considered and considered not just in the way that is provided in the legislation. There is obviously a capacity for com 
 pensation when someone's rights are affected and when someone's property rights are affected. Clause 22D of the bill states:</para></talk.start><para>If an intermediate period act is an act attributable to the Commonwealth, the native title holders are entitled to compensation for the act.</para><para>We say that there also needs to be some flexibility with respect to that, and that flexibility is provided by our amendments which allow the compensation regime to be accommodated through an ILUA. It is a more convenient, more flexible and much more accessible way of handling the particular problem of compensation. We cannot see why the government has a philosophical or legal problem with it. In terms of a legal problem, let us put it on the record that the clause is very clear and definite. That is, the question of validation is not to be part of an ILUA. The validation happens; it is a question of compensation. We say that, in the same way as one would have a right to pursue it in courts or tribunals, this is the easier, more expedient and more acceptable way which allows some flexibility in the ILUA structure to pick up it up.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2196</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the Labor Party amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2196</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Prior to lunch, there was some suggestion made by the minister that, even to achieve the objective—and, I believe, a laudable objective—sought by the opposition in the particular amendment that we are discussing, there may well need to be some amendments to other parts of the legislation.

 the question of whether it is category A, B, C or D in relation to extinguishment or non-extinguishment.

By and large, the government's proposals on primary production were accepted by the Senate in November-December. After discussion with other parties, we have moved a couple of minor amendments to clarify the operation of these provisions.</para><para>Government amendment 24 makes it clear that future acts that make it legally possible for a non-exclusive pastoral lease that is larger than 5,000 hectares to be used for non-pastoral purposes, whether or not it is in fact used for non-pastoral purposes, will not be permissible under section 24GB. It is a fairly technical amendment, but it clarifies some concern that was mentioned before about this limitation that we put in, in good faith, about the granting of additional rights in relation to 5,000 hectare properties and above, just to make it clear that it is the grant and not whether it is used for non-pastoral purposes.</para><para>Government amendments 25 and 26 relate to the extraction, obtaining or removal of sand, gravel, rocks, soil and other resources. The effect of amendment 25 is that the granting of rights to extract, obtain or remove sand, gravel, rocks, soil or other resources is permitted under the primary production provisions in the bill, so long as that does not amount to mining. As I said, the Senate has already accepted the regime that permits these sorts of activities, but this clarifies their operation and makes it clear to what activities they apply.</para><para>Amendment 26 makes it clear that the definition of `mine' does not generally include the extraction, obtaining or removal of sand, gravel, rocks or soil from natural surface of land, or of the bed beneath waters. This can only be mining if it is for the purposes of extracting, producing or refining minerals from the sand, gravel, rocks or soil, or otherwise processing it by non-mechanical means.</para><para>We are just restructuring those amendments. We have taken out, as will be seen later, quarrying, so that quarrying is dealt with in a way that can attract the right to negotiate 
 process. But for extraction of these sorts of things—sand, gravel, rocks and soil—on pastoral leases, which is something that does occur, there is a separate, alternative procedure provided for those and these sorts of activities should not go through the right to negotiate process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>2199</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition will agree to a couple of the government amendments but we do have further amendments to suggest to them. That will be part of the subsequent debate. This raises an area which has been of concern to all involved in this debate. Basically, what we have here is a bill that proposes to allow a range of activities to take place on pastoral leases going beyond traditional pastoral use. They will occur, under the government scheme, without a compulsory acquisition and without the native title holders having the right to negotiate, as would have been the case under the 1993 legislation.</para></talk.start><para>The activities that we are concerned about are activities which are allowed to go beyond what are current legal rights of pastoralists and, in some respects, give some of them a windfall gain at the expense of not only indigenous people, but also average Australians, who have to bear the ultimate burden of compensation for impairment of native title.</para><para> The bill has the direct effect therefore of diminishing native title rights—rights that have been uncovered by both the Mabo and Wik decisions. As such, we feel that the bill lays the foundations for constitutional problems and workability problems. Labor recognised that there was a need to provide certainty.</para><para>Different to the government's scheme we proposed a three-tier scheme which would have, at the first level, allowed pastoralists who want to simply engage in traditional pastoral activities and matters incidental to them to be able to do so. The second level would cut in where a pastoralist wanted to go beyond the traditional pastoral use to engage in activities like intensive cropping, land clearance, gravel taking or the like. Here a system would have been put in place to have allowed for notification, good faith processes, a capacity for representatives bodies and 
 claimants group to make representations and a process which would have made it clear that permitted diversification activities would not include a major regional irrigation project like the Fitzroy River scheme.</para><para>Diversification would not be permitted if it meant the dominant purpose of the lease was no longer pastoral. It would have ensured that suppression and suspension rather than extinguishment and compensation would have been available. That was a much fairer scheme than the one proposed by the government and the one that was passed by the Senate last December.</para><para>A third level under our scheme would have been for those pastoralists who sought formal upgrading of title to, for instance, a perpetual lease or freehold type status. Here the full impact of the Native Title Act processes would have come into play. That scheme did not get sufficient support in the Senate last year. As a consequence, we are now having to face the reality of the government's proposal.</para><para>The government's amendments have some attraction to us because, once again, they are an incremental improvement on what was passed by the Senate last year—incremental in the full meaning of the word. We have some concerns with respect to some of the amendments. Our amendments to the government amendments fall particularly in respect of permitting primary production pastoral diversification. The government amendments do not discriminate between those people who have a right to undertake the activity which is covered by the primary production definition and those who do not. Our concern is that this creates a windfall gain to some leaseholders at the expense of native title holders.</para><para>Our amendments N14 and N15 correct the drafting errors in Harradine 7 which was accepted by the Senate last time. The purpose of that amendment was to prevent pastoral diversification except where the activity would have been permissible under the lease or legislation governing the lease before 23 December 1996. If the activity required authority the authority would have been lawfully given prior to that date. That is the 
 impact of those two amendments. We split Senator Harradine's amendment in order for it to achieve its intent, so we believe.</para><para>With respect to the government's definition of a right to mine, this government amendment amends the definition of a right to mine in the Native Title Act by excluding the extraction of sand, gravel, rock and soil from the natural surface of the land or the bed or subsoil beneath water so long as the extraction is not for the purpose of obtaining minerals. Hence this would result in such activities being excluded from the right to negotiate which previously may have come within the definition of quarrying. The full impact of this definition is difficult to gauge as the definition of quarry does vary from state to state.</para><para>We are concerned that there are problems faced due to the exclusion of mining when some of the activity contained in 24GE(1)(e) comes within the definition of the right to mine in section 253. In essence, what we are seeking to do with our amendment is restore 24GE to its original intent without placing restrictions on the right to negotiate. We provide that the more limited definition of a right to mine will apply only for the purposes of 24GE. There are some amendments from Senator Harradine which we will support.</para><para>I go back to the point I made earlier. This is one of those areas where there would be deprivation or acquisition of native title rights and interests in a way that sufficient notice and process is not provided for under this legislation. This is one case, for instance, where the government goes much further than what the Wik case would have given pastoralists had it been decided in their favour. It is a case where you would have constitutional problems and the burden would fall on the Australian taxpayer.</para><para>For that reason, we did put up a scheme last time. We realise that we will not be successful in putting up the alternative scheme this time, but we will maintain an interest in this because some of our amendments will improve the government amendments as well. Senator Minchin, I think it is fair to say that our amendments to your amendments are 
 minor, but we will have the specific debate on them as we approach them all seriatim.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>2201</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This section on primary production is extraordinarily important. It is the heartland of the debate that we are undertaking. It is the heartland of the decision as to whether this country is going to extend to the indigenous people, the first Australians, their right to have a say on their land or whether it is going to steal that right from them. That is the question that we are about to deal with.</para></talk.start><para>We have previously dealt with the right of people to access their land and we have truncated that. The debate now moves on to the question of those persons who have been able to establish a claim to land because it is the land of their ancestors and being able to have a say in what happens to that land forever more. What the government's legislation does is cut down that say in its tracks. It is a wholesale robbery of the rights of the indigenous people of this country. `Nugget' Coombs, the great Australian who died so recently, said:</para><para>In taking the land, we did not merely deprive Aborigines of property. We also took the source of their livelihood, the very foundation of their society, the basis of the rights and obligations on which it was built, and above all the source of the religious convictions which gave purpose and justification to their lives.</para><para>Galarrwuy Yunupingu, in commenting on this legislation we are now dealing with, said:</para><para>This is the final drive. This is the revisit to our waterhole to poison it yet again. This is rounding up Aboriginal people into the valley and a final shoot-out. This is the killing of Aboriginal men, women and children one by one . . . Our right must not be taken away ever . . . Without this right—</para><para>that is, the determination of what happens on the land—</para><para>we will not maintain and practise what we practise now. We will be like a dead leaf in a river that floats up and down in the stream. We will be a bird that flies freely up in the sky with no foundation, with no law, with no song, with no story.</para><para>Yet that is what we are being asked to do by the Howard government here this afternoon, to cut the rights of the indigenous people from their land. What this section is saying is: if we do give a token acknowledgment of the 
 ancient connection of the indigenous people of this country to their land, we will take it no further than that. As this nation looks into the next century and the next millennium, knowing that the whole face of northern Australia in particular is going to be changed by so-called development, what this legislation says to the first Australians is: we will cut you out from a say in that change of the face of this country. It is not good enough for Senator Minchin or anybody else to sit there and shake his head. That is what this is doing. He can get up and quibble with this if he wants to.</para><para>Let me just enumerate what this does, the uses of the land which this permits with no right to negotiate by the original people whose land it is. I can best do that by repeating the story of the trip to the Kimberley recently with the Bunuba people and spending a week floating down the mighty Fitzroy River in the wet through four magnificent gorges and hundreds of kilometres of woodland lined rivers and tributaries full of natural wildlife, ecosystems intact—extraordinary, magnificent country by any world standards—and watching the relationship of those people with their ancient lands and with that wildlife and with that mighty river that gives life to their country.</para><para>When we came to the major downstream gorge called Diamond Gorge in European terms, they pointed to the place where a great dam is about to be built which will flood a greater area of the Fitzroy country than Lake Argyle on the nearby Ord. The water from that is going to be canalled 300 kilometres to near Broome to establish and irrigate some hundreds of thousands of hectares of cotton crops on the plains to the east and south of Broome. Of course the consequences of that will be chemical flows back into the water system downstream towards King Sound and the world's greatest oyster pearl resource.</para><para>That aside, what I had to sadly tell my host from the Bunuba people was that under this legislation and, moreover, under Labor Party policy as well as—under a Beazley or a Howard government—when it comes to that dam you will have no say; when it comes to that canal you will have no rights; and when 
 it comes to those cotton crops you will not be able to negotiate. Moreover, to other clans of indigenous people across this country, if the woodchippers move in on their woodlands like in Cape York—it has already been mooted in the past—they will have no say against that woodchipping operation.</para><para>If other smart money from anywhere comes and says, `How about a broadacre plantation?'—the sort you see dotted all over indigenous people's lands in central America, for example, and in South-East Asia and in Indonesia—under this legislation the indigenous people of this country have no right to negotiate. The same applies to roads, fences, quarries, as we have just heard, to certain forms of mining like opal and gold, and farm stay tourism—a whole range of developments which are going to change the face of the land and the waterways and indeed include in this deep sea fisheries, although it is not in this section.</para><para>The indigenous people of this country do not get a little say. They do not get a big say. They get no say at all. They get cut out of their say. Senator Harradine said only yesterday in this debate, `I am not prepared to see a reduction in the common law rights of the Aboriginals to their lands.' Well he, for one, will have to vote, if he is true to his word, for the Greens/Democrat amendment which restores those rights, that right to negotiate which flows out of the common law right to the land. It is no good saying that we recognise your attachment to the land and then say but we will give you no right to have a say in what happens to it. That is what is being mooted here.</para><para>In a paper, which I might send to Senator Harradine so that he will understand the position, under the heading `The social and economic significance of the Right to Negotiate' ATSIC said:</para><para>The significance of the removal of the Right to Negotiate from pastoral leases lies in the extent of the land covered by pastoral leases, and the continuing association with, and attachment to, such land by Aboriginal people.</para><para>Although Aboriginal people have sometimes been able to live on or visit their traditional country on pastoral leases (such access rights are to some degree legal requirements— 
</para><para>It names three states. It continues:</para><para>. . . they have until now been effectively excluded from any decision making about what is to happen to their country.</para><para>As a result, Aboriginal people have often not benefited by development of their land in terms of employment, training and income generation. The almost total marginalisation of Aboriginal people from development on their own land has caused great distress to Aboriginal people and resulted in serious health and social problems.</para><para>If the cycle of poverty, unemployment and alienation is to be broken it can only be through active partnership in development of native title land.</para><para>Let me intervene there to repudiate a minister of the Northern Territory government who said today, `No, we'll put money into social welfare for indigenous people. That's what we've got to do.' That is a failed prescription. We have to understand that to give the indigenous people their rights is to give them their health, is to give them their dignity. ATSIC continues:</para><para>Such partnership must be based on recognition of native title and the right for indigenous people to have a real say in what happens.</para><para>This move by the government cuts out that right. In doing so, it causes that alienation and unemployment and all the problems that flow from it. A paper of the National Indigenous Working Group said:</para><para>On 30 October 1996, a bipartisan resolution was carried unanimously in the Commonwealth Parliament on the motion of the Prime Minister. The resolution stated that "This Parliament reaffirms its commitment to the right of all Australians to enjoy equal rights and be treated with equal respect regardless of race, colour, creed or origin." Extinguishment of one group's common law rights on the basis of race will violate this historic commitment—</para><para>So does the extinguishment of the right to negotiate and have a say in what happens to that land. It is effectively the same. It is to say, `We recognise your attachment, but we deny you any right to have any say in that land, in that future.'</para><para>Instead of that, what we are being asked to entertain here is the giving of those rights across to the lessees of this land, including, of course, the likes of the Sultan of Brunei, Mr Kerry Packer and a number of other people who have extraordinary rights on this planet 
 through their power and wealth and against whom the extinguishment of rights of indigenous people through this legislation is an obscenity. This taking away of the right to negotiate is an obscenity. It will be the cause of great trouble further down the line, unless we address it.</para><para>Let me finish this part of my contribution by reading from a letter which, I understand, was sent to Senator Harradine today from the Governing Committee and Native Title Holders of the Miriuwung and Gajerrong Families Heritage and Land Council at Kununurra. The letter is signed by seven members of that committee. It says:</para><para>The Council writes—</para><para>On the passing of native title; this bill—</para><para>to register the stark facts of the matter now before you in the Senate.</para><para>This Council has just completed its Native Title Claim process through the Federal Court. After the WA, NT and Federal Govts forced our old people to prove what they have always known to be primordial rights to country, why do we now exhausted by this process and the savagery of the white man's unsuccessful attempts at dispossession, now have to find that the verdict is stolen by white men changing their . . . rules.</para><para>They thought they were getting access to their lands. Here the rules are being changed. You can hear the anger in this letter. And we should take note. This committee says:</para><para>The verdict:	 Australian Government—Winners</para><para>		 Traditional Owners—Losers forever.</para><para>That is how they are seeing it out in the bush. That is how the indigenous people of this country are seeing it. The letter further says:</para><para>We cannot give any more ground on this issue. Please do not give the Government its chance to destroy our children's lives forever.</para><para>That is a plea from the heart that this committee must hear.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>2203</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support government amendments Nos 24 and 25.

You are getting away with most of them, but we just take the point here that, together with Senator Harradine's amendment, we provide sufficient scope for diversification.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>2204</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I just want to make it clear that this has to be read in conjunction with amendment No. 25. In other words, where rights on pastoral leases to third parties—which may include the lessee—under No. 25, which I think we have accepted, can include the right of a lessee to extract, obtain or remove sand, gravel, rocks, soil or other resources, except so far as doing 
 so constitutes mining, consequentially we seek to amend the definition of mining to make clear that mining includes quarrying, but not those sorts of extractions which we have referred to in No. 25. They are defined in such a way as to make clear what the threshold is beyond which things become mining and therefore would be covered, but below which they are not and are therefore picked up in No. 25.</para></talk.start><para>So we have done this in good faith in discussions to make sure that quarrying has not somehow slipped through the net through, as you say, amendment creep. Quarrying is there and is covered but, to make it clear that in compliance with what we want to allow to continue on pastoral leases, particularly where it involves a lessee and it is very low level extraction, that can continue without accidentally or consequentially attracting the right to negotiate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>2205</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am getting to the stage where I am sorry I mentioned the word `quarrying' on the last occasion that we were debating this matter.

Because that was raised and because we have covered that, it is suggested that, in relation to this regime, as to granting rights to third parties and what they could and could not do, and to make it clear that, to the extent that it amounted to quarrying, it could not be covered and would not amount to the sort of activity that could be done on a pastoral lease. So it is a very clear definition of what is and is not quarrying. The reason we are doing this—and I would have thought 
 that it would be acceptable to everybody—is that it does flow from our discussions over the 26A issue. So we would support it.</para></talk.start><para>The trouble with the opposition's amendment is that it potentially leaves it to courts to decide what is mining and what is not and the arguments that flow from that, and the legal bunfight that we then have.

It lists, one after the other, a whole range of things that can happen on leasehold land, with the indigenous people having no say at all. This is the heart of this matter. I say again to the committee, this is legalised theft. We have 
 had the stolen lands, we have had the stolen generation, now we have the stolen rights. For the first time, here is a Commonwealth parliament tempted to give assent to that tragic move to yet again thieve from the indigenous people of this country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is not a light matter. This is a comprehensive theft of the rights of the indigenous people to have a say in their future on their land. Essentially, it means that on these lands any development will do, with holes in the ground—mining—excluded, and then with some exceptions. You have no say in any development, broad scale or small, which comes on your lands because the parliament in 1998 passed an act which took away those rights. If somebody in the Labor Party or one of the two Independents, or more importantly somebody in the government can get up and say that that is wrong, let them do so and let them explain it.</para><para>I suspect we are going to get a very short debate on this. We are going to get another period of silence, of non-response, of heads down. There should be a lot of shame going along with that. We in this small corner of the Senate are not going to be accomplices in this theft of the rights of the indigenous people. There is nothing in here truncating the rights of the leaseholders. There is nothing here to say that you cannot, in the future, with state government assent, essentially upgrade your cattle grazing rights to any form of development that may be lucrative in the future. That is not written in here. This is not fair and even-handed.</para><para>What is written in here is what the indigenous people have no say in. It is a big, thick section. It reads like a list of everything you could imagine happening to their land in the coming decades, in the coming centuries—everything that they, their children, their grandchildren and their grandchildren's children may not want to happen to their land.</para><para>What are we doing in this legislation? We are saying, `You have no right. You have no say. We are stealing that right.' That moment of injustice is now upon this chamber. I charge everybody in this place to think about how history is going to treat this moment, because I think it will treat it no less well 
 than it has treated the ravages on the indigenous people of this country in the past. You may say, `Well, this is not taking guns out. This is not putting poison in waterholes. This is not taking children from their mother's arms.' But I say this is taking their heart. This is taking their bond with the land and each other. This is taking their dignity.</para><para> If we call ourselves a proud and decent nation, I cannot understand how this legislation got into this place, let alone be on the threshold of being passed by the power of the numbers of the big parties in here. I find it even less easy to contemplate how it could be that in a democracy we are in the position, whoever wins the next government—whether it be a Howard or a Beazley government—where those rights will be taken away because that is the policy of both parties. You would expect on a monumental issue like this that the people would have an option, that there would be an opposition with the potential for government to stop what is happening here, but there is not. This is an historic failure of people elected to power to represent this nation and its best interests for the future.</para><para> I can say this: in those letters coming to us such as the one from the Kununurra people which I read out earlier, there is now an anger. Resignation has moved to anger, which should be noted. It is not going to be good enough further down the line when turmoil comes out of this legislation, be it at the Olympics or be it further down the path, for us to throw up our hands and say, `This is unfair. This is ruining our international reputation. This is not good for our feeling of pride as Australians,' because this representative parliament is doing this today.</para><para> We cannot shrug our shoulders this time. We are doing it with our eyes wide open. The great political parties of the day are the driving force behind this. It has been left to the so-called minor parties—the Greens, the Democrats—to show the other side of the coin in this argument, to represent a wider and more open view of the rights of the first Australians and the interests for the long term of this country for succeeding generations.</para><para> I might add that it is a matter also of environmental prudence that we are dealing 
 with here. If we are really concerned about the environment of this country—the future of the Fitzroy River, the future of the coastlines, the mangroves, the wildlife and the beauty—the best custodians we can have in charge of management with a say in what happens in the future are the indigenous people. Their record is there for us to see. At the very least the spin-off for all of us would be a brake on the destruction that will occur to the environment through untoward land use in the future. But instead of building in that brake that we know will work, we are here putting the foot on the accelerator and removing the safeguard, removing the seat belt for this nation's environment.</para><para>We do not even have the Minister for the Environment in this place, and never have had at any stage of this debate. He ought to be here standing up for the environment. He ought to be here making sure that safeguards are built into the massive changes which will happen when these so-called upgrades of these leases are allowed and, beyond the determination of Wik and the High Court, when massive alternative uses of the land besides cattle grazing occur right across this country in the future.</para><para>That is why the Democrats and the Greens have said, `Let's knock out this list of rights' removal of the indigenous people of this country. Let's take out this evil kernel in this 10-point plan. Let's shell it out in one go by knocking out subdivision G,' as it is called—it might better be called subversion G—`when it comes to the rights of the indigenous people of this country.' That is why we will be opposing this subdivision and voting against it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2207</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ronald</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to respond to some of Senator Brown's statements. The fact that the Greens and the Democrats are going to knockout all the subdivision on primary production shows that they have little understanding of the needs of primary producers. It is all right to talk about the environment and it is all right to talk about certain rights but, Senator Brown, you are speaking about the disappointment of the Aboriginal people when 
 there is disappointment all round in this legislation.</para></talk.start><para>There are no winners in this legislation. The mining industry is not jumping for joy. Members of the pastoral industry, who thought they had complete use of their tenure, now have to eat humble pie and recognise that there are other people who will have some rights and will share their properties. It is a bitter pill for them to swallow too; you must recognise that. They had paid for their properties, they had inherited their properties, they did not take their properties from anywhere—and in most cases they are still paying for their properties. In most places at the moment, they are not making any money out of their properties and they hanging on by their fingernails, so they are disappointed.</para><para>As I said, there are no winners in this legislation: there are three losers. We have to manage this in the best way possible. Primary producers require some certainty. They have to keep up with changes in technology and move with the times. By removing this subdivision from the legislation, you are putting a heavy penalty on people being able to manage their properties. They have always been great improvisers in the bush. For instance, if the wool industry collapses, they take in a bit of farm tourism to balance the books. I do not see that it is going to hurt Aboriginal people having people staying in the shearing shed. It is not going to take away their rights.</para><para>Senator Brown, you have to recognise that, and I know that you do not, and you are out on one wing of the debate. You are a doctor, and you are obviously a clever person. You have the ability to earn $80,000, $90,000 or $100,000 a year. Many people in regional Australia do not have the capacity to get a job unless there is a viable and moveable primary industry which can compete. You are sitting there with your obvious mental capacity that can earn a lot of money, but you have to consider that other people do not have your capacity—people like kangaroos shooters or tractor drivers—and you are ignoring them.</para><para>Agriculture employs some 358,000 Australians. The food processing industry employs 181,000 people—blue-collar workers in the 
 main. These blue-collar workers get their jobs from the products off the farms or the stations. Primary producers have to be able to respond to new technology. They have to respond to new methods of production, cultivation and marketing. If this amendment is carried, it will tie them up. It is not going to affect you; you will get your $100,000 a year, or whatever you can get as a medico or a politician. However, you have to consider that there are many Australians who are blue-collar workers who depend on farmers and the cattle industry for their jobs. Many hundreds of thousands of people are employed in abattoirs or Golden Circle or whatever. They are low-income earning people.</para><para>By not giving people the right to change direction, to change technology, to change from growing cattle to growing cotton, grapes or something else, you are taking away the rights of these people to earn a living. An Aboriginal lady whom I respect highly said to me, `There is no dignity in welfare.' What you are doing by this amendment is condemning a lot of people to welfare.</para><para>Let's get a bit of balance in this debate. Primary industry and the mining industry provide many jobs. Of course we have to recognise the environment—and this bill does recognise the rights of indigenous people—but there is no balance in this debate. Let's see if we can get back to a debate that considers all the people in Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2208</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to respond to Senator Boswell.

I want to speak a little bit longer than I would have in responding to Senator Boswell. Senator Boswell, although we are removing this section, it is not to knock it out; it is to replace it with other definitions, because we believe that the definition as given by the government is far too wide and goes way beyond any understanding of what normal pastoral activity would entail, even if it does extend to farmstay tourism, et cetera. With the amendment, we want to redefine the whole notion of pastoral activity.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The purpose of this group of amendments proposed by the Democrats and Greens is to replace the government's wide primary production definition with a definition which allows pastoralists to continue their pastoral enterprises and some related diversification without the requirement of negotiation with native title holders. These amendments also add some restrictions to the scope of farmstay tourism; reverse the government's position of not allowing compensation for activities, as opposed to grants, which may impair native title; remove the extension of permissible primary production to off-farm activities; and remove the provisions relating to the granting of rights to third parties on non-exclusive leases.</para><para>We will have to move through the group of amendments because they have different questions and, therefore, different answers. I will speak to all of them rather than simply to the particular amendment we are looking at now. If I speak to every one, we will be here not until Easter is finished but until Christmas.</para><para>In broad terms, the 10-point plan validates the authorisation of primary production activities, including farmstay tourism, on non-exclusive agricultural pastoral leases granted before the Wik decision. The problem with this proposal is that it completely denies the essence of the Wik decision, in our opinion. The Wik decision said that there were pastoralists' rights, certainly, and, where indigenous rights conflict, the pastoralists' rights will prevail. It does not mean that farmers cannot do what they need to do to sustain their properties or businesses. All of 
 the indigenous people to whom I have ever spoken certainly want that. They do not want to take away farmers' rights at all, and they certainly want pastoral activity to continue.</para><para>It also does not mean that they have to negotiate every time with Aborigines—that is, every time they want to sink a dam or do some of the normal pastoral activities. Senator Minchin, although you keep saying that, it does not make it so. The Wik decision does say that indigenous people cannot be simply ignored any more. It means they have rights too, and they cannot simply be walked over or ploughed through anymore. The government's proposal, as contained in the bill, is a way of walking over the valid rights and aspirations of indigenous people, and it is done under the heading of `Primary production', or diversification. In some ways, if we accept the government's proposals, it will be more like primary discrimination.

 since. There is not much I really want to add, except that the Greens amendment takes out the whole future act regime regarding primary production and, in effect, leaves nothing in its place, which is completely inadequate. The Democrat amendments try to put some sort of regime in place which we believe would be completely unworkable.</para></talk.start><para>The history of this is that, when the Native Title Act was written, it was clearly written on a presumption that there was no native title on pastoral leases, and we were talking about vacant Crown land and Aboriginal land. As a result, a $1.3 billion indigenous land fund was set up to enable Aboriginal people to buy $45 million worth of pastoral leases every year forever, and Noel Pearson went out and said, `We're not making any claims on pastoral leases. That would be quite futile.'</para><para>To everyone's surprise, the High Court held by 4-3 that, on the pastoral lease in question in Wik, native title may not necessarily have been extinguished—but even there they do not have native title yet. That is still to be determined by the Federal Court. On the face of it, it is going to be case by case and depend on the terms and conditions of the lease. It could well be, even as a result of Wik, that no native title is found on any pastoral lease anywhere. It still remains possible, of course. It is up to the courts to decide whether or not the lease itself does extinguish and whether the legislation on which it is granted allows that extinguishment.</para><para>Of course, they went on to say, `If any native title has survived, it is subject to the rights of the pastoralists.' As a matter of common law, governments can issue statutory grants enabling activity on those leases. To the extent the grant is inconsistent, it extinguishes. If it is not inconsistent, it prevails. There is a break on the common law. The common law made it quite clear that governments had the authority until then to extinguish native title right across the country. They have not done that. Following Wik, at common law, they could, but they are restricted at the state level by the RDA and now by the application of the NTA, but the NTA does not include any future act regime for primary 
 production because it was never thought that it would have to.</para><para>We need a future act regime for primary production, for the 40 per cent of Australia on which native title could potentially have survived and which would affect every single person who farms, grazes cattle or whatever they are doing on that 40 per cent of Australia. There has to be a workable future act regime, given our decision that we would not extinguish native title on pastoral leases. I believe we have gone to quite extraordinary lengths to make sure that farmers can get on with their businesses but do so in a way that does not extinguish native title. By and large, the non-extinguishment principle applies and compensation is payable to the extent that there is impairment.</para><para>When you go beyond a certain limit, if it involves mining or compulsory acquisition you get all the rights that the pastoralist has in respect of future mining on that pastoral lease land. So it is not true to go around saying that they do not get a say; they do. They get as big a say as the lessee, who has the statutory rights which the High Court said prevail. So let us stick to the facts and what is actually in the bill.</para><para>We believe this is the only workable, sensible regime for ensuring that primary production activities, which is a huge multibillion dollar industry in Australia, can continue sensibly. At the same time we acknowledge the possibility that, as a matter of common law, native title may have survived and where it has it is properly respected not to be extinguished except by agreement or compulsory acquisition, compensation is payable and, depending upon the level of activity, there is the appropriate ability for native title claimants and holders to participate in decision making as to those activities. So this is, in our view, the only sensible regime to accommodate that 4-3 decision of the High Court into the statutory law of Australia regarding pastoral leases.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>2210</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Briefly, as I said earlier on in the debate, the opposition has immense problems with the government's scheme.

 is not true. The amendment seeks to exclude large dams and irrigation from the big list of upgrades which can occur to land which, in turn, are exempted from indigenous people having a say—in other words, it is a double negative. We want to give indigenous people back their say in dams which have a capacity exceeding 10,000 megalitres or in canals, channels and irrigation developments which come from those dams.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We must note how important water is to all of us and, in particular, how important water is to indigenous people around the world. It is the lifeblood of ecosystems upon which all of nature, including human beings, depend. It is essential, beyond the life-giving largesse of rivers, that indigenous people also have a say in the welfare of the environs of those rivers because they are the places of ancient connection.</para><para>In floating down the Fitzroy River with the Bunuba people in February, on three occasions we came to galleries of paintings—magnificent art on the walls of the gorges, some  of which is from recent times but much of which is many thousands of years old. We do not know the effects of dams below such systems. We do know of course that, as in Tasmania with the Derwent scheme, when paintings come into the flood zone they are irrevocably and totally lost. Their cultural significance is destroyed no less than if a bomb hit Westminster Abbey. That is total extinguishment.</para><para>What we want to do in this legislation is to restore the rights of indigenous people, anywhere in this country where they have their native title established, to be able to negotiate when the dam builders, the canal builders, the cotton growers and the irrigators come along to transform their ancient homelands.

They are getting a uranium mine stuck in the middle of their homelands—the Mirrar people's lands. I can guarantee that no less so we are going to see massive water retention schemes, particularly in northern Australia in the coming decades. Your legislation, Senator, is going to cut out the right of people to have a say in those dams which change their lands, their rivers, their waterways—with massive environmental impacts—forever. This is not to say that they can stop the dams. This is to say that they should have a right to negotiate and come to an agreement. Surely we cannot deny them that.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>2212</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As I understand it, the amendments were motivated by Senator Brown's concern about what may happen in the Fitzroy River. It is probably fair to say that many Australians are concerned about dams which affect some of Australia's great tributaries. I share that innate concern about dam projects which dramatically affect the natural flow of waters into the oceans and the effect on the oceans. We must approach this with extreme caution. In relation to this project, as I understand it, the Western Australian government is so doing. This is only at a feasibility stage. There is no commitment to proceed with this project. I believe that a process is already in place for consultation and the involvement of Aboriginal people in the area as to their views on the feasibility of this. The Western Australian government is, and would be, very sensible to proceed with caution on this project.</para></talk.start><para>In terms of the impact of the project and whether the Native Title Act should be the mechanism by which we seek to effect this project, the provisions we are dealing with concern primary production on pastoral leases and allowing pastoralists to get on with their business. A major project of this kind, which would be about the conversion of what is now land primarily used for grazing cattle to intensive cropping and the construction of a 
 dam on a river—not normal dams which are for cattle and sheep to drink from, such as a dam across a river, which is not what this is about—would involve the necessity to acquire all interests in the area concerned.</para><para>The 24G provisions are all based on the non-extinguishment principle. If there is to be, in a hypothetical world, some conversion of an area from grazing to cotton cropping or whatever, it will necessitate the acquisition of all interests compulsorily or by agreement. That includes any pastoralists who are there whose pastoral leases are resumed, surrendered or acquired in order that a different form of agricultural activity can take place there. All over Australia and throughout the world for centuries agricultural activity on land changes from time to time. If there is a proposal that it changes from grazing to cotton cropping it will involve compulsory acquisition. It will involve the compulsory acquisition of the pastoral lease and the native title rights. They will get the same say on the question of the compulsory acquisition as the lessee who is having his or her lease acquired. So they do have all those procedural rights and full compensation for the acquisition of their native title. A mechanism is established whereby the Aboriginal people involved in any such project will get exactly the same say if it is on a pastoral lease as the lessee. If it is not, if it is vacant Crown land, they will get the right to negotiate.</para><para>While I understand where you are coming from, this is not the way to achieve your purpose. We believe the concerns you have are covered under the act and that the appropriate level of involvement in the issue is there for Aboriginal people. As I say, if it is vacant Crown land, they will have the right to negotiate; if it is pastoral lease land and an agreement cannot be reached—I would hope that agreement could be reached, but if it is not—and there is a compulsory acquisition of both the lease and the native title rights, then they will get the same procedural rights and full compensation for any acquisition of their native title.</para><para>Trying to put such a provision under this primary production area is not the way to deal with the issue which you quite properly have 
 some concern about, and I understand that concern. That is dealt with in other provisions.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>2213</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is not the first time that this issue has been before the Senate in this debate. It was before the Senate last time, in a rather more comprehensive manner. I think that needs to be placed on the record.</para></talk.start><para>There are problems with Senator Brown's amendment, because I think it has come in late in the day and without due regard for the debate we have had on this issue at the earlier stage. Basic principles of law, Senator Brown, would mean that anything under 10,000 megalitres and associated canals may be given the go-ahead under your proposal, because yours is expressly in respect of those exceeding 10,000 megalitres. There is that direct consequence of what you are trying to do.</para><para>Let me put it to you that, when we had this debate last time, the opposition moved an amendment which, in effect, covered this particular case, and also covered it more comprehensively. During the debate before Christmas, R63 was an amendment which rewrote section 24GD to provide for future acts which allowed diversification of use of non-exclusive pastoral leases provided that the dominant purpose of the lease remained pastoral. Diversification under major regional irrigation schemes was not included. The amendment that we moved before Christmas provided native title holders with notification of procedural rights when a government authority proposed to do a future act permitting the diversification activities on non-exclusive pastoral leases. Let me go to amendment R63. I will read it for the record. It states that this diversification section does not apply to a future act if:</para><para>(a) 	 the future act takes place under or as part of a scheme for the development of a region involving a significant change of land use over a large area; and</para><para>(b) 	 the development involves a more intense use of the land and pastoral activities; and</para><para>(c) 	 the scheme includes, but is not limited to, activities that are related to or result from water storage or water reticulation.</para><para>The note below that says:</para><para>The approval for the use of all or part of a pastoral lease for agricultural purposes as part of a major regional development based on a large dam or irrigation system is an example of an act excluded by this subsection.</para><para>So we had before us a more comprehensive and more sustainable provision to try to accommodate the problem that you are now trying to fix up, and you voted against it before Christmas. Consistency is important. That was a proposal which more comprehensively did what you are trying to do now.</para><para>You have come in with this proposal today, late in the debate, and you are asking us to support it, warts and all. I am sorry; we cannot support it, warts and all, because there are warts involved with it. Our proposal that we moved last year did not get support. As a consequence, that protection was not afforded.</para><para>There are other ways of protecting the scheme that is involved here and those ways, I am sure, will be pursued by many others. Senator Brown, your alternative is the poorer model and we cannot support it, given the fact that it is nowhere near as comprehensive as it needs to be for this protection—not just in respect of the Fitzroy River but in respect of any other such diversification of land use. Unfortunately, we cannot support it but I do ask you, when you come in here with models like this, to keep in mind previous debates.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>2214</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The amendment has been specifically honed to ensure protection for the indigenous rights to negotiate on big water storage schemes and consequent irrigation projects coming from those schemes.

That would help to accelerate the progress of debate, but it might also be in the interests of those people that you claim you want to protect—indigenous Australians. At the end of the day, lots of time is taken up, but your impact on this debate has been basically to the detriment of indigenous Australians by that one vote you took last night—a vote that denies the stolen generations from access to native title claims.</para><para>That is what I am upset about.

I do so in order to refer to media coverage of this debate. It is absolutely essential that the media get things right and have some understanding of what native title is all about. A number of reports in the print and broadcast media this morning concerning my position on the native title threshold were incorrect. These reports stated that the government's threshold test, which requires a traditional physical connection to the land, would inhibit indigenous people in making claims on land where there was not a physical connection. I was accused of caving in to the government on limiting the registration test.</para></talk.start><para>These statements show a misunderstanding of the processes for making native title claims under the Native Title Act, as it is proposed to be amended by the government bill. It is important to appreciate that under the Native Title Act, as amended, there would be a two-track regime. One track would involve the filing of an application in the Federal Court for a determination that native title exists in respect of particular land. The second track would involve the passing of that application to the national Native Title Tribunal, where the registrar would decide whether or not the application should be included in the register of native title claims. If the registrar decided to register the application, then the native title claimants would obtain the benefits of right to negotiate and statutory access to the land. It is only in respect of this second track that 
 the threshold test would require there to be, or to have been, a traditional physical connection. That part of the threshold test would not apply to the first track, so that even in circumstances where the native title claimants were unable to satisfy the traditional physical connection test, their claims for determination of native title in respect of their traditional lands, for example, with which they may have a spiritual connection could proceed in the Federal Court.</para><para>I appeal to the media to get it right and to get a little bit of understanding of the basics of native title. I do not mind being accused at all—mostly they are right—but on this occasion they happen to be wrong. But I have maintained all along, since the second reading speech that I am not about diminishing the common law rights of the indigenous peoples of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>2217</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(44)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 48 (line 19), omit "<inline font-weight="bold">primary production</inline> ", substitute "<inline font-weight="bold">pastoral activities</inline> '.</para><para>(46)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 49 (line 4), omit "<inline font-weight="bold">primary production</inline> ", substitute "<inline font-weight="bold">pastoral</inline><inline font-weight="bold">activities</inline> ".</para><para>(47)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 49 (line 15), omit paragraph (c).</para><para>(48)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 49 (lines 16 to 28), omit paragraph (d) and the note, substitute:</para><para>(d)	 the future act permits or requires the carrying on of a pastoral activity (see section 253) while the lease (including as renewed on one or more occasions) is in force.</para><para>(49)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 49 (line 31), omit paragraph (a).</para><para>(50)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 50 (lines 4 to 7), omit subsection (3), substitute:</para><para>(3)	 However, this section does not apply to a future act permitting or requiring farmstay tourism if:</para><para>	 (a)	 the act permits or requires tourism that involves observing activities or cultural works of, or observing places because of their cultural significance to, Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; or</para><para>	 (b)	 the act permits or requires the construction of buildings or other facilities that:</para><para>		 (i)	 are not additions or alterations to a homestead used for the purposes of the lease; or

This is to ensure that pastoralists would be able to go about their usual activities as leaseholders and also do those things that are necessary, incidental or ancillary to their primary production, without having to negotiate with the traditional owners. If you like, this is taking the Northern Territory situation and expanding the definition. It is ensuring that all things that leaseholders currently need to do, in relation to fostering their primary production, would be able to be done without the need to negotiate. It nevertheless means that all the things that are not done at the moment, that we can cite as coming down the line and can expect will come down the line in the future, particularly as leaseholdings are upgraded to freehold status, would require negotiation with the traditional owners.</para><para>If you like, it is a means of covering the concerns, to some degree, that Senator Boswell had earlier and to assure current leaseholders that their leasehold activities, as laid down in their lease, and their ability to go about their cattle grazing and ancillary and necessary incidentals to that, would be free of the requirement to negotiate.

What has been proposed would amount to a significant distraction of the current and existing rights of pastoral lessees all over Australia by denying them and by the act of the federal parliament taking away from them rights that they currently have without any, as I can see it, compensation or any other scheme in place. It is attempting to freeze pastoral activity as per the Northern Territory regime, but the fact is that every state does allow and provide on pastoral leases—where they properly constitutionally are able to, because they have constitutional responsibility for land management—the rights to engage in a whole range of activities on pastoral leases. We have made it quite clear that those rights which they currently have are not going to be taken away from them and should not be taken away from them.</para></talk.start><para>There is a future act regime in place to allow them to determine the extent to which and the manner by which they engage in other activity in the future. We have made it abundantly clear as a matter of government policy that we are not going to destroy, take away or extinguish the existing rights of pastoral lessees across Australia by using the races power in this way to cut across the legitimate constitutional prerogatives of state governments to manage their land.

He said that they are not going to support a move that would take away, destroy or extinguish the rights of leaseholders. What a way to describe giving indigenous people the right to negotiate. What we are saying here is that the pastoral activity means, as in the Northern Territory legislation, amongst other things: `the pasturing of stock for sustainable commercial use of the land on which they are pastured; or agricultural or other non-dominant uses of the land that are essential to or inseparable from the activity of pasturing such stock . . . including the production of agricultural products for use in stock feeding; farmstay tourism activities . . . things done on leased land, an activity that was necessary, reasonably incidental or reasonably ancillary to the use or development of the lands or waters for the purposes for which the lease was granted . . . ' But it does not include mining.</para></talk.start><para>What these amendments are doing is saying that those activities, which are the activities granted through leases to date, are to be pursued without the indigenous people having a right to negotiate. We are moving a lot of ground here. But we are saying that all of the other things that the government wants—upgraded leases, lessees or third parties to be 
 able to engage in in the future—would be subject to the right to negotiate.</para><para>What the government says is there is no right to negotiate for indigenous people on anything except mining. Nothing at all. We have been through that earlier this afternoon. The minister has no answer to that because he knows it is a perfectly correct description of what the government is doing: wholesale divestment of the indigenous people's rights to negotiate on a whole range of development activities—dams, fisheries, woodchipping, cotton growing; we have been through the list before—in the future. There will be enormous frustration and, as I said, a reticence turning to anger that you can pick up in the indigenous communities around this country in the future.</para><para>We are putting forward here a means of saying, `Let us ensure that the pastoralists go about their activities with a very expanded definition of those activities to include all manner of things that are incidental to their pasturing of stock while giving indigenous people the right to negotiate if other purposes that are not foreseen are visited upon their lands in the future', and the government is saying no.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>2220</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I underline that the whole issue of the Northern Territory Pastoral Land Act definition is contained, as I understand it, in Democrat-Greens (WA) amendments 189 and 48.

I understood, particularly from listening to the Prime Minister, that in fact that is not so and that his 10-point plan widens them very widely indeed, way beyond any fair understanding of pastoral activity. I draw his attention to a pres conference on 28 April last year when the Prime Minister said:</para></talk.start><para>. . . primary production . . . is a very wide definition indeed . . . and goes far beyond pastoral activities that are currently sanctioned under pastoral leases and those activities will be able to be carried on without any let or hindrance from either native title claimants or indeed any other section of the Australian community.

In only those two circumstances is the right to negotiate triggered: for mining, which includes any mining activity, or compulsory acquisitions for third parties. Those are the two activities to which the right to negotiate applies in the current act. That is the current law and that was what was agreed. It is important to keep remembering this.</para></talk.start><para>As to what Senator Woodley said, it is important to understand that the government's starting point was to say that what pastoral lessees are currently allowed to do should be preserved in the application or in the incorporation of the Wik decision into the land law of Australia and, most particularly, into the Native Title Act. Can I tell you what the situation is in every state?</para><para>Every state and territory already has procedures in place for approving the conduct of quite wide new pastoral or agricultural activities on pastoral leases. South Australia has no specific restrictions on the type of activities that can be approved—you have the right to seek approval and have that right granted. A Queensland pastoral lease must be used for agricultural or grazing purposes, or both. Section 153 of the Land Act 1994 says that, including horticulture and cropping, approval for new activities may be given by the minister. In New South Wales, the minister can approve a change of lease purpose to allow for cultivation or use of the lease for any other purpose, and so on.</para><para>Even in the Northern Territory, a pastoral lease may only be used for pastoral purposes 
 but, in addition to the pasturing of stock, these may include pastoral based tourist activities, conducting a trucking business or running a store or roadhouse and the pastoral board may approve a non-pastoral use, for example, horticultural activities. So even in the Northern Territory, people who have bought leases in good faith, worked their leases, complied with the law and done everything expected of them, have legal rights which these provisions would take away from them.

Let me, first of all, describe what this amendment attempts to do. The section applies to a future act that:</para><para>. . . takes place on land which has not been the subject of an</para><para>approved determination of native title in respect of which the native title</para><para>rights and interests include a right to exclusive possession of the land.</para><para>The government has indicated that, in amending section 24GD to limit off-farm activities to grazing and access to, and taking of, water, if a pastoralist wishes to undertake those activities on freehold land, the pastoralist would need the consent of the landowner. The section, as currently worded, is discriminatory in that some pastoralists would not have to obtain the consent of native title holders.</para><para>Native title may encompass a broad range of rights from rights to access through to rights of exclusive possession, as was found to be the case in Mabo and, in fact, in Crescent Head. Where a native title is the latter kind—that is, the exclusive possession kind— 
it would be particularly discriminatory if pastoralists on adjacent or nearby properties could agist their cattle or sheep without the consent of native title holders.</para><para>This amendment is designed to ensure that native title holders whose native title rights are determined to include a right of exclusive possession are not subject to section 24GD. I am sure that eventually the government will understand the purpose of this particular amendment. It is carefully worded to apply only to those native title holders who are not claimants for exclusive possession but are determined to have a right of exclusive possession. In those circumstances, I think all honourable senators would have reason to expect that the holders of that sort of title would be given the same sorts of courtesies as freehold land holders.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>2223</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I place on record the government's opposition to this amendment. We do think it is important to support the regime which we proposed for limited off-farm activities to be allowed, particularly with respect to water. It is often the case that governments have preserved land next to water sources as vacant Crown land specifically to ensure that farmers and others can access the water. If, by dint of having done so, it means that the land can then be claimed and perhaps exclusive possession put over it, the native title holders then have a veto over the farmer who has previously had access to the water that could be put in place.

We have put this up-front because the management of water and airspace is extremely important. We would be asking for that subdivision to be removed. We might move some amendments if we are not successful in opposing this subdivision; however, it is important to explain the reason why we oppose it. Subdivision H validates state and territory actions regarding land or resource use based on the nature of the land tenure or of the resource. Subdivision G relating to the diversification of pastoral leases, subdivision J relating to reserves and subdivision N relating to offshore places are to a similar effect.</para></talk.start><para>Effectively, the government is enabled to act without regard to native title rights and an interest in the resource or to the effect of the act on those rights and interests. This means a group of property right holders will be liable to having their property rights overridden in favour of pastoral diversification, regulation and management of water and airspace acts done pursuant to a reservation or any act done offshore. Subdivision H divides regulation of water and airspace into two categories: legislation in relation to management or regulation, and grants of leases, licences, permits or authorities under valid legislation that relates to management or regulation.</para><para>In respect of water and airspace, the Senate passed an amendment requiring the person granting the interest to notify native title parties, including the representative body, and 
 give them an opportunity to comment—that was government amendment No. 25. The ALP proposed removing the subdivision altogether—that was opposition amendment No. 70. The Greens and Democrats treated the two classes differently. Native title parties were to be notified of proposed legislation. The state or territory had to consult in good faith about changes to protect native title and to relax any prohibitions in favour of native title holders. The right to negotiate would have applied to grants of interests. The latter proposal provides some protection for native title rights and interests while ensuring that the government is able ultimately to legislate, regulate and manage the resource. This is important for native title holders, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin where the states are proposing transferable property rights for water.</para><para>Almost any indigenous Australian you speak to would tell you why this issue is so very important culturally, socially and spiritually. I cannot think of any other issue on which people were so plaintive to me when we were debating this in 1997. Anywhere in Australia where native title exists there are special places for ceremonies, sacred sites, in relation to places of water. They could be creeks, waterholes, rivers, seasonal rivers and so on. They are meeting places. They are special. They are an absolutely important part of the story-lines of indigenous Australians. If you wipe out of contention the possibility for indigenous Australians to have part in their management, you are basically wiping out a large part of their cultural life and identity.</para><para>Some of the areas that might be considered to be of spiritual significance and that might end up being taken out of the realm of consultation as a result of this action could include: Todd River; Boobara Lagoon; Lake Victoria; Lake Mungo; Crocodile Dreaming in Broome; inland fishing environments such as the Cooper Basin; Murray-Darling Basin; Snowy River; Macquarie Marshes; socially significant areas of customary obligation; gathering and meeting places; trading places; areas of access to cultural activities; stock routes and reserves; access areas for cere 
 monial materials such as ochre; burial sites and sandy banks; recreational and leisure activities, especially those for children; education and camping sites; and economically significant areas for reeds, shells and stones, examples of which include the Mitchell River system, Cooper Creek, the Lake Eyre Basin and Dalhousie Springs.</para><para>Water rights are fundamental to the traditional economies of all coastal indigenous people in Australia. Their right to preserve their access to the sea and to protect traditional fishing grounds is even more important following the dispossession of much of their land. We will deal with that when we deal with offshore areas. Inland rivers and waterholes are very often the location of the most spiritually significant places for Aboriginal people. The right to preserve access to the sea and to protect traditional fishing grounds is even more important because of the level of dispossession of so much of their land. For many generations, governments encouraged sole dependence on the sea as a means of facilitating that dispossession. The same situation applies along inland rivers.</para><para>The special importance of the sea to indigenous people has been acknowledged by the Resource Assessment Commission in its 1993 report on the costal zone. The threats include not only fishing but also oil and mineral activities. So we are talking about the impact of other activities on those rights. The seas, inland rivers and the waterholes are, as I have mentioned, very often the location of the most spiritually significant places to Aboriginal people. We see that overuse by other interests may cause environmental disasters and destroy sacred places—that can be sea as well as inland river overuse. The development that goes with that kind of activity can also restrict access to important areas.</para><para>The right to negotiate is the minimum protection which can be afforded to indigenous people giving them some say in how future proposals affect the traditional sea and river country. Canada, New Zealand and the United States have each afforded their indigenous people a level of protection for their marine estates which goes well beyond that 
 currently existing in Australia. The current act does not deal adequately with native title over places beyond the limits of a state or territory—that is, areas not covered as onshore places. The only relevant provisions are those which allow a government to confirm its ownership of natural resources and to confirm public access to coastal water—that is, sections 212(1)(a) and 212(2)(c). Native title fishing and hunting rights are preserved in section 211.</para><para>What the government is proposing here is a total overreach in that it allows almost any action over any water to constitute a permissible future act. It does what I have not heard of native title doing in any other part of the world—that is, restrict the right of native title claimants to claim native title and to have access to fishing. It is just almost unbelievable.</para><para>Proposed sections 24HA(1)(b) and 2B(ii) both say, `Living aquatic resources'. It would be very interesting to see if what the government is suggesting is that at some stage they can envisage—and perhaps the minister can advise me that this is not the case—traditional owners being in breach of some law, arrested or put in prison for accessing traditional fishing rights. If they do not have access to native title over fishing areas, it is going to be difficult for them to fish and hunt, especially fish. If they do not have access to native title, how can they be guaranteed access to those traditional methods of existence? It seemed to me to be a ludicrous juxtaposition in the bill as we dealt with it last time.</para><para>The proposed government amendments will deny native title holders the right to negotiate. Senator Boswell, it is not the right to veto; it is the right to negotiate. The right to negotiate is not the same as the right of veto. The amendments will provide only the most minimal procedural requirements available to them before the government takes action which may permanently deprive indigenous land-holders of their rights to fish, use waters or prevent desecration of sacred sites in, for example, wetlands, waterholes or rivers. This is most significant to many native title holders. On the one hand there are many locations across Australia where the only likely remain 
 ing native title rights reside in waters because the greater area has had native title extinguished by the grant of exclusive possession. Therefore, the proposed amendments will effectively provide the final act of dispossession of those people.</para><para>How can we find anything in this act which distinguishes the Australia of today from our colonial past? Where is the fair and just outcome for these people in this bill? Where can it be seen that their remnant rights are respected? Under traditional law and custom there is no differentiation between rights in land and rights in waters. There is no doubt about that, and I would like to quote Senator Harradine who in 1997 stated:</para><para>If a right to negotiate . . . is to be enjoyed by native title holders whose country is vacant crown land, that right should not be taken away from native title holders who suffer the added disadvantage of having their land subject to a pastoral lease without their consent.</para><para>I would like to thank Senator Harradine for those words. Under the same principle, this place must ask the question: if a right to negotiate is to be enjoyed by native title holders whose country is vacant Crown land, why should that right be taken away from native title holders who suffer the disadvantage of having their only remaining native title rights removed or affected without their consent simply because these rights reside in waters?</para><para>Australia is in the main a dry continent and, as such, waters are of essential significance to native title holders. Many people traversed the country from waterhole to waterhole or up and down watercourses and rivers. Water was not only essential for survival; it also provided important places for meetings, ceremonies and trading between different groups. Such waters provide a very important social role for people that is integrally linked to traditional relationships, laws and customs. Waters have been traditionally used for a wide range of activities from recreation and the harvesting of plants to traditional medicines, burial places and so on. Under the current act, any grant of new rights is subject to the future act regime by which native title holders must be accorded the same procedural rights as they would be if they possessed freehold title.</para><para>The proposed amendments are a significant impairment to existing rights and are likely to be in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. There can be no question that water and the places around water have traditionally and customarily been of economic, social, recreational, educational, ceremonial and spiritual importance. People are also traditionally responsible for caring for waters and the land around them. Waters and land are integrally related in a traditional way. Remember, the land belongs to the people and the people belong to the land. It is a two-way process. Any attempt to preclude claimants from carrying out their responsibility in caring for waters is unjustifiable and shows a complete lack of understanding of native title itself.</para><para>I am aware of the fact that the last time we dealt with this in 1997 there were no amendments accepted by the Senate. I am also aware of the fact that between 1997 and April 1998 a lot of people will have spoken to the various groups involved in making decisions to express the importance of the ability to negotiate over water and airspace. I hope some of those pleas have reached the hearts of the senators whose role it is to make decisions in this place. I commend the amendments to the Senate. And first, of course, is the need to remove the iniquitous subdivision H.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>2226</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This section that we are dealing with is point 8 of the Prime Minister's Wik 10-point plan.

If we are to take a rational approach to these matters and look at them in context, we will see that the common law has developed in a wholesome, and sometimes unwholesome, way for generations. Take, for instance, the law of negligence. Anyone who has studied the law of 
 torts will readily tell you that nearly the whole system of public responsibility and, indeed, the insurance industry, developed out of a case where someone, unfortunately, consumed a decomposed snail in a bottle of ginger beer.

In one direction it would close it off. The other amendments of the Democrat-Greens would close it off by being more beneficial, I suppose, than what is in the common law at the moment.</para></talk.start><para>The position we took last time was that we want the common law to develop. It has developed over recent years. The Mabo decision gave rise to the potential for recognition of native title rights and interests in airspace and waters, including offshore, onshore and subterranean waters with the resources in them. Such recognition, according to the common law, could give native title holders authority to deal with these elements of the environment as owners and rights to access and use them as resources.</para><para>Mabo was a new element in the development of the Australian common and statutory law in respect of the management, conservation and distribution of water. It was a recent development and one that impacted on the existing law. At the same time as it impacted on the existing law, it also respected the fact that there were objectives in the existing law to achieve regulatory and management control in most states. Therefore, we have a system of state law. We also have native title. How native title and the common law develop is something which to date has been allowed, by statutory law, to find its own course. We believe it is important to allow that to happen. The government goes too far. The government cuts off potential development of common law and for that we do not support the government's proposals.</para><para>It is important to place on record a potential direct and long-term injustice. The Yorta Yorta case has been mentioned. That is a case which has been proceeding for quite some time. It has been extensive in its deliberations on the system and it is one where many people have pursued their interests under the common law and the processes available to them. What we may be doing here, if we do not support 58A, is cutting off those people, with their interests and their claims, at the 
 knees. If we are concerned about protecting the common law, we should allow it to develop, particularly in respect of those cases which are already on foot.</para><para>To not do so would be an injustice to the Yorta Yorta people. It would also be an injustice to the people pursuing the Croker Island case. Once again, cases have been instituted there. The impact of this legislation will be to cut off whatever rights those people will be able to achieve in those cases. Not only should we keep our eye on the development of the common law but also we should keep an eye on the fact that, by adopting the government's position here, by not allowing the common law to find its way, as 58A would allow, there would be a direct injustice on the people involved in those cases.</para><para>Both cases have involved much expense, many resources and many people. In a sense, they are cases at the cutting edge of the development of the common law. I would hate to be in a position where this chamber and this parliament denied these people the capacity to pursue their rights to the full extent of the common law. It is a bit like passing retrospective legislation—not technically but, in essence, what we are talking about here is removing the rights of people who have instituted proceedings.

Again, this does not measure with the facts of the bill.</para></talk.start><para>The bill does not in any way inhibit the opportunity for Aboriginal Australians to make claims for native title on water and airspace. It allows the courts entirely the prerogative to make determinations as to 
 what, if any, native title rights exist and where and how they are to be exercised, et cetera. What this bill is about is simply ensuring that democratically elected governments, on behalf of all of us, through powers granted to them by the parliaments of the country, have the proper prerogative of being able to regulate water and airspace on our behalf and to issue to the millions of Australians concerned the appropriate statutory rights—including, obviously, to Aboriginal Australians who seek those rights—and the circumstances under which they shall be issued.</para><para>In effect, it is to put into place a coexistence regime for common law native title in respect of water and airspace, and the statutory rights granted by democratically elected governments. We are dealing here with thousands and thousands of individual permits, licences and leases in respect of water all over Australia. As I say, often it could well involve Aboriginal Australians who want statutory rights.</para><para>What we are putting in place is a mechanism by which governments can issue those rights. It is based on the non-extinguishment principle—as I say, the common law can develop, that the native title cannot be extinguished. It follows the Wik principle exactly. This is not a race issue; this is about the law itself, when you talk about the common law. The fact of our legal system is that statutory rights do prevail over common law rights and the common law is constantly being moulded, prodded and, in many cases, extinguished or overridden by statutory law, because that is what democracy is about. Laws passed by democratically elected parliaments obviously must and should override inconsistent common law, otherwise we would have an autocracy of judges.</para><para>We have put in place compensation; where there is any impact on the native title there is compensation. We have put in a full notification regime for native title holders and the opportunity to comment, et cetera. This is not about extinguishment; this is not about cutting across the common law; this is about how we put in place a sensible co-existence regime, given that we now have native title, which we 
 did not have before, given that for 200 years governments have been regulating, and seeking to regulate, on behalf of all of us, water and airspace. How do we do that, taking account of the fact that native title may be determined as being held in respect of water and airspace?

 is any conflict between the statutory rights and the common law rights, as the High Court has said, the statutory rights prevail.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>2229</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What I asked, Minister, was: what were the rights to negotiate of the traditional owners, the traditional fishers in the gulf?

It has never been contemplated by anybody—apart from you, I understand—that the right to negotiate process could apply to every single fishing permit, water permit or whatever.

It says that this legislation leaves no rights for the indigenous people to negotiate. Senator Minchin says that common law gives them no rights. That has not been tested. Where does he get 
 that from? That is a totally fatuous assumption. Logic would have it that of course the indigenous people have a right to their fisheries. What Senator Minchin and the government are doing in this section is stealing that right away. That is legalised theft that is occurring here. Senator Minchin sits there and says, `There is no extinguishment here', as if when you put somebody in gaol and remove all their rights, there is no extinguishment of life as far as they are concerned.</para></talk.start><para>Let me tell the government that there is enormous extinguishment here. This legislation says that any state government that comes along and authorises, permits, licences, leases an operation that is going to rob the indigenous people of their access rights, their resource base and their cultural relationship, as Senator Margetts puts it, with the waterways or the seas, gets cut out. This is bald-face extinguishment in this case. Not only is this incidental to the government's legislation, but it is what this legislation is about. They are thieving from the indigenous people their rights. Let us call a spade a spade. That is what is happening here.</para><para>It could all float through but, Senator Minchin is right, that some people in this corner, and to some degree the Labor Party on this occasion—and we have not heard from Senator Harradine—are saying, `We might not have the numbers, but we are not going to agree to that.' We will have the numbers if Senator Harradine votes with us. Here is a big test. Just across the way from the Wik people are the Mornington Island people whose rights are about to be taken away from them if this amendment moved by the Democrats and Greens is not  supported.

Senator Bolkus has indicated that the Labor Party has no intention of legislating in a positive way ahead of common law determination on these issues. That is very sad, because I do not know that that is their decision on all areas of common law and legislative law. It does seem a pity. In 1993, when we came together in this place, what we did was to pare back the common law decision. When we have dealt with these laws before, we have dealt with shoring up other land interests to try to reduce the potential for common law development from indigenous Australians. That is a very sad precedent.</para><para>I do not go along with that precedent. I do not think there is anything written in stone that says that that is the way it has to be. I expressed an abhorrence about the general idea of pre-empting and reducing rights for native title claimants who are seeking them through common law. Isn't it interesting? Again and again during this debate, Senator Minchin has said, `Aha! We're not taking away people's common law rights.' Yet, ironically, here we are pre-empting common law and cutting it off at the pass.

This addresses criticism that the renewal provisions contained in the bill should not permit the renewal of mining leases for an indefinite period. I commend those amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>2233</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition supports amendments 27, 28 and 29. We do have a problem with one aspect, but we will get to that later on. 
 This section raises issues which were debated last time. In the earlier debate, opposition 124A had some success in the Senate. We have been working through our provisions over the interim period and we have been able to develop our position to a new one which is now reflected in opposition amendments N27, N21, N22 and N23. Our new approach is to replace section 26D(1) with a new subsection which excludes the right to negotiate from the renewal of mining leases in a much narrower range of circumstances than the government's. As I say, this is all embodied in those four amendments.</para></talk.start><para>We have enormous difficulty with the government's position. The government's position goes too far. Sections 26(2)(e) and 26D(1) remove the right to negotiate from mining tenement renewals. This means that under the government's provisions mining leases can be extended or renewed without the application of the right to negotiate. The only limitation that the government imposes on this exclusion is that the area of the mine lease cannot be extended. This means, for instance, that native title holders will not be afforded the protection of the right to negotiate where a renewed mining lease, for instance, is of substantially larger scale. It may use different technology or processes of extraction, it may change from underground to open-cut and to different waste disposal mechanisms, it may employ different means of transporting ore and minerals, and may also apply different environmental standards for land use and rehabilitation. In other words, there could be greater impact on the land and waters concerned under the government's proposal. There could be a new impact on native title because of that greater impact, but that is not accommodated for in the government's plan.</para><para>The other criticism we have of the government's position is that their amendments extend to intermediate period acts, so the right to negotiate will not apply to the renewal of mining leases which were invalidly granted due to the failure of state and territory governments to comply with the Native Title Act.</para><para>It has been pointed out to me that we were going to deal with these with the right to 
 negotiate, but I am trying to work out why we have a section here called `Renewals'. As far as I am concerned, renewals covers the renewals here. It seems from over the other side that they would rather deal with this later on. I do not know if that is appropriate, because if you look at the running sheet for renewals opposition amendments N21 to N23 are included. I think it is probably more appropriate that we proceed with them now.</para><para>We maintain that our alternative is a fairer balance. We maintain consistency with the concerns that we raised previously in the Senate. Our concerns were that an activity under a renewed mining lease may have a substantially greater impact on native title than an activity which occurred under the old mining lease. In such circumstances, we believe the right to negotiate should apply to the renewal. Factors such as changes in technology, markets, waste disposal and other variables can have enormous implications for native title holders where leases are renewed.</para><para>Our concerns are multifaceted and varied. They go, for instance, to the issue of an underground mine being converted to an open-cut mine, such as in circumstances where high-grade seams are mined out. Also, if a mine is increased substantially in size, it may entail the retention of a substantially larger work force, the construction of mining townships and infrastructure, without recognition of the necessary environmental and social impacts, such as liquor outlets, people visiting and desecrating sacred sites and effecting a substantial change to the way of life of native title holders.</para><para>We maintain that the government does not take these factors into account sufficiently. Our alternatives, as expressed in the amendments I have referred to, do so. We do weigh greater impact into the occasion through all these different factors. I maintain that we provide a fair balance. In a sense we adopt the government's procedure but we qualify it by limiting the exclusion on the right to negotiate from mining renewals where such renewals, grants, rights, for instance, do things which have a greater impact on the land and waters concerned and consequently on native title. Of course, as reflected upon earlier, the 
 opposition amendments do not extend the application of 26D(1) to intermediate period acts.</para><para>We also have a consequential amendment to opposition N27, which inserts subsection (1A) into 24(1)(c) to maintain consistency between 26D(1), 24(1)(c) and so on. These amendments bring the excluded renewals within subdivision I and provide, as with other renewals, for compensation, which we believe is important, if it arises, to ensure that the just terms requirement of the constitution are complied with.</para><para>It has been pointed to me that I might have said that mining lease renewal provisions do not cover the intermediate period. I did mean to say—I hope I did say—that our mining lease renewal provisions do cover the intermediate period as well. With respect to these renewal provisions, we have worked diligently at them to try to ensure that any renewal with greater impact is a renewal which attracts the right to negotiate and also attracts a right to compensation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>2235</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate that the Democrat-Greens (WA) amendments are to totally oppose subdivision I.

However, the Democrats have a particular affection for the topic of renewals of leases because it was the Democrats in 1993 that inserted an amendment that became section 235 of the 1993 Native Title Act. At that time, on 21 December 1993, my colleague former Senator Sid Spindler moved the amendment that now appears in the act. It is important to note that it was a very different time in Parliament House and, indeed, a very different time in Australia—the pre-Hanson era, I would suggest.</para></talk.start><para>The single element that distinguished the process in 1993 is the value place on indigenous people.

We believe the government amendments just go too far. The Democrat-Greens (WA) amendments will maintain the existing Native Title Act by reference to a legally enforceable right created before 1 January 1994—section 25—and a no larger proprietary interest than the original interest—section 235(7).</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that amendments 27, 28 and 29, as moved by the government, be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2235</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—May I suggest that we move 27 and 28 together and leave 29 for a separate deliberation.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—To be voted upon separately?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—Yes.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The question is that government amendments 27 and 28 be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>2235</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek your guidance here.

Most of the things here are covered by the government's bill except that this now would not allow a renewal and therefore is subject to the renewal of the right to negotiate. If the term of the renewal extension is longer than the term of the original lease, I think that would justifiably cause considerable concern to the mining industry. All the chin wagging that went on in Queensland does not seem to have resolved all the difficulties which the mining industry has with the ALP's position. This goes, again, to this fundamental question of native title and what affects it.</para></talk.start><para>What affects native title is the rights granted under a lease, that is, what can be done under the lease; not the term of the lease. The mere term of the lease has absolutely nothing to do with the impact of what can be done under a lease on native title. We have ruled out, in our amendments already passed, any proposal to allow mining leases to be made perpetual. We do not see why renewals of mining leases cannot contemplate a longer term without running into the real difficulties associated with then having to go through a right to negotiate process, when you have a major, multimillion dollar mining operation under way, to then have to subject that to a right to negotiate simply because a longer term is sought, when the term itself has nothing to do with the impact of what is done under the lease on the native title.

What we are dealing with here is a current Native Title Act which does permit acts affecting native title to occur on reserves or leases without the involvement of the native title holders only if they are carried out in good faith under a reservation, condition, permission or authority created prior to 1 January 1994 and are carried out in accordance with the purpose of the reservation, condition, permission or authority.</para></talk.start><para>Subparagraph 24JA(1)(e)(ii), which was accepted by the Senate, extends the application of this principle on reserves to any act so long as its impact is no greater than the impact that any other act that could have been done under or in accordance with the reservation would have had. Proposed section 24JA 
 also extends the application of subdivision J to the date of the Wik decision, 23 December 1996, depriving, therefore, native title holders involvement in an even greater area of land brought within reserves or purpose leases between 1 January 1994 and 23 December 1996.</para><para>The effect of the government's provisions, the effect of the subdivision, is to deny native title holders any involvement in the management—I stress `management'—of a national state or territory park intended to preserve the natural environment of an area. It is no surprise, therefore, that this has caused considerable alarm to indigenous people. In recognition of that concern, the government now intends to move amendment No. 30, which is an improvement on the current position in the bill, but I must say is somewhat of a token improvement.</para><para>Government amendment 30 amends subsection 24JB by adding new subsection (7), a subsection which provides for the notification—just notification—of registered native title bodies corporate, registered native title claimants and native title rep bodies regarding the creation of a plan for the management of a national state or territory park intended to preserve the natural environment. So there is notification and only in respect of the creation of a plan of management. The notified parties then have an opportunity to comment on the creation of the management plan.</para><para>There are a couple of concerns here. First of all, the guarantee of notification is welcome, but we have to acknowledge that it does nothing more than really extend the current provisions relating to public notification practices and procedures adopted nationally in the states and territories in relation to such parks, and adapts those general procedures and provisions to indigenous Australians. It is a right to comment, which is in essence the right which current practice allows to the general public. So one can make the claim, I think quite validly, that the amendment is somewhat tokenistic, particularly when you keep in mind that native title is more than a general public interest. Native title is something which gives people a right greater than a general public interest right.</para><para>Also it needs to be acknowledged and recognised by the Senate that the High Court clearly stated in Mabo that national parks were an obvious place where native title exists. So we have here an extension of a public right when the High Court made it clear that national parks were an obvious place where native title exists. Not only is there just notification, but there is no obligation to take into account the comments of the native title holders. Our other concern is that the proposal covers only the management plans; it does not cover variations or developments in respect of those management plans.</para><para>So we will proceed with opposition amendments RN20 and RN20A. They differ from the government proposal in two important aspects. We extend the same procedural rights contained in subsection (7) to the variation to a significant extent of plans. Variations also need to be brought under the umbrella here. The application of subsection (7) is also extended to developmental uses which are likely to have a significant impact on the natural environment or the cultural or spiritual concerns of native title holders in relation to an area. This is necessary because some states do carry out massive variations to management plans without an appropriate process of engagement of interested parties.</para><para>Amendment RN20A builds on the principles in government amendment 30 by inserting a new subsection (9) into section 24JB. The procedural rights afforded to native title holders are, we would maintain, modestly extended to a right for rep bodies, registered native title bodies corporate and registered native title claimants to be consulted in good faith in relation to the land or waters covered by the act. We say here that good faith is the imperative part of this provision.</para><para>The protection of sacred sites must also be provided for under the new amendment. It must be noted here that what we are proposing is not a new general heritage provision but one which is dependent on the existence of native title. We maintain that this aspect of the amendment is necessary due to the lack of effective heritage protection in most states. It is a guarantee that it would be of no effect in those states where there is already legislation 
 or practices that ensure that sacred sites and areas of significance are protected. So RN20A will give native title holders some involvement in the formation and implementation of plans of management and give them some more meaningful role and some more meaningful respect for their interests in the whole process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>2242</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I formally move government amendment No. 30 under the heading of Reservations:</para></talk.start><para>(30)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 64 (after line 25), at the end of section 24JB, add:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Notification of national, State and Territory park management plans</inline></para><para>	 (7)	 If the act consists of the creation of a plan for the management of a national, State or Territory park intended to preserve the natural environment of an area, then, before the act is done, the person proposing to do the act must:</para><para>		 (a)	 notify, in the way determined in writing by the Commonwealth Minister, any representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander bodies, registered native title bodies corporate and registered native title claimants in relation to the land or waters covered by the plan that the act is to be done in relation to the land or waters; and</para><para>		 (b)	 give them an opportunity to comment on the act.</para><para>	 Note about Schedule 1, item 9:	 The heading to subsection 24JB(6) (page 64, line 13) is replaced by the heading "<inline font-style="italic">Notification of public works</inline> ".</para><para>As Senator Bolkus intimated, this amendment deals with the question of national parks and the appropriate procedural rights that should attach to them—remembering, as I said, that native title is not extinguished by a national park or reservation for a national park. The amendment imposes a notification and consultation requirement in relation to the formulation of a plan of management for the park. That will enable any native title holders, registered claimants and representative bodies with interests in the park to have that opportunity to be involved in, and comment on, the management plan. We do think it is a sensible amendment and I accept that it would be 
 supported. But what the ALP wants to do is to go further than is warranted.</para><para>We are talking about the federal parliament exercising the races power to intervene in the responsibilities of state governments in a way that we think is unwarranted, particularly when it is proposed in—of all places—the states' house. It remains the states' house as far as we are concerned. The question of national parks is one for state authorities and we think this proposition would effectively involve any change to the plan—that is, potentially anything done in a national park would first have to go through a process that is described as a consultation in good faith  with any representative body, registered native title body corporate or registered native title claimant.</para><para>We think this is completely unworkable in practice given the propensity of native title claimants to have recourse to the Federal Court at every opportunity—which, as we have seen, is basically making the right to negotiate process unworkable. If something happens they do not like, parties are too enthusiastic to rush off to the Federal Court. If they do not like something that is done in a national park, all they do is bring a Federal Court action which says, `We were not consulted in good faith,' and then for six months or a year of argument about whether or not what was done, in terms of a process, was consultation in good faith. So we think this is potentially another huge legal bottleneck in relation to national parks.</para><para>Again, to require that sites and areas of significance to native title holders are protected before the act which relates to the management of national parks is done is going to very severely interfere with the states' management of national parks, which—after all—are for the benefit of all of us. National park management is very good and everything they do, by and large, is for the benefit of the park and for the protection of the environment. This could very seriously interfere with that sensible management. That sort of thing should not be covered under the Native Title Act. It should be covered, quite properly, under heritage legislation which all states have. It just provides another process that has 
 to be gone through and another avenue for legal recourse to be taken by those who wish to stop a particular activity occurring. Therefore, we do think this goes too far and what the Senate ought to do is accept the amendment we are proposing.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>2243</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would describe the government's attempts at amending this section as being fairly cursory and in that sense, unsatisfactory to the Greens (WA). They do require some notification but the problems largely remain.</para></talk.start><para>In the running sheet, right at the beginning or in the first line, it  would be noted that we were intending to oppose the subdivision. When we get to it I would like to defer to Senator Woodley so that he can put his amendment 937 and we swap that order, to a large extent, because I think 937 does the job very well. Opposition to the subdivision will only be necessary if neither the Democrats' amendment nor the ALP amendment gets support in the Senate.</para><para>Subdivision J is intended to implement part of point 7 of the 10-point plan, that is, future actions for the management of any existing national park or forest reserve would be allowed. This is misleading as governments already have sufficient power under the current Native Title Act to manage these areas should negotiations with native title holders not result in agreement. The subdivision would prematurely stifle any meaningful negotiations about indigenous concerns and the possibilities of joint management of these areas. As drafted, subdivision J goes well beyond national parks and forest reserves—to apply to any land reserved for a particular purpose before 23 December 1996. Where an act is done in accordance with the existing reservation, that is, section 2(4), 24JA(1)(e)(i), and where the reservation predates 1 January 1994, the act will be valid under section 22(8)(iii) and section 25(1). There is no justification for extending this regime to acts not done in accordance with the reservation, especially as the likely effect is extinguishment as per section 24JB. If the reservation was done in the intermediate period, there is no reason to validate it. Governments have 
 full power to compulsorily acquire native title and ordinary title if land is needed for public purposes in the future. This subdivision permits gratuitous extinguishment—another load of extinguishment. Leases to statutory authorities are in no different position to that noted above, that is, section 24 JA(2). Such a lease has similar effect with respect to native title as a reservation and there is the same absence of justification.</para><para>I would like to give some examples of the impact this section of the government's bill will have. One example I would like to give of effect on native title holders is from Victoria. The area already held by Aboriginal people in Victoria is 3,083 hectares or 0.01 per cent of the state. This is a tiny portion of the total held by indigenous people in Australia. It is less in area than the holdings of the Tasmanian Aboriginal community.</para><para>Land tenure in Victoria can be broken down as follows: freehold, 68.2 per cent; schedule 4 leases—mostly historical—unknown; vacant Crown land, negligible; pastoral leases, negligible; and other public land, 31.8 per cent. These figures come from the federal government's submission to the joint parliamentary committee on native title. Most of this land is either reserved for a public purpose, especially nature conservation and public recreation, or is a national, state or other park as follows: Crown land reserved for public purposes, 16.3 per cent of the state; and national and other parks, 12.7 per cent of the state.</para><para>Thus the area of the state potentially affected by subdivision J of the proposed future act regime is 29 per cent. This amounts to almost the whole of the area available for native title claims in Victoria. It is likely to comprise almost the whole of the land already subject to native title determination applications in Victoria.</para><para>There is a substantial amount of mining in Victoria. Approximately 200 exploration and mining licences are issued each year. However, it is likely that by far the greatest number of future acts will be compulsory acquisitions of native title. For instance, in 1995-96, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment sold 534 parcels of `surplus' 
 Crown land. That comes from the DNRE annual report of 1995-96.</para><para>I would also like to add some advice that has been given to me by the Australian Conservation Foundation. I quote:</para><para>The proposed amendments to the NTA—</para><para>that is, the Native Title Act—</para><para>significantly detract from the rights and negotiating position of native title holders in reserves, particularly national parks.</para><para>In effect, it will be as if the RDA—</para><para>that is, the Racial Discrimination Act—</para><para>did not apply to reserves. The proposed amendments will allow reserve land to be used for the reserve purpose if the land was reserved before 23 December 1996 . . . This is inconsistent with the operation of the RDA. Also, it ignores the distinction between reservation and subsequent extinguishment made in Mabo [No. 2]. Any reservation of an appropriate date will mean that land managers will be authorised to use land for that purpose despite the existence of native title rights. Extinguishment will be authorised in the case of public works . . .</para><para>The proposed provision does require the previous reservation to be in place when the subsequent act is done . . . However, allow land to be used for non-reserve purposes where it would cause `no greater impact' than a use consistent with the reserve purpose. This provision is unworkable and provides no criteria for measuring impact . . . eg. does it include impact upon cultural and spiritual values of native title holders, . . .</para><para>It is also inconsistent with the law concerning the use of reserves as it purports to authorise the use of a reserve for a purpose that is otherwise illegal such as allowing the construction of a commercial facility in a national park, that is, there is the potential that the Commonwealth is using its race power to undermine the land management systems of States and Territories merely because particular acts affect native title.</para><para>Wouldn't that be a turn-up for the books, considering all the sanctimonious comments we have heard so far. I continue:</para><para>The amendments have dramatic consequence for the management of reserve lands. No longer will land managers be required to consider the low impact future act test when undertaking management activities. The characterisation of land use purposes that are related to a reservation will determine the extent to which land managers may disregard subsisting native title rights in reserves established before 23 December 1996. It is telling that, in Woollahra MC supra 
</para><para>., Kirby P described the establishment of a ski resort in a national park as consistent with the dedication of a national park. It remains to be seen if State and Territory provisions which protect native title rights in reserves will continue or will be altered by hostile legislatures.</para><para>Quite clearly, any change in this provision will be capitalised on by those states that have no care for either native title rights or the environment.</para><para>The examples I have given in previous sections on such things as Crown to Crown grants, shifty little deals to try to get around native title, indicate that any loophole that we leave open for the states to get around these provisions to reduce native title rights and potentially damage the environment will be used. I urge the chamber to resist the use of this legislation to do so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2244</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak to the amendments proposed by the Greens (WA) and the Democrats and then an amendment which I am proposing.

The Democrat-Greens amendments seek to omit subdivision J under amendment 84. Amendment 17 is a consequential amendment flowing from that. I wish to give a brief explanation. Subdivision J, as proposed by the government, is intended to implement part of point 7 of the 10-point plan—that is, future actions for the management of any existing national park or forest reserve would be allowed. This is misleading, as governments already have sufficient power under the current Native Title Act to manage these areas should negotiations with native title holders not result in agreement. The subdivision would prematurely stifle any meaningful negotiations about indigenous concerns and the possibilities of joint management of these areas.</para><para>As drafted, subdivision J goes well beyond national parks and forest reserves to apply to any land reserved for a particular purpose before 23 December 1996. When an act is done in accordance with an existing reservation and the reservation predates 1 January 1994, the act will be valid. There is no justification for extending this regime to acts not done in accordance with the reservation, especially as the likely effect is extinguishment.</para><para>If the reservation was done in the intermediate period, there is no reason to validate it. Governments have full power to compulsorily acquire native title and ordinary title if land is needed for public purposes in the future. This subdivision permits gratuitous extinguishment. Leases to statutory authorities are in no different position from that noted in section 24JA(2). Such a lease has a similar effect with respect to native title as a reservation. There is the same absence of justification. </para><para>I refer briefly to national parks, and other reserves more specifically. Approximately 23 per cent of Australia is reserve, including conservation parks and reserves. Proposed amendments contained in the bill would enable developments on reserves—for example, mining, tourism and dams—without reference to or consideration of the rights and aspirations of native title holders.</para><para>Of equal significance is the prospect of state agencies finalising management plans or constructing camping facilities without any requirement to negotiate with native title holders. Some of Australia's most treasured reserves—Kakadu, Uluru and Nitmiluk, or Katherine Gorge—are Aboriginal owned and managed under negotiated leases and management plans. Their appeal combines natural beauty and bio-diversity with a thriving Aboriginal heritage. I am tempted to digress to say briefly that I have been visiting Uluru for 30 years and the improvement in the whole environment of Uluru, once it was handed back to the native title holders, has been quite remarkable.</para><para>Further opportunities for viable representative reserve systems elsewhere—for example, Cape York and the Kimberleys—rely not only on Aboriginal support but on Aboriginal empowerment in planning and management. If native title rights are not upheld in Australia's reserve system, we risk the creation of a climate of division, antagonism and litigation on a scale which will seriously undermine the future of Australia's conservation estate.</para><para>National parks and other Crown reserves are generally lands reserved for public purpose. The amendments allow reserve land to be used for non-reserve purposes where it would cause no greater impact than a use consistent with the reserve purpose. This is inconsistent with the law concerning the use of reserves, by authorising the use of a reserve for a purpose regardless of whether it is for private or public purposes, such as allowing the construction of a commercial facility in a national park—and we have seen that happen.</para><para>The 10-point plan refers to mining in national parks, which is currently illegal in 
 most states. The amendments allow vacant Crown land to be converted to a reserve as a low impact future act. The amendments also allow mining to proceed on reserves without negotiation with native title holders. States will be able to convert vacant Crown land to some type of reserve to facilitate mining projects. I might add that there are rumours of that happening in Queensland to a very large degree. Therefore, mining development is likely to accelerate in sensitive environments on Crown land.</para><para>If the committee is prepared to accept the way we have suggested we might vote, Democrat amendments 1 and 2 would insert a process into subdivision J for involving native title holders more in co-management where land or waters have, before the Wik decision, been reserved or leased for any one of a number of purposes. These purposes mostly concern nature conservation and recreation. These are areas likely to look as if they had been left largely untouched. They are areas where public access and an indigenous connection are likely to have been maintained. More importantly, they are areas where coexistence is a real possibility.</para><para>The amendments set up a process involving, firstly, notice to native title representative bodies, registered native title bodies corporate and registered claimants; secondly, a right to object to the person proposing to create or vary the management plan; thirdly, a right to be consulted in good faith for the purpose of minimising the impact of the act on native title and maximising indigenous participation in the management of land and waters; and, fourthly, a right to be heard by the arbitral body—most usually the National Native Title Tribunal—as to whether the latter act is to be done and, if so, on what conditions.</para><para>Proposed section 24JB(5) sets out particular matters which are to be the subject of good faith consultation. They similarly relate to the matters set out in government section 26A(7), being matters to be taken into account in any approved exploration, et cetera, act or scheme approved by the Commonwealth minister under section 26A. They are in summary site protection, access to land and waters by native title holders and the way the act is to 
 be done. If the committee is of a mind, I would suggest that we vote on Democrat amendments 1 and 2 at least prior to putting amendments 84 and 17.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>2246</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is obvious that we will be opposing these amendments.

During the debate on these sections, I quite clearly heard the Senate querying the problems associated with government amendments 21 and 22. I heard more support for the Greens (WA) amendments 162 and 163. It would therefore make sense to clarify whether or not people did in fact want the government's amendments 21 and 22 if they were clearly saying that they thought that 162 and 163 were supportable. The government usually likes their amendments put first. I am happy for the government's amendments to be voted on first. If the Senate says that they are preferring the Greens-Democrats amendments, perhaps we would know that the vote on those amendments would stand.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>2251</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With the leave of the Senate, I therefore again move:</para></talk.start><para>(21)	 Schedule 1, item 30, page 130 (line 3), omit "The", substitute "Subject to subsection (1A), the".</para><para>(22)	 Schedule 1, item 30, page 130 (after line 34), after subsection (1), insert:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">Federal Court order not to remove details</inline></para><para>	 (1A)	 If:</para><para>		 (a)	 the Registrar is or will be required to remove the details of an agreement from the Register in a case covered by paragraph (1)(a) or (b); and</para><para>		 (b)	 the persons who, under the approved determination of native title mentioned in that paragraph, hold native title apply to the Federal Court for an order under this subsection; and</para><para>		 (c)	 the Federal Court is satisfied that those persons accept the terms of the agreement, in accordance with the process by which they would authorise the making of such an agreement;</para><para>		 the Federal Court may order the Registrar not to remove the details of the agreement from the Register.</para><para>		 Note about Schedule 1, item 30: The heading to subsection 199C(2) (page 131, line 1) is altered by adding at the end "<inline font-style="italic">to remove details</inline> ".</para><para>I think it would probably help if I explained what this is all about. The bill provides that 
 agreements are to be removed from the register of ILUAs in certain circumstances. With regard to body corporate agreements, an agreement has to be removed if it was made by the body corporate and then there is a determination by the court that other persons are the native title holders in relation to the area. That would be unusual but, of course, still possible. With regard to area agreements, an agreement is to be removed if there is a determination of native title and the true native title holders did not authorise the agreement.</para><para>It does not seem appropriate to the government that the true native title holders should be bound by an agreement entered into by people who the court decides are not native title holders. It was pointed out in the debate last year that this may be an inappropriate result in some circumstances, especially if those determined as the true native title holders are happy to be bound by the agreement. So we proposed amendments 21 and 22. They provide that the Federal Court can order that an agreement not be removed from the register where the new determined holders accept its terms. Those two amendments—21 and 22—were passed by the Senate.</para><para>As has been pointed out, the Greens-Democrats amendment 162 covers the same issue. That amendment amends the bill but not the bill as amended by government amendments 21 and 22. It does different things from government amendments 21 and 22. The Greens-Democrats amendment 162 provides in effect that even where there is a determination of new native title holders the registrar is not required to automatically remove the agreement. The agreement is only required to be removed if the new determined holders convince the court that the agreement would not have been authorised had it been known that those persons only were the persons entitled to authorise the making of the agreement. It is our view that that is a very difficult condition to determine. But that amendment has also been passed by the Senate.</para><para>Thus there are two inconsistent amendments made by the Senate. The government puts to the Senate that its amendments should be the ones that are made. The presumption should 
 be that where it is clear an agreement has been made by the wrong people, that agreement should be removed by the registrar. It is only in exceptional cases, and where the court specifically orders, that that agreement should remain. The government does not agree that the presumption should be that where it is clear the agreement has been made by the wrong people that the agreement should continue to be on the register. That would be the effect of the Greens-Democrats amendment, and it can be removed only by an order of the court. We therefore put government amendments 21 and 22 as the preferred procedure for dealing with this particular issue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>2252</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think it is probably best to argue these as a package as they are obviously linked in the argument. As I mentioned before, the idea of amendments 162 and 163 is that the Federal Court cannot sign off on an indigenous land use agreement unless it is satisfied that there has been no duress.</para></talk.start><para>It seems that people do want the indigenous land use agreements to work. We believe that if this kind of provision is not there, there is no indication that the ILUAs will necessarily work. If you have parties that continue to be unhappy with the process, if they feel they have been coerced or there has been duress used, then this system is not going to work. The kinds of things that many people, not everybody, in the system are asking for may not come to fruition, so I think it would be counterproductive.</para><para>If I heard Senator Minchin correctly, I believe he indicated the problems he had were more with amendment 162, and that he was prepared to accept amendment 163.

We have said repeatedly that we believe equality of rights is vital so that, if the services are implemented on a pastoral lease, then the rights that should attach to the native title are the same rights as attached to the pastoral lessee and, if it is on freehold, then it is freehold title.

The amendment is necessary in order to appropriately address state and territory laws and land management practices. The whole purpose of section 24MD is to 
 ensure that native title is protected from discriminatory acquisitions and extinguishment. In essence, it provides the same protection to native title holders as freeholders receive. It provides the same protection as currently in the 1993 act but strengthened. To suggest that the bill allows massive acquisition and extinguishment of native title is wrong. Those who think otherwise, especially those with the responsibility to inform the public on this issue, should concentrate on what is actually in our bill.</para><para> Subsection 24MD(2) ensures a non-discriminatory outcome by requiring that, when native title rights in an area are compulsorily acquired, any non-native title rights in relation to that area must also be acquired. However, there are a range of ways in which non-native title rights, such as freehold leases and licences, which are rights granted by governments, can in effect be acquired and therefore cease to exist. Particular rights granted by the Crown may be surrendered, cancelled or resumed. These have the same outcome as compulsory acquisition. Government amendment 31 therefore ensures that the surrender, cancellation or resumption of relevant non-native title rights is treated in the same way as the compulsory acquisition of other non-native title rights.</para><para> Government amendment 36 makes a similar amendment to subsection 24NA(3) which deals with the non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition of native title rights to an offshore place. It is not appropriate in 24MD to address the fact that native title rights may also be surrendered by agreement. As I said, the whole point of the provision is to protect native title from discriminatory compulsory acquisition. The provision therefore gives to native title holders the same protection as freeholders. Native title holders may of course agree to surrender their native title under an ILUA or an agreement arising out of a right to negotiate process. That is made clear in the note to be added at the end of 24MD by our amendment 33.</para><para>The note also goes on to point out that, because the focus of the provision is the protection of native title, it does not deal with the terms of any unrelated compulsory acqui 
 sition, surrender, cancellation or resumption of non- native title rights. However, there will of course be circumstances when non-native title rights are compulsorily acquired but native title rights are not. For example, in some states and territories, Aboriginal living areas are excised from pastoral leases and given to indigenous peoples.</para><para>Government amendment 32 clarifies that, where there has been a non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition of native title, the acquisition extinguishes the native title that was acquired. It has always been the government's belief that a non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition of native title does extinguish that title. This is not the reservation of Crown land for public purpose, which we agree does not extinguish; this is the acquisition of all the rights in the land by the government concerned.</para><para> Government amendment 37 makes a similar amendment to subsection 24NA(3) to clarify that a non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition of native title to an offshore place extinguishes the native title acquired. Amendment 34 sets out the effect of an agreement to surrender native title that arises out of a right to negotiate process. If the agreement contains a statement to the effect that the surrender is intended to extinguish the native title, new subsection 24MD(2)(a) provides that the voluntary surrender of the native title as a result of the right to negotiate process extinguishes the native title. Compensation for native title holders who receive benefits under the agreement is as set out in the agreement. Any native title holders who do not receive benefits under the agreement are entitled to compensation determined in accordance with division 5 of the act. Government amendment 35 makes a minor consequential amendment to include a reference to new subsection 24MD(2)(a) in subsection 24MD(3).</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>2257</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The freehold test is an important part of the legislation. Under the Native Title Act, future acts are only permissible if they are non-discriminatory in the sense that the act applies in the same way to native title holders as it would to other ordinary title to the land. This was a key principle behind the Native 
 Title Act. There are some exceptions to the rule under the Native Title Act but they are very limited, particularly very limited when compared to the government's proposed amendments which will not require the non-discrimination freehold test to be set aside for many major developments.</para></talk.start><para> The government does propose to leave the freehold test principle in some future acts. Those future acts will be valid if they are granted in a non-discriminatory way, just as one would for acts over freehold land owned by another. What we are concerned about here is that the government is seeking to make even further inroads and exceptions to the non-discrimination principle in the freehold test itself.</para><para> We tried last December to exempt from the system those involved in the mining of opals and gems. Therefore, the right of veto for freeholders in some states would not have to apply to the benefit of native title holders in these areas. Another exemption which we also contested was that, where land was compulsorily acquired, the native title is extinguished at the date of the acquisition even though the land was never used. We were not successful in pursuing that particular point. We also had concerns about gold and tin mining acts as well.</para><para> In December we sought to remove some of these exemptions and to return the freehold test as much as possible to the original Native Title Act position. As I say, we were not successful. We are not going to pursue amendments this time that we could not get up last time and for which there is no indication of support this time. We do have some concerns with respect to the government's amendments this time. In relation to paragraph 24MD(2)(b) relating to the onshore freehold test and 24NA relating to ex-offshore, these paragraphs of the bill were amended in December pursuant to amendments moved by Senator Harradine, amendments which were aimed at taking into account the criticisms that the state and territories could use discriminatory practices even for compulsory acquisitions.</para><para>This requires that practices and procedures adopted in acquiring native title rights do not 
 cause native title holders any greater disadvantage than is caused to the holders of non-native title rights and interests when their interests are compulsorily acquired. Unfortunately, the government did not accept this amendment in the House of Representatives. It now proposes amendment No. 31, which we see as an inadequate attempt to address the same problem. The government would allow compulsory acquisition of native title rights where the non-native title rights are compulsorily acquired, surrendered cancelled or resumed, and in those cases only the freehold tests might apply. Our concern is that the operation of the freehold test will be more limited and native title rights and interests would not be preserved in the way that they should.</para><para>Once again, we will be supporting the Harradine amendments. We believe that they achieve the purpose of providing that state and territory governments cannot acquire land by agreement for non-native title holders but compulsorily acquire native title. The government amendments still allow for differential treatment and, to that extent, Harradine amendments Nos 18 and 21 are more acceptable to us.</para><para>In respect of proposed subsection 24MD(2)(a), our amendment RR107 will extend procedural rights to the rep body involved as well as the registered native title claimants notified. Once again, we are involved in a very technical part of this debate, but we indicate at this particular stage our concern with the government excesses and our in-principle support for Senator Harradine's amendments.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Senator Patterson)</name></talker><para>—Given that, Senator Bolkus, I will split the question from the chair and put the amendments separately.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—That is a good idea, Madam Temporary Chair.

 over places beyond the limits of a state or territory—that is, those areas not covered as onshore places.

Those are in sections 212(1)(a) and 212(2)(c).</para></talk.start><para>Native title fishing and hunting rights are preserved by section 211. The need to deal with offshore resources which are or may be subject to native title should be addressed. The bill would allow them to be extinguished without any procedural fairness or regulated out of existence. There is a need to allow native title holders to be heard when decisions are made concerning the exploitation of resources and granting of fishing licences.</para><para>If the right to negotiate is not to be provided—that is, the constructive approach—the status quo should remain and the indigenous land use agreements will provide the relevant mechanism. In any event, this subdivision should be omitted. It is internally inconsistent, it will apply only to land outside state or territories but it envisages the application of their compulsory acquisition laws, and it is grossly discriminatory.

My amendment seeks to delete from 24MD(2)(b) the words `(whether compulsorily or otherwise)'.</para><para>I hope it would generally be agreed around the chamber that it would be racially discriminatory to allow compulsory acquisition of 
 proven native title rights, not for public purpose but simply for the grant of a right of exclusive possession to a lessee who has voluntarily surrendered a non-exclusive tenure. If this upgrade of pastoral leases proposals were truly non-discriminatory, it would have to be non-discriminatory on its face and also non-discriminatory in its application.</para><para>This would mean that it would be equally feasible for native title holders voluntarily to surrender their native title rights and successfully to request state governments compulsorily to acquire pastoral leases, and then issue the native title holders with rights of exclusive possession. Leaseholders attempting to upgrade could go along to a state government and say, `We want to upgrade. We do not want to go through all this hassle. You compulsorily acquire our leasehold rights and then we will buy it back and have it as a freehold.'</para><para>My amendment says that compulsory acquisition of native title rights should be possible only on the same terms and conditions as the compulsory acquisition of all involuntary resumption of other property rights. Compulsory acquisition of native title rights should not complement a voluntary surrender of a pastoral lease. In other words, my amendment seeks to keep everybody honest. I assume that that is why, in December, the Senate unanimously endorsed my amendment. When I say `unanimously', of course that means the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>2259</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have indicated in the past to Senator Harradine that we do not really understand the purpose of this amendment, and we do not accept it. The fact is that native title can, of course, be acquired by agreement. If, in the circumstances you are talking about, the native title holders wanted to engage in some form of agriculture that required the surrender acquisition of the pastoral lease and the native title in order that a new agricultural lease could be issued, an agreement can be reached with the native title holders that does not involve the compulsory acquisition of their title, but it may involve the compulsory 
 acquisition of the pastoral lease and then the agricultural lease is issued to the native title holders. That is contemplated. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.</para></talk.start><para>We are talking about ensuring that there is a non-discriminatory acquisition of all property interests in the area concerned. The fact is that non-native title rights and interests can also be acquired by means other than compulsion under the various state procedures. They all have a variety of procedures referring to surrender, acquisition and resumption—all those sorts of things—all by agreement, as is the case with native title, which can be acquired by agreement or, if necessary, compulsion. As I say, it may well be the case that there is agreement for the acquisition which is for the benefit of the native title holders having a new title issued.</para><para>So we do not really understand this amendment. We think it is simply going to inhibit this in a way that does not really make any sense. That is not reflective of the fact that we are putting in place, quite clearly, a non-discriminatory regime as to the acquisition of interests—all interests have to be acquired—that gives some flexibility about that acquisition and takes account of the fact that all the states have a variety of regimes to allow the acquisition of non-native title rights and interests. As I say, this accords with and is mirrored by the arrangements put in place in the Native Title Act regarding the acquisition of native title rights and interests.</para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>2259</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>(94)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 70 (lines 3 to 9), omit subsection (2).</para><para>(96)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 73 (lines 4 to 18), omit subsection (6), substitute:</para><para>(6)	 In the case of any future act to which this Subdivision applies, other than an act to which Subdivision P (which deals with the right to negotiate) applies, the native title holders have the same procedural rights as they would have in relation to the act on the assumption that they instead held ordinary title to any land concerned and to the land adjoining, or surrounding, any waters concerned.

It was subject to amendment last time round so we are trying here to address some of the confusion about the effect of section 44C in the statutory access rights regime.</para><para>Section 44C arises where some people are claiming native title to a pastoral lease and have statutory access rights under the bill. It provides that, in those circumstances, other people should not be able to enforce any general common law rights, in particular access rights, outside the Federal Court process which is taking place. If those other people want to enforce any access rights, they need to make a claim and pass the test for statutory rights, otherwise the pastoralist would be subject to double or triple jeopardy, being required to mediate with, and provide access to, registered native title claimants who are in the Federal Court and having to deal at the same time with other people asserting their rights in other courts.</para><para>Government amendment 48 inserts a note to 44C(1). The note explains that the fact that one person or one group enjoys statutory access rights does not mean that other persons and other groups may not also be entitled to exercise statutory access rights. A number of people—indeed, a number of groups—may meet the test for statutory access rights and, if so, they are all entitled to exercise those rights. It was never the government's intention that, once one person has statutory access rights, no other person could also have such rights. There is nothing in the wording of 44C(1) to suggest that that is the case, but we do want to put the matter beyond doubt by inserting a note to that effect.</para><para>Government amendments 49 and 50 make it clear that the provisions of the Native Title Act, such as the right to negotiate provisions and procedural rights for other future acts, are still enforceable by the claimants even though they cannot enforce other possible native title rights while statutory access rights are in place, remembering that they are interim rights pending a determination. It was never the government's intention that, while a person enjoys statutory access rights, the act itself would cease to operate or be enforceable. Subsection 44C(2) and the existing note to that subsection make it clear that 44C(1) does not affect the operation of the act. For example, a registered native title claimant who does not have access rights may nonethe 
 less be a native title party for the purpose of any right to negotiate on the land.</para><para>Similarly, the primary production provisions in the bill would continue to protect native title holders and give them, in certain cases, procedural rights even when there is a person who also enjoys statutory access rights. Government amendment 50 makes it clear that this is the case by inserting examples to that effect. The amendments ensure that the act continues to protect the native title rights of those who hold statutory access rights, and those who hold native title rights but not statutory access rights.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>2262</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is quite a critical and symbolic part of the government's scheme. We are talking about a scheme where, once a native title claim over all or part of an area covered by a non-exclusive agricultural or pastoral lease is registered, and if one or more of the native title claimants regularly had physical access to that area—underline physical—for the purpose of carrying out traditional activities as at 23 December 1996, the bill provides for a conditional statutory right of access to those areas while the claim is in progress. The rights of the leaseholder prevail over the statutory access rights and initially, while the statutory right of access applies to any part of the lease, no person can enforce any native title rights or interests in relation to the whole of the land covered by the lease.</para></talk.start><para>As well as those restrictions, there is another more curious one. The statutory access right to pastoral leases only applies when native title holders have not previously been excluded from entry. This is a somewhat absurd provision in that it will be unnecessary for claimants who already have access, and it is unhelpful for those who do not, particularly in cases where Aboriginal people have wrongfully been prevented from entering traditional country on a pastoral run. In those circumstances, we have here a government actually rewarding unlawful acts of pastoralists who excluded them.</para><para>Once again, we find here a case where the Attorney-General has misled again. The government stated through the Attorney-General on 4 September last year:</para><para>Access for registered native title claimants to pastoral leases will be guaranteed—</para><para>This, however, as we found out, is restrictively qualified:</para><para>. . . provided that they regularly had physical access at the date of the Wik decision.</para><para>We should not underestimate the importance of these provisions. This is one provision that has been described by the Kimberley Land Council as `one of the cruelest hoaxes in the amendment bill'. The National Indigenous Working Group, which has been asked to suffer lots in the process leading up to this bill and since, comments in its submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title:</para><para>The provision is of very limited benefit, is likely to be difficult to enforce and precludes the exercise of common law rights of access. Its benefit to indigenous people at all, which is doubtful, if it is of benefit, then the benefit is likely to be entirely marginal.</para><para>We also have here a registration test which must be passed before Aboriginal people can claim a conditional statutory access right, and that is an onerous one. Failure of native title holders to pass this test will preclude them from gaining any statutory access rights. There needs to be physical access as at 23 December 1996.</para><para>Many Aboriginal people have access to pastoral lands and do have good relationships with pastoral leaseholders. But let us not forget that throughout our history many Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their lands either as part of government policy or, in some other circumstances, by pastoralists. That denial will deny them access here. If the native title claimants did not enjoy or were refused regular physical access to the area up until 23 December 1996, the statutory access right is not available to them. The regular physical access criteria does not appear to have any basis in the common law concept of native title. I have to signal at this particular stage that what constitutes regular physical access is not easily answered and it will be pursued in courts.</para><para>We also have here a suspension of native title rights for all claimants, even in the circumstances where one individual claimant 
 is entitled to a statutory access right under this subdivision. I must indicate that this is the cruel hoax referred to by the Kimberley Land Council. There is no just basis for the suspension of native title rights in these circumstances, nor is there any basis for not providing for compensation for the suspension of the native title rights.</para><para>There is also some irony in the fact that the conditional statutory right of access will apply only if a native title claim is lodged. What the government is doing is what pastoralists would not want—people living in co-existence situations now have to lodge a claim. We say it is better to do it by agreement; we say there are problems with the government's provisions. We will be moving amendments. For instance, amendment 183 deletes section 44C, which removes the suspension of common law native title rights of interim statutory access rights. Our amendment N30 is worth reading at this stage. We want to insert in the government's provision a subclause (3)(A) which, for the purposes of one being entitled to statutory access, will read:</para><para>(3A)	 For the purposes of paragraph (3)(a), physical access to land is deemed to have been regular up to 23 December 1996 if the person, being a member of the native title claim group, had not had regular physical access to the land prior to 23 December 1996 by reason of an act of government or by reason of the person having been denied physical access to the land by the lessee or a person acting on behalf of the lessee.</para><para>This is an important amendment for us. It tries to redress in part some of the inequities of the government's proposal in this particular division.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2263</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to give a general explanation of what this section is all about, and then to explain the Greens (WA)-Democrat amendments.

It provides certain persons with access to land covered by non-exclusive agricultural and pastoral leases for traditional purposes. The current act does not deal with this issue. However, this bill provides so little 
 that it is virtually worthless to people with traditional connections to particular land. In that sense, I support what Senator Bolkus said. The concept itself is sound and was recognised by various inquiries, including the ALRC in its customary law report before the decision in Mabo No. 2.</para></talk.start><para>I will now give a brief explanation of each proposed amendment. Amendment No. 147 removes the restriction to claim land, access on available Crown land and other land not subject to exclusive possession interest—that is section 44A(2). Greens (WA)-Democrat amendments 148 and 150 remove the significance of the date 23 December 1996 in assessing previous access and need for regular access and provide right of access to any person entitled or obliged under law and custom if such a person alive at the date of commencement had had such access—section 44A(3).</para><para>Greens (WA) amendment No. 149 removes the requirement that a person entitled to access rights must have lodged a claim and removes unreasonable restrictions on the exercise of access rights—that is, they have to be exercised in the same manner and to the same extent as previous access. It replaces a provision based on access rights specified in section 48 of the South Australian Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989. Among other things, it does not allow camping within one kilometre of any house or within 500 metres of a dam or other constructed stock watering point not being a site of significance—section 44B. Greens (WA)-Democrat amendment No. 151 removes the suspension of common law native title rights if interim statutory access rights are pursued.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>2264</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On this issue Senator Woodley and I are sharing the same notes so I cannot improve on what he has just said.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>2264</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am opposed to government amendments Nos 48 to 50 for the same reasons that have been outlined in the chamber.

Talking about access rights, when I look back on my notes from 1997 I find that the questions I asked Senator Minchin were far from adequately addressed. They included the whole issue of what is access, what is regular access, how do people prove it, how do other people attempt to disprove it, and the situation where somebody has traditional access which may mean they visit a place only once in their entire life, and that is the meaning for them of the traditional access. It might be a particular place for death ceremonies, coming of age ceremonies or one of those places which have specific significance for only one thing. There were many problems which were poorly addressed by the government. Considering all of those issues—Senator Bolkus has argued quite well on a number of issues in relation to access and how ridiculous the government's proposal 
 is—I wonder whether we can add at the end of amendment No. N30 `or any other person'.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>2265</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not have any problem with that, Senator Margetts.

Because the government's approach to its 10-point plan has been so one sided we think it is important that the compensation provisions do assume greater importance.</para></talk.start><para>We have discussed just terms throughout the context of this ongoing debate. We dealt with them in division 2B relating to the legislative extinguishment of native title. There is universal concern amongst the lawyers who appeared before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the constitutionality of this bill that just terms provisions of the constitution were in one way or another not being met. Some of those concerns have been taken up by amendments from non-government senators.</para><para>In respect of compensation, let us put it very clearly on the record that our position is that the parliament must express to the courts in a very unambiguous fashion that the compensation provisions of the Native Title Act are intended to be genuine. We are also concerned that though through this bill the government consistently and continually provides up front certainty of validation for non-indigenous land interests, it leaves native 
 title holders merely with a right to recover compensation with no real attempt made to ensure it is timely and appropriate. Compensation on just terms must be the general overarching principle under this legislation. It should cover not only valid acts but also invalid acts and impairment as well as extinguishment.</para><para>The small claims compensation provision which the government in part is adopting is, as far as it goes, acceptable to us, but we do want to amend it. Opposition amendment RN32 is designed to provide greater clarity to the compensation process where an application has been referred to a judicial registrar. As such it builds on the government's amendment 51 which provides for the Federal Court to delegate compensation claims under $100,000 to a judicial registrar.</para><para>We have tried to achieve what we regard as an important policy objective—that is, to prevent the entitlement of compensation from being a convenient fiction for the government and a hoax on native title holders. The damage has been done. What we need to do is ensure that compensation claims are a viable proposition for native title holders. As such our amendment clarifies the law such that the Federal Court may make directions to ensure that a claim is determined as cheaply, formally and expeditiously as possible and that the legal costs of recovering compensation is not disproportionate to the amount being claimed. We do have non-exhaustive directions which the Federal Court may choose to make in pursuit of these objectives.</para><para>The government has moved to a proposal for referral to judicial registrars of compensation claims under $100,000 because I think it recognises the validity of the policy arguments which we put in relation to small claims last December. What we are concerned about is that, through our amendment RN32, a vital element of the scheme for referring matters to the registrar is maintained and that this parliament demonstrates its clear intention that when a decision is made in terms of referral the costs and complexity of a small compensation claim must be contained and must not be thwarted by excessive legal manoeuvring. For the government to be 
 totally consistent with its policy it will contribute to the costs of effective justice. I think there is some chance that they might support this particular amendment.</para><para>We support government amendment 52. We support Democrats-Green (WA) amendment 152. We will pursue the debate in respect of 160. Our concern also is that compensation be paid for invalid as well as valid acts. Our amendment 31, which is one of the three elements passed by the Senate last time, will ensure that the position of the Senate in respect of valid and invalid acts is retained. Strangely enough, this amendment was agreed to in the House of Representatives last year, but the government is now stepping back from it.</para><para>We also have another amendment which was also another strain of the compensation provisions that went through and was accepted by the Senate last year. One is in respect of just terms for impairment as well as extinguishment. We will move that again this time and anticipate that the government, which spoke in support of it and agreed to it in the House of Representatives on 6 December 1997, will once again change its mind and support it now.</para><para>There needs to be some equity in this process. This is one of the last chances for the parliament to ensure not just equity but also protection against unconstitutionality. The three strains of our amendments, amendments which were accepted last year, need to be supported tonight.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>2268</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State;Minister Assisting the Prime Minister</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government does not have a problem with RN32 but opposes R188 and N31. We think there is a problem with insisting on just terms compensation when you are not talking about extinguishment. Just terms compensation is the concept applied for acquisition of property not impairment. The procedural rights for compensation relating to impairment are equated with that pertaining to freeholders. It is appropriate and sensible where there is an acquisition of property—that is, the acquisition of the native title, which is obviously much greater than impairment—that just terms 
 compensation be paid but not where there is impairment. The relevant test is equivalent freeholders' rights. So we do have a problem with that amendment.</para></talk.start><para>We think N31 is not at all necessary. The whole act is about ensuring that where things are validly done, the Native Title Act itself should provide for compensation at just terms where that involves an acquisition. If they are invalid acts, they are outside the parameters of the Native Title Act. That is the whole point. To the extent that an invalid act which, by definition, allows itself to fall outside the Native Title Act, then any effect on native title should be addressed under the general law.</para><para>So we do think there is an important distinction to draw when you are dealing with the Native Title Act and what it requires of governments in paying compensation. This is a fairly important issue in that sense because of the impact of the native title and the statutory obligation as it imposes on people. It is about the effect of saying: if the act allows you to do something that is valid, then you have this obligation under the Native Title Act. Where it is invalid and it is outside the auspices of the act, then the recourse in terms of damage obviously must rest with the general law.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>2268</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are a couple of points in response there. Impairment is a relevant consideration. Impairment denotes a negative impact. We should keep in mind in this debate that when we talk about compensateable property under the Constitution we are talking about more than just freehold land; we are talking about rights; we are talking about rights determined in cases like Georgiardis v. Newcrest. An asset can be an asset without being a real property asset. An impairment of that asset, a detrimental impact on that asset, is something which is compensatable and something that needs to be taken into account here.</para></talk.start><para>The other point to make is in respect of invalid acts. Senator Minchin, you have exposed the fraud that has been perpetrated on Aboriginal people here. You are wanting us to believe that your clause note is suffi 
 cient to cover compensation in the case of invalid acts, although you have argued against compensation in those circumstances. We have problems with your clause note. It is vague in language. It makes reference to native title holders who `ordinarily may be entitled to compensation' and states that the Federal Court may be able to be award compensation through a general `vesting of jurisdiction'.</para><para>We say that to make this act defensible you really need to be more explicit. Your clause note is not explicit. The amendment that was passed in the Senate last year was explicit. It is one that I believe the government has given us absolutely no reason to withdraw from. We are talking about protecting the constitutionality here, and disregard for those considerations is something that must be of concern to people.</para><para>Going back to this particular point, though your clause note does recognise scope for compensation in respect of invalidity, we say that the language is such that it is insufficient. We also say that there has been no argument given, for instance, to make us withdraw from the protections afforded to native title interests during the last debate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>2269</page.no><name role="metadata">Woodley, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WOODLEY</name><name.id>HX5</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think I should briefly speak to the general principle that we are debating. We will be supporting the opposition amendment. The whole issue of compensation under subsection 51(3) is not necessarily just terms compensation. That provision applies if the act is not a compulsory acquisition and the similar compensable interest test is satisfied. That test is satisfied if compensation is payable under any law for the act on the assumption that the native title holders instead held ordinary title.</para></talk.start><para>The assumption is that for anything short of compulsory acquisition, native title holders should do no better than ordinary titleholders. If ordinary titleholders are provided with just terms compensation, it may not follow that compensation assessed on the same principles will be just terms compensation for native title holders. Similarly, when even for ordinary holders the compensation is less than just terms, equivalent compensation for native 
 title holders may be much less than just terms compensation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>2269</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—At this stage I can clarify one or two points I have made. I did make the assertion that there were three elements of the compensation package that were accepted by the Senate last time. One is just terms for impairment as well as extinguishment. Another was compensation for invalid as well as valid acts. I believe the third one was the small claims process. I will seek further advice on that. Those two provisions reflected in opposition N31 in respect of the invalid as well as valid acts and opposition R188 for impairment as well as extinguishment I believe were carried last time.

The purpose of that is twofold: firstly, that the amendments ensure that applications are made with the authority of all the persons who according to traditional law and custom hold the native title claimed and, secondly, the amendments prevent separate applications from being made by members of the same native title claim group. As we have discussed, this deals with the problem of multiple claims coming out of the same group.</para><para>Government amendment 56 is to subsection 61A(4), which enables applications that would be covered by sections 47, 47A or 47B to be made even though there has been a previous exclusive possession act over all or part of the claim area. The amendment requires that, in order for an application of this kind to be made, the application must state that 47, 47A or 47B, as the case may be, applies to it. The amendment is necessary so that it will be apparent on the face of an application whether or not it is one that may be made under the act.</para><para>Government amendment 59 makes it clear that applications may be amended at any time to reduce the area covered by the applications and, of course, applications may also be amended in other ways under Federal Court rules. The amendment inserts a note to make 
 it clear that where applications are amended, the court can make orders about costs.</para><para>Government amendment 60 inserts a new section 66B that provides for members of a native title claim group or compensation claim group to apply to the Federal Court for an order that they replace the applicant in relation to the claim. The Federal Court may make an order of this kind if it is satisfied that the current applicant is no longer authorised by the claim group to deal with the application or has exceeded that authority and that the members who seek to replace the current applicant are authorised by the claim group to deal with the application. The amendment provides a sensible and workable mechanism for ensuring that applicants retain the authority of the claim group so that the wishes of the group as a whole are properly considered during the application process and in other matters which may affect their interests.</para><para>The government amendment means that if at any time those interests are not being properly represented, action can be taken to replace the applicant.

I will not be canvassing those issues again tonight, but I do find the hypocrisy of the coalition breathtaking. It was only four years ago that we in this chamber witnessed members of the coalition raising operational matters that were then before the Australian Federal Police. They canvassed them in this chamber at question time, on other occasions and on the adjournment; canvassing them at the estimates committee, and canvassing them in camera at a select committee that had nothing to do with those issues.</para></talk.start><para> The fact is that the matter I referred to last night has been referred to the Australian Federal Police, but that in no way stopped the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, tonight from canvassing those issues in the House of Representatives. In fact, he canvassed them in the House of Representatives by telling people that he had made his own investigation. Here we have the minister for industrial relations investigating matters when the matters have already been sent to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. I note for the record that the last time Penthouse Pete raised these sorts of issues and accusations against former Senator Gareth Evans and myself, DAS investigated them and brought in a total clearance of both of us. He was left with egg on his face but never withdrew the allegations.</para><para> In the House of Representatives tonight, Mr Reith said that I should put up or shut up. He demanded that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, come into the chamber and put the evidence on the record. Yet his colleague Senator Vanstone wrote to me—and you might have read that, because she tabled the letter today—and said:</para><para>I trust that from now on, you will assist the authorities to investigate the matter fully. 
</para><para>I certainly intend to do that. But you cannot have it both ways as a government. You cannot have the Minister for Justice writing to me saying, `I wish you, from now on, to take these matters up with the Federal Police,' and have Mr Reith canvass them in full in the House of Representatives. There is some sort of dilemma there for the government as to what its approach is.</para><para> But if I can read body language correctly, and I do not know if I can, I got the impression from the debate in the other place tonight that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, did not know these matters had been referred to the Federal Police. He seemed quite surprised by that in the House of Representatives and went over to the advisers' box to check. I think Mr Howard would have taken the view, as he has on many other occasions, and we can go to the quotes in the House of Representatives in the last two years, that when a matter goes to the Federal Police it is not canvassed in the parliamentary chamber. I, for one, think Mr Howard did not know of this reference.

In effect, what she referred to the federal police was not based on the statements I made last night, but on the inferences that she took from those statements. If that is a valid ground for reference to the federal police, at least Senator Vanstone should have got that part accurate. To her credit, she attached my adjournment speech to the letter so that at least the federal police could use that not as an evidentiary base—because we know it cannot be used as an evidentiary base—but as an indication of the issues I raised, but it is in contradiction to the actual reference to the federal police.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Madam President, they sent a message out through the whips to come in to disrupt me.

Are you always going to do it when accusations are made by any member of parliament? Are you actually going to table the letter to the police commissioner in the parliament? I think not.

I wish to speak tonight on an issue of importance to a great number of people on the south side of Brisbane concerning the proposed expansion of Brisbane airport. Last weekend I attended a meeting at the Colmslie RSL Club in Morningside, on the south side of Brisbane. It was held to provide information to the 
 people of that area of Brisbane about the potential impacts of the proposed expansion of the Brisbane airport.</para></talk.start><para>A draft master plan was released a few weeks ago, and 90 days has been allowed for people to make comments on it. It is a very extensive document, detailing proposed quite extensive expansions to the airport. It envisages the construction of an additional runway and an extension of the length of the two existing runways. It also has plans for the creation of an airport city, with business zones, shopping areas and a transport hub linking shipping, rail and air. In short, it is a very major proposal.</para><para>It is important to note that the people of the south side of Brisbane have had to endure, for about 10 years now, unacceptable levels of aircraft noise following the construction of the new Brisbane airport. They are levels of noise which they were assured would not occur, and they have had various assurances ever since that this degree of noise was being dealt with. But the reality is that those problems have not been adequately addressed. When the word went out that further major expansions were being planned, it is obvious that a lot of people in this area were highly concerned about what might befall them in the future.</para><para>The meeting on the weekend was exceptionally well attended; 300 to 400 people from that area came along. A further meeting at Cannon Hill, just up the road, is planned for a couple of weeks time, which I expect will get a similar number again. One of the most unfortunate things about this meeting on the weekend is that, despite the fact that all these people came along to be informed about the reality of what is going to happen, about what is being proposed with the expansion of the airport, the Brisbane Airport Corporation declined to appear.</para><para>Regardless of all the arguments for and against expansion of the airport, a parallel runway and other alternatives, the Australian Democrats and I believe that it was totally unacceptable and a great shame that the Brisbane Airport Corporation chose not to come along to inform the people of what was going to occur and to provide some facts from their perspective. They can hardly complain 
 when other people get up and put forward all sorts of horror scenarios about what it is going to mean when they are not there to put forward the alternative view.</para><para>It is not surprising, given the rough deal the people of the south side of Brisbane feel they have been given over the last 10 years, that there is a great deal of mistrust and anxiety about what might happen with the Brisbane airport. This was a major public forum; hundreds of people came along. Yet the airport corporation decided that they did not want to come. The only reason they gave was they prefer to speak to small numbers of people, to individual community groups, and they do not wish to speak to large forums. I believe that is completely unacceptable and really does the airport corporation a great disservice, regardless of whether what they are proposing is a good thing.</para><para>I understand that it is part of the act that the federal Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Vaile) has to satisfy himself, before he approves any plan to expand the airport, that adequate consultation occurred and there was adequate opportunity for informed input from the community. But, when the major corporation that is putting up their preferred option in a big glossy document, with all the usual reassuring maps and diagrams, et cetera, refuse to come along and answer direct questions on it in a public forum, I believe that really puts into serious doubt the adequacy of the consultation process.</para><para>As all senators would know, it is a great shame that there is a lot of disaffection throughout the community at all levels in relation to people's trust in politics, trust in government and trust in large corporations. We always talk about trying to repair that trust, trying to convince people that we have their best interests at heart. Yet, when a large group of people on a Saturday afternoon gather to get answers and to just get informed and the people who are proposing to make this major change, which potentially has massive impacts on this area, do not turn up to put their perspective, to answer questions or, just as importantly, to hear the concerns directly from the community—not just about 
 what might happen with the proposed expansion but also about their concerns regarding what is occurring now—these people quite justifiably feel that over the years they have been ignored, that they have not been listened to.</para><para>Present at the forum was the federal member for the electorate of Griffith, Mr Graeme McDougall, who represents that area, as was the Labor candidate, Mr Kevin Rudd, who is having his second shot at the seat. They had lots of proposals and lots of questions—some fairly firm, some more polite—put to them. Both of them were given a fair bit of work to do in lots of ways. One of them, at least, could have been more convincing in terms of the answers they were giving. But at least they turned up; they were willing to answer the questions, address the issues and hear what people's concerns are.</para><para>At the end of the day, it is the airport corporation that is putting forward this draft plan, which is very comprehensive. They have their preferred option; they have glossed over the other three very minimally. For them not to show up is completely unacceptable. The consistent message from people in these suburbs on the south side of the Brisbane River—Coorparoo, Norman Park, Bulimba, Cannon Hill, out through to Tingalpa and to the bayside—is quite clear: the existing level of noise is unacceptable to everyone in that area and it is very difficult to see how what has been proposed here is going to do anything more than increase those levels of noise.</para><para>Add to that issue, which is probably the prime issue that keeps coming to the fore, other issues, such as the lack of willingness to consider or propose the imposition of a curfew for Brisbane. A curfew seems to be acceptable for cities in other parts of Australia—but not for the Brisbane airport, for reasons that are not explained. There is inadequate outlining of other potential alternative runways.</para><para>Also, there has been virtually no recognition at all of air pollution, the emissions coming from aircraft. The fact that there are many hundreds of aircraft every day flying over that area barely gets a mention. From studies that have been done in relation to the 
 ongoing issues with the Sydney airport, including major problems with pollution and associated health impacts on people underneath the flight paths, senators would be aware that this is a very significant issue. To not even raise it and hope that nobody is aware of it is just unacceptable.</para><para>The people in that area are aware of it because they are living under the flight path already. They know what they are getting as it is. They know they are just as likely to get the same thing again, but double. It is no surprise that they are concerned.</para><para>On top of that, there is the construction of the proposed additional runway itself. That is likely to have adverse effects on the immediate local environment around the airport. The Brisbane airport is located at the mouth of the Brisbane River in Morton Bay, which is a fairly environmentally sensitive area, as most coastal or waterside areas are. I understand that 70 hectares of mangroves will be removed to allow for the new construction.</para><para>There will be pretty extensive reclamation work required. That will be carried out over approximately 60 hectares of intertidal soft sediment, and will affect local wetland birds. Also required will be construction of a deepwater drainage outlet into the floodway, south of the existing main parallel runway.</para><para>So there are immediate natural environmental impacts, as well as health and living environment impacts on the people situated on the south side of the river. There is the major issue of noise pollution. Again, it seems that the sorts of options that are put forward really gloss over or put forward half the story. It is no wonder that the people on the south side of Brisbane do not trust what they are being told; and it is even less of a surprise when the people who are telling it to them refuse to turn up to major public forums to hear concerns and put forward answers to the issues.</para><para>The Democrats would simply say to the Airports Corporation and to the federal government—which at the end of the day has to take the decision on this issue: please listen to the community; please make sure that the people who need to do the consulting hear the community's concerns and provide enough 
 information to enable them to have informed input into this process. Otherwise, the disaffection and distrust that currently exists will only get worse. That will be doing a disservice not only to the people of that area but to all of us.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Travel Allowances</title><page.no>2283</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>00:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>2283</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to speak on what is clearly about the lowest watermark one could ever imagine in terms of the ALP's approach to politics in this country. Today is clearly another day of shame and ignominy, and one that is led by a man who, for many months now, has paraded himself around in a garb of sanctimonious unctuousness, pretending all the time that somehow he is interested in the welfare of the parliament. The fact is that he has never, ever canvassed any policy issues since the last federal election. All he has ever done is dredge through the gutter, digging up sleaze, conducting a systematic campaign of distortion and misrepresentation.</para></talk.start><para>What we have seen in this instance is Senator Ray setting up an environment in which he and his mates have been able to go up to the gallery, name Liberal members of parliament, invite the press down to take photographs of material that they have—in other words, create an entire climate designed to fit the Liberal Party. So, as a result, on the <inline font-style="italic">Today</inline> show this morning, we had a headline, `Government embroiled in new rorts row'—all orchestrated by someone who knows full well that what he is doing is an absolute disgrace.</para><para>To have the gall to somehow pretend that he has not actually accused anyone of fraud, that all he has done is state a few facts beggars belief. It is an insult to the intelligence. Anyone who examines what Senator Ray had to say last night—and I was in here to hear it—knows full well that he talked about scams, he talked about fraud, he talked about forging and uttering. In other words, he made it absolutely clear that he was systematically imputing fraud and misbehaviour on the part of Liberal members of parliament.</para><para>In fact, Senator Ray went so far as to indicate that there was one member of parliament from South Australia and another from Queensland. But, of course, he was not prepared to name anyone; he was not prepared to spell out any of the allegations. All he said was that he believed his informant was reliable.</para><para>We are not here to take his word for it. In fact, I think it is entirely incumbent upon Senator Ray to explain precisely where he got the information, if in fact he got it. I think we have now reached the stage where we do not believe a word that Senator Ray says. After all of this hand wringing and all this pretending to be concerned about the welfare of others, every time that Senator Ray gets to his feet, it is to sink to another low.</para><para>What Senator Ray has done in this instance is to cast a slur over the entire Liberal Party. He has done it quite deliberately and maliciously. He has done it in such a way that he is hoping that the Labor Party will get through to the next election without ever having to come up with any policies, without having to do anything other than try and discredit their opponents in the most disreputable and dishonest way one can ever imagine.</para><para>Madam President, do you remember what he had to say about Senator Colston, whom he hounded remorselessly for months on end?	The appropriate epithets for Senator Ray are `the vicious viper from Victoria', `the sultan of sleaze'. He relishes that reputation, much and all as he might pretend that somehow he has a higher purpose. I do not know why he is in this parliament. For the last two years he has spent all his time trying to find ways of discrediting his political opponents—and he does not care whom he drags down in the process.</para><para>In the last 24 hours he has been absolutely caught short. He has not been able to come into this parliament and substantiate any of these allegations. He is simply content to get up and take some very spurious points of demarcation with Senator Vanstone. There it was for all to see: someone who had absolutely nothing to support his case but who was trying to play semantic games, to pretend that somehow all he had been doing was rais 
 ing some concerns—when what he was doing was abundantly clear to anyone who even listened half-heartedly. What he was doing was systematically casting a slur upon his opponents in such a way that it was very difficult to rebut, because there was not enough there for substantiation.</para><para>It is an absolute disgrace. We do not expect the Labor Party to do anything by way of apology because we know the Faulkner creed. The Faulkner creed is: no matter how low in the gutter you get, no matter who you defame, no matter how gross the slander, you never apologise, you never explain. As Senator Faulkner says, `I have never got anywhere in my political career by taking one step backwards.' Lovely, is it not? In other words, I do not care who I tread on, I do not care who I knife, I do not care what I say, I do not care how we do it, as long as we drag you down, as long as we win by sticking in the knife, we think we have done well. We could not give a damn about Australia. We are not interested in alternative policy approaches. Our task in life for the last two years has been to simply trawl through the gutter, to come up with anything we can, totally unsubstantiated.</para><para>Look at the Senator Parer allegation about letterheads being distributed. There was nothing to substantiate it. There was no follow-up in question time. It was leaked through the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline> and then out it went into the ether. All of this black cloud is left hanging. They go quiet for a couple of days and then they are back into it again. They have a program of trying to target individuals to cast slurs on them. It does not matter about Senator Parer's family or his reputation. No, you simply say that he is a $2 million man.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">PATTERSON</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—Or his staff.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—Or his staff or anyone else for that matter.

You cannot.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Unless you are prepared to come in here and do a lot better than Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner have ever thought of doing, then they will be condemned by the Australian public in due course. The moment of truth will be arising in the next period of months. They will then face the moment of truth, and that will be that they have not spent the last two years on anything that the public is interested in. All they have tried to do is to denigrate and discredit their political opponents. And they will pay the price for that. I hope that Senator Ray then has the decency to quit this parliament and to allow the standards to go up a little bit. The example that he sets in recruiting some of these lackeys to come in here and follow in the same pattern is an absolute disgrace to this institution.</para><para>To think that Senator Ray can go around trying to pretend that somehow he is concerned about the institution is absolute hypocrisy at its highest. I do not need to say any 
 thing further other than that Senator Ray's actions and words speak louder than we could. He is condemned out of his own mouth. We do not expect him for a moment to have the decency to come in here and apologise, but we will make sure he never forgets this day. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>01:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>2285</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 1.03 a.m. (Wednesday)</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>2285</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2285</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government document was tabled:</para><para>Australian Dried Fruits Board—Report for 1996-97.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2285</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Defence Act—Determinations under section 58B—Defence Determinations 1998/14 and 1998/15.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>2286</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Industrial Relations</title><page.no>2286</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1080)</subtitle><id.no>1080</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2286</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 5 March 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) Did the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [ACCC] take any action in 1997, under the boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974, concerning industrial action by unions which were claimed to be to protect the environment or consumers, for example, green bans; if so, can details be provided.</para><para>(2) Has any environmental, consumer or human rights individual or group of activists or body corporate been investigated, fined, prosecuted or incarcerated, since the commencement of sections 45D, 45DA and 45DB of the Trade Practices Act 1974, for blockade style protest action; if so, can details be provided.</para><para>(3) Under these sections, has any environmental, consumer or human rights individual or group of activists or body corporate been investigated, fined or prosecuted for boycott campaigns; if yes, can details be provided.</para><para>(4) Under these sections, has any Aboriginal individual or group of activists or body corporate been investigated, fined or prosecuted for protesting because of land rights or spiritual reasons.</para><para>(5) Have any company injunctions been taken out under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 or the Trade Practices Act 1974 against protests and boycott actions by consumers, environmentalists or human rights activists, whether individuals, groups or bodies corporate; if so, can details be provided including a comparison of the number with action taken in previous years under the Industrial Relations Act 1998.</para><para>(6) Have any unions been prosecuted under the boycott provisions because their members have engaged in environmental or consumer protest, such as a forest blockade.</para><para>(7) Has the Minister received any complaints since the promulgation of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the new sections 45D, 45DA and 45DB of the Trade Practices Act 1974, that the new Act has stifled environmental, human rights, spiritual, cultural or consumer protest in any way; if so, can details be provided.
