I also saw a strenuous denial by a spokesman for Telstra. They are, of course, matters of concern to the government, particularly the quantum alleged, and we would certainly expect the matters to be properly investigated by the communications authority, the ACCC, or even the TIO. There are plenty of people who have direct responsibility for aspects of charging and billing and we would expect them to be pursuing those matters.</para></talk.start><para>Certainly there is already an industry code of practice in place in relation to the accuracy and timeliness of charging and billing, and the communications authority has the power to direct any non-complying carriage service provider to comply with the code. The TIO is also able to investigate and make determinations on complaints about overcharging of certain services, including standard telephone services provided to residential and small business users, and public mobile services.</para><para>The ACCC has a general mandate to protect consumers and considerable powers to investigate allegations of anti-competitive conduct. I understand that Telstra has already written to the ACCC claiming that the allegations 
 constitute misleading and deceptive conduct. There is clearly an area of dispute, but it is not one that needs to be resolved by the government at this point in time or that requires more than an expression of concern; from that will flow all the necessary and proper inquiries.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3059</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask a supplementary question, Madam President.

We have taken a practical and responsible approach to indigenous affairs, and we are making a difference, but there is more work to be done.

We sent the army into communities which desperately required urgent action. These were communities which lacked basic essentials.

He has attempted to obtain a passport from the Republic of Seychelles. The government has urged the Seychelles not to issue a passport or other document for travel to Mr Skase. Mr Downer has instructed his department to urge foreign governments not to issue Mr Skase with a passport. Skase's efforts to obtain a Seychelles passport demonstrate the value of cancelling his passport.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The question that needs to be asked is this: why didn't Labor's Minister for Foreign Affairs, now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Gareth Evans, take that action himself? Why did Gareth Evans allow Skase to be reissued with a passport? Why did he not cancel Mr Skase's passport? Labor issued Skase with a 10-year passport. Gareth Evans could have issued Mr Skase with a passport for a period of less than 10 years; he could have issued him with a three-year passport; he could have issued him with a one-way travel document back to Australia.</para><para>Senator Evans allowed the issuing of the passport and subsequently failed to cancel the passport when the Department of Foreign Affairs had put a special alert on his passport. This was not a case of just a passport coming in out of the blue; there was a special tag on this passport and the tag said, `Do not reissue unless you go back to Canberra.' I am advised that the particular file had an annotation on it with an instruction that then Minister Evans be notified in the event that Skase applied for a passport.</para><para>So now the question needs to be asked: what did then Minister Evans do when he was presumably notified that Mr Skase was seeking a passport?

But there is one major area of economic reform that is badly in need of attention, and that is the taxation system. Everyone knows that that is so. They know that the existing system is unfair.

This prohibition never ceases. As former employees, they are free to engage in other employment. The Commonwealth has a legislative and guidelines framework which safeguards official information and defines the parameters for tendering and outsourcing processes.

Let me say at the outset, not only the Leader of the Opposition but also the Australian Education Union has been intent on distorting this government's commitment to the future generation of this country and this government's education policy. Let us look at what the Leader of the Opposition said over the weekend. He said that if they got into government—fat chance of that—they would have a review of education in this country. It was only two years ago that they were in power—and they were in power for 13 years.

This government is committed to a strong government school sector and a strong non-government school sector so that parents can have a viable choice.

Mr Beazley has given his game away, in fact, with the promise of a "ground-up review of the entire Australian education system." This review creates a subsidised vehicle for the federations to drive their agendas forward.</para><para>That is what that editorial said and how right it is. Never mind the real issues of literacy, 
 numeracy, drugs, civics education and vocational education in schools; let us just talk about doing away with the new school policy and having a ground-up review.</para><para>The other aspect of Senator Tierney's question relates to the distortion that is going on in relation to the funding and the commitment that this government has to schools and education in this country. Let us have a look at the facts. Compared with 1996, Labor's last year in office, this government has increased funding for schools by $580 million. When you look at that in relation to government schools the figure is $382 million. That is an increase since Labor was last in power of $382 million for this year. That is totally opposite to the distortion the Leader of the Opposition stated when he said that this government was likely to cut funds by $90 million over last year's figures. What we have in fact done is increase funding for government schools by $382 million in this year compared to the last year of Labor in power.</para><para>There are other aspects that this government is committed to. I mentioned numeracy and literacy. With the cooperation of the states and territories we have achieved national benchmarks in relation to literacy. We have also announced recent funding in relation to national Asian languages—$42 million odd there. We have announced funding of $187 million for a program of vocational education in schools until the year 2000—vocational education which will address the needs of those 70 per cent of students who do not go on to university.

Senator Neal was here two years ago when I said that we were quarantining the funding for housing. And it was quarantined. ATSIC complained about it at the time but we have quarantined the reductions we had to make because we did have a $10.3 billion budget deficit that those on the other side seem to have forgotten about. We had to find savings within that budget because if we had projected on with the forward projections in that budget we would have been in a much more desperate position than we would be if the Labor Party was in power. So we do not resile from that. There were savings but we quarantined the amount of funding in relation to housing.</para></talk.start><para>The second part of Senator Neal's question was in relation to the home ownership program. The reality is that 50 per cent of Aboriginal people are totally dependent on welfare and 60 per cent are partially dependent on welfare. There are very few people who can actually access the program. So the amount of funding that went to the home ownership program has decreased to a degree because people do not want to take it up—they cannot afford it because of the Labor Party policies. They cannot afford it because for 13 years the Labor Party ran them into a desperate situation in relation to their own funding, making 50 per cent of them totally welfare dependent. There are very few people who can take up that program; in fact, only 
 a little over 450 people actually take up that program.</para><para>If Senator Neal were to go to the trouble of looking at the booklet <inline font-style="italic">Rebutting the Myths</inline>, the home ownership program is all spelt out in that. I suggest that she reads this material so that she can see that we are improving, that we are devoting our attention to the basics of health, housing and education. That is what we are doing; that is what we have done in the first couple of years. We will continue to do so and we will not resile from that. We are putting more funds into housing, we are putting more funds into health and we are putting more funds into education. It is all in the budget papers. I am happy to provide Senator Neal with a graph which demonstrates quite clearly that the amount of funding is increasing and will increase over our first four years of government.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3070</page.no><name role="metadata">Neal, Sen Belinda</name><name role="display">Senator NEAL</name><name.id>B36</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

The Australian people can rely on it, said the Labor Prime Minister.	 What happened after the election? It disappeared. Instead the Australian people got increases in petrol tax; increases in tobacco excise; increases in fringe benefits tax; wholesale sales taxes went up.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The people can look to the 1995 budget only two years later. What happened there? Sales tax on cars went from 15 per cent to 22 per cent; the Medicare levy was increased; in

In 1995-96 alone, there was a 9.3 per cent real increase in the tax take. That is because Labor is the high-tax alternative of Australian politics—and we know just below the surface it is still there.</para><para>What did former senator Gareth Evans, now the shadow Treasurer, say in October 1996?

Mr Evans said Australia is so undertaxed by all relevant international standards that there is a case for having some overall revenue increases. Mr Evans is saying revenue increases, and he talked about possible death duties, property taxes, income tax surcharges—this is what Mr Evans is talking about—and increased payroll taxes.</para><para>Even yesterday what did Mr Evans say?

Employment National has received $130 million over two years of taxpayers' money to provide a service. It is 
 outrageous that Employment National is trying to say, `We are not accountable.' They are accountable. They are accountable to the people of Australia through the provision of that money, and they are also accountable with regard to estimates.</para><para>In that regard, we now have the situation where Employment National is charging small business—the very constituency that this government attempts to purport to represent—between $300 and $2,000 for services that the CES previously provided for free. I think that is absolutely outrageous. I believe that the bottom line is that this is a de facto jobs tax. It is something that small businesses never anticipated would happen, and now they are starting to scream.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3075</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I found it interesting listening to Senator Mackay's remarks on this motion to take note of answers.

So, every time that organisation subcontracts, taxpayers' hard earned dollars are now going for a commission. And can we establish the value of that commission? No.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why should taxpayers be subsidising an organisation to take a cut or a kickback every time it subcontracts to those organisations already on the ground who were denied the continuance of that work by this government?

When we were in South Australia—in Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Pirie, north and south of Adelaide—not one of those positions had been filled. There was nobody providing job assistance. There was nobody there to provide any of this. According to the department, the money has been paid, but nobody is providing any service at all.</para><para>When we were in Craigieburn one of the people there said, `I would like to tell you what has happened to us. I rang this number to find out where my nearest unemployment agent office was.' Somebody on the phone asked, `How can I help you?' This woman said, `I am in Craigieburn and I want to know where my nearest Employment National office is or any office that can assist me.' The lady said, `Where is Craigieburn?' `Oh,' said the woman ringing up. `Where are you?' She 
 said, `I am in Perth.

They want people who know about the jobs in their area, who want to know about unemployment in their area, who want to know about the skills and talents of the people in that area. They do not want people miles away across the nation down a telephone answering questions about Melbourne from Perth when the people in Perth properly have no expert knowledge at all.</para><para>The system, as far as we have been able to discover it and explore it to this point, is a total, unmitigated fiasco.

According to the lot over there, I think those three `s's should be replaced with others; namely, smugness and self-satisfaction. You are sitting there complacently. We just heard Senator Tierney saying that things will be much better. They are not; they are a shambles. We are unable to discover how many taxpayers' dollars are going where under this veil of commercial in confidence. You should take no satisfaction from this. It is a disaster. It is a disaster that is already happening.</para><para>People are very disinterested and disappointed with what you have put in place. As Senator Ellison said, `If the office in Bathurst cannot help you, go to another one.' As one of my colleagues has said, it is a long way in a wheelchair to another employment agency. What kind of government, what kind of compassion, security or stability will that give people when they are told by the minister, `I am not aware, I do not know.' It is a disaster out there. It is not waiting to happen; it is happening right now.

What needs to be understood is that this government has introduced a new system of employment services 
 because of the failure of Labor's system. The system that Labor had in place for all their years in office proved to be a dismal failure. Their system did not succeed through the old CES in placing unemployed people in real, long-term jobs in any significant numbers. As I said, it is because of that failure that the government has taken the initiative and set up a new system which will provide a much better service. The previous arrangement simply did not work effectively in getting people into jobs.</para></talk.start><para>Too often under Labor, job seekers were merely churned through costly, ineffective and complex so-called training programs with little regard for the individual needs of the particular unemployed person concerned or with no job involved at the end of it. The focus was on process and program placements rather than the needs of the individual and the job opportunities that were available. What we had under Labor was training for training's sake rather than effective placement in a job. Job seekers were expected to fit the program rather than, as should have been the case and as will be the case under the new employment services programs initiated by these changes, the programs fitting the job seeker.</para><para>Another thing that needs to be understood is that the Commonwealth Employment Service under the old system had only a very limited share of the available vacancies—about 20 per cent. Most of the jobs that were available in the community in small, medium and large business were filled through advertising, word of mouth or other means rather than by placement by the Commonwealth Employment Service. We needed to change that and get a results driven system into place that would serve the needs of the unemployed. That is exactly what we have done. We have introduced a results driven system. Jobs network members will be paid to place unemployed people in jobs and not simply to continue managing the unemployed.</para><para>Another thing that became evident under Labor was that those involved had a long-term interest in dependency on government, in keeping people dependent on government, instead of making them independent of 
 government by finding them appropriate employment and by being required to place them in jobs rather than managing their unemployment. That is the essence of the changes that have been made under the new scheme which came into effect at the beginning of this month—the replacement of the Commonwealth Employment Service by the new jobs network. This is a national network of more than 300 private, community and government organisations specialising in finding jobs for unemployed people, and especially dealing with the long-term unemployed and finding the right jobs for them.</para><para>In making these changes, the government is making employment services more effective and is focusing on the outcomes, on the results, getting unemployed people into jobs and providing help that genuinely makes a difference to them. Jobs network members will be paid to place unemployed people in jobs. Because of the broad spread—and I said that some 300 or so organisations were involved in this—there will be three to four times more sites than were available under the CES as a source of assistance for unemployed people. Similarly, employers will have a far greater choice of organisations to find the right person for their job vacancies.</para><para>As far as Commonwealth services relating to employment assistance and other Commonwealth assistance is concerned, Centrelink has now been well established and is operating effectively in providing an easier, better and more efficient way for people to obtain those Commonwealth services. That is now the base where unemployed people register for work and receive their unemployment benefit and government assistance. Centrelink provides the initial gateway entry for benefits for those on unemployment benefits to obtain that assistance, and it is also the gateway to the jobs network. It will be Centrelink that provides the link, very appropriately, between unemployed people and the jobs network members in their area. A very effective system has been established by the government to overcome the dismal failures of the previous Labor government system which did not succeed. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>3079</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is worth noting that this new scheme, or Jobs Network, only came into effect on 1 May. It has been, in fact, in operation for 25 days and already there is sufficient anecdotal evidence to suggest that it will turn out to be an absolute national disgrace; an absolute national disgrace in terms of what it is projected to do compared with what it will do. My colleagues Senator Crowley and Senator Mackay gave some examples—anecdotal evidence—of what is occurring in practice out in the field with Jobs Network. I have also come across a few examples.</para></talk.start><para>When we were on the regional unemployment inquiry in Broken Hill, we were told by people in Broken Hill that the company that had won the contract—the people who were providing the employment services in Broken Hill—was located in Bendigo—a considerable distance, I would suggest, away from Broken Hill. In fact, I dare say that they had never visited Broken Hill in the whole period of their existence.</para><para>Another example was given to me the other day by Senator Sherry who was approached by one of his constituents who had rung up the service which was providing employment services to Burnie. After spending a considerable period of time waiting in the queue, she spoke to the person at the other end of the line. After going through the procedures and processes they said, `Where do you live?' She said, `I am located in Burnie.' They said, `Isn't that a suburb of Hobart?' Where was the person located that was providing this service to Burnie? In Sydney! There is a range of examples already starting to emerge to suggest that this will turn into a national disgrace.</para><para>Senator Chapman said that employers were happy about the new service being provided by Employment National. An article appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 11 May that would tend to suggest otherwise. It referred to the experiences of a Mr Richard Bullock, who runs a restaurant in Lane Cove in Sydney. He said that over the years—free of charge—the CES would provide a list of unemployed candidates from which he could 
 pick workers for his Lane Cove restaurant. The article states:</para><para>So when Mr Bullock called Chatswood CES recently looking for a kitchenhand, he was surprised to find that not only did the CES no longer exist—but its replacement, Employment National, wanted to charge $250 to send him the resumes of three suitable candidates.</para><para>And if he wanted a `fully-screened' prospective employee, he would have to pay $800.</para><para>It was a case of welcome to the user-pays, deregulated employment market, Mr Bullock said.</para><para>He went on to say:</para><para>"They have taken away a source of employees for employers which worked extremely well. Some of my best employees have been long-term unemployed people the CES found."</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>The changes have angered small businessmen such as Mr Bullock, who said that a free service that encouraged employers to take on workers—especially the long-term unemployed—had disappeared.</para><para>A spokesman for Employment National said the services that were provided through the CES were no longer available but that there was no fee for an employer simply to lodge notice of a vacancy.</para><para>Well done!

They do not appear to exist because they all seem to be very focused on earning a buck. Those comments of Mr Bullock are very important in understanding the dimension of this problem; the dimension that you people on the other side of this chamber have created in terms of the capacity of unemployed people to get into jobs and into jobs quickly—because Mr Bullock, as far we know, is not a supporter of the Labor Party but a very committed supporter of the Liberal Party.

What we found was no anecdotal evidence of a disgrace, it was an actual disgrace; it was outrageous; and, if Senator Crowley was here, it certainly lacked compassion and you could describe it as a total disaster. We had hundreds of thousands of our young people with no jobs, no job prospects, churned through make-work job schemes. Working Nation could not have been worse named if you had sat down and thought about the name for a week.</para><para>We gave those young people a clear message: they did not need to get out of bed, they did not need to get off the couch, they did not need to leave the video shop or the television screen. They had no prospects at all. They had no chance of getting work and they knew it. The previous government did nothing to address the concerns of those young people. Many of them, I am sad to say, were in my own state of South Australia, and the ongoing evidence of the disaster created by some of those policies was brought before the committee that I also have the privilege to serve on, which Senator Tierney referred to earlier in this place.</para><para>What we have tried to do, in giving these young people a chance to get some work, is to create job opportunities in a different form. Let us just have a look at what we have offered: of the 310 Job Network organisations, 148 are private, 143 are community and 19 are government—including of course the federal government owned Employment National. The benefits for job seekers and employers under the Job Network include access to more than 1,400 Job Network sites 
 across this country—more than four times the 296 CES sites that were previously available. Thousands of extra job vacancies will be on the touch screens at the Centrelink offices, when the CES in fact had only 20 per cent of all job vacancies. What we are trying to do in providing these opportunities is to give those young people who choose not to go on to university a chance to find a real job—a chance to be educated and then have some job opportunities.</para><para>When I looked at the alternative opportunity that the Labor Party in government would offer as part of their education policy, I was very interested to note a description offered by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, in its editorial of just a day or so ago, that it was `a threadbare offering that lacks much merit.' So what was this other opportunity? It was yet another round table, a policy review. As I calculate it now, that makes four: an education round table, a native title round table, a tax round table and a waterfront round table. This is going to be some sort of a table; it is going to be a very big table; there are going to be lots of little round knees under it. People will be sitting on little round chairs, talking empty words and trying to address the disgraceful problems that were left to this government when we took office: the problem of the Native Title Act, the problem of an antiquated tax system, the disgraceful problem on the waterfront, and now the difficulties that we are having in trying to find jobs for those thousands of young people who were without work at the time when we came to office. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>3080</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10001</name.id><name role="metadata">CLERK ASSISTANT</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Landmines</title><page.no>3080</page.no><no.signed>7</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>TW4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Bourne</name><name> Sen Vicki</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled.</para><para>The Petition of the undersigned draws to the attention of the Senate the Australian Government's hesitation in signing the Ottawa Treaty to ban the production, sale, stockpiling, transfer and use of landmines.

The Minister for Workplace Relations and the Prime Minister boastfully confirmed their support for what can only be described as a corporate `scam' by Patrick to sack its workforce.</para><para>This government schemed with Patricks to break its own workplace relations act, in actions that 10 out of 11 judges found to be arguably illegal. 
</para><para>By this government's actions it has created an unprecedented sense of job insecurity amongst Australians and has allowed a dubious employer to evade the law and, in fact, to become a law unto itself.</para><para>The Labor Party will not be a party to this laissez-faire, "leave it to the market" approach to industrial relations.</para><para>The Labor Party will not abrogate its responsibility to Australian families and we will not stand by and watch this government threaten workers' job security.</para><para>The government's spin doctors have tried to ameliorate the community outrage by saying that the Patrick's circumstances are unique. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!</para><para>It can happen again and with this compliant and supportive government, it is likely to do so.</para><para>This bill, Madam President, is to ensure that workers are protected from these sorts of scams and that workers are given a measure of job security.</para><para>The bill explicitly addresses the circumstances of the corporate scam Patrick engaged in when it sacked its workforce.</para><para>For the benefit of the Coalition, I will now highlight the exact nature of Patrick's scam, as it appears that they have up to now been either unable or unwilling to grasp the pervasive implications of these actions.</para><para>The scam originated in the Minister's Department. Mr Derren Gillespie, in a minute to the Minister, told Mr Reith that the entire workforce had to be dismissed. The next step was Mr Corrigan's. He orchestrated a corporate structure which accommodated this.</para><para>The Patrick companies that employed the labour within the Patrick group were stripped of their assets. Most of these assets went upstream to other companies in the Patrick Group.</para><para>The only significant asset left with the Patrick employing companies was a contract to supply labour to the rest of the Patrick group. This had a provision, which the administrators described in their report as onerous, providing that if there was any interruption in the supply of labour by, for example, industrial action, the Patrick group could terminate the labour hire contract and obtain their labour from other sources.</para><para>These changes in the Patrick corporate structure were made without the knowledge of the workforce.</para><para>The workers did not know that they were actually employed by companies that were little more than $2 companies. The workers did not know that the 
 company's contract to supply labour to the Patrick group could be terminated on such easy grounds.</para><para>I will remind senators of the circumstances when Patrick `terminated' their entire workforce of 1,400 workers. I quote from the Herald Sun (9/4/98):</para><para>"Patrick Stevedoring Company's clandestine sacking of 1400 waterside workers is a tragedy . . . </para><para>It is a sad when confrontation reaches the point where one side regards dismissal enforced by savage dogs and anonymous security guards as the only way forward . . . </para><para>This brings a new dimension to industrial relations in this country."</para><para>The editorial went on to say:</para><para>". . . the reaction of Mr Reith and the Prime Minister, John Howard, makes it clear that the government was involved in the strategy which led to the sackings. So much so, that it immediately committed itself to putting up $250 million so Patrick can make redundancy payments to its sacked workers."</para><para>The image of masked security guards and savage dogs is an image foreign to Australians and it is an image that will not be easily forgotten by the Australian community, I can assure you.</para><para>Patrick relied on this new structure to sack its workforce. The Patrick group determined that grounds had been made out to terminate the labour hire contracts with the Patrick employing companies, and those contracts were terminated. The Patrick group then determined that they were free to hire labour from other sources—which they did, hiring labour from the National Farmers' Federation Company, P&amp;C Stevedores.</para><para>At the same time the Patrick employing companies were placed in receivership, having lost their only significant asset—the contract to supply labour to the Patrick group.</para><para>The employees of the Patrick labour hire companies were, as a result, left without their two most important rights:</para><para>1.	 Any claims for accrued entitlements—like annual leave and sick pay, redundancy pay, and long service leave—could only be made against their direct employer, the $2 Patrick labour hire companies, now in receivership.</para><para>2.	 Their right to be protected against unlawful termination was rendered meaningless.</para><para>The workers could only be reinstated to their direct employer—the Patrick employing companies—but those companies were in receivership, and, in any event, the Patrick Group would be under no obligation to take labour from those companies. 
</para><para>A reinstatement order is therefore of no practical effect, even though the workers were sacked illegally, because they were union members. This is a clear breach of the workplace relations provisions concerning freedom of association.</para><para>The Prime Minister confessed on `A Current Affair' that the reason why the entire Patrick workforce was dismissed, was because "they're all part of the one union". He went on to say:</para><para>"One of the consequences of having a bargaining monopoly, ruthlessly used in the hands of the union that won't listen to reason, is that some innocent people get affected."</para><para>This is clearly unlawful and I will remind the senators opposite of what the Workplace Relations Act says in this regard. Subsection 170CK(2), states, in part:</para><para>". . . . An employer must not terminate an employee's employment for any one or more of the following reasons, . . . ."</para><para>And one of the reasons stated is:</para><para>"(b) trade union membership or participation in trade union activities outside working hours or, with the employer's consent, during working hours;"</para><para>As I said before, the government has tried to say that the circumstances of the Patrick corporate scam were unique. That is just plain wrong.</para><para>Any corporate group could organise their structure so that employees are employed by internal labour hire company, with a tenuous agreement to supply labour to the rest of the group.</para><para>Indeed, many corporate groups, for quite legitimate reasons, already have separate companies within the group that employ the labour, just as separate companies own the assets, own the land, hold the debt, or hold the tax losses. A corporate group could easily alter this structure so that they could do what Patrick did.</para><para>Any employee who is employed in this sort of structure is effectively without any job security.</para><para>They still have a legal entitlement to redundancy pay, long service leave, accrued holiday and sick pay, but that is only enforceable against a company which is only a $2 company. There will be no assets to provide these entitlements on termination. So, in actuality they stand to lose all their entitlements.</para><para>Employees have a legal right not to be sacked illegally, but any reinstatement order is only enforceable against the direct employer, which may not have work to provide to the employees.</para><para>This is why our bill is so important. 
</para><para>The Patrick scam could happen to anyone. Any employee could be left without an effective means of getting reinstated to their job, or getting their accrued legal entitlements.</para><para>This bill ensures that this cannot happen again. It gives employees a measure of job security.</para><para>It does so by making amendments to both the Workplace Relations Act and the Corporations Law.</para><para>I will now briefly describe our intention. The two amendments to the Workplace Relations Act are as follows:</para><para>.	 First, section 170JI of the bill, allows the Court or Commission, when it finds that an employee has been unlawfully or unfairly dismissed and should be reinstated, to make the reinstatement order against companies that are related to the direct employer. At present reinstatement can only be ordered against the direct employer itself.</para><para>.	 The Court or Commission can make a reinstatement order against a related company if it deems it just to do so.</para><para>.	 The matters to which the Court or Commission will have regard are:</para><para>.	 the extent to which reinstatement of the employee by the direct employer is impractical because the employer is in receivership or is in the course of being wound up;</para><para>.	 the extent to which the related company took part in the management of the direct employer;</para><para>.	 the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the receivership or to the winding up of the direct employer are attributable to the actions of the related company; and</para><para>.	 any other relevant matters.</para><para>The Court or Commission will also have an associated power to make any other orders that are necessary to give practical effect to the reinstatement order.</para><para>In the Patrick's situation, this provision would have permitted the Court to make an order reinstating the sacked employees to other companies in the Patrick group. The various requirements would have been easily satisfied because:</para><para>.	 reinstatement to the Patrick labour hire companies would be impractical because those companies were in receivership;</para><para>.	 clearly the Patrick group played a substantial part in the management of the Patrick employing companies;</para><para>.	 the circumstances which gave rise to the receivership of the Patrick employing companies were clearly attributable to the actions of the Patrick 
 group—it was they who orchestrated the corporate scam which lead to the companies being in receivership.</para><para>This provision will therefore ensure that companies can not use the Patrick corporate scam to leave their workers without any effective remedy against unfair and unlawful termination.</para><para>Secondly, section 178A of the bill allows employees to claim accrued legal entitlements against a related company of their direct employer in certain circumstances.</para><para>The related company will be liable for the payment of any legal entitlements of unpaid employees in the following circumstances:</para><para>.	 the related company has entered into a contract for the carrying out of work for or on its behalf the direct employer, including a contract or arrangement to hire labour from the employer;</para><para>.	 the direct employer has contracted to undertake work for or on behalf of the related company, including the provision of labour services to the related company;</para><para>.	 the work is carried out in connection with a business undertaking of the related company;</para><para>.	 the relevant employees are, or at the time of the non payment were, subject to an award, an order of the Commission, a certified agreement or an Australian workplace agreement.</para><para>It is worth noting that these provisions are based on the successful precedent of section 127 of the NSW Industrial Relations Act 1996.</para><para>In the Patrick's situation, this provision would make the Patrick group of companies liable for the accrued legal entitlements of the employees of the Patrick employing companies. The requirements would have been easily satisfied:</para><para>.	 the Patrick group and the Patrick employing companies entered into contracts for the hire of labour from those companies to the group;</para><para>.	 the work under the contracts was carried out in connection with the stevedoring undertaking of the group;</para><para>.	 the employees were, at the time of non-payment, subject to an award and a certified agreement.</para><para>So this provision ensures that, in future, company groups will not be able to escape liability for accrued legal entitlements by leaving employees employed by $2 companies that go into receivership. In these circumstances, the group of companies will be liable for payment.</para><para>The two amendments to the Corporations Act are as follows.</para><para>First, Division 6A of the bill, provides that, where a company is in receivership, the Court can make an order requiring a related company to pay the 
 debts of the other company, including debts owed to employees, like accrued entitlements.</para><para>This amendment is basically for the same purpose, and is substantially to the same effect as, the new section 178A of the Workplace Relations Act. It is included for abundant caution, to ensure that both acts recognise the liability of related companies for accrued legal entitlements of employees.</para><para>The requirements for liability of the related company in this case are also somewhat different.</para><para>The matters which the Court will take into account in determining whether to make an order are as follows:</para><para>.	 the extent to which the related company took part in the management of the employer;</para><para>.	 the conduct of the related company towards the creditors of the company generally and to the creditor to which the debt or liability relates—ie, the employees;</para><para>.	 the extent to which the circumstances that gave rise to the winding up of the employer are attributable to the actions of the related company; and</para><para>.	 any other relevant matters.</para><para>Again, this provision will give greater security to employees in relation to their accrued legal entitlements.</para><para>Secondly, amended section 1317HD of the Corporations Law, will give creditors the right to bring proceedings for the recovery of debts against directors of companies acting in contravention of the Corporations Law.</para><para>At present, only the company, usually the liquidator or receiver, has this right.</para><para>Under this provision, creditors such as employees will be given the right.</para><para>In the Patrick's case, it would mean that the employees of the Patrick companies, not just the receivers, would have the right to sue Chris Corrigan and the other Patrick directors for debts arising from breaches by them of the Corporations Law.</para><para>It is ironic, that while this government was scheming with Patricks to illegally sack workers and rushing in to provide $250 million in redundancy payments, it was publicly condemning the actions in Cobar. Yet, when the Cobar miners who have lost their jobs and their entitlements ask the government for a $9 million loan to fund their redundancies, no money was forthcoming. This is hypocrisy at its finest.</para><para>I noticed that the Prime Minister has finally realised that security is a vital issue to Australians, despite the Minister for Workplace Relations claiming it is not of great concern to workers. 
</para><para>No amount of promises or weasel words will enable the government to persuade the Australian people that their jobs are safe from this sort of scam. Only action will help redress the wrong this government has committed.</para><para>This action must start with supporting the Employment Security Bill 1998 which will protect workers from Patrick-style corporate scams.</para><para>The Prime Minister has thus far supported Patrick in the illegal sacking of its workforce.</para><para>The Prime Minister has shown the Australian people that the law is only binding on certain sections of the community, that is, unions.</para><para>The Prime Minister has shown himself to be a partisan participant in the attempt to deny Australian workers the protections afforded to them by law.</para><para>The Prime Minister now has an opportunity to show the Australian community that he is committed to job security by supporting this bill.</para><para>If this support is not forthcoming, the Australian people can safely assume that the Prime Minister's "Triple S" pledges actually mean: `security' guards, `security' dogs and `security' fences.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Calvert</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>INDONESIA</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>3088</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline>) proposed:</para><para>That the Senate—</para><para>(a)	 views Indonesia's leadership succession as the beginning rather than the end of a process of change and reform needed to create political and economic stability based on the full participation of the Indonesian people and on respect for human rights;</para><para>(b)	 calls on the Indonesian Government to adopt Amnesty International's agenda for human rights reform, and in particular its call for:</para><para>	 (i)	 the immediate release of all political prisoners in Indonesia and East Timor,</para><para>	 (ii)	 a public commission of inquiry into recent killings and disappearances in Indonesia,</para><para>	 (iii)	 ensuring the independence of Komnas Ham, the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights, to investigate cases of killing and disappearance and allow it to act on its findings,</para><para>	 (iv)	 the repeal of the anti-subversion law and the articles of its criminal code which are used to repress and detain political activists, and

There is an opportunity to debate matters of general business on a Thursday. The practice used to be that attempts to suspend standing orders in order to bring on general business notices of motion were a rarity. They have become commonplace. The consequence of that of course is that government business time is lost. I am not arguing the right of Senator  Colston to raise a matter that is of concern to him, but I am suggesting that it should not take the place of other business of the Senate. Therefore he should have his opportunity to call it on, as a matter of general business, on a Thursday in the way in which business used to be done. I presume, consistent with that philosophy, that this opposition has an arrangement whereby Independents and minority parties are given a fair share of the occasions on Thursdays for such debate. We believe that is the appropriate time for it.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>3092</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Labor Party, the opposition in the Senate, will oppose the suspension of standing orders. I would like to point out to you, Madam President, and to the Senate, that we consider this motion to be a case of one 
 utterly discredited Queensland politician—that is, Senator Colston—trying to discredit another utterly discredited Queensland politician—that is, Pauline Hanson. As far as the members of the opposition in the Senate are concerned, we will have no part of this grubby and absurd political exercise.</para></talk.start><para>The truth of the matter is that Labor's record in relation to Pauline Hanson has been clear, principled and unwavering. It stands in stark contrast to what we have seen from the Liberal Party since Ms Hanson first became prominent in Australian politics. In relation to the issue of preferences, the Labor Party has categorically made its position absolutely clear. That is a position from which we have not wavered for a very long period of time.</para><para>In fact, as early as October 1996, when the inherent threats of One Nation to Australia's stable and multicultural society and economy were apparent, the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, Gary Gray, stated on the Channel 9 <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program that we, the Australian Labor Party, would put One Nation last on our how-to-vote ticket. I might say, by the way, that so did Mr Andrew Robb, the then federal director of the Liberal Party. Remember that it was the Labor Party that sponsored, negotiated and supported a bipartisan motion in this parliament against racial intolerance, a motion which was in response to the national and international outrage over the member for Oxley, and we will have no part in this action taken in this chamber by someone as discredited as Senator Colston.</para><para>We consider Senator Colston's actions also to be unprincipled, reprehensible and venal and we are not going to see the Labor Party associated in any way with any move or any exercise in which he tries to attempt to grandstand and claw back some of his lost status, standing and image in the community. We will have no part of it, and of course we also know that events have superseded the rhetoric that is contained in Senator Colston's motion.</para><para>In the Queensland election, where the Liberal Party and the National Party are tying themselves in knots over the issue of preferences from the One Nation Party, Labor's position has been clear for a very long period

Given the focus of this motion, and particularly its focus on the One Nation Party, this is something that is particularly relevant to my own state of Queensland. The outcome of the Queensland state election is very important for Queensland's future, just as will be its potential flow-on effects for the federal election, particularly again in terms of representation for some of the federal seats in Queensland.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So this is an urgent matter. It is important that the Senate does have an opportunity during this week to express a view on this motion put forward by Senator Colston, because this will be the last time that all senators are able to be put on the record in relation to their views on the issues put forward.</para><para>In that regard—and one would have thought this would go without saying but, given the remarks made by the ALP, obviously it does need to be said—in voting and expressing a view on a motion, one should do so in relation to the actual wording of the motion. To try to avoid taking a position on a motion simply because there is dislike for its mover, I find, is disingenuous, to say the least, and inappropriate. The ALP have indicated that they support the motion's wording and, therefore, I believe they should allow themselves to be placed on the record in relation to the motion as it stands, rather than to try to dodge it because they do not like the person who has moved it.</para><para>I think the issue of preferences and the preference recommendations of all parties on the how-to-vote cards in the Queensland election will be crucial. I should place on the record that the Democrats long ago indicated 
 that they will be placing One Nation last on all their how-to-vote cards. That decision was made by our state council many, many months ago at a state council meeting in Ipswich, by coincidence. That is something we have stayed solidly firm on since that time.</para><para>Because of the optional preferential system that operates in Queensland, it is important that all parties give a commitment not simply to try to ignore One Nation or take a non-committal stand on it, but that they actually commit themselves specifically to putting One Nation candidates last. The option is open there for all parties simply to have a how-to-vote card that shows a single first preference and leaves all the other options. In that circumstance, it provides an opportunity for a de facto first-past-the-post contest to eventuate.</para><para>In that circumstance, those areas, those few seats that have been given some focus as being ones where there is a high One Nation Party vote—and they are seats similar to those that in the past have pulled high votes for other extreme right wing parties, such as the Confederate Action Party and the Citizens Electoral Council which unfortunately do have some ongoing support base in Queensland—once again quite probably these will pull a reasonable vote for One Nation. If the circumstance is allowed to develop where a de facto first-past-the-post contest does occur, that will give those people a much greater chance than they have had in the past of gaining a seat in the Queensland parliament.</para><para>For those reasons, it is crucial that parties do not simply commit to not allocating preference towards One Nation but that they specifically commit to preference against One Nation and put One Nation last, as the Democrats have indicated they are going to do.</para><para>For that reason, it is important that all parties go on the record about this. We will see soon enough with the how-to-vote cards that are issued over the next few days in Queensland what will happen in that regard. But, if all parties were to do that, it would enable us all to finally focus on some policies in the Queensland election. Unfortunately, 
 there has not been much of that to date because of the focus on the novelty of One Nation's performance.</para><para>The fact is that, if all other parties commit themselves to putting One Nation last, One Nation has no chance of winning a seat. That is why this is a crucial matter for the future of my state of Queensland. Also, it is potentially a future matter for Queensland because I am sure that all senators agree on how divisive and dangerous One Nation's policies are. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>3096</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, this matter is so urgent that it was put off yesterday—which will give you an idea of the urgency of it.

Functions of the Council include coordination of strategic policy at the national level and negotiation and development of national agreements on shared objectives and interests in the Council's areas of responsibility.

Effectively, they have had just under 12 months to prepare a reply, and they exceeded the normal three-month deadline by some nine months. In that time, they have come up with a startling revelation: that the concerns and the issues raised by the Senate committee on fees and charges being made by schools across this nation are in fact the responsibility of the states. They have attempted to dismiss the concerns of many hundreds of thousands of Australians by buckpassing this issue to the states.</para><para>This government tries to present to the Senate, in this most inadequate and totally unresponsive manner, its views which should best be summed up as `referring it to someone else to deal with', to basically pass it off to other people; to suggest that the volume of evidence presented by the Senate committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated; and to maintain the great myth, the great lie that this government seeks to assert, that it is maintain 
 ing its commitment to public education in this country.</para><para>The committee report demonstrated, over and over again, the substantial concern of many hundreds of thousands of Australians that the level of support by public education authorities is declining; that in recent years we have seen a devolution of responsibility to schools and, as a consequence, more and more, there is an expectation by governments that it is not governments' responsibility to take care of the legitimate concerns for the educational needs of this country, but that it is for individual parents to meet the funding shortfalls that arise from government policy decisions to reduce government expenditure.</para><para>The Liberal's own National Commission of Audit demonstrated that there was a decline in the level of government spending on school education. Expenditure by all levels of government on schools rose by 2.8 per cent of GDP throughout the 1970s; in the 1980s it rose by a slightly greater amount, but it declined under this government. During the period that this government has been in office, public education support has seen a massive reduction.</para><para>The government tries to maintain that it is increasing its spending, but the lie was revealed in an answer to a question in the estimates committee. In real terms, in the amounts of money actually being spent, in real dollars that are available for the education of the children of this nation, there has been a substantial decline in public support by the governments of this country. Answer to question No. 52 before the Senate education committee demonstrates in real terms that, in 1995-96, $1.338 billion was spent on government education, by this year the figure had fallen to $1.335 billion and in 1998-99 it will fall to $1.318 billion.</para><para>Those figures are quite clear, they are official statistics, yet this government seeks to maintain the lie that it is maintaining its level  of commitment to public education. It seeks to include the additional funds that would normally be applied for inflation or additional students enrolled in the system in the money spent; it does not acknowledge that it is 
 reducing the money spent on public education in real dollar terms.</para><para>The Victorian Commission of Audit demonstrated that, in Victoria today, between six and seven per cent of total education revenue is now being raised by parents at a local level; that is, $155 million is coming out of the pockets of parents as a result of so-called voluntary fees and charges. It is not just that people are being expected to put in a bit extra to fund their child's education, the fact remains that not all parents have equal access to money, not all parents have equal access to opportunity. But what you are seeing under this government is a reduction in the level of opportunity, a reduction in the level of real choice being made available to those who seek to use the public education system.</para><para>The Victorian Auditor-General demonstrated that 16.9 per cent of non-staff school operating costs was raised as a result of fees and charges being levelled by government schools in Victoria. This is a long way from the claims made in this shonky response that this government has presented to this Senate today, which says that there were `unsubstantiated allegations'—not unsubstantiated to the National Commission of Audit, not unsubstantiated to the Victorian Auditor-General. A number of submissions to the committee demonstrated that the real cost to parents of sending their children to government schools is now in the range of 33 to 70 per cent of the non-staff school operating costs as a result of the government cutbacks in that state. Again and again, you see the parents and teachers highlighting to the public that it is not just a question of people not having the capacity to pay.</para><para>Substantial educational issues follow from that. It has been demonstrated again and again that individual children of families who cannot pay these voluntary contributions—these so-called voluntary levies and charges—through various acts of what I would call humiliation, are being embarrassed and their educational opportunities in our schools diminished. Such examples include the withholding of academic reports; the barring of students from graduation ceremonies and other functions; the withholding of education 
 al material such as photocopied handouts; the marking of students as absent so that Austudy and Abstudy payments cease; the linking of student enrolment or re-enrolment to the payment of levies; the sending out of accounts for payments of levies; the use of debt collectors on children in this country; the failure to provide school diaries to students; and the removal of various state government support payments—the school card provisions, for instance, in South Australia.</para><para>We see the denying of the use of books, the refusing of students access to computers and library; the refusal to allow students whose voluntary contributions have not been paid to attend excursions or camps; the withdrawal of curriculum materials from woodwork, cooking or photography classes and so on.</para><para>What the committee demonstrated, again and again, is the use of illicit and, I think, deeply ingrained attempts to humiliate students and force these so-called voluntary payments. The concerns that are raised by the committee go much further than just the question of educational opportunity; they go to some really basic questions about the level of civil rights within the schools in our system.</para><para>This is a situation that is becoming more and more intense as a result of the declining levels of financial support by governments for public education in this country and a retreat by governments from what was once accepted as the universal notion of the right of all children to enjoy access to high quality public education.</para><para>What you have seen is a rapid growth in the use of levies and charges to make up for the shortfalls in funding that are the result of these government policies. What you are seeing is an increasing use of practices by schools to conceal the so-called voluntary nature of these charges and to engage in what can only be described as bullying and heavy-handed tactics to enforce payment.</para><para>What you have here is a Commonwealth government that does not care. It is essentially a Commonwealth government dedicated to the promotion of an elitist view of education—a 
 notion of education that is essentially a 1950s idea—that those who have plenty of money can go to elite schools to enjoy the exclusive conditions of those elite schools and those are the ones who do well in our society. Those who do not have access to large sums of money and do not have access to large sums of disposable cash miss out on educational opportunity.

What he is doing is totally misrepresenting evidence. What he is making out to be hard evidence on this matter in reality is just anecdotal evidence. The committee was enormously frustrated in terms of getting any sort of clear picture of what was happening, purely on the basis of a lack of evidence.</para></talk.start><para>Let us look at what is happening broadly in the school system in this country in relation to funding levels. What we have had over a very long period of time is increasing expectations of parents as to what schools should provide. That is fine; we have no problem with that. The difficulty is with finding enough public money to fund such a proposition. Senator Carr makes out that this is a new problem but it is not a new problem, Senator Carr, as you realise. If you look at the minority report you will see a quote going back to the Schools Commission in the early 1980s. It raised a lot of the problems that you are raising in relation to there not being enough money in public schools. It is quite a reasonable proposition, we feel, that parents of children in these schools contribute something towards their education.</para><para>It is quite surprising, however, to find that, far from there being a shortage of public money in education in our public schools, in the case of New South Wales there is an absolutely massive surplus. Let us find out where that is. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> article of 16 April—and as Senator Carr realises, our report was brought down in July last year so we have only the benefit of hindsight with this information; but it makes very interesting reading—lists the funds in reserve that public schools have in the high schools of New South Wales. Senator Carr, it 
 lists all 250 high schools. It has beside it the balances of those high schools.</para><para>We find, for example, that Bossley Park High—not exactly in your North Shore area of Sydney—has reserves of over $1 million. We find that Goulburn High School has $620,000. We can go through a number of areas in the western suburbs of Sydney: Blacktown High School has $250,000; Liverpool High has $340,000; Tempe High School, which is near the centre of Sydney and has some of the poorer suburbs nearby, has $283,000; Wollongong High, in the steel belt, has $219,000; and Young High School has $432,000.</para><para>I found your figure for Victoria interesting, Senator Carr, when you said that parents were asked to chip in $155 million. I do not see any great problem with that: if you divide it by the number of school pupils it is not a huge amount of money. In comparison, in New South Wales, if you look at the total of what I have been talking about—and remember your Victorian figure was $155 million—reserves in New South Wales high schools are $285 million. That is just in the high schools, not primary schools—and that money is sitting there at the moment. It is a matter of great concern to the department's general manager of finance, Ken Dixon. He says that funds allocated to schools are to be expended in general in the year of allocation.</para><para>Senator Carr, you really have to answer this question: if there is such a shortage of funding in public schools, how come they can build up a quarter of a billion dollars in reserves in the state of New South Wales? It is good housekeeping, I am sure, but it does not really paint the poor picture that you are trying to put up.</para><para>The report that was brought down had dissent from the government senators. What we discovered, in listening to the evidence around the country, was that the extra funding of private money in public schools was not significant and that it came in two parts: sponsorships and fees and charges. We found  that in fees and charges these levels were not high and in many states, and in a vast number of schools, there was the opportunity for people who could not pay to make other 
 arrangements. Many of the schemes were voluntary in any case. In the case of sponsorships of schools we found that this was an opportunity for many schools—schools always have limited resources; they always have had and always will—to get extra funding from particular organisations.</para><para>We find totally unacceptable the recommendation of the opposition members of the committee that that sort of funding should be used outside the eight key learning areas only. Obviously schools should have the flexibility to use such funding across a much broader area. The idea of central sponsorships with big companies sponsoring events and the resulting funds spread across schools is attractive to us. But we were not drawn to the suggestion of opposition senators that this should be a centrally managed pool of funds.</para><para>The broad implications of what was presented in the report of the opposition members are basically unrealistic on a number of accounts. They are not based on any hard evidence. We really did not see any evidence, apart from a bit of anecdotal evidence—and systems will go wrong in particular places, obviously—that this is widespread across the system. We did not see any evidence that fees are an onerous burden on people. We did see evidence that there are mechanisms in place in most states to do something about that. We did not see evidence that sponsorships are causing that great a problem.</para><para>In summary, the situation in our schools is that there is quite a reasonable level of funding from the public sector. This is demonstrated by the fact that in New South Wales a quarter of a billion dollars of public money has been salted away. The level of fees is not too high. I think most people would agree that it is reasonable for parents who have children at school to contribute something towards their education. This is not a new idea, Senator Carr. Parents have put in contributions over the whole century.</para><para>The idea that absolutely everything should be free—that hospitals should be free, schools should be free and universities should be free—is very much a Whitlamesque type view. I thought we had left that behind in the seventies. We saw the economic disasters 
 when a government overspending approach applied. There is a feeling in the community that in all these areas the public should contribute, and that in particular the people who use these particular services should make some small contribution.</para><para>We found on the evidence that we have—as I have indicated, it is mostly anecdotal—that there is not a high level of this sort of funding in schools. It is not creating a significant problem. In his description today Senator Carr totally misrepresented what was found in the set of hearings. The evidence really is just anecdotal, but he is trying to make out that it is some sort of scientific evidence. We certainly do not have that. This is not a major problem.</para><para>The responsibility for dealing with the matters raised by the committee rests almost entirely with the states.

You are over two years late in providing a response to one of the reports of this committee. I have never found it a persuasive argument to say that, just because you are wrong, it is all right to say, `You're wrong because we were wrong too.' Two wrongs do not correct the fault in your case. If I were you, I would urge your government to respond. This is one of those things that convinces people that we are serious about what we do in this place.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government in its response starts off by saying:</para><para>The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.</para><para>The response is therefore very disappointing. As I heard my colleague Senator Carr say, the response by the federal government to most of the recommendations is, `That is a state and territory matter. We'll have nothing to do with it.' That is not what the community cares for. The community knows that the Commonwealth has a federal education minister who has an overarching responsibility for education services from schools to tertiary institutions in this country. The government has suggested that the minister's interest is of no relevance and that really it should be left to MCEETYA, which is no more than a council 
 of Commonwealth and state officials. It is not a council that actually responds to ministerial guidelines or directly implements policy. It does the work that allows the implementation of policy, but it is not the committee that should be given responsibility for the running of these things.</para><para>It is cavalier of the Commonwealth government to dismiss its own responsibility—and, I might say, to dismiss it in a contradictory fashion, because with some of the recommendations the government is saying, `It is a state and territory matter, and we have no responsibility,' but in other areas it is saying, `The Commonwealth and the states do work together on this.' What we know, and what everybody said in the committee, is that private funding is necessary for our public schools because government funding for public schools is no longer sufficient for the very many demands on those schools.</para><para>It may well be that the money has increased, but the demands on the schools have increased far more, and therefore there is an ever increasing gap between the funding provided to our public schools—charged, I might say, under state education acts to provide a free secular education. That retreat from `free' is causing major concern, and the committee picked up on this concern, because what it says is that in some areas of our community, particularly in what are short-handedly known as the Eastern Suburbs, schools are able to set fees and charges for parents using that school and that, in large part, those parents are able to meet those fees, but that, in many other areas of our country, people simply cannot find the wherewithal to pay those fees and charges.</para><para>Families creep around, embarrassed and afraid for it to be found out that they are not able to afford those fees and charges. There even are specific arrangements to assist families in hardship to get some extra funding from the schools but, once again, a lot of parents are mortified that they should have to register for this kind of assistance. We have actually made a lot of recommendations in the report about doing it so that the privacy and  decency of families are respected. We have state and territory governments and a 
 Commonwealth government which are all committed to providing education for all Australians but which are not, according to this response, committed to funding it. That is grossly insufficient.</para><para>Secondly, we also have that major point that I have just been alluding to, that the need for private funding has led to a gross inequity in the amount of funding going to schools. As I said, schools in the better-off areas are able to set fees and charges and get that extra assistance; schools in those same areas can also much more readily afford the new technology—computers and so on. They are more likely to have parents who can assist the teachers and the schools with getting sponsorship arrangements that also bring more wealth to those schools, while the schools in the so-called Western Suburbs, the tougher areas in our major states and regions, get further and further behind.</para><para>The number of schools that have access to computers in this country makes a very interesting little map, but certainly many of the schools in the western suburbs and in regional and rural Australia, isolated areas, do not have the same access. If time and time again we hear of the need for access to technology so that our children will at least be able to get the new jobs that require that technology and that kind of training and capacity, then what we are doing is simply writing a formula now for all those children to be further behind the eight ball when they leave their schools.</para><para>This is a report that I thought the government might take much more seriously, because it is a thoughtful and considered report and because, as I say, the committee had very many submissions from many people who were very concerned that the cost of education was pricing education out of affordability for many families. Many families told us, for example, that they had to choose between funding their children for special classes or funding their children for trips and tours. Many families could not afford both, and so their children were being dudded out of some of those visits and trips that the school curriculum decides are important. They also have to deal with the fact that their children are 
 very isolated, alienated, if they are not able to participate with all their school chums.</para><para>I find it an interesting thing too that the government seems to be rejecting any recommendation for decent research, for example, about hard data on the actual cost of education. What does it cost to educate a grade 4 pupil in Australia? We do not know. The government accuses us in this response to the report of saying that the evidence was anecdotal and unsubstantiated in many cases. We say that is exactly the case because we have not got the hard data and research, and we recommended that there be such hard data and research—in other words, that the Commonwealth fund that kind of investigation so that we could say in future what it does cost to educate a grade 4, grade 6 or grade 10 pupil, and then we would have a much better idea of what the level of state and Commonwealth assistance ought to be.</para><para>It is interesting that Senator Tierney was so dismissive of this report: `It is anecdotal; we are not going to worry; it is all made up, and parents out there in the community are not complaining about education.' I do not know where Senator Tierney has been, but the parents that I know are complaining. They are very concerned about the cost of education and they are very concerned that they will not be able to get the best for their children. That is what so many parents actually put their effort into. They will work at second and third jobs; both parents will work, and the highest priority for so many of those parents is to make sure their children get a good education. When people can no longer afford a so-called free secular education, it is time for governments very seriously to have a long hard look at this.</para><para>I find it very disappointing that a Commonwealth government education minister should put out a report that says, `It is not my responsibility.' In the past we have seen education ministers from the states brawling with the Commonwealth minister for education. It has had a very bad effect on the status of teachers, it has had a very bad effect on morale and it has had a very bad effect in  terms of sufficient funding for our schools. The state education ministers know that the 
 Commonwealth's involvement in education is particularly to make sure that they do have adequate funding distributed with equity, and that they get support, so that particularly our children from disadvantaged areas who are doing it tough do get that kind of consideration from the Commonwealth. The government response is a very big disappointment, and parents and families of Australia will judge the government very sternly because of it.</para><para>	Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee</title><page.no>3107</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>3107</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>3107</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the government's response to the third report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on two international agreements on tuna, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows</inline>—</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO 3RD REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">TWO INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ON TUNA</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Preamble</inline></para><para>The government has considered the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into the Subsidiary Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan concerning Japanese Tuna Long-line Fishing 1996 and is pleased to provide the following response. The government would like to acknowledge the Committee for preparing a concise and clear report which seeks to address the range of complex issues that arise when considering the Bilateral Agreement. The Committee's recommendations are addressed in turn below.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Bilateral Arrangements</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">1)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with the relevant States, ensures that restrictions placed on either Bilateral vessels or Joint Venture vessels cannot be circumvented by interchange between such arrangements.</inline></para><para>Under the Bilateral Agreement restrictions are placed on the number of vessels that can operate 
 off the west and east coasts of Australia. For example, in the 1996 Bilateral Agreement up to 20 Japanese longline vessels were permitted to operate north of 34o South off the west coast. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) ensures that this number is not exceeded.</para><para>When the joint venture commenced in 1991, joint venture vessels were permitted to operate north of 34o South (S) off the west coast. This was additional to the 40 bilateral vessels which, at that time, were permitted to operate under the Bilateral Agreement. This was raised as a concern, particularly by the Western Australian fishing sector, as potentially all licensed joint venture vessels and the 40 bilateral longline vessels could have operated off the west coast.</para><para>To address this, from November 1994 joint venture vessels were excluded from operations north of 34o S off the west coast. This restriction will remain if a southern bluefin tuna joint venture proceeds in future.</para><para>AFMA has indicated that it has no difficulty in providing scope for any future joint venture vessels to change to a bilateral licence provided the vessel cap negotiated as part of the Bilateral Agreement is not exceeded. This has been the situation since the joint venture was amended in November 1994.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">2)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government reviews the existing arrangements for potential foreign ownership of fishing licences within the Exclusive Economic Zone or Joint Venture arrangements which may jeopardise the potential to manage fish stocks in the Exclusive Economic Zone.</inline></para><para>The issue of foreign ownership is a matter of broad government policy and may, in specific circumstances be referred to the Foreign Investment Review Board. All proposals above certain thresholds need prior approval and therefore need to be notified to the government. Notification thresholds are: over $5 million for acquisitions of substantial interests in existing businesses; $10 million or more for the establishment of new businesses; and $20 million or more for offshore take-overs. The government normally raises no objections to proposals above the notification thresholds where the relevant total assets/total investments is below $50 million.</para><para>However, in this instance the Commonwealth Government has reviewed the existing arrangements for foreign ownership or joint venture arrangements within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and considers that they do not provide for any arrangements which may jeopardise the potential to manage fish stocks in the EEZ. 
</para><para>There is no provision in fisheries legislation providing specific control on foreign ownership of fishing rights. All tuna longline operations within the EEZ are subject to management arrangements administered by AFMA in accordance with the Fisheries Management Act 1991. Domestic longline arrangements apply to Australian boats, and these are developed by AFMA in conjunction with the appropriate fisheries Management Advisory Committee (MAC). This means that operators, including foreigners, who may own Australian boats and licences are subject to the same management arrangements.</para><para>Japanese vessels are the only foreign flag operators which have been permitted in recent years to longline for tuna in the EEZ either under a government to government agreement (Bilateral Agreement) or through the joint venture (which requires an agreement with the Commonwealth, through AFMA).</para><para>Both the Bilateral and joint venture agreements specify stringent terms and conditions under which Japanese longline vessels can operate. The terms and conditions are more restrictive than those applying to domestic operators. All foreign operators are licensed and are subject to conditions such as inspections, observer coverage, vessel monitoring systems and are generally restricted to waters where there is limited domestic activity.</para><para>The government believes the arrangements outlined above support and strengthen AFMA's ability to sustainably manage Australia's fish stocks.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">3)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the subsidiary agreement on long-line tuna fishing with Japan be for a timeframe of at least two years.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Government agrees that there would be benefits in moving towards a longer term agreement, including administrative savings, a better planning environment and a more appropriate timeframe within which to address complex issues. However, the government believes that important external issues such as the setting of annual national catch allocations by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), domestic management arrangements, environmental perturbations and economic changes may erode the extent of such benefits. These issues are dynamic and a flexible approach is required in order that the government is able to respond in a timely manner to the needs of the fishery and to secure the best benefits for Australia (external issues such as those mentioned above may lead to considerable pressure for an annual review of the terms of any multi year agreement, from either Australian or Japanese interests, depending on the circumstances).</para><para>In giving in principle support to multi-year agreements, it will be important to develop a clear 
 framework and schedule to deal with these pressures, including an elaboration of the mechanisms provided for in the current negotiation process, or there may be frequent ad hoc demands to implement mid-term changes to the Agreement. Should any changes to the Agreement be negotiated during a mid-term review process, these changes would be subject to the treaties procedure and be tabled in Parliament. It will be in Australia's interest to minimise the potential for mid-term changes to the Agreement, otherwise it will be unlikely that there would result any decrease in the workload incurred or in the frequency with which matters relating to the Agreement would need to be subject to scrutiny.</para><para>The Commonwealth agrees that a properly constructed multi-year agreement, which takes into account fisheries management needs and recognises that it is essentially a negotiated commercial arrangement, would be beneficial.</para><para>This is particularly the case if multiple year quotas can be agreed in the CCSBT, which would strengthen the case for a multiple year Bilateral Agreement. However, the Commonwealth Government notes that the adoption of such an approach would need whole of government support, including a revision of the way fishing and port access are dealt with, and may also necessitate consideration of alterations to the fee structure and access arrangements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">SBT Certification</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">4)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government raises the issue of the introduction of a certificate system for southern bluefin tuna within the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.</inline></para><para>Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna</para><para>Australia has already sought consideration of a certificate of origin scheme for SBT within the CCSBT regime and within the annual meetings of the tripartite management discussions held prior to the formation of the CCSBT. In 1993, Australia formally proposed a certification system similar to that implemented within the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to be introduced into the SBT fishery. Japan did not support adoption of such a scheme. After being pressed on the issue again in 1994, Japan opposed any attempt to require documentation of SBT trade. Japanese concern reputedly centres on the administrative burden that such a scheme would impose, a concern that Australia shares.</para><para>It should also be noted that a certification scheme, although useful for tracking fish in transit, only achieves its full value if monitored and enforced at 
 the market for the fish. In the case of SBT, the main markets are in Japan. In such a system Japan would carry responsibility for the administration and integrity of the system for imports from all countries. Further, as Japan is not technically importing product from its own vessels' high seas activities, such Japanese catch may fall outside any certification scheme. Also, catches by Korea and Taiwan are increasingly being directed towards their home markets. Within these contexts, Australia will continue to consider ways of introducing a practicable certification scheme.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Indian Ocean Tuna Commission</inline></para><para>The first meeting of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) was held in December 1996. This new organisation has many complex administrative and scientific issues to resolve in developing a strong tuna management regime in the Indian Ocean. Certification schemes are important tools that will need to be examined as part of that management regime. For tunas other than SBT, Australia sees the first step as being the establishment of basic fishery management measures. For SBT, Australia has pressed within the IOTC that the CCSBT has precedence over SBT management wherever the fish occurs. Australia will continue to argue strongly in the IOTC and other relevant forums that a SBT management scheme should be developed and managed within the CCSBT.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Indian Ocean Tuna Commission</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">5)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government:</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">a)	 notes Western Australia's particular interest in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission;</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">b)	 facilitates their participation in the delegation to and any consultations relating to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission where possible.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Government has fully consulted with the Government of Western Australia on IOTC issues and has extended an invitation for the Western Australian Government to participate in Australian delegations to IOTC meetings.

Where possible AFMA attempts to facilitate communication between fishermen to minimise these incidents. Instances of gear conflict in waters adjacent to Tasmania occurred several years ago, when there were 40 joint venture licensed Japanese vessels operating in addition to the 10 vessels licensed through the Bilateral Agreement. The large numbers of Japanese vessels fished co-operatively by allocation of lanes in which to set their longlines. The Australian Tuna Boat Owners Association (ATBOA) prepared guidelines advocating sharing of details of line setting location and time between the Japanese and local domestic. The number of Japanese longliners operating off Tasmania is now markedly reduced and the incidence of gear conflict has been negligible.</para><para>In the period of the last Agreement (1996) there was only one reported instance of gear conflict which was off the NSW coast. In response to this report AFMA immediately notified the Japanese industry indicating that it should maintain a radio watch and communicate with domestic operators to resolve issues. The observers present on the boats operating in the area were advised to facilitate any dialogue. Even though it was only one isolated instance the issue was subsequently raised at the negotiations with the government of Japan when reporting on compliance in the past season. If there was a failure to co-operate, the area of access may be changed, excluding foreign vessels from the areas where gear conflict occurs.</para><para>Japan has complained of alleged gear theft in the east coast fishery, presumably by domestic fishers. AFMA has again attempted to facilitate communications with the Japanese fleet to ensure subsequent investigations are timely and effective, though to date there has been insufficient evidence on which to base conclusive investigations of the allegations.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">8)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government 
 creates, as a matter of national consistency, an exclusion zone for the Bilateral and Joint Venture Japanese long-line fishing vessels around Tasmania of 50 nautical miles.</inline></para><para>The government supports the progressive Australianisation of tuna fisheries, however, it believes that an exclusion to 50 nautical miles (nm) around Tasmania at this time would be premature, especially given current reduced levels of Japanese activity.</para><para>Japanese fishing adjacent to Tasmania brings considerable economic benefit to the State and Commonwealth. The port of Hobart benefits from Japanese access to the AFZ through the use of port facilities, victualling and recreation. Japan has stated previously it cannot accept a 50 nm exclusion adjacent to Tasmania since some high catch rate areas for SBT which attract its vessels to the AFZ are between 20 to 50 nm off Tasmania. A substantial further restriction off Tasmania would jeopardise general bilateral activity and the potential for a future joint venture adjacent to Tasmania, because it is likely that Japanese vessels would choose not to fish the Tasmanian area at all if the 50 nm limit were applied.</para><para>The Commonwealth received $425,000 from Japan in 1997 as a component of the bilateral access fee for enabling a specified number of its vessels to fish for Japanese SBT quota in the AFZ adjacent to Tasmania. In negotiating the 1997 bilateral access arrangements the Commonwealth's approach was, cognisant of the Inquiry's recommendation, to increase the exclusion zone from 12 to 17 nm from the coast. There are important other benefits associated with Japanese access off Tasmania, including data collection on both SBT and seabirds through the AFZ observer programme. The Commonwealth regards this information as vital to its management of SBT and obtaining information on the incidental capture of seabirds including albatross. It also maintains an important link with the high seas activities of the Japanese fleet.</para><para>Japanese activity peaks adjacent to Tasmania during May to July. In 1996 only 10 Japanese boats operated in the area. This is substantially less than previous years due to the cessation of the joint venture and is likely to decrease further in 1997. During the May to July period a maximum of six domestic boats operated in any one month. With such small numbers of vessels the potential for gear conflict appears slight.</para><para>On balance, the government believes its approach in reducing Japanese access from 12 nm to outside 17 nm is appropriate, given the benefits Australia derives from this arrangement, but that this be regularly reviewed in light of the level of Australian activity in waters adjacent to Tasmania.

A paper on the issue was discussed at the July 1997 meeting of the Ministerial Council on Forestry, Fisheries and Aquaculture (MCFFA). The Ministerial Council agreed to give its `in principle' support for day-to-day management of the recreational and charter sectors of Commonwealth-managed fisheries by the States and Northern Territory, noting Queensland's position that jurisdiction for recreational and charter fishing for tunas and billfish should remain under Commonwealth jurisdiction. A revised policy paper concerning recreational and charter fishing will be released by Commonwealth and State agencies for public comment in the first half of 1998.</para><para>The views of the Treaties Committee on recreational and charter boat fishing, along with the concept of optimal utilisation, will be considered in developing the Commonwealth's position on recreational and charter fishing management.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">10)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government undertakes a full assessment of the relative values of the recreational, game and long-line fisheries and their compatibility as a basis for determining the most appropriate management arrangements for the fishery and the degree of access to be allocated to each sector.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth agrees that an assessment of the relative values to the different user groups of the fish resource provides important information to underpin consideration of how to allocate access to the resource in the most efficient and equitable manner. Both the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (through the Fisheries Resources Research Fund (FRRF)) and AFMA have commissioned studies on options for valuing recreational and commercial fishing. These initial studies indicate there are many complex issues which would need to be addressed in a full assessment of practical methods for valuing and allocating access 
 among users. Furthermore, any outcome will likely be contested by one or more of the affected groups.</para><para>One issue relates to the many claims that have been made by the gamefish/recreational sector that the value (in dollar terms) of a billfish to it is far greater than to the commercial fishing sector. There are a range of techniques which could be used to establish values for the different sectors using the bill fish resource, though estimating values is difficult for the charter boat and recreational sectors, and comparing "like with like" presents major challenges. For the longline sector it is relatively simple to establish value through the use of standard production approaches, although an important requirement of establishing values for this sector is that there is provision of accurate information by operators.</para><para>For the charter boat industry, values would be more difficult to establish. Prices for boat charter and capture rates of game fish could be used to calculate a value for this sector. However, the problem with such a calculation is that it would be difficult to separate the proportion of the charter price which is associated with the fish resource, as opposed to a number of other factors. These include the quality of the charter service, whether the operator is charging a fair price and the actual importance of capturing fish to the charterer.</para><para>Establishing values for recreational fishing is probably the most difficult task. If there is market information associated with recreational fishing then this should be identified and considered in the context of the characteristics of the particular type of recreational fishing for which a management decision is to be made. A range of non-market valuation techniques could be used to estimate dollar values for recreational fishing.</para><para>The application of these techniques is usually complicated and there is no assurance that the estimates will be reliable. Further, the Commonwealth notes that, even if dollar values at a given time can be estimated, allocation on the basis of relative value is complicated by the fact that values change over time.</para><para>Finally, the Commonwealth recognises that while relative values in dollar terms are of importance in considering allocation of access, the range of impacts, costs and benefits which cannot be expressed in dollar terms should be taken into account when developing fishery management strategies. For example, relative and cumulative impacts on the status of the marine resource must be considered, in conjunction with estimates of the relative values of fishing by various groups.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">11) 	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government require all Japanese longline vessels fishing in the 
 Exclusive Economic Zone to cut free all marlin (alive or dead), without removal from the ocean.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth has agreed to ban the take of blue and black marlin by commercial fishing operators. The ban will apply to both domestic operators and Japanese tuna longlining vessels operating in the Australian fishing zone under the Subsidiary Agreement. The ban will be effected by the introduction of legislation in early 1998 which requires commercial fishermen to return blue and black marlin to the sea whether dead or alive.</para><para>The Commonwealth recognises the high value placed on blue and black marlin by game fishers in comparison with the commercial catching sector, which regards blue and black marlin as an unintended bycatch. The introduction of the legislation aims to acknowledge these values by establishing an appropriate allocation of resources between the two sectors.</para><para>Under the new legislation, domestic operators may retain as part of the commercial fishery, striped marlin. Japanese vessels will be required to cut free all marlin species caught in the AFZ (alive or dead) without removal from the ocean. In addition, under the bilateral agreement, Japan has agreed that its vessels will not target any billfish (except broadbill swordfish).</para><para>A difficulty with the legislation, particularly in relation to Japanese vessels, is the issue of compliance. Japanese longline boats will have on board in freezer holds high seas' caught marlin from the same stocks which can not be distinguished from `in-zone' catch. These marlin will have been caught outside the AFZ, both from the high seas and neighbouring countries' EEZ's, in areas where there are no restrictions on their retention.</para><para>This problem may be overcome by arranging for the Japanese longline vessels to inform Australian authorities of the amount of marlin on a vessel at the time at which it enters the AFZ. Through random inspections either at sea or during victualling at an Australian port, such information could then be verified.</para><para>Partly in recognition of concerns over Japanese catch of important recreational/charter marlin species, a range of area closures and restrictions on fishing methods have been applied to the Japanese, including exclusion from the East Coast Tuna and Billfish Fishery management area off Cairns, known as Area E, and 50 nm closures off the east and west coasts.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">12)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government undertakes a review of the existing tuna fishing technology to determine if modifications could be made to reduce the bycatch of non-target species.</inline></para><para>The minimisation of the impact of fishing operations on the environment, including non-target 
 species, is a requirement under Objective 3(1)(b) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991.</para><para>From industry's viewpoint, there is a financial interest in maximising the catch of high value target species and avoiding bycatch of non commercial species. A range of collaborative work with industry has been carried out and is planned for the future, including research into fishing practices, development of more selective fishing gear and improved mitigation devices. Environment Australia is also preparing a consultative Threat Abatement Plan which aims to minimise seabird bycatch.</para><para>Research into the reduction of seabird bycatch in tuna longline operations is on-going. The development of tori poles, or bird scaring devices, is a major step forward and an example of what can be developed through co-operative research involving industry operators. Regulations have been put in place to require the use of tori poles by domestic and foreign longline operators south of 30o South latitude. Furthermore the Commonwealth continues to work with industry and researchers on ways to improve bycatch mitigation measures, whether for seabirds or other incidental bycatch.</para><para>In the case of billfish, specifically blue and black marlin, research is under way to determine where in the longline hauling process these species are taken. Preliminary research indicates that blue and black marlin are taken at a shallower depth than the target tuna species (generally bigeye and yellowfin tuna), i.e. during the deployment or hauling of the longline.</para><para>However, to accurately determine longline performance sophisticated electronic equipment (such as hook monitors which measure depth and water temperature) and longline deployment gear (line shooters) are required. The former is not yet commercially available and the latter is quite costly and generally only carried by large vessels dedicated exclusively to tuna fishing. It is anticipated that as the domestic fishery continues to expand, the technology employed by industry to accurately position their longline in the thermocline will be refined and result in cleaner catches of target species.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Port Access</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">13) 	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends the separation of port access from the subsidiary agreement but making port access subject to the continuation of Japan's membership of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and participation in Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth is supportive of a reconsideration of the structure for the Bilateral Agreement, including the option of separating port and fishing access, but in doing so recognises the need to fully assess the implications of any changes proposed. 
</para><para>In developing any alternative arrangement careful consideration needs to be given to ways of securing the management and research funding derived from the current arrangements, as well as the important issues of the longer term financial and other benefits gained by providing Japan with privileged access to our fishing zone. The provision of port access, without effective means to secure Japan's collaboration in effective international monitoring regimes, could work quickly to erode the integrity of the CCSBT and put the full range of benefits we seek to secure for our domestic industry (both fishing and port servicing sectors) at considerable risk.</para><para>The Committee's recommendation recognises the risks that giving unfettered port access to Japanese fishing vessels may lead to adverse impacts on the sustainability of the fish stocks if these vessels fish on the high seas without effective management and regulation. The recent identification of forty Japanese vessels fishing in breach of Japan's domestic fisheries management regulations on the high seas off the south western AFZ has highlighted the realities of this risk.</para><para>To address the risk, the Committee has suggested that any separate port access arrangement must be linked to responsible participation in regional management regimes, such as the CCSBT. The Commonwealth strongly supports this approach, but believes it should go further and deal with a range of related issues not directly addressed in the Committee's report. These include implications for access fees, the incentive to fish in the AFZ, links with the CCSBT and the potential impacts on local fishing and port economies around Australia.</para><para>Notwithstanding these issues, as Australia's domestic tuna fisheries expand, a reduction in Japanese fishing activity in the AFZ is considered likely in the mid to longer term. Under such a scenario, a progressive restructuring of the access arrangement to provide a greater separation of fishing and port access, with strong obligations imposed for co-operation on data and monitoring needs, may suit both countries in the medium term.</para><para>Based on the Committee's recommendation and the additional issues identified above, the government is at present evaluating alternate approaches to providing for both fishing and port access in an administratively simple and effective way while securing the wider range of benefits and realistic returns to Australia.</para><para>Any approach must seek to meet Australia's interests in securing effective co-operation and compliance with responsible regional fisheries management regimes. Matters of importance include the implications for access fees, need to provide for effective monitoring of fishing effort adjacent to the AFZ through surveillance and electronic vessel monitoring systems, high seas 
 observer coverage and in port inspection of fishing vessels entering our ports.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Environmental</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">14)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government formalises a process in which management plans relating to international fishing agreements require a specific written clearance from the Environment Protection Group if they have significant potential environmental impacts.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Government accepts this recommendation and DPIE, AFMA and the Environment Protection Group have held discussions to clarify the way in which the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 may apply to the Subsidiary Agreement and to reach clear understandings on how to deal with potential environmental impacts that may arise from the Subsidiary Agreement.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">15)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Minister responsible for fisheries requests the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to provide all relevant information to the appropriate Commonwealth environment agencies for consideration of issues pertaining to the marine ecosystem.</inline></para><para>The government is committed to ensuring that relevant data collected by, and accessible to, Commonwealth agencies is used in the most productive way, including as a basis for research on the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems in general and on seabirds in particular.

 wealth Employment—Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998.</para><para>This main purpose of the bill is to ensure that the Commonwealth's civilian employees can participate in our choice of funds policy announced in the 1997 Budget. This will give them greater flexibility and control over their superannuation arrangements.</para><para>At present, many Commonwealth employees are tied to membership of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) or the closed Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS). The bill will close the PSS to new members from 1 July 1998 and new employees will be able to choose from superannuation arrangements made available by their employers. My colleague the Minister for Finance and Administration announced on 13 May 1998 that the closure of the PSS and the repeal of the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 would be deferred until 1 July 1999. The Government will be moving a number of requests for amendments to the bill in relation to these matters.</para><para>From 1 July 2000, CSS and PSS members will, if they wish, be able to cease active membership and choose the alternative superannuation arrangements made available by their employers. The bill will provide for the entitlements of CSS members who exercise choice to be based on the resignation deferred benefit, but adjusted to ensure no windfall gains for members or increase in unfunded liabilities.</para><para>The bill will make a number of other amendments to various superannuation acts covering civilian employees. For example, it includes amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 to allow CSS members to transfer amounts held in the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust or other funds to the CSS Fund. It will also amend that act so that reversionary benefits may be paid to a CSS pensioner's spouse or child from a post-retirement relationship with fewer restrictions than currently apply. Similar changes are made in respect of spouses' benefits under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948.</para><para>In addition, the bill provides for modifications to the superannuation redundancy entitlement arrangements for employees who cease to be CSS or PSS members as a result of a sale or outsourcing, in the terms announced in June 1997. In line with the operational date of the new preservation arrangements to apply to the general workforce, the bill will provide for preservation from 1 July 1999 of the employer financed component of a CSS or PSS lump sum superannuation redundancy payment.</para><para>The bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976, with effect from 5 December 1997, to restore its original intention in relation to the acceptance of late elections for preservation of rights. The operation of this provision has been changed 
 progressively by interpretations placed upon it by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court. The changes included in the bill are designed to balance out the interests of the Commonwealth with the interests of current CSS members and former members, who seek to make a late election. Without these changes the Commonwealth could continue to incur costs in the order of $10 million per year.</para><para>Finally, to simplify and streamline the administration of our civilian superannuation arrangements, the bill includes amendments to simplify the operation of relevant legislation and subsequently repeals a number of acts applying to those arrangements. Savings and transitional provisions relating to these repealed acts are included in the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment—Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998 contained in this package. The other bill in the package, the Commonwealth Superannuation Board Bill 1998, will provide for new rationalised administration arrangements for the closed schemes and for the continued administration of the repealed acts by a new Board, the Commonwealth Superannuation Board.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Financial Implications</inline></para><para>This bill will result in a net increase in Budget outlays as a result of increased funding of future superannuation accruals.

The decision as to which fund invests their money seems at present to almost be a random accident of who happens to be their employer. Employees who want to entrust contributions to another fund cannot do so. We believe that this is undemocratic, uncompetitive, unfair and unAustralian. The government's bill brings in our view greater democracy, fairness and competition to Australia's superannuation industry.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Australian Labor Party and the Democrats have put forward detailed alternatives to choice. These alternatives are unacceptable to the government. There are a number of reasons why they are unacceptable but one is paramount—neither the Democrats nor Labor guarantee employees any choice of a superannuation fund at all. The government believes employees should have the right to choose their superannuation fund, just like they have the right to choose their home loan, the sort of car they buy or what political party they vote for. We give employees all these rights, but I have always said that when it is a choice between trade union interests and worker rights it is always easy to see where the Labor Party will come down.</para><para>The government cannot accept choice of fund legislation that does not provide employees with a right to choose.

I totally reject that accusation. One of the frustrating things in dealing with this government and particularly with you, Minister, is that we do not get answers of substance to questions. I put on the record last night seven or eight questions relating to the issue of choice—and, indeed, the rebate issue—and the effect it has on private savings. This is a very important issue which I must say, Senator Kemp, you have done your very best to avoid since becoming a minister. You have done your very best to avoid direct, succinct, accurate and relevant answers to questions in respect of this issue. I reject the issue of filibustering.</para></talk.start><para>I am not going to take up a lot of time but I want to briefly respond to a couple of the other points you made. You made the point in your comments, and you have made it on a number of other occasions, about what is wrong with Australians having the right to 
 choose. Superficially that is a statement of some appeal, but you neglect to acknowledge that, unlike purchasing a house, purchasing insurance or even getting married, superannuation in this country is compulsory. It is compulsory for employees to be members of a superannuation fund. They have to do it. You do not have to buy life insurance, you do not have to buy a house, and you do not even have to get married.</para><para>So we have a system, very similar to Chile's, where it is compulsory to have private superannuation. What you consistently fail to address are the failings of a system such as Chile's. It is a very good working example, with some horrific outcomes, of where superannuation is compulsory. There are very significant flaws in a model that forces choice.</para><para>I would like you at some stage—obviously not in this debate because you are withdrawing schedule 5—to attempt to explain how we are to overcome the problems of a choice model. As well as the problems of inducement and coercion in respect to people being forced into a particular superannuation product, there is the fundamental problem we have in this country of between two million and 2½ million people being functionally illiterate. How on earth are they to sit down with these key feature statements and analyse, in a compulsory superannuation savings environment, what is in their best interests when they cannot even read or write? You can have all the education campaigns in the world, all the television advertising, all the literature going out and people being bombarded with propaganda, but how are they to understand what they cannot read? That is one of the fundamental failures of a full choice regime.</para><para>Even in the United Kingdom, and I gave examples, where people were convinced that choice was good for them, about one million people withdrew from very good superannuation funds to join a model—wrapped in the rhetoric of freedom and choice—imposed on them by the then Thatcher government. Of the one million people who exercised choice, 900,000 of them got ripped off. These were not illiterate people, either. They were teach 
 ers, miners and public servants who could certainly read and write, as I understand it, but they got ripped off to the tune of £10 billion. This is a very good example of the Thatcher government's ideological obsession to impose compulsory choice—a contradiction in terms—and people who were well educated got ripped off.</para><para>The government has not attempted to explain, not only to the Senate but to the Australian people, how people will be better off under a choice regime. What I find most ironic, if not obnoxious, Senator Kemp, in your government's approach to its argument on choice is that when employers kicked up about the choice model, you backtracked. Employers did not want full freedom of choice. Employers did not want the employee to have the ability to say, `I want my superannuation paid into my particular fund' because employers feared the administrative difficulties that would emerge. Theoretically, if employers employ 100 different people, they would have to pay superannuation into 100 different funds.</para><para>When the employers pressured you and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, you quickly backtracked. You put a veto on choice, and the veto is: if the employer does not agree, there is no choice. You know that the employers were very concerned about the administrative difficulties of paying into a multitude of different funds on employee demand. So the very model that you were offering—in the guise of freedom and choice and the other rhetoric you surround it with—is in fact employer choice.</para><para>I am gravely disappointed, Senator Kemp. The ongoing debate about superannuation has convinced Labor that, where an employee wants to opt out of a particular fund and it is administratively convenient for an employer, and the employee and the employer mutually agree—this is your approach—at a workplace, that is not a bad thing. This is reflected in the Labor amendments. So it is a grave disappointment to me that you have got uptight and upset. The numbers do not look good for you, although we will see how the cards fall in the Senate. But you have started pouting and blowing out your bottom lip.</para><para>We want this debate on choice. We want debate on the amendments that Labor is proposing that provide fundamental employee choice—worker rights. We welcome that debate, and we want to see our amendments, which improve your choice model, passed by this Senate. We are very gravely disappointed that, in your fit of pique, you have withdrawn it. That is a grave disappointment. But we would still like answers to the questions that were posed last night by me and my colleagues Senator Conroy and Senator Hogg. I think they were very relevant questions for this debate.</para><para>I will conclude by saying that this issue of employee choice of superannuation, which is effectively the deregulation of the retail market, is one of the most radical prescriptions—economic changes, fundamental changes—that your government has proposed. We will agree on that, I suspect. It is one of the most radical changes, that will affect millions of Australians. The overriding principle must be: will it generate a higher retirement income for Australians who have superannuation? That is the overwhelming principle. It is not whether it is in the best interests of banks, life agents, the money markets, financial managers or life companies. It is what is in the best interests of Australian consumers, millions of Australians who have superannuation, and fundamentally your model fails the test.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>3122</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, can I thank Senator Kemp for withdrawing schedule 5.

Today's papers are again pleading with the government to reconsider its choice regime—because it has not been initiated by employers; it certainly has not been initiated by employees.

You have not been prepared to discuss those issues. You have not been prepared to come

We think there should be further discussions and we think that a compromise could be reached on this issue.' The sides are not really that far apart if Senator Kemp and the government is interested in achieving choice for employees—not achieving choice for employers, which is what this bill does. There is not that much between us. So I would hope that everybody will be willing to sit down in the next few weeks and have some discussions about that, Senator Kemp. I hope that that is the case.</para><para>As Senator Sherry said, the key here is whether we will see retirement incomes for ordinary working Australians improved through choice. That is the bottom line; those are the key tests that the government has to be prepared to demonstrate to the Senate and to the broader Australian community. How do we address that? How do we give choice to people who cannot read bus timetables? How do we help them to understand the issues so that they can pick up the key feature statements and look at the earning rates and the crediting rates. Most Australians would not know that there is a difference between an earning rate and a crediting rate—a very important issue.</para><para>Super funds of all complexions—I include industry funds in this—should not be able to highlight a crediting rate to disguise their earning rate. It is very important that Australians know how their superannuation fund is performing, not what they are being credited, not what reserve is being brought into play. It is important that they know whether money is being syphoned off in the good years to pad out the bad years. Those are very important issues.</para><para>I know we have a busy schedule and that there is plenty of legislation before the chamber but, hopefully, we will have time to discuss issues such as these. We need to ensure that there is full and proper disclosure, that there is no third line forcing, that there is 
 no capacity for spivs to approach employers and say, `Here's the package. Here's how we'll do this: you put all your employees into my little package. Maybe we can talk about the Chile situation where they have kickbacks.' Everything from brown paper envelopes to lotteries, to free mobile phones, to cheap loans have come into play in Chile.</para><para>We have seen the shocking outcomes in England where many people have been convinced to leave their super fund and join a new super fund, which is far inferior, and then have not been able to switch back to defined benefit funds. These are the sorts of issues in the government's legislation and they desperately need to be addressed and desperately need further discussion. I hope they will also be part of the debate and discussions that we are going to have in the next few weeks.</para><para>I leave that with Senator Kemp because I know he will want to move onto the savings rebate. I know he is looking forward to telling us about how the savings rebate is going to improve national savings, despite what Ted Evans the secretary of Treasury said. I know he is looking forward to doing that. I know Senator Cook is ready to ask a series of questions.

In fact, I have never been in the chamber and seen people more keen to ask questions and less willing to receive answers. Senator Conroy chalked up about 30 questions, and he was backed up by Senator Bishop and Senator Hogg. They all came up with a fascinating series of questions. As we analysed them this morning, we noted the overlaps. Nonetheless, a lot of questions were put on notice, and I assume that at least some of them were put in with a degree of sincerity and want answers. Therefore, I shall respond to those that relate to the bill currently before the chamber.</para></talk.start><para>One of the issues raised—I think this was touched on by Senator Conroy and Senator Jacinta Collins—was how the mere distribution of moneys from a trust contribute to the national savings when the moneys received by the beneficiaries do not have to be saved. If we cut through a lot of the comments, we can see that the question asked by Senator Jacinta Collins was similar to the question asked by Senator Conroy.</para><para>In response to the general comments, the government has examined the available evidence on the provision of tax concessions for savings. A great deal of work has been done in looking at the various savings vehicles, and particularly international experiences where the concessions have been offered on savings and specific savings vehicles.</para><para>The evidence points to increased savings in the particular vehicles without necessarily resulting in a net increase in national savings in the countries concerned. The upshot of this is that the least distortionary approach was to provide a broad based concession, as the government proposes to do. Trust distributions may not have been saved by the beneficiary but this is not the point. The distributions result from earnings on particular investments that the trustee has made, which is a form of savings. A broad based incentive is in our view— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—It is not generating economic gain.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Senator Conroy, you are not at a Labor Party conference or a faction meeting, you are in the Senate chamber.

If you can keep quiet for about three minutes, I will deal with the first part of the question that you asked.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A broad based incentive is the best way to encourage an increase in national savings; the government does not want to merely change the composition of Australian savings. If you put extra conditions on the incentive, for example, only new savings—and I think that was one of the issues—or savings held for a certain period, you would, by definition, attract less savings.</para><para>There will always be people who do not want to accept the condition, whatever it is. The group of people who are encouraged to change their behaviour would be smaller. A condition of `new savings' only encourages people to shift to so-called new savings. The point is that a savings rebate with any design limitations will thereby suffer limitations in its chances for success. Accordingly, the savings rebate has been deliberately designed to reward current savers and encourage new savers.</para><para>As I have said, that was a question asked by Senator Conroy. I am pleased that he has been able to keep quiet for a few seconds so that he could listen to the response.</para><para>Senator Sherry asked me to outline in detail what the precise addition to private and national savings of the savings rebate is. I think that is probably a fair summary, Senator Sherry, of the question that you put to me. I will try not to pout, Senator Sherry, in giving my response to you. Of all the things you said, Senator Sherry, a lot washes over one's shoulder, but that rather surprised me.</para><para>Projections by the retirement income modelling unit, RIM, indicate that the government's superannuation policies, including measures announced in the 1996-97 and 1997-98 budgets, will lead to an increase in net private 
 financial savings of 1.7 per cent of GDP by the year 2000-01, and 3.9 per cent of GDP by 2019-20; and an increase in national financial savings of 1.5 per cent of GDP by the year 2000-01, and 3.6 per cent of GDP by 2020. This projection assumes no behavioural response to the savings rebate.</para><para>If it is assumed that there is a 12 per cent increase in member superannuation contributions as a result of the savings rebate—for example, that is one-third of the response assumed for the former government's co-contribution policy—it would produce member contributions exceeding the cost of the savings rebate on undeducted member contributions alone.

This referred to the discussion on page 3-11 of budget paper No. 1. It makes clear that the medium-term projection for private savings encompasses a number of factors. Some of these, such as the low and predictable rates of inflation and the superannuation guarantee, are already having an effect. Some of these, such as the savings rebate, will begin to take effect over the next one to two years. Some of these, such as demographic change, will take effect over the next decade or so. Perhaps that is not quite as simple as Senator Sherry might have assumed, but the medium term encompasses three, five and 10 years in looking forward.</para><para>I think another issue that Senator Sherry raised is how giving the savings rebate to self-funded retirees, who are people in the community most likely to dissave, is going to 
 encourage national savings. One of the great advantages of the savings rebate is that it does reward people for saving. Under the co-contribution, which I do not think Labor could have ever delivered—it certainly found it difficult to deliver while it had the levers of power—the savings rebate will reward those who have saved in the past, such as self-funded retirees, as well as providing an incentive to new savers.

What I did question—and it is in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> —was an issue on page 3- 
11 of the budget paper No. 1. In the commentary it refers to a suggestion of an improved outlook for private savings. I did express my surprise that demographic changes over the next decade or so were likely to see a rise in the proportion of the population in age groups which historically have been high savers and a decline in younger low saving age cohorts.</para></talk.start><para>The reason I asked that question which expressed surprise is that we have an ageing population, and people who are retiring are net dissavers. I would be very surprised if the rebate in the context of people who have already retired actually added to their saving levels. I would be very surprised. I would be very surprised if you claimed that the total level of saving amongst people who are retired will go up as a result of the rebate. The point is that it would seem to me that because of demographic changes there will be pressure towards a reduction in private saving because of demographic changes, not the reverse, which is claimed in budget paper No. 1. You might care to address that point at some stage in the debate.</para><para>The other question I was going to raise is that, when this measure was announced in the budget, I recall the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, being asked a day or two later in question time whether he was going to collect the rebate. As you would be aware, Senator Kemp, the rebate applies in respect of superannuation contributions, and I assume that is why the Prime Minister would be eligible for the rebate. I do not wish to know the Prime Minister's personal savings habits, but can you please explain to the chamber what is the latest position regarding the Prime Minister's acceptance of the rebate? It is an important question, because he did considerably undermine this measure and contribute to the lack of confidence in the rebate measure by declaring that he was not going to accept it.

It seems to me that the same principle, therefore, says that the economic gain of the income/savings should be incurred and the recipient should be the person who incurs it, not using that structure of a family trust to open a couple of bank accounts for your kids and have a distribution to them, because the kids clearly have not incurred the economic gain.

The crux is whether or not the individual who is holding the asset—bearing the economic risk—is to be the beneficiary of the savings rebate or not.

If that is the case, then at least you are achieving what you are setting out to achieve—whether we agree with that or not.

The savings rebate that you are finding difficult is quite a distinctive measure; the other measures were the subject of other debates at other times. For example, in relation to the savings rebate, the distribution of trust income qualifies because the distributed income would have resulted from the investment of funds by the trust in various forms of savings, such as shares, bank deposits, other property or a business venture. In this sense, of course, trust distributions are no different from interest earned on bank accounts or income earned by a sole trader from his or her own investment in business.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Conroy, you are shaking your head. Your government put in place taxation measures which relate to trusts. We have taken some initiatives in relation to trusts, particularly relating to trust losses. But, as I have

It relates to the aspect of the bill that requires remittances by electronic means. The government have created this odd situation in an attempt to rationalise and streamline the system of remittance. It seems that they may have ignored a number of negative or unfair implications. They may have turned a blind eye to the implications for businesses of the changes.</para><para>Forwarding payments by cheque has previously been a perfectly legitimate form of commercial transaction in this country; now it is not even an option for large remitters. I know that just about every time I go to my own bank they attempt to get me to transfer money by some forms of electronic means or to make payments by electronic means, and I consistently say that I am not interested in that option. Maybe the banks have got to the government and suggested that what is cheapest for them is what they want consumers to do—and not just consumers. We have seen that they have certainly got to the government over the retirement savings allowance. I am just wondering whether the banks have got to the government and said, `Look, this is going to be cheaper for us if these transactions all take place by electronic transfer, and then we won't have to worry about processing cheques.' I do not really think the use of cheques should suddenly be outlawed by 
 governments, even if it is for a limited group of people.</para><para>Beyond the expensive and time consuming compliance measures that business is faced with, the government is making failure to pay electronically into an offence with a penalty. These fines can be downright unfair and misguided. They are not aimed at what they are trying to prevent, that is, preventing large payers from deferring payment because the cheque is not cleared for some days. These fines are an unfair penalty on large remitters.</para><para>The legislation proposed in section 220AAW does not seek to penalise late remitters; it seeks to penalise large remitters who choose to use some other form of payment. So they are not penalising a late payment; they are penalising people who would choose to use cheques. So even if a large firm pays by cheque and it is cleared before the due date, the firm is still subject to a penalty of either $500 or 16 per cent per annum on the principal amount for a period of seven days. Many people might think that is a drop in the ocean for a large firm but, considering that large remitters may potentially remit twice per week, the liability for cheque payment, even if they were all on time, could be $52,000 per year.</para><para>Will it stop there? I just wonder whether, in the end, like analogue telephones and analogue televisions, we will have corporations more and more requiring the parliament to legislate to reduce their costs, the parliament legislating to take away consumer choices. In this case, it might start with business choices and may well end up with the ability of ordinary regular consumers, who may choose still to use cheques, being told that their choices no longer exist. Whilst I would probably like to get rid of the whole section, our amendment removes the penalty from it—and quite rightly so.</para><para>If, in the end, the government has a sensible way of dealing with late remittances, please come and talk to the Senate about it. I urge the Senate to accept the amendment to that. I am not saying that I necessarily support the government's first amendment on B98AF338.WB but if the government's amendment does not get up, I will be happy 
 to move our original amendment, which is still on sheet 1001 and which does the same thing outside the context of the government's amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>3130</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What is before the chair at the moment is an amendment to the government's own amending bill to which the government has just provided an explanatory memorandum.

I wonder about the unfairness; about not targeting late payment but targeting the form of payment—because there is no penalty for late payment, the penalty is for use of a cheque to pay it on time.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>RF4</name.id><name role="metadata">COOK</name><name role="display">Senator Cook</name></talker><para>—That's a fair enough point for the government to answer.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name></talker><para>—Yes.

It is interesting to see the principles the council has set out in the report. On page 11 of the report, section 1 outlines `Principles for the assessment and practice of research in protected and environmentally sensitive areas'. Under the heading `Basis', the report talks about transparency principles. In section 1.2, the report talks about principles particularly relevant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' concerns.	 This is a most appropriate day to highlight this aspect of the report. The goal is, as the report says, to make:</para><para>Indigenous Australians confident that research in protected and environmentally sensitive areas:</para><para>.	 respects their values and customary obligations;</para><para>.	 benefits and empowers traditional owners—</para><para>and so on. The importance of having ethics in scientific research is that the disputes that occur about the environment are normally based on disputed facts rather than on principles. Everybody, whether they are timber gatherers or whether they are environmentalists, says they want to protect the environment or they want to provide work for people.</para><para>There is little dispute about the principles that underpin our concern for the environment. Little separates people in terms of the principles of getting jobs and developing industries. People want industries to develop. They want people to have jobs. They want to preserve the environment. People want all those things and, as a matter of principle, most people agree. But they disagree about the facts of the situation. Somebody will say about a particular piece of forest, `That's good forest. That's pristine forest. That's forest that must be preserved.' Other people looking at that particular piece of forest will say, `No, this is wasteland. This is timber that would best serve the country by being chipped.'</para><para>We want a system whereby a true assessment can be made of the actual facts of the matter. It is here that scientists are so important. What we tend to get in areas such as saving the dugong is one lot of scientists saying, `Yes, these provisions should be put into the requirements to preserve them.' Others say, `No, you don't need those provisions in the assignment to preserve them.' We need people who have the scientific ability to say whether that particular area of forest or that particular area in which dugongs live is good or bad.</para><para>Often people say that you can get whatever opinion you want from lawyers or accountants or from most professions. I think that is too cynical an appraisal; but, in so far as there is any truth in that, it is a bad thing. The only way we can get over that is for people to stand by the ethics of their profession. What this particular report deals with is the ethical standards of scientists that are looking at 
 environmentally sensitive areas. Our arguments about the environment can only be solved ultimately if the people who know about it, the scientists who go about researching a particular area, stick by ethics. That is why this is such an important report.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>3133</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The issue of ethics in the conduct of research in protected and environmentally sensitive areas is obviously absolutely important. It is probably more important right at the moment than it has been for some time, and I will give you the reason. There are extreme pressures in relation to the outcomes of environmental assessments. At the moment, in Western Australia we have a situation, I gather, where it has recently been announced that for environmental assessments for mining you will have someone called an approved assessor—and I will have to check the wording of that—who not only writes the report but also actually does their own assessment. The ability for such kinds of assessments not only to be wrong or misplaced but also to be ill-informed is enormous, where people may in fact be checking their own work.</para></talk.start><para>We have a situation with the environment in Western Australia whereby, for ordinary Department of the Environment assessments, you have private contractors assessing other private contractors, and there is nothing to say that the private contractors will not be assessing their own work. What does it mean if you are in fact employed by the government as a private contractor and you want to continue working for the government? If that government is not wanting environmentalists to be `standing on the hose of development', what does that mean in terms of the way that person will feel, if it is necessary for them to assess those projects?</para><para>There are other pressures as well. Those pressures relate to the impact of competition policy. When you have a situation where there is more and more pressure to take the lowest cost tender, what does it mean in terms of the ethics involved in environmental assessment, even in sensitive areas? It means this, as far as I am concerned: when people are honest enough to say that a particular area 
 needs a lot of research or has not been well researched, that a particular area can only be researched in certain seasons or may take two consecutive seasons to be researched, or that to do the research properly and present a report properly would take two years, but someone else says, `That's out of the question; it costs too much,' or when a consultant says the hours that they would have to put in to do the job properly, but someone else says, `I am prepared to do it in half the time,' that someone else is saying that because they know how competitive the tendering process is.</para><para>Where do ethics come into that? The ethics are that the person in this case who is honest may well be the person who misses out on the job. In the midst of all of this, we find people who charge very large amounts of money to be consultants for the government—we are not quite sure under what process—but who do not actually do the work. One example that I can quote is in relation to the Oakagee proposal. The consultant produced a report for the Department of Resources Development. The consultant said in the report, `There is going to be no impact on seagrass meadows, because there are no seagrass meadows.' Funnily enough, that may well have been the answer the proponent wanted, but was it true?</para><para>A group of other scientists were so angry at that slap-dash way of dealing with environmental assessment that they went to the proposed site at Oakagee, did the measurements, took the dives, took the transect measurements, used a global positioning system and basically quite clearly proved that what the consultant had said was untrue. They proved that what the consultant said was untrue because the consultant had not looked: it was apparently too rough that day, and so he had not done the dives but had apparently only looked at overhead maps and at fisheries reports.</para><para>So here we have a consultant being paid lots of money to present an environmental report but not doing the work. A group comes in and proves the report is untrue, and guess what? The government does not actually have to do anything about it. Not only are the ethics hugely important, but also governments 
 will have to lift their game, because no longer will people be fooled by that kind of shoddy process.

Before I do so, I would like to acknowledge the comments made by Senators Cooney and Margetts in relation to ethics and science. I should put on the record that there is another important and valuable area of science where we should be evaluating and looking at the ethics of research. That, of course, is in relation to genetic technology. Gene technology and its benefits are dazzling, but there are also some difficult ethical and moral issues surrounding that particular technology, such as with human cloning, owning life forms and stealing cultural practices—and the list goes on.</para><para>I again put on record my concern and that of my party that our attempts to have a Senate committee to evaluate and investigate some of these ethical dilemmas were rejected by the two old parties. In relation to this year's science and technology budget statements, again this is a disappointment for Australia, a country that has really staked its future on innovation and creativity. Certainly, this government likes to rave on and on about innovation. Last year's Investing for Growth industry policy statement by the government had as its very foundation the notion of innovation. That is what we should be doing, and that is what we need to use the budget to create the chances for.</para><para>Recently I made an assessment of the government and how it had kept to, or not kept to, its election promises in relation to science. I published that in <inline font-style="italic">Australasian Science</inline>. In the conclusion, I gave the government about four out of 10 for positive rhetoric while failing to deliver in a few key areas, including its failure to restore infrastructure in 
 the research sector, and its declining support financially for higher education. These are major policy flaws which should have been addressed by this budget.</para><para>However, I will focus on this year's budget and the moves towards encouraging the private sector to undertake more research and development. This document reports a gross expenditure on RD for 1994-95 of $7.4 billion, up 5.5 per cent over the previous year. This was a contribution of approximately 47 per cent by business enterprises and made up about 1.61 per cent of GDP. More recent figures are not yet available. This document also shows that Commonwealth support for major science and innovation programs has increased from $3.6 billion in 1997-98 to $3.7 billion in 1998-99, which is actually a decrease in real terms of about 0.5 per cent. It is claimed that, excluding some capital works programs, it would show a 0.4 per cent increase in real terms.</para><para>Sadly, these claims are best interpreted as showing the budget expenditure on science and technology has stayed the same since 1996-97 and the policy reliance on innovation is not matched by budgetary commitment by the government. Perhaps the most telling aspect of this whole story was the dramatic cut in the 1996-97 budget, where there was a staggering 10.7 per cent decrease in Commonwealth funding in real terms. This cut has not been restored since. The report concludes:</para><para>Looking at the broad changes . . . Budget funding for the research agencies has remained static in real terms over the period from 1987-88 to 1998-99.</para><para>I believe this just undermines the government's so-called commitment to innovation.</para><para>It is also concerning that the figures are not yet in to show the effects of the government's decision to cut the 150 per cent RD tax concession down to 125 per cent, saving $2.4 billion over four years. The Academy of Science suggests that there is anecdotal evidence to suggest this single measure will have caused the excellent growth in business RD to falter. This is supported by the budget papers, which show that the uptake for the START program funds has been poor. Does this mean the government has, through its tax policy, stopped business investment in 
 RD in its tracks? I hope not, but I suspect so.</para><para>The conclusion from this document is the need to seriously re-examine the place of government funding for science and technology and to at least repair the damage of the 1996-97 budget cuts, and to re-examine incentives to encourage business to invest. I look forward to the commitment from the government in the near future to some of these areas. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties: Anti-Personnel Mines</title><page.no>3135</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>3135</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>This report is a national interest analysis, and it obviously includes in it some elements of the more positive approach that has been taken by government in recent times to anti-personnel landmines. But there are still some major issues that remain. I would like to take the opportunity at this point of acknowledging the work that has been done in Australia over time by Sister Patricia Pak Poy internationally but especially within Australia in increasing the knowledge on landmines. That work was in fact acknowledged and celebrated in the awarding of the ANZAC peace prize this year, and very well deserved it was.</para><para>The national interest analysis includes reasons for Australia to take the proposed treaty actions. I will read from it:</para><para>The past decade has witnessed a growing number of instances where anti-personnel mines have been used indiscriminately.</para><para>Of course, one of the arguments that have been used in relation to anti-personnel mines is that it is women, children and non-combatants who are most impacted on. But it is not entirely their use; it is the weapons themselves which are inherently dangerous. It is not a matter of whether you use them indiscriminately. In many cases people deliberately put landmines in places where women, children and non-combatants will encounter them. Whether that is meant indiscriminately I do not know, but in many countries those are the ways landmines are used.</para><para>So we should be dealing with the fact that not only do we see the majority of victims being non-combatants but that it is not just the indiscriminate use of landmines, it is the fact that the weapons themselves, wherever you use them, are inherently dangerous because most of them are meant to be not easily detected. The reality is that the danger of the landmines themselves becomes the problem and becomes the inhumane element of what we are dealing with. The report says:</para><para>In addition, the Convention also requires the states parties to destroy or ensure the destruction of stockpiles of anti-personnel mines within a period of four years after the entry into force of the Convention, with provision for the retention of a minimum number of anti-personnel mines for training.</para><para>We still do not know what this means in terms of numbers. We know in terms of the treaty but we do not know in terms of numbers for Australia. I guess it is unlikely that it is in the terms that each country will make its own decision. I might indicate that under `Costs' the report says:</para><para>Noting that final destruction methods and exact quantities for retention are still to be determined, initial indicative costs for destruction of the stockpile are $4.1 million, of which stock write-offs total $3.9 million.</para><para>Landmines themselves per item usually are not a terribly expensive commodity, so $3.9 million worth of landmines is a great many landmines. One wonders what Australia was ever proposing to do with that quantity of landmines, considering all the negotiations that have been going on in recent years.</para><para>Further on under implementation there is a section in the second last paragraph which reads:</para><para>The Government will consider on a case-by-case basis requests for assistance from other states parties within the framework of its overall policy response to the landmines issue. . . . receive assistance to the extent possible for mine clearance and related activities.</para><para>I guess the question is whether or not we assist those countries that have not signed the convention. That becomes, obviously, a very difficult question in terms of the humanity of the situation.</para><para>I am cruel enough to remind the Senate that in June 1995 I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, Senator Gareth Evans:</para><para>How can the government justify not supporting a complete ban on anti-personnel landmines, including their manufacture, given their appalling record as an indiscriminate destructive weapon which is mainly targeted at civilians in regions of conflict and whose effects are felt a long time after the conflict is over?</para><para>The response from Senator Evans at the time was that our position was `hopelessly utopian'. We were proved correct—the so-called `hopelessly utopian' position was much more achievable than the position the government was taking. Finally, the trip-wire grenades used as mines by the Australian military are still not banned under this provision. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>3136</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was recently in Angola and Mozambique—two countries that are blighted by war and the legacies of war.

In Angola I went to a workshop where people made artificial legs to replace the natural ones that were blown off by mines. Australia has put funding into that and made it a successful undertaking. There is, for reasons I cannot go into now, some issue as to whether or not funding will continue to that particular undertaking in Angola. I take this opportunity to urge Australia and Australia's government to see to it that that undertaking is kept going because it does provide much needed aid to women and children, and men as well. Anyone who is injured is entitled to sympathy and to an artificial leg, I would say. Those people are entitled to the legs that they would otherwise be denied were funding withdrawn. Australia is not the only country that people can look to for funding, but certainly we are a compassionate nation and we need to look to that.</para><para>In Mozambique I witnessed the blowing up of a couple of mines around a particular village. I was with other Australians at the time. The crew that undertook the clearing of mines in Mozambique were trained by the 
 Australian Army. This is a proper time to acknowledge the work that the Australian Army does overseas in actions such as this where its personnel clear mines. It is a task that needs a lot of patience, training and concentration. Those elements have been put into the area by the Australian Army. They were directly in charge at one stage; now they are at the point where they have become advisers. I think that is something to be proud of. Major Peter McIntosh was on duty at the time I was there and I would like to acknowledge the great service he has given to Mozambique and to Australia. I acknowledge not only him but those who went before him and those who will come after him. It is a noble task.</para><para>Let me end this way, Madam Acting Deputy President: if you do get the chance, do urge the government to keep the undertaking going in Angola.

The erection of a 15-storey building that obscures a view of the Opera House from almost every part of the city is an absolute outrage. Not surprisingly, it has prompted a public outcry. A public meeting last week attracted 1,500 protesters, including the playwright David Williamson, scientist Dr Tim Flannery and broadcaster Margaret Throsby. The meeting heard estimates of the cost to get the site back ranging from $250 million to Premier Bob Carr's touted figure of $700 million.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>—He is trying to balance his budget.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name></talker><para>—Yes, he is trying to balance his budget. Regardless of the cost, the meeting was unanimous in its decision that the building, dubbed the `toaster', has to go and it has the support of international figures such as Robert Hughes and the architect of the Sydney Opera House, Joern Utzon.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The depth of feeling locally, nationally and internationally means action must be taken. East Circular Quay is a site of great significance to Australians, as it is home for the building which many regard as our national icon and symbol, the Opera House. It also incorporates other Sydney landmarks: the harbour, the quay and the botanic gardens. Sydneysiders have great pride in the city, and they will not allow this building to ruin its appearance and its reputation. At the moment, arriving at a solution to removing the `toaster' poses great difficulty, as the whole issue—perhaps appropriately, given the site—has become something of an operatic event. The debate must be allowed to return to sensible levels of dialogue; emotion must be contained.</para><para>The role of the New South Wales Labor government in the fiasco is to be condemned, as is Premier Bob Carr's attempted sidestep to avoid tackling the issue and taking any blame. The fact of the matter is that it was Bob Carr who signed the approval for this building. This was 10 years ago, when he was the New South Wales minister for planning. Not only did he approve the development, he approved it to be 20 storeys high. The present building is 15 storeys high so, if Mr Carr had his way, it would be a third higher than it is now.</para><para>His approval has allowed a building that blocks out a view of the Opera House from most parts of the city. What great vision this man had, and has, for his state. He signed on the dotted line to allow a building which overshadows the Opera House. His actions have turned what was envisaged as an area for the people into a high-rise accommodation tower which only the very wealthy can afford. Mr Carr's signature has allowed an elitist tower, owned and developed by overseas 
 interests, to spoil an unparalleled icon of our built heritage.</para><para>Even as minister for planning, Bob Carr exhibited the traits which are all too apparent now: lack of vision, lack of leadership and lack of commitment to the people of New South Wales. Now that the project to which he gave the nod has spun out of control, guess what? He is appealing to the federal government to bail him out. Based on press reports, there are indications that a solution could be brokered with the building's owners, Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels. Pressed about this, Mr Carr showed how diminished is his own party's confidence in him. Mr Carr mentioned a figure of $700 million being needed to buy the site back from its owners. Perhaps his own government does not keep him informed because it now emerges that Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels held private talks with the New South Wales government as recently as last year, at which they reportedly said that they would vacate the site for something in the order of $250 million.</para><para>The public meeting in Sydney heard that the Save East Circular Quay Committee had received word from an intermediary for the developer that it was prepared to sell the site for $300 million. The total value of the development has been put at $600 million. One thing that must be avoided is a Dutch auction with the owners to buy the site back. Very detailed examination must be made of the true value of the undertaking to the owners. In October last year the site was valued at $85.8 million by the Valuer-General. The fact that only 22 of the 237 apartments in this gross complex have been sold—and all of those before 1996—indicates that the project is something of a commercial dud. Obviously, at prices starting from $700,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to $5.5 million for a sub-penthouse, the owners have priced themselves out of the market and this may be behind their willingness to vacate.</para><para>Mr Carr and his government have consistently failed to listen to the people of Sydney on this matter and have only taken the cotton wool out of their ears in recent weeks. In the face of continuing protest—local, national and international—Mr Carr, using his $700 
 million figure, tried to insist that the building was too expensive to buy back and that the whole thing was just beyond his government to fix. Once again, he failed to recognise the values and pride Sydney people have for their city. They will not just turn away from what they regard as a travesty which was foisted upon them against their will.</para><para>They fought on and, only hours before the protest rally, it was learnt that the Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels had expressed a willingness to quit the site for something in the order now of $300 million. Having been caught out on the figures, Mr Carr has the unmitigated hide to turn to the federal government to come up with the readies to get the site back. Mr Carr's ineptitude in this matter has meant that the obstacles to resolving the problem have not been addressed.</para><para>A land swap might simply move the problem, not solve it. In the past, there has been justifiably strong resistance to the notion of swapping land next to the Opera House in return for land elsewhere, on the proviso that permission would be granted to exceed height restrictions in other locations. Given Bob Carr's previous penchant for a 20-storey building, such a scenario is a frightening possibility.</para><para>The government has control of much harbour and foreshore land and it must be stopped from doing any deal which compromises these sites. But there is no doubt that the East Circular Quay apartment building is out of character with the site, with the city and with the wishes of the people, so the problem cannot be left unresolved. The critical question is: where would the funds come from to get rid of it? One suggestion which seemed to have some merit was to start a new lottery to help raise some of the money needed. After all, this was how the Opera House was funded, so it would be appropriate to at least help return East Circular Quay to the way it was envisaged through similar means. But the New South Wales government has poured cold water on that idea.</para><para>Another suggestion was a one-off fee in New South Wales. Raising $300 million would represent a cost of $67 to each New South Wales resident over the age of 20. This 
 would be in keeping with the desires of the people after a recent <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> poll showed people were overwhelmingly opposed to the idea of using taxpayers' money to solve the issue. However, Bob Carr has turned to the federal government and wants money from the Federation Fund to be used to solve the problem. Not one solution has come forward from Bob Carr on his own account. Bob Carr obviously did not confer with his federal Labor Party colleagues on that one.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has gone on record saying:</para><para>There are many priorities confronting that Federation Fund and I'm not sure that would necessarily be the highest.</para><para>Effectively he has told Bob Carr to abandon the idea. For once I agree with Mr Beazley. The Federation Fund was, however, not established to help remedy Mr Carr's colossal errors of bad judgment. The billion dollar fund was set up in the 1997-98 budget to fund projects of national significance as part of the activities to celebrate this nation's centenary of Federation. Mr Howard made it very clear the funds belonged to everyone. Announcing the plan, he said:</para><para>Everybody will be treated equally because the centenary of Federation does not belong to one or other side of politics. It belongs to all Australians and this is a practical demonstration of that commitment.</para><para>Giving money to Bob Carr hardly fits that scenario.</para><para>The Federation Fund projects are ones of major cultural, economic and social significance. As part of Mr Carr's logic, he claims the coalition government is not giving enough money to New South Wales and he has conveniently ignored the fact that the Corowa bridge on the New South Wales-Victorian border is getting $12 million and that there is funding for the Opera House of $32 million and other money for the cathedral refurbishments and other projects.</para><para>Mr Carr ignores, in relation to the Federation Fund, that it is up to state governments to develop and to submit proposals for funding of major projects that would have the support of all Australians. Bob Carr has to 
 find his own way to clean up the mess that he allowed to be created at East Circular Quay.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment Services</title><page.no>3139</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>3139</page.no><name role="metadata">Reynolds, Sen Margaret</name><name role="display">Senator REYNOLDS</name><name.id>XI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I want to document the frustrations of one of my constituents who has been trying to make the adjustment from CES to working with Centrelink and Employment National. I am not going to make any comments myself. I am just going to use the documents that have been sent to me, because I think they clearly illustrate the enormous problems we have with these changes. This gentleman writes that on 9 September 1997 he was registered with DSS and CES and got casual work for eleven weeks around Christmas. He states:</para></talk.start><para>April 1998</para><para>Getting worried and financially desperate.</para><para>I am sorry that some members of the government on the other side seem to think it is amusing. I do not think you will as I go further. He continues:</para><para>But the big glossy ads for the new Employment National give me hope, assistance, training, case management.</para><para>Read in the Innisfail Advocate that the CES staff of 13 will be replaced by an Employment National staff of ONE serving the area from Cardwell to Babinda. A bit disconcerting but those glossy ads restore my faith.</para><para>April 17 1998</para><para>Put in my fortnightly form at Centrelink and ask if I have to do anything for the new system. No, I'm told, your registered on the computer. Too easy, such efficiency, I can hardly believe it.</para><para>May 1 1998</para><para>D Day! I try to find the Employment National Office no one knows where it is. The CES is closed. I spend the afternoon ringing to find out something. Centrelink . . . is engaged as usual cant get through Emp. National . . . and . . . at last a . . . human voice but they cant help me they've never heard of Innisfail.</para><para>I presume it is a central telephone number.</para><para>They will get someone to ring me back.</para><para>Someone from Employment National—</para><para>rings me from Townsville he gives me the old CES number and address then he gives me a Cairns number—I have to pay STD—turns out to be the old CES. He senses my desperation I sense his. He will get back to me as soon as he can. 
</para><para>May 5 1998</para><para>I've somehow been given the number of Jobs Australia Innisfail . . . they apparently are the old Skilshare and are also contracted. They tell me I need a Centrelink Job Search No. and they'll help me. Living 10 miles out of town these visits are not easy. I go to Centrelink and ask for a Job Search No. The staffer looks surprised that I've found out about the secret numbers and reluctantly and with difficulty because the computers are not working properly gives me my number. At last, off I go to Jobs Australia, alias Innisfail Job Centre and their computer isnt working properly but they take my details and will get back to me once I'm linked.</para><para>I read in today's Innisfail Advocate that Emp.

The phones and comps havent been connected yet but the operator . . . seems to know something. As a six to twelve month unemployed I'd be categorised as flex 2 and therefore jobs Australia would look after me. Emp Nat is contracted for flex 1 and 3. Centrelink should have categorised me and referred me!</para><para>I go home and ring Centrelink . . . its engaged then eventually I get an extensive spiel about things that have nothing to do with me until I'm told to wait for up to three minutes for an operator after 5 more three minutes I give up and ring complaints.

She checks the computer which isnt working properly and gives me a form to fill in which will allow them to assess and categorise me she doesnt know why I hadn't been given this form earlier.

She doesnt want to process it and I suggest that it is the same info I gave in Sept. No she says, I'm sure says I, well its in a different format says she. Well I want to know what category I am and what assistance I can get. The computers not working properly anyway it will take 2 to 3 weeks for your case to be referred to Jobs Aust or Emp Nat.</para><para>I DONT BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN CONNED. Why wasn't all this done before I've been wasting time for two weeks and now you say I have to wait 2-3 weeks more. It doesn't matter she says the training doesnt start till June 15 anyway. BUT there are only 10 funded places.</para><para>At this point, the constituent rang my office. Senators might say that this is just one example and that perhaps it is a case of the individual being unfortunate or not being able to access the right course for gaining assistance. But I am receiving—as are many of my colleagues in this place and in the other place—these kinds of complaints daily on the telephone. We also receive other letters.</para><para>I have a letter from a constituent in Bowen. Again, time will not allow me to detail it all but I will give you the flavour of it. It states:</para><para>At Home</para><para>Telephone call No. 1—To enquire when these employment services would be available. The department's officer's reply was `You know as much as I do.'</para><para>Call No 2. C.E.S Ayr—`No idea.'</para><para>Call No 3. C.E.S NSW—`No idea.'</para><para>Call No 4. The officer suggested we call 013 for the number of Employment National.</para><para>Call No 5. Employment National—Consultant to return our call.</para><para>Call No 6. Office of De Anne Kelly, M.P., federal member for Dawson, they would look into this matter and get back to us.</para><para>Reply from call No. 5—Employment National.</para><para>The consultant from E.N. advised that the available facilities were located at the office of Northern Employment and Training Organisation (NEATO) 
 which has been established in Bowen for some time.</para><para>Reply from call No. 6—De Anne Kelly's office advised us to call NEATO.</para><para>Telephone call No. 7—Contacted NEATO and they advised that they would be available to see us on Tuesday—anytime.</para><para>Light at the end of the tunnel???</para><para>And so the letter goes on. An interview was then held but they advised my constituent that they were a private employment service and that they covered only the area from Ayr to Cannonvale, and my constituent does not live in that particular area.</para><para>If this were not so serious, this attempt at replacing the very good service that we had through the CES would be a joke. People are phoning and they are being given the runaround. There is nothing there for them. I hope that the minister on duty will take these concerns to the minister responsible because, as a Queenslander, he must surely be receiving as many complaints as I am. I understand that just as many complaints about the failure of the new system are being received throughout Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Jabiluka Uranium Mine</title><page.no>3140</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>3140</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to report to the Senate on the events of the last couple of days at Jabiluka and on my visit there last month. Before I get to that subject, I must say that Senator Coonan's message regarding the Opera House could just as easily have been said about Jabiluka. The international condemnation and community concern that she talked about happen when you put a uranium mine slap-bang in the middle of a world heritage area. I also entreat her to add her voice to the call for the Sydney Opera House to be nominated for world heritage—this is something that Senator Hill has been most reluctant to pursue since coming to office.</para></talk.start><para>But on the subject of Jabiluka, last week the Northern Territory police, along with the Darwin based tactical response team, moved onto the scene of the new uranium mine at Jabiluka. They gave the peaceful protesters there 24 hours to clear the blockade site and told them that they would be arrested, that their materials would be confiscated, and that 
 road access to the site would be cleared for heavy duty construction works. The police and the tactical response group made it very clear that there would be a mass assault on those peaceful protesters.</para><para>Eighteen people were arrested on Tuesday of last week, including the Mirra senior traditional owner, Yvonne Margarula. She was arrested for being on the lease site, which is, of course, her own land. That very same day we saw protests in eight different countries around the world. Yesterday there was a pre-dawn raid at the site. The police arrived before the protesters had a chance to chain themselves to the blockade and there were a further nine arrests before 7.15 in the morning.</para><para>The police moved in with six police cars to block the road between Magela Creek and Jabiluka, and they stopped the protesters' vehicles attempting to go through by using the pretence of checking for defects. The protest will go on. There are many people still prepared to go to Jabiluka. These are the people who are carrying the flag for the majority of Australians and who do not want this country taking part in this deadly nuclear cycle.</para><para>When I was in Jabiluka a few weeks ago, the situation then was that the Northern Land Council had agreed to allow Energy Resources of Australia, the mining company, to proceed with the project in return for the sorts of promises that were made when the nearby Ranger mine began—promises which, by and large, have not been to the benefit of the local indigenous people and particularly not to the Mirra people.</para><para>ERA's announcement came with the advice that its consultation with Aboriginal people was complete but, of course, the question is: what Aboriginal people? The traditional owners were identified by Mr Justice Toohey in 1982 as the Mirra people. He said that the `Mirra are a local descent group who have common spiritual affiliations to sites on the land that place the group under a primary spiritual responsibility for the sites and the land.'</para><para>The Mirra people have held fast to their refusal to have a mine on their land. But the 
 decision has been made on their behalf and not by them. It is also fair to say that ERA has attempted to render the Mirra invisible with the language in its publicity that engages in post-Mabo analogies of terra nullius.</para><para>Clearly, the Mirra people are hampered in their fight by the fact that they live in a place far removed from the central business districts of the eastern seaboard which, of course, are where most of the mining industry cheer squad reside—that is, the finance managers, the major banks such as the National, the ANZ and Westpac, and of course the mining company publicity machines. The latter are helped along by some $333 million of government subsidies to the industry over a five-year period.</para><para>One of the Mirra people asked me to convey this message to the Senate:</para><para>Please ask them to think of our children, our children's children, our children's grandchildren; to imagine a world with healthy humans on it for another 60,000 years . . . And ask them to consider that no one is perfect, mistakes will always happen, and that we can't afford to play with such incredibly destructive technology . . . to remember Hiroshima/Nagasaki, Chernobyl . . . and the many other disasters whose repercussions we are already living with and can never take back.</para><para>Very few politicians have been up to see what it is that is being earmarked for destruction. Unfortunately, this trickle is not threatening to become any sort of steady flow either.</para><para>It was my first visit to Kakadu, and I must say that I was overwhelmed with the extraordinary beauty of the place—the vast green wetlands, framed by ancient rocky escarpments; diverse forests of paperbark, palm and sheoak. It is a place which is teeming with wildlife, particularly birds. Termite mounds, for instance, two metres high are an attraction to the many tourists who flow through the area. I saw places where barramundi leap out of very clear streams and others where crocodiles lie in wait. You can look at this place and say it is untouched by European-Australian endeavours.</para><para>But at the same time the signs of Aboriginal culture are everywhere to see. I was taken to Ubirr, which is very close to the Jabiluka mining lease. This is a place to which overseas visitors flock in order to look at rock 
 paintings which are thousands of years old. European and Asian tourists whom I saw while I was there were both alarmed and puzzled that anyone would want to set up a mine in this world heritage area. After they found out it was a uranium mine, they were even more incredulous—and I spoke with visitors who had decided to stay on to join the blockade.</para><para>I saw a group of houses alongside a river into which sometime earlier the effluent from the Ranger tailings dam had been released. A 35-year-old woman from this area had died a week previously. I was told that people who live in and around Jabiluka do not live much beyond the age of 40. People in this area use bore water instead of collecting rainwater from their rooftops; the reason is that the radon in the air is very dangerous. Jabiluka and the township of Jabiru may be very beautiful, but they are also very deadly places in which to live.</para><para>Most visitors do not get to see where Aboriginal people in this area actually live. The vast wealth which is dug from the ground has not brought many benefits to the Mirra people or other Aboriginal groups in the area. I saw a typical house; it was a small enclosure that looked much more like a chicken coop than a house in which you would put people. Nevertheless, these houses are crowded, and this is one of the reasons why scabies affects 90 per cent of the children in this community. Scabies is a Third World disease which has been eliminated from most places on the planet—but not here in Australia. And, of course, it is a disease which has long-term effects on these young bodies.</para><para>Jobs in the mine have largely gone to outsiders. The small amount of revenue from the mine flows on to ATSIC, to the land council, to tourism projects, and to fund services which we here in Canberra or Melbourne take for granted as being government services.</para><para>A few weeks ago wearing, I must say, a very small moral fig leaf, Minister Downer recalled our ambassador to India in protest at that country's nuclear tests. Australia however, I must say, is complicit in this lethal economy. The boundaries between the peace 
 ful use of uranium and the market that eventually produces nuclear weapons are, indeed, porous. Let us remember that the Australian government cannot guarantee that no uranium finds its way into weapons manufacture.</para><para>The mismanaged nuclear industry has been propped up with the collusion of governments and banks. An accident occurring at Dounreay a couple of weeks ago is the latest in a long line of disasters in the uranium business. In the meantime, safe and renewable alternatives, such as wind and solar energy, gain a toehold ever so slowly.</para><para>I do not think we can rely on our present leaders to engage in ideas of responsibility to the planet and to the people in other countries on this issue. For instance, a couple of weeks ago, the submission by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Senate Economics Committee argued that Australia would fall behind in its role in international nuclear policy if the proposed new reactor at Lucas Heights did not go ahead.</para><para>This logic says that, by consolidating our status as players in this deadly industry, Australia will somehow do a better job of ensuring safety standards at plants in Asia and in negotiating on nuclear non-proliferation issues. It seems that we need more nuclear prowess in order to stop other countries using theirs—a little like the justification India has come up with to defend its own nuclear tests.</para><para>It is remarkable then that, in this political climate, hundreds of dedicated Australians have travelled to Jabiluka to lend their support to the blockade, and we are not talking about a quick trip here. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>University of Western Sydney</title><page.no>3142</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>3142</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to address an area of great interest in that part of Sydney in which I work, the area of Greater Western Sydney—and that is the ongoing success of the University of Western Sydney. Since entering the Senate last year, I have been pleased to firstly establish, and then pursue, an ongoing relationship with the university, and I am constantly impressed with both the staff and students alike.</para></talk.start><para>UWS, as it is locally known, has a long history and very complex structure. It began operating in 1989 as a federated university based on three existing colleges of advanced education in Greater Western Sydney: the Nepean College of Advanced Education, the Hawkesbury Agriculture College and the Macarthur Institute of Higher Education.</para><para>It continues to operate in that way—as a federated university with three separate and distinct parts: Macarthur, Hawkesbury and Nepean. Each of those parts has its own culture, offers to the students its own courses, and services a different area of Greater Western Sydney. In fact, it is highly diverse even in terms of its geography. Between Macarthur, Hawkesbury and Nepean, there are seven individual sites across western Sydney. But it is UWS Nepean on which I wish to focus tonight.</para><para>Nepean is the largest of the three elements of UWS and is primarily based in Penrith on three sites: Kingswood, Werrington North and Werrington South. I was taken on a tour of the Nepean campuses very early on in my time in this place by my very proud colleague the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly. In addition to the Penrith sites is the latest inclusion of the Parramatta campus, to which I will return. UWS Nepean offers courses in eight faculties, ranging from business to science and technology, to performance, fine arts and design. With total enrolment at UWS Nepean alone in excess of 10,000 students, the university has proved its popularity with students from both the Greater Western Sydney region and beyond.</para><para>The Nepean site occupies land on which relics 20,000 years old have been found, with further evidence of occupation in the area indicating the presence of indigenous Australians as long ago as 47,000 years. This heritage is acknowledged and continued through the existence and operation of the university's respected Durali Aboriginal Centre. Nepean itself is situated in one of Australia's most historic urban regions. Penrith is one of the earliest townships established in the colony and was responsible for much of the supply of grains and foods to the colony. Similarly, honourable senators would know that Parra 
 matta also has a rich heritage and is now one of the  major centres of Sydney.</para><para>The newest campus of UWS Nepean is the Parramatta campus. At the beginning of this year, the faculties of business, law, nursing and health studies and some departments of the faculty of science and technology moved to the new Parramatta campus, which is one of particular historical significance. It is situated on the site of the former female orphanage, Australia's first purpose built orphanage, on the banks of the Parramatta River. The campus is home to Australia's oldest three-story building, thus ensuring that UWS Nepean has the honour of the nation's oldest university site; an honour I am sure the University of Sydney previously imagined was well within its keeping.</para><para>The foundation stone of the orphanage was laid in 1813 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie and the building was completed in 1818 and then began operation. The building had a very varied history, later being incorporated as part of Rydalmere Hospital before it was purchased by UWS Nepean from the state government in March 1995. All the redevelopment carried out by the university has been subject to a stringent heritage plan. The use of the orphanage is therefore extremely limited, but there is an aim of full restoration and use as a major heritage site and a public focus for research and education.</para><para>The area known as the Vernon precinct is also part of the campus. It consists of buildings constructed in the early 1900s which were also a part of Rydalmere Hospital. They now house the university's commerce faculty and will be used for teaching and for staff accommodation. Late last year I was pleased to be able to tour that site, which is close to my office, with Deputy Vice-Chancellor and UWS Nepean President, Professor Chris Duke; Pro Vice-Chancellor, Professor Harry Irwin; and Michael Charlton, the head of UWS public relations. Wandering around the construction areas even then showed me that the site is truly impressive and will be a very attractive educational facility when fully completed. Whilst there is ongoing work to be completed, the campus is already operational, with courses commencing this year. I know 
 several students whose enthusiasm about their university and the new Parramatta campus is almost bordering on infectious.</para><para>UWS Nepean has been very successful at integrating with the community in which it is based. Already they have established a range of what they describe as cooperative programs which aim at involving local industry with the university. They have over 70 industry partners involved, and the programs are an enormous success. The first and perhaps one of the most successful is a student industry cooperative program called the cooperative education for enterprise development. It involves industry partners as diverse as the Australian Army, Hawker de Havilland, Barcode Solutions and the Sydney Church of England Grammar School.</para><para>The students are involved in a vast range of projects, with the 1996-97 graduates having participated in everything from creating an electronic bookshop to the development of a DNA based protocol for identification of native and introduced animals from hair samples. Incoming student projects are similarly as diverse, with projects such as a strategy development for youth and children's theatre in Parramatta and an evaluation of staff perceptions at Nepean Health.</para><para>The second cooperative program is a research program known as the Nepean summer research awards. It includes organisations such as the Olympic Coordination Authority, and those involved have described it as an invaluable two-way experience that provides us with fresh perspectives and solutions and also as a great opportunity for business to access enthusiastic and talented students. The final of the cooperative programs was introduced last year. The engineering summer placement program has benefited from the involvement of organisations such as Blacktown City Council and the Penrith Lakes Development Corporation, and it can only go upwards from there.</para><para>UWS also recently established the Western Sydney Research Institute, which is designed to coordinate research programs with regional industry and business groups. Aimed at ensuring integration between all three campuses—the Hawkesbury, the Nepean and the 
 Macarthur—the institute will be involved in three main areas: environmental management, regional development and planning, and urban, social and cultural development. All these areas are particularly important to the healthy growth and wellbeing of western Sydney, with the potential for a direct and positive impact on regional, economic and industrial planning. Already the Western Sydney Research Institute is planning its first project: the construction of an enormous geographic information system for Greater Western Sydney. The university has committed $1 million to this project and is now looking to funding from regional partners involved.</para><para>I think anyone who has followed the progress of UWS since the late 1980s agrees that it has been an enormous success in giving more Australians access to higher education. Statistics from the UWS Nepean's student intake survey of last year indicated that nearly 70 per cent of students who completed the survey were first generation students. That is, neither of their parents had obtained a degree. The survey also indicated that nearly 40 per cent of respondents lived within 24 kilometres of the university. What is significant about these statistics for the community of Greater Western Sydney is that it is a clear indication that UWS is offering opportunities to students who may never have taken up those opportunities at existing facilities elsewhere in the Sydney metropolitan area. UWS is obviously servicing an appreciative education market.</para><para>One of the most gratifying aspects from these statistics relates to the number of UWS graduates who are not only finding work but also finding it in the Greater Western Sydney region. In 1993 the graduate success rate of finding work was well in excess of 80 per cent of students in full-time or part-time work, and over half of those in the local region. That is a tremendous boost not only to the individual students but also to their families and to our region.</para><para>Finally, I am also pleased to say that the University of Western Sydney has become the latest Australian university to appoint a female vice-chancellor. Professor Janice Reid, formerly the Pro Vice-Chancellor of the Queensland University of Technology, was

There is an opportunity to debate matters of general business on a Thursday. The practice used to be that attempts to suspend standing orders in order to bring on general business notices of motion were a rarity. They have become commonplace. The consequence of that of course is that government business time is lost. I am not arguing the right of Senator  Colston to raise a matter that is of concern to him, but I am suggesting that it should not take the place of other business of the Senate. Therefore he should have his opportunity to call it on, as a matter of general business, on a Thursday in the way in which business used to be done. I presume, consistent with that philosophy, that this opposition has an arrangement whereby Independents and minority parties are given a fair share of the occasions on Thursdays for such debate.

I would like to point out to you, Madam President, and to the Senate, that we consider this motion to be a case of one 
 utterly discredited Queensland politician—that is, Senator Colston—trying to discredit another utterly discredited Queensland politician—that is, Pauline Hanson. As far as the members of the opposition in the Senate are concerned, we will have no part of this grubby and absurd political exercise.</para></talk.start><para>The truth of the matter is that Labor's record in relation to Pauline Hanson has been clear, principled and unwavering. It stands in stark contrast to what we have seen from the Liberal Party since Ms Hanson first became prominent in Australian politics. In relation to the issue of preferences, the Labor Party has categorically made its position absolutely clear. That is a position from which we have not wavered for a very long period of time.</para><para>In fact, as early as October 1996, when the inherent threats of One Nation to Australia's stable and multicultural society and economy were apparent, the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, Gary Gray, stated on the Channel 9 <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program that we, the Australian Labor Party, would put One Nation last on our how-to-vote ticket. I might say, by the way, that so did Mr Andrew Robb, the then federal director of the Liberal Party. Remember that it was the Labor Party that sponsored, negotiated and supported a bipartisan motion in this parliament against racial intolerance, a motion which was in response to the national and international outrage over the member for Oxley, and we will have no part in this action taken in this chamber by someone as discredited as Senator Colston.</para><para>We consider Senator Colston's actions also to be unprincipled, reprehensible and venal and we are not going to see the Labor Party associated in any way with any move or any exercise in which he tries to attempt to grandstand and claw back some of his lost status, standing and image in the community. We will have no part of it, and of course we also know that events have superseded the rhetoric that is contained in Senator Colston's motion.</para><para>In the Queensland election, where the Liberal Party and the National Party are tying themselves in knots over the issue of preferences from the One Nation Party, Labor's position has been clear for a very long period 
 of time. It is a principled position. We will not resile from it, we have not resiled from it, and we will be absolutely consistent in that position. We do not need an individual of the standing of Senator Colston coming in here and telling the Labor Party or the parliament how we should approach these sorts of matters.</para><para>Our stand has been proper, it has been principled and it has been consistent. We will continue to stand up and provide the political leadership that is required in this nation on the issue of racism and on the issue of the rise of the One Nation Party. We remain the only major political party in this country that is willing to make that level of commitment in defence of our national cohesiveness and our international standing.

 racism and how poor my party is. Can I ask Senator Faulkner: which party was it that got rid of the white Australia policy promoted by the Labor Party for decades?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">CARR</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Gough Whitlam</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—Tell me which party it was, Senator Carr.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">FAULKNER </name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Which party is putting One Nation last on the how-to-vote cards?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name></talker><para>—It is not the Australian Labor Party, Senator Faulkner.

Given the focus of this motion, and particularly its focus on the One Nation Party, this is something that is particularly relevant to my own state of Queensland. The outcome of the Queensland state election is very important for Queensland's future, just as will be its potential flow-on effects for the federal election, particularly again in terms of representation for some of the federal seats in Queensland.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So this is an urgent matter. It is important that the Senate does have an opportunity during this week to express a view on this motion put forward by Senator Colston, because this will be the last time that all senators are able to be put on the record in relation to their views on the issues put forward.</para><para>In that regard—and one would have thought this would go without saying but, given the remarks made by the ALP, obviously it does need to be said—in voting and expressing a view on a motion, one should do so in relation to the actual wording of the motion. To try to avoid taking a position on a motion simply because there is dislike for its mover, I find, is disingenuous, to say the least, and inappropriate. The ALP have indicated that they support the motion's wording and, therefore, I believe they should allow themselves to be placed on the record in relation to the motion as it stands, rather than to try to dodge it because they do not like the person who has moved it.</para><para>I think the issue of preferences and the preference recommendations of all parties on the how-to-vote cards in the Queensland election will be crucial. I should place on the record that the Democrats long ago indicated 
 that they will be placing One Nation last on all their how-to-vote cards. That decision was made by our state council many, many months ago at a state council meeting in Ipswich, by coincidence. That is something we have stayed solidly firm on since that time.</para><para>Because of the optional preferential system that operates in Queensland, it is important that all parties give a commitment not simply to try to ignore One Nation or take a non-committal stand on it, but that they actually commit themselves specifically to putting One Nation candidates last. The option is open there for all parties simply to have a how-to-vote card that shows a single first preference and leaves all the other options. In that circumstance, it provides an opportunity for a de facto first-past-the-post contest to eventuate.</para><para>In that circumstance, those areas, those few seats that have been given some focus as being ones where there is a high One Nation Party vote—and they are seats similar to those that in the past have pulled high votes for other extreme right wing parties, such as the Confederate Action Party and the Citizens Electoral Council which unfortunately do have some ongoing support base in Queensland—once again quite probably these will pull a reasonable vote for One Nation. If the circumstance is allowed to develop where a de facto first-past-the-post contest does occur, that will give those people a much greater chance than they have had in the past of gaining a seat in the Queensland parliament.</para><para>For those reasons, it is crucial that parties do not simply commit to not allocating preference towards One Nation but that they specifically commit to preference against One Nation and put One Nation last, as the Democrats have indicated they are going to do.</para><para>For that reason, it is important that all parties go on the record about this. We will see soon enough with the how-to-vote cards that are issued over the next few days in Queensland what will happen in that regard. But, if all parties were to do that, it would enable us all to finally focus on some policies in the Queensland election. Unfortunately, 
 there has not been much of that to date because of the focus on the novelty of One Nation's performance.</para><para>The fact is that, if all other parties commit themselves to putting One Nation last, One Nation has no chance of winning a seat. That is why this is a crucial matter for the future of my state of Queensland. Also, it is potentially a future matter for Queensland because I am sure that all senators agree on how divisive and dangerous One Nation's policies are. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>3096</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, this matter is so urgent that it was put off yesterday—which will give you an idea of the urgency of it.

I was about to inform Senator Bartlett that, in the question of Queensland Senate elections, should the now Independent Senator Colston run—and despite our rather diminished view of him—we will send him preferences ahead of One Nation. Nothing could demonstrate to anyone more clearly our commitment to putting One Nation last than sending preferences to Senator Colston or the Queensland First Party if it happens to run with him at the head of the ticket. We can give no clearer indication that we are willing to put the past behind us and prejudice behind us and do that particular thing.

You only have to look back over the last hour to know that the Senate is starting to lose its way. These points were made in a different form and in a different way by Senator Harradine some weeks ago. I think we gave him sympathetic if not actual voting support on that occasion. Every device in the Senate, once it starts to be exploited, just steamrolls. We have seen it in the past with petitions and disallowance motions and everything. We are now getting to the stage where today something like eight or nine or 10 motions have been asked to be carried formally. I think there comes a point in time where the Senate is going to say, `We are not going to carry resolutions without debate.' We can also have the choice of what resolutions we want to debate.

Effectively, they have had just under 12 months to prepare a reply, and they exceeded the normal three-month deadline by some nine months. In that time, they have come up with a startling revelation: that the concerns and the issues raised by the Senate committee on fees and charges being made by schools across this nation are in fact the responsibility of the states. They have attempted to dismiss the concerns of many hundreds of thousands of Australians by buckpassing this issue to the states.</para><para>This government tries to present to the Senate, in this most inadequate and totally unresponsive manner, its views which should best be summed up as `referring it to someone else to deal with', to basically pass it off to other people; to suggest that the volume of evidence presented by the Senate committee is anecdotal and unsubstantiated; and to maintain the great myth, the great lie that this government seeks to assert, that it is maintain 
 ing its commitment to public education in this country.</para><para>The committee report demonstrated, over and over again, the substantial concern of many hundreds of thousands of Australians that the level of support by public education authorities is declining; that in recent years we have seen a devolution of responsibility to schools and, as a consequence, more and more, there is an expectation by governments that it is not governments' responsibility to take care of the legitimate concerns for the educational needs of this country, but that it is for individual parents to meet the funding shortfalls that arise from government policy decisions to reduce government expenditure.</para><para>The Liberal's own National Commission of Audit demonstrated that there was a decline in the level of government spending on school education. Expenditure by all levels of government on schools rose by 2.8 per cent of GDP throughout the 1970s; in the 1980s it rose by a slightly greater amount, but it declined under this government. During the period that this government has been in office, public education support has seen a massive reduction.</para><para>The government tries to maintain that it is increasing its spending, but the lie was revealed in an answer to a question in the estimates committee. In real terms, in the amounts of money actually being spent, in real dollars that are available for the education of the children of this nation, there has been a substantial decline in public support by the governments of this country. Answer to question No. 52 before the Senate education committee demonstrates in real terms that, in 1995-96, $1.338 billion was spent on government education, by this year the figure had fallen to $1.335 billion and in 1998-99 it will fall to $1.318 billion.</para><para>Those figures are quite clear, they are official statistics, yet this government seeks to maintain the lie that it is maintaining its level  of commitment to public education. It seeks to include the additional funds that would normally be applied for inflation or additional students enrolled in the system in the money spent; it does not acknowledge that it is 
 reducing the money spent on public education in real dollar terms.</para><para>The Victorian Commission of Audit demonstrated that, in Victoria today, between six and seven per cent of total education revenue is now being raised by parents at a local level; that is, $155 million is coming out of the pockets of parents as a result of so-called voluntary fees and charges. It is not just that people are being expected to put in a bit extra to fund their child's education, the fact remains that not all parents have equal access to money, not all parents have equal access to opportunity. But what you are seeing under this government is a reduction in the level of opportunity, a reduction in the level of real choice being made available to those who seek to use the public education system.</para><para>The Victorian Auditor-General demonstrated that 16.9 per cent of non-staff school operating costs was raised as a result of fees and charges being levelled by government schools in Victoria. This is a long way from the claims made in this shonky response that this government has presented to this Senate today, which says that there were `unsubstantiated allegations'—not unsubstantiated to the National Commission of Audit, not unsubstantiated to the Victorian Auditor-General. A number of submissions to the committee demonstrated that the real cost to parents of sending their children to government schools is now in the range of 33 to 70 per cent of the non-staff school operating costs as a result of the government cutbacks in that state. Again and again, you see the parents and teachers highlighting to the public that it is not just a question of people not having the capacity to pay.</para><para>Substantial educational issues follow from that. It has been demonstrated again and again that individual children of families who cannot pay these voluntary contributions—these so-called voluntary levies and charges—through various acts of what I would call humiliation, are being embarrassed and their educational opportunities in our schools diminished. Such examples include the withholding of academic reports; the barring of students from graduation ceremonies and other functions; the withholding of education 
 al material such as photocopied handouts; the marking of students as absent so that Austudy and Abstudy payments cease; the linking of student enrolment or re-enrolment to the payment of levies; the sending out of accounts for payments of levies; the use of debt collectors on children in this country; the failure to provide school diaries to students; and the removal of various state government support payments—the school card provisions, for instance, in South Australia.</para><para>We see the denying of the use of books, the refusing of students access to computers and library; the refusal to allow students whose voluntary contributions have not been paid to attend excursions or camps; the withdrawal of curriculum materials from woodwork, cooking or photography classes and so on.</para><para>What the committee demonstrated, again and again, is the use of illicit and, I think, deeply ingrained attempts to humiliate students and force these so-called voluntary payments. The concerns that are raised by the committee go much further than just the question of educational opportunity; they go to some really basic questions about the level of civil rights within the schools in our system.</para><para>This is a situation that is becoming more and more intense as a result of the declining levels of financial support by governments for public education in this country and a retreat by governments from what was once accepted as the universal notion of the right of all children to enjoy access to high quality public education.</para><para>What you have seen is a rapid growth in the use of levies and charges to make up for the shortfalls in funding that are the result of these government policies. What you are seeing is an increasing use of practices by schools to conceal the so-called voluntary nature of these charges and to engage in what can only be described as bullying and heavy-handed tactics to enforce payment.</para><para>What you have here is a Commonwealth government that does not care. It is essentially a Commonwealth government dedicated to the promotion of an elitist view of education—a 
 notion of education that is essentially a 1950s idea—that those who have plenty of money can go to elite schools to enjoy the exclusive conditions of those elite schools and those are the ones who do well in our society. Those who do not have access to large sums of money and do not have access to large sums of disposable cash miss out on educational opportunity. This report is a disgrace.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>3103</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think the comments of Senator Carr are a disgrace. What he is doing is totally misrepresenting evidence. What he is making out to be hard evidence on this matter in reality is just anecdotal evidence. The committee was enormously frustrated in terms of getting any sort of clear picture of what was happening, purely on the basis of a lack of evidence.</para></talk.start><para>Let us look at what is happening broadly in the school system in this country in relation to funding levels. What we have had over a very long period of time is increasing expectations of parents as to what schools should provide. That is fine; we have no problem with that. The difficulty is with finding enough public money to fund such a proposition. Senator Carr makes out that this is a new problem but it is not a new problem, Senator Carr, as you realise. If you look at the minority report you will see a quote going back to the Schools Commission in the early 1980s. It raised a lot of the problems that you are raising in relation to there not being enough money in public schools. It is quite a reasonable proposition, we feel, that parents of children in these schools contribute something towards their education.</para><para>It is quite surprising, however, to find that, far from there being a shortage of public money in education in our public schools, in the case of New South Wales there is an absolutely massive surplus. Let us find out where that is. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> article of 16 April—and as Senator Carr realises, our report was brought down in July last year so we have only the benefit of hindsight with this information; but it makes very interesting reading—lists the funds in reserve that public schools have in the high schools of New South Wales. Senator Carr, it 
 lists all 250 high schools. It has beside it the balances of those high schools.</para><para>We find, for example, that Bossley Park High—not exactly in your North Shore area of Sydney—has reserves of over $1 million. We find that Goulburn High School has $620,000. We can go through a number of areas in the western suburbs of Sydney: Blacktown High School has $250,000; Liverpool High has $340,000; Tempe High School, which is near the centre of Sydney and has some of the poorer suburbs nearby, has $283,000; Wollongong High, in the steel belt, has $219,000; and Young High School has $432,000.</para><para>I found your figure for Victoria interesting, Senator Carr, when you said that parents were asked to chip in $155 million. I do not see any great problem with that: if you divide it by the number of school pupils it is not a huge amount of money. In comparison, in New South Wales, if you look at the total of what I have been talking about—and remember your Victorian figure was $155 million—reserves in New South Wales high schools are $285 million. That is just in the high schools, not primary schools—and that money is sitting there at the moment. It is a matter of great concern to the department's general manager of finance, Ken Dixon. He says that funds allocated to schools are to be expended in general in the year of allocation.</para><para>Senator Carr, you really have to answer this question: if there is such a shortage of funding in public schools, how come they can build up a quarter of a billion dollars in reserves in the state of New South Wales? It is good housekeeping, I am sure, but it does not really paint the poor picture that you are trying to put up.</para><para>The report that was brought down had dissent from the government senators. What we discovered, in listening to the evidence around the country, was that the extra funding of private money in public schools was not significant and that it came in two parts: sponsorships and fees and charges. We found  that in fees and charges these levels were not high and in many states, and in a vast number of schools, there was the opportunity for people who could not pay to make other 
 arrangements. Many of the schemes were voluntary in any case. In the case of sponsorships of schools we found that this was an opportunity for many schools—schools always have limited resources; they always have had and always will—to get extra funding from particular organisations.</para><para>We find totally unacceptable the recommendation of the opposition members of the committee that that sort of funding should be used outside the eight key learning areas only. Obviously schools should have the flexibility to use such funding across a much broader area. The idea of central sponsorships with big companies sponsoring events and the resulting funds spread across schools is attractive to us. But we were not drawn to the suggestion of opposition senators that this should be a centrally managed pool of funds.</para><para>The broad implications of what was presented in the report of the opposition members are basically unrealistic on a number of accounts. They are not based on any hard evidence. We really did not see any evidence, apart from a bit of anecdotal evidence—and systems will go wrong in particular places, obviously—that this is widespread across the system. We did not see any evidence that fees are an onerous burden on people. We did see evidence that there are mechanisms in place in most states to do something about that. We did not see evidence that sponsorships are causing that great a problem.</para><para>In summary, the situation in our schools is that there is quite a reasonable level of funding from the public sector. This is demonstrated by the fact that in New South Wales a quarter of a billion dollars of public money has been salted away. The level of fees is not too high. I think most people would agree that it is reasonable for parents who have children at school to contribute something towards their education. This is not a new idea, Senator Carr. Parents have put in contributions over the whole century.</para><para>The idea that absolutely everything should be free—that hospitals should be free, schools should be free and universities should be free—is very much a Whitlamesque type view. I thought we had left that behind in the seventies. We saw the economic disasters 
 when a government overspending approach applied. There is a feeling in the community that in all these areas the public should contribute, and that in particular the people who use these particular services should make some small contribution.</para><para>We found on the evidence that we have—as I have indicated, it is mostly anecdotal—that there is not a high level of this sort of funding in schools. It is not creating a significant problem. In his description today Senator Carr totally misrepresented what was found in the set of hearings. The evidence really is just anecdotal, but he is trying to make out that it is some sort of scientific evidence. We certainly do not have that. This is not a major problem.</para><para>The responsibility for dealing with the matters raised by the committee rests almost entirely with the states. In the response by the minister to this report he has put most of these matters back in their rightful place. They are things that should be considered by the states through the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>3105</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to make some comments about the government's response to the report of the Employment, Education and Training References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">Not a level playground: private and commercial funding of government schools</inline> .

I have never found it a persuasive argument to say that, just because you are wrong, it is all right to say, `You're wrong because we were wrong too.' Two wrongs do not correct the fault in your case. If I were you, I would urge your government to respond. This is one of those things that convinces people that we are serious about what we do in this place.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government in its response starts off by saying:</para><para>The Commonwealth's policy is that the question of voluntary contributions is the responsibility of individual State and Territory governments. State and Territory governments have previously firmly rejected efforts to obtain national consensus on the issue and have indicated they see the Commonwealth as having no role in this area.</para><para>The response is therefore very disappointing. As I heard my colleague Senator Carr say, the response by the federal government to most of the recommendations is, `That is a state and territory matter. We'll have nothing to do with it.' That is not what the community cares for. The community knows that the Commonwealth has a federal education minister who has an overarching responsibility for education services from schools to tertiary institutions in this country. The government has suggested that the minister's interest is of no relevance and that really it should be left to MCEETYA, which is no more than a council 
 of Commonwealth and state officials. It is not a council that actually responds to ministerial guidelines or directly implements policy. It does the work that allows the implementation of policy, but it is not the committee that should be given responsibility for the running of these things.</para><para>It is cavalier of the Commonwealth government to dismiss its own responsibility—and, I might say, to dismiss it in a contradictory fashion, because with some of the recommendations the government is saying, `It is a state and territory matter, and we have no responsibility,' but in other areas it is saying, `The Commonwealth and the states do work together on this.' What we know, and what everybody said in the committee, is that private funding is necessary for our public schools because government funding for public schools is no longer sufficient for the very many demands on those schools.</para><para>It may well be that the money has increased, but the demands on the schools have increased far more, and therefore there is an ever increasing gap between the funding provided to our public schools—charged, I might say, under state education acts to provide a free secular education. That retreat from `free' is causing major concern, and the committee picked up on this concern, because what it says is that in some areas of our community, particularly in what are short-handedly known as the Eastern Suburbs, schools are able to set fees and charges for parents using that school and that, in large part, those parents are able to meet those fees, but that, in many other areas of our country, people simply cannot find the wherewithal to pay those fees and charges.</para><para>Families creep around, embarrassed and afraid for it to be found out that they are not able to afford those fees and charges. There even are specific arrangements to assist families in hardship to get some extra funding from the schools but, once again, a lot of parents are mortified that they should have to register for this kind of assistance. We have actually made a lot of recommendations in the report about doing it so that the privacy and  decency of families are respected. We have state and territory governments and a 
 Commonwealth government which are all committed to providing education for all Australians but which are not, according to this response, committed to funding it. That is grossly insufficient.</para><para>Secondly, we also have that major point that I have just been alluding to, that the need for private funding has led to a gross inequity in the amount of funding going to schools. As I said, schools in the better-off areas are able to set fees and charges and get that extra assistance; schools in those same areas can also much more readily afford the new technology—computers and so on. They are more likely to have parents who can assist the teachers and the schools with getting sponsorship arrangements that also bring more wealth to those schools, while the schools in the so-called Western Suburbs, the tougher areas in our major states and regions, get further and further behind.</para><para>The number of schools that have access to computers in this country makes a very interesting little map, but certainly many of the schools in the western suburbs and in regional and rural Australia, isolated areas, do not have the same access. If time and time again we hear of the need for access to technology so that our children will at least be able to get the new jobs that require that technology and that kind of training and capacity, then what we are doing is simply writing a formula now for all those children to be further behind the eight ball when they leave their schools.</para><para>This is a report that I thought the government might take much more seriously, because it is a thoughtful and considered report and because, as I say, the committee had very many submissions from many people who were very concerned that the cost of education was pricing education out of affordability for many families. Many families told us, for example, that they had to choose between funding their children for special classes or funding their children for trips and tours. Many families could not afford both, and so their children were being dudded out of some of those visits and trips that the school curriculum decides are important. They also have to deal with the fact that their children are 
 very isolated, alienated, if they are not able to participate with all their school chums.</para><para>I find it an interesting thing too that the government seems to be rejecting any recommendation for decent research, for example, about hard data on the actual cost of education. What does it cost to educate a grade 4 pupil in Australia? We do not know. The government accuses us in this response to the report of saying that the evidence was anecdotal and unsubstantiated in many cases. We say that is exactly the case because we have not got the hard data and research, and we recommended that there be such hard data and research—in other words, that the Commonwealth fund that kind of investigation so that we could say in future what it does cost to educate a grade 4, grade 6 or grade 10 pupil, and then we would have a much better idea of what the level of state and Commonwealth assistance ought to be.</para><para>It is interesting that Senator Tierney was so dismissive of this report: `It is anecdotal; we are not going to worry; it is all made up, and parents out there in the community are not complaining about education.' I do not know where Senator Tierney has been, but the parents that I know are complaining. They are very concerned about the cost of education and they are very concerned that they will not be able to get the best for their children. That is what so many parents actually put their effort into. They will work at second and third jobs; both parents will work, and the highest priority for so many of those parents is to make sure their children get a good education. When people can no longer afford a so-called free secular education, it is time for governments very seriously to have a long hard look at this.</para><para>I find it very disappointing that a Commonwealth government education minister should put out a report that says, `It is not my responsibility.' In the past we have seen education ministers from the states brawling with the Commonwealth minister for education. It has had a very bad effect on the status of teachers, it has had a very bad effect on morale and it has had a very bad effect in  terms of sufficient funding for our schools. The state education ministers know that the 
 Commonwealth's involvement in education is particularly to make sure that they do have adequate funding distributed with equity, and that they get support, so that particularly our children from disadvantaged areas who are doing it tough do get that kind of consideration from the Commonwealth. The government response is a very big disappointment, and parents and families of Australia will judge the government very sternly because of it.</para><para>	Question resolved in the affirmative.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee</title><page.no>3107</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>3107</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>3107</page.no><name role="metadata">Tambling, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator TAMBLING</name><name.id>6E4</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>CLP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I present the government's response to the third report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on two international agreements on tuna, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows</inline>—</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO 3RD REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">TWO INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ON TUNA</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Preamble</inline></para><para>The government has considered the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into the Subsidiary Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan concerning Japanese Tuna Long-line Fishing 1996 and is pleased to provide the following response.

The Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) ensures that this number is not exceeded.</para><para>When the joint venture commenced in 1991, joint venture vessels were permitted to operate north of 34o South (S) off the west coast. This was additional to the 40 bilateral vessels which, at that time, were permitted to operate under the Bilateral Agreement. This was raised as a concern, particularly by the Western Australian fishing sector, as potentially all licensed joint venture vessels and the 40 bilateral longline vessels could have operated off the west coast.</para><para>To address this, from November 1994 joint venture vessels were excluded from operations north of 34o S off the west coast. This restriction will remain if a southern bluefin tuna joint venture proceeds in future.</para><para>AFMA has indicated that it has no difficulty in providing scope for any future joint venture vessels to change to a bilateral licence provided the vessel cap negotiated as part of the Bilateral Agreement is not exceeded. This has been the situation since the joint venture was amended in November 1994.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">2)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government reviews the existing arrangements for potential foreign ownership of fishing licences within the Exclusive Economic Zone or Joint Venture arrangements which may jeopardise the potential to manage fish stocks in the Exclusive Economic Zone.</inline></para><para>The issue of foreign ownership is a matter of broad government policy and may, in specific circumstances be referred to the Foreign Investment Review Board. All proposals above certain thresholds need prior approval and therefore need to be notified to the government. Notification thresholds are: over $5 million for acquisitions of substantial interests in existing businesses; $10 million or more for the establishment of new businesses; and $20 million or more for offshore take-overs. The government normally raises no objections to proposals above the notification thresholds where the relevant total assets/total investments is below $50 million.</para><para>However, in this instance the Commonwealth Government has reviewed the existing arrangements for foreign ownership or joint venture arrangements within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and considers that they do not provide for any arrangements which may jeopardise the potential to manage fish stocks in the EEZ. 
</para><para>There is no provision in fisheries legislation providing specific control on foreign ownership of fishing rights. All tuna longline operations within the EEZ are subject to management arrangements administered by AFMA in accordance with the Fisheries Management Act 1991. Domestic longline arrangements apply to Australian boats, and these are developed by AFMA in conjunction with the appropriate fisheries Management Advisory Committee (MAC). This means that operators, including foreigners, who may own Australian boats and licences are subject to the same management arrangements.</para><para>Japanese vessels are the only foreign flag operators which have been permitted in recent years to longline for tuna in the EEZ either under a government to government agreement (Bilateral Agreement) or through the joint venture (which requires an agreement with the Commonwealth, through AFMA).</para><para>Both the Bilateral and joint venture agreements specify stringent terms and conditions under which Japanese longline vessels can operate. The terms and conditions are more restrictive than those applying to domestic operators. All foreign operators are licensed and are subject to conditions such as inspections, observer coverage, vessel monitoring systems and are generally restricted to waters where there is limited domestic activity.</para><para>The government believes the arrangements outlined above support and strengthen AFMA's ability to sustainably manage Australia's fish stocks.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">3)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the subsidiary agreement on long-line tuna fishing with Japan be for a timeframe of at least two years.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Government agrees that there would be benefits in moving towards a longer term agreement, including administrative savings, a better planning environment and a more appropriate timeframe within which to address complex issues. However, the government believes that important external issues such as the setting of annual national catch allocations by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), domestic management arrangements, environmental perturbations and economic changes may erode the extent of such benefits. These issues are dynamic and a flexible approach is required in order that the government is able to respond in a timely manner to the needs of the fishery and to secure the best benefits for Australia (external issues such as those mentioned above may lead to considerable pressure for an annual review of the terms of any multi year agreement, from either Australian or Japanese interests, depending on the circumstances).</para><para>In giving in principle support to multi-year agreements, it will be important to develop a clear 
 framework and schedule to deal with these pressures, including an elaboration of the mechanisms provided for in the current negotiation process, or there may be frequent ad hoc demands to implement mid-term changes to the Agreement. Should any changes to the Agreement be negotiated during a mid-term review process, these changes would be subject to the treaties procedure and be tabled in Parliament. It will be in Australia's interest to minimise the potential for mid-term changes to the Agreement, otherwise it will be unlikely that there would result any decrease in the workload incurred or in the frequency with which matters relating to the Agreement would need to be subject to scrutiny.</para><para>The Commonwealth agrees that a properly constructed multi-year agreement, which takes into account fisheries management needs and recognises that it is essentially a negotiated commercial arrangement, would be beneficial.</para><para>This is particularly the case if multiple year quotas can be agreed in the CCSBT, which would strengthen the case for a multiple year Bilateral Agreement. However, the Commonwealth Government notes that the adoption of such an approach would need whole of government support, including a revision of the way fishing and port access are dealt with, and may also necessitate consideration of alterations to the fee structure and access arrangements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">SBT Certification</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">4)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government raises the issue of the introduction of a certificate system for southern bluefin tuna within the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.</inline></para><para>Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna</para><para>Australia has already sought consideration of a certificate of origin scheme for SBT within the CCSBT regime and within the annual meetings of the tripartite management discussions held prior to the formation of the CCSBT. In 1993, Australia formally proposed a certification system similar to that implemented within the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to be introduced into the SBT fishery. Japan did not support adoption of such a scheme. After being pressed on the issue again in 1994, Japan opposed any attempt to require documentation of SBT trade. Japanese concern reputedly centres on the administrative burden that such a scheme would impose, a concern that Australia shares.</para><para>It should also be noted that a certification scheme, although useful for tracking fish in transit, only achieves its full value if monitored and enforced at 
 the market for the fish. In the case of SBT, the main markets are in Japan. In such a system Japan would carry responsibility for the administration and integrity of the system for imports from all countries. Further, as Japan is not technically importing product from its own vessels' high seas activities, such Japanese catch may fall outside any certification scheme. Also, catches by Korea and Taiwan are increasingly being directed towards their home markets. Within these contexts, Australia will continue to consider ways of introducing a practicable certification scheme.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Indian Ocean Tuna Commission</inline></para><para>The first meeting of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) was held in December 1996. This new organisation has many complex administrative and scientific issues to resolve in developing a strong tuna management regime in the Indian Ocean. Certification schemes are important tools that will need to be examined as part of that management regime. For tunas other than SBT, Australia sees the first step as being the establishment of basic fishery management measures. For SBT, Australia has pressed within the IOTC that the CCSBT has precedence over SBT management wherever the fish occurs. Australia will continue to argue strongly in the IOTC and other relevant forums that a SBT management scheme should be developed and managed within the CCSBT.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Indian Ocean Tuna Commission</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">5)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government:</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">a)	 notes Western Australia's particular interest in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission;</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">b)	 facilitates their participation in the delegation to and any consultations relating to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission where possible.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Government has fully consulted with the Government of Western Australia on IOTC issues and has extended an invitation for the Western Australian Government to participate in Australian delegations to IOTC meetings.

Where possible AFMA attempts to facilitate communication between fishermen to minimise these incidents. Instances of gear conflict in waters adjacent to Tasmania occurred several years ago, when there were 40 joint venture licensed Japanese vessels operating in addition to the 10 vessels licensed through the Bilateral Agreement. The large numbers of Japanese vessels fished co-operatively by allocation of lanes in which to set their longlines. The Australian Tuna Boat Owners Association (ATBOA) prepared guidelines advocating sharing of details of line setting location and time between the Japanese and local domestic. The number of Japanese longliners operating off Tasmania is now markedly reduced and the incidence of gear conflict has been negligible.</para><para>In the period of the last Agreement (1996) there was only one reported instance of gear conflict which was off the NSW coast. In response to this report AFMA immediately notified the Japanese industry indicating that it should maintain a radio watch and communicate with domestic operators to resolve issues. The observers present on the boats operating in the area were advised to facilitate any dialogue. Even though it was only one isolated instance the issue was subsequently raised at the negotiations with the government of Japan when reporting on compliance in the past season. If there was a failure to co-operate, the area of access may be changed, excluding foreign vessels from the areas where gear conflict occurs.</para><para>Japan has complained of alleged gear theft in the east coast fishery, presumably by domestic fishers. AFMA has again attempted to facilitate communications with the Japanese fleet to ensure subsequent investigations are timely and effective, though to date there has been insufficient evidence on which to base conclusive investigations of the allegations.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">8)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government 
 creates, as a matter of national consistency, an exclusion zone for the Bilateral and Joint Venture Japanese long-line fishing vessels around Tasmania of 50 nautical miles.</inline></para><para>The government supports the progressive Australianisation of tuna fisheries, however, it believes that an exclusion to 50 nautical miles (nm) around Tasmania at this time would be premature, especially given current reduced levels of Japanese activity.</para><para>Japanese fishing adjacent to Tasmania brings considerable economic benefit to the State and Commonwealth. The port of Hobart benefits from Japanese access to the AFZ through the use of port facilities, victualling and recreation. Japan has stated previously it cannot accept a 50 nm exclusion adjacent to Tasmania since some high catch rate areas for SBT which attract its vessels to the AFZ are between 20 to 50 nm off Tasmania. A substantial further restriction off Tasmania would jeopardise general bilateral activity and the potential for a future joint venture adjacent to Tasmania, because it is likely that Japanese vessels would choose not to fish the Tasmanian area at all if the 50 nm limit were applied.</para><para>The Commonwealth received $425,000 from Japan in 1997 as a component of the bilateral access fee for enabling a specified number of its vessels to fish for Japanese SBT quota in the AFZ adjacent to Tasmania. In negotiating the 1997 bilateral access arrangements the Commonwealth's approach was, cognisant of the Inquiry's recommendation, to increase the exclusion zone from 12 to 17 nm from the coast. There are important other benefits associated with Japanese access off Tasmania, including data collection on both SBT and seabirds through the AFZ observer programme. The Commonwealth regards this information as vital to its management of SBT and obtaining information on the incidental capture of seabirds including albatross. It also maintains an important link with the high seas activities of the Japanese fleet.</para><para>Japanese activity peaks adjacent to Tasmania during May to July. In 1996 only 10 Japanese boats operated in the area. This is substantially less than previous years due to the cessation of the joint venture and is likely to decrease further in 1997. During the May to July period a maximum of six domestic boats operated in any one month. With such small numbers of vessels the potential for gear conflict appears slight.</para><para>On balance, the government believes its approach in reducing Japanese access from 12 nm to outside 17 nm is appropriate, given the benefits Australia derives from this arrangement, but that this be regularly reviewed in light of the level of Australian activity in waters adjacent to Tasmania.

A paper on the issue was discussed at the July 1997 meeting of the Ministerial Council on Forestry, Fisheries and Aquaculture (MCFFA). The Ministerial Council agreed to give its `in principle' support for day-to-day management of the recreational and charter sectors of Commonwealth-managed fisheries by the States and Northern Territory, noting Queensland's position that jurisdiction for recreational and charter fishing for tunas and billfish should remain under Commonwealth jurisdiction. A revised policy paper concerning recreational and charter fishing will be released by Commonwealth and State agencies for public comment in the first half of 1998.</para><para>The views of the Treaties Committee on recreational and charter boat fishing, along with the concept of optimal utilisation, will be considered in developing the Commonwealth's position on recreational and charter fishing management.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">10)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government undertakes a full assessment of the relative values of the recreational, game and long-line fisheries and their compatibility as a basis for determining the most appropriate management arrangements for the fishery and the degree of access to be allocated to each sector.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth agrees that an assessment of the relative values to the different user groups of the fish resource provides important information to underpin consideration of how to allocate access to the resource in the most efficient and equitable manner. Both the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (through the Fisheries Resources Research Fund (FRRF)) and AFMA have commissioned studies on options for valuing recreational and commercial fishing. These initial studies indicate there are many complex issues which would need to be addressed in a full assessment of practical methods for valuing and allocating access 
 among users. Furthermore, any outcome will likely be contested by one or more of the affected groups.</para><para>One issue relates to the many claims that have been made by the gamefish/recreational sector that the value (in dollar terms) of a billfish to it is far greater than to the commercial fishing sector. There are a range of techniques which could be used to establish values for the different sectors using the bill fish resource, though estimating values is difficult for the charter boat and recreational sectors, and comparing "like with like" presents major challenges. For the longline sector it is relatively simple to establish value through the use of standard production approaches, although an important requirement of establishing values for this sector is that there is provision of accurate information by operators.</para><para>For the charter boat industry, values would be more difficult to establish. Prices for boat charter and capture rates of game fish could be used to calculate a value for this sector. However, the problem with such a calculation is that it would be difficult to separate the proportion of the charter price which is associated with the fish resource, as opposed to a number of other factors. These include the quality of the charter service, whether the operator is charging a fair price and the actual importance of capturing fish to the charterer.</para><para>Establishing values for recreational fishing is probably the most difficult task. If there is market information associated with recreational fishing then this should be identified and considered in the context of the characteristics of the particular type of recreational fishing for which a management decision is to be made. A range of non-market valuation techniques could be used to estimate dollar values for recreational fishing.</para><para>The application of these techniques is usually complicated and there is no assurance that the estimates will be reliable. Further, the Commonwealth notes that, even if dollar values at a given time can be estimated, allocation on the basis of relative value is complicated by the fact that values change over time.</para><para>Finally, the Commonwealth recognises that while relative values in dollar terms are of importance in considering allocation of access, the range of impacts, costs and benefits which cannot be expressed in dollar terms should be taken into account when developing fishery management strategies. For example, relative and cumulative impacts on the status of the marine resource must be considered, in conjunction with estimates of the relative values of fishing by various groups.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">11) 	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government require all Japanese longline vessels fishing in the 
 Exclusive Economic Zone to cut free all marlin (alive or dead), without removal from the ocean.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth has agreed to ban the take of blue and black marlin by commercial fishing operators. The ban will apply to both domestic operators and Japanese tuna longlining vessels operating in the Australian fishing zone under the Subsidiary Agreement. The ban will be effected by the introduction of legislation in early 1998 which requires commercial fishermen to return blue and black marlin to the sea whether dead or alive.</para><para>The Commonwealth recognises the high value placed on blue and black marlin by game fishers in comparison with the commercial catching sector, which regards blue and black marlin as an unintended bycatch. The introduction of the legislation aims to acknowledge these values by establishing an appropriate allocation of resources between the two sectors.</para><para>Under the new legislation, domestic operators may retain as part of the commercial fishery, striped marlin. Japanese vessels will be required to cut free all marlin species caught in the AFZ (alive or dead) without removal from the ocean. In addition, under the bilateral agreement, Japan has agreed that its vessels will not target any billfish (except broadbill swordfish).</para><para>A difficulty with the legislation, particularly in relation to Japanese vessels, is the issue of compliance. Japanese longline boats will have on board in freezer holds high seas' caught marlin from the same stocks which can not be distinguished from `in-zone' catch. These marlin will have been caught outside the AFZ, both from the high seas and neighbouring countries' EEZ's, in areas where there are no restrictions on their retention.</para><para>This problem may be overcome by arranging for the Japanese longline vessels to inform Australian authorities of the amount of marlin on a vessel at the time at which it enters the AFZ. Through random inspections either at sea or during victualling at an Australian port, such information could then be verified.</para><para>Partly in recognition of concerns over Japanese catch of important recreational/charter marlin species, a range of area closures and restrictions on fishing methods have been applied to the Japanese, including exclusion from the East Coast Tuna and Billfish Fishery management area off Cairns, known as Area E, and 50 nm closures off the east and west coasts.</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">12)	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends that the Commonwealth Government undertakes a review of the existing tuna fishing technology to determine if modifications could be made to reduce the bycatch of non-target species.</inline></para><para>The minimisation of the impact of fishing operations on the environment, including non-target 
 species, is a requirement under Objective 3(1)(b) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991.</para><para>From industry's viewpoint, there is a financial interest in maximising the catch of high value target species and avoiding bycatch of non commercial species. A range of collaborative work with industry has been carried out and is planned for the future, including research into fishing practices, development of more selective fishing gear and improved mitigation devices. Environment Australia is also preparing a consultative Threat Abatement Plan which aims to minimise seabird bycatch.</para><para>Research into the reduction of seabird bycatch in tuna longline operations is on-going. The development of tori poles, or bird scaring devices, is a major step forward and an example of what can be developed through co-operative research involving industry operators. Regulations have been put in place to require the use of tori poles by domestic and foreign longline operators south of 30o South latitude. Furthermore the Commonwealth continues to work with industry and researchers on ways to improve bycatch mitigation measures, whether for seabirds or other incidental bycatch.</para><para>In the case of billfish, specifically blue and black marlin, research is under way to determine where in the longline hauling process these species are taken. Preliminary research indicates that blue and black marlin are taken at a shallower depth than the target tuna species (generally bigeye and yellowfin tuna), i.e. during the deployment or hauling of the longline.</para><para>However, to accurately determine longline performance sophisticated electronic equipment (such as hook monitors which measure depth and water temperature) and longline deployment gear (line shooters) are required. The former is not yet commercially available and the latter is quite costly and generally only carried by large vessels dedicated exclusively to tuna fishing. It is anticipated that as the domestic fishery continues to expand, the technology employed by industry to accurately position their longline in the thermocline will be refined and result in cleaner catches of target species.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Port Access</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">13) 	 The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommends the separation of port access from the subsidiary agreement but making port access subject to the continuation of Japan's membership of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and participation in Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth is supportive of a reconsideration of the structure for the Bilateral Agreement, including the option of separating port and fishing access, but in doing so recognises the need to fully assess the implications of any changes proposed. 
</para><para>In developing any alternative arrangement careful consideration needs to be given to ways of securing the management and research funding derived from the current arrangements, as well as the important issues of the longer term financial and other benefits gained by providing Japan with privileged access to our fishing zone. The provision of port access, without effective means to secure Japan's collaboration in effective international monitoring regimes, could work quickly to erode the integrity of the CCSBT and put the full range of benefits we seek to secure for our domestic industry (both fishing and port servicing sectors) at considerable risk.</para><para>The Committee's recommendation recognises the risks that giving unfettered port access to Japanese fishing vessels may lead to adverse impacts on the sustainability of the fish stocks if these vessels fish on the high seas without effective management and regulation. The recent identification of forty Japanese vessels fishing in breach of Japan's domestic fisheries management regulations on the high seas off the south western AFZ has highlighted the realities of this risk.</para><para>To address the risk, the Committee has suggested that any separate port access arrangement must be linked to responsible participation in regional management regimes, such as the CCSBT. The Commonwealth strongly supports this approach, but believes it should go further and deal with a range of related issues not directly addressed in the Committee's report. These include implications for access fees, the incentive to fish in the AFZ, links with the CCSBT and the potential impacts on local fishing and port economies around Australia.</para><para>Notwithstanding these issues, as Australia's domestic tuna fisheries expand, a reduction in Japanese fishing activity in the AFZ is considered likely in the mid to longer term. Under such a scenario, a progressive restructuring of the access arrangement to provide a greater separation of fishing and port access, with strong obligations imposed for co-operation on data and monitoring needs, may suit both countries in the medium term.</para><para>Based on the Committee's recommendation and the additional issues identified above, the government is at present evaluating alternate approaches to providing for both fishing and port access in an administratively simple and effective way while securing the wider range of benefits and realistic returns to Australia.</para><para>Any approach must seek to meet Australia's interests in securing effective co-operation and compliance with responsible regional fisheries management regimes.

This measure is in itself a significant guarantee of the independence of the Auditor-General from Executive Government.</para><para>In its Report No. 346, <inline font-style="italic">Guarding the Independence of the Auditor-General</inline> , tabled in October 1996, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that it be given a statutory power to consider and report on draft budget estimates of the Audit Office as part of the then Auditor-General Bill.

 wealth Employment—Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998.</para><para>This main purpose of the bill is to ensure that the Commonwealth's civilian employees can participate in our choice of funds policy announced in the 1997 Budget. This will give them greater flexibility and control over their superannuation arrangements.</para><para>At present, many Commonwealth employees are tied to membership of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) or the closed Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS). The bill will close the PSS to new members from 1 July 1998 and new employees will be able to choose from superannuation arrangements made available by their employers. My colleague the Minister for Finance and Administration announced on 13 May 1998 that the closure of the PSS and the repeal of the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 would be deferred until 1 July 1999. The Government will be moving a number of requests for amendments to the bill in relation to these matters.</para><para>From 1 July 2000, CSS and PSS members will, if they wish, be able to cease active membership and choose the alternative superannuation arrangements made available by their employers. The bill will provide for the entitlements of CSS members who exercise choice to be based on the resignation deferred benefit, but adjusted to ensure no windfall gains for members or increase in unfunded liabilities.</para><para>The bill will make a number of other amendments to various superannuation acts covering civilian employees. For example, it includes amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 to allow CSS members to transfer amounts held in the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust or other funds to the CSS Fund. It will also amend that act so that reversionary benefits may be paid to a CSS pensioner's spouse or child from a post-retirement relationship with fewer restrictions than currently apply. Similar changes are made in respect of spouses' benefits under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948.</para><para>In addition, the bill provides for modifications to the superannuation redundancy entitlement arrangements for employees who cease to be CSS or PSS members as a result of a sale or outsourcing, in the terms announced in June 1997. In line with the operational date of the new preservation arrangements to apply to the general workforce, the bill will provide for preservation from 1 July 1999 of the employer financed component of a CSS or PSS lump sum superannuation redundancy payment.</para><para>The bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976, with effect from 5 December 1997, to restore its original intention in relation to the acceptance of late elections for preservation of rights. The operation of this provision has been changed 
 progressively by interpretations placed upon it by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court. The changes included in the bill are designed to balance out the interests of the Commonwealth with the interests of current CSS members and former members, who seek to make a late election. Without these changes the Commonwealth could continue to incur costs in the order of $10 million per year.</para><para>Finally, to simplify and streamline the administration of our civilian superannuation arrangements, the bill includes amendments to simplify the operation of relevant legislation and subsequently repeals a number of acts applying to those arrangements. Savings and transitional provisions relating to these repealed acts are included in the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment—Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998 contained in this package. The other bill in the package, the Commonwealth Superannuation Board Bill 1998, will provide for new rationalised administration arrangements for the closed schemes and for the continued administration of the repealed acts by a new Board, the Commonwealth Superannuation Board.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Financial Implications</inline></para><para>This bill will result in a net increase in Budget outlays as a result of increased funding of future superannuation accruals. However, this will be offset by a reduction in future unfunded superannuation liabilities. The financial implications of the bill are explained in more detail in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>COMMONWEALTH SUPERANNUATION BOARD Bill 1998</para><para>The Commonwealth Superannuation Board Bill is part of a package of three bills, the other bills being the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 1998 and the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment—Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1998.</para><para>This bill will establish a new Commonwealth Superannuation Board to administer the closed Commonwealth superannuation schemes and, where determined, other schemes covering Commonwealth civilian employees.</para><para>The Board will comprise an equal number of member and employer representatives and will have an independent chairman appointed with the agreement of the other Board members. Member representatives will be elected by scheme members.</para><para>The new Board will have greater responsibility for administering the rules relating to the Commonwealth's closed superannuation schemes subject to 
 certain caveats, including in relation to the employer costs of the schemes.</para><para>The Board will be able to recover its administrative costs from employing agencies. Budget funded agencies not currently meeting these costs will receive the funding that was previously allocated to ComSuper.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Financial Impact</inline></para><para>This bill does not involve any additional Budget outlays.</para><para>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION (COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT—SAVING AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1998</para><para>The Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment—Saving and Transitional Provisions) Bill is part of a package of three bills, the other bills being the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 1998 and the Commonwealth Superannuation Board Bill 1998.</para><para>This bill will put in place saving and transitional provisions as a consequence of certain amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 and the subsequent repeal of the Superannuation Act 1976, Superannuation Act 1990, Superannuation Act 1922, Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 and the amendment of the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973 as provided for by the Superannuation Legislation (Commonwealth Employment) Repeal and Amendment Bill 1998.</para><para>The bill will also ensure that the Commonwealth Superannuation Board will continue to use ComSuper for the provision of scheme administrative services for a period of at least three years from 1 July 1998.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Financial Impact</inline></para><para>This bill does not involve any additional Budget outlays.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carr</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>3118</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>3118</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives notifying changes in the membership of joint committees as follows—</para><para>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade—Joint Standing Committee, Mr Prosser in place of Mr Sinclair.

It was interesting that it came through in that debate that somehow we can allow employees choices about whole aspects of their lives—their jobs, whether they get married, whether they have children; all those important things—but we dare not, apparently, according to some of the speakers, allow employees to make choices about their superannuation. The decision as to which fund invests their money seems at present to almost be a random accident of who happens to be their employer. Employees who want to entrust contributions to another fund cannot do so. We believe that this is undemocratic, uncompetitive, unfair and unAustralian. The government's bill brings in our view greater democracy, fairness and competition to Australia's superannuation industry.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Australian Labor Party and the Democrats have put forward detailed alternatives to choice. These alternatives are unacceptable to the government. There are a number of reasons why they are unacceptable but one is paramount—neither the Democrats nor Labor guarantee employees any choice of a superannuation fund at all. The government believes employees should have the right to choose their superannuation fund, just like they have the right to choose their home loan, the sort of car they buy or what political party they vote for. We give employees all these rights, but I have always said that when it is a choice between trade union interests and worker rights it is always easy to see where the Labor Party will come down.</para><para>The government cannot accept choice of fund legislation that does not provide employees with a right to choose.

I regret to say that the end point of continuing in this vein is evident: we would use up a very large amount of Senate time—that was clearly the intention of the Labor Party senators—yet we would probably not have a 
 bill that would guarantee choice of fund and open competition, which is important from the government's perspective.</para><para>Such a course of events would jeopardise the prospect of a number of other measures in the bill, particularly the savings rebate, and I can see we are going to have an interesting debate on that as well. The government simply cannot accept this, and I wish to emphasise that the government will continue negotiations with all other parties in an attempt to reach an acceptable position on the choice measure. The government believes that if other parties put the interests of employees first, such an arrangement could be made so that a choice bill could be passed, hopefully in the these sittings of the Senate.</para><para>To this effect, the government will be seeking to introduce the choice bill in the other place as soon as possible and will be seeking consideration of this new bill at an appropriate time during these sittings.

I totally reject that accusation. One of the frustrating things in dealing with this government and particularly with you, Minister, is that we do not get answers of substance to questions. I put on the record last night seven or eight questions relating to the issue of choice—and, indeed, the rebate issue—and the effect it has on private savings. This is a very important issue which I must say, Senator Kemp, you have done your very best to avoid since becoming a minister. You have done your very best to avoid direct, succinct, accurate and relevant answers to questions in respect of this issue. I reject the issue of filibustering.</para></talk.start><para>I am not going to take up a lot of time but I want to briefly respond to a couple of the other points you made. You made the point in your comments, and you have made it on a number of other occasions, about what is wrong with Australians having the right to 
 choose. Superficially that is a statement of some appeal, but you neglect to acknowledge that, unlike purchasing a house, purchasing insurance or even getting married, superannuation in this country is compulsory. It is compulsory for employees to be members of a superannuation fund. They have to do it. You do not have to buy life insurance, you do not have to buy a house, and you do not even have to get married.</para><para>So we have a system, very similar to Chile's, where it is compulsory to have private superannuation. What you consistently fail to address are the failings of a system such as Chile's. It is a very good working example, with some horrific outcomes, of where superannuation is compulsory. There are very significant flaws in a model that forces choice.</para><para>I would like you at some stage—obviously not in this debate because you are withdrawing schedule 5—to attempt to explain how we are to overcome the problems of a choice model. As well as the problems of inducement and coercion in respect to people being forced into a particular superannuation product, there is the fundamental problem we have in this country of between two million and 2½ million people being functionally illiterate. How on earth are they to sit down with these key feature statements and analyse, in a compulsory superannuation savings environment, what is in their best interests when they cannot even read or write? You can have all the education campaigns in the world, all the television advertising, all the literature going out and people being bombarded with propaganda, but how are they to understand what they cannot read? That is one of the fundamental failures of a full choice regime.</para><para>Even in the United Kingdom, and I gave examples, where people were convinced that choice was good for them, about one million people withdrew from very good superannuation funds to join a model—wrapped in the rhetoric of freedom and choice—imposed on them by the then Thatcher government. Of the one million people who exercised choice, 900,000 of them got ripped off. These were not illiterate people, either. They were teach 
 ers, miners and public servants who could certainly read and write, as I understand it, but they got ripped off to the tune of £10 billion. This is a very good example of the Thatcher government's ideological obsession to impose compulsory choice—a contradiction in terms—and people who were well educated got ripped off.</para><para>The government has not attempted to explain, not only to the Senate but to the Australian people, how people will be better off under a choice regime. What I find most ironic, if not obnoxious, Senator Kemp, in your government's approach to its argument on choice is that when employers kicked up about the choice model, you backtracked. Employers did not want full freedom of choice. Employers did not want the employee to have the ability to say, `I want my superannuation paid into my particular fund' because employers feared the administrative difficulties that would emerge. Theoretically, if employers employ 100 different people, they would have to pay superannuation into 100 different funds.</para><para>When the employers pressured you and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, you quickly backtracked. You put a veto on choice, and the veto is: if the employer does not agree, there is no choice. You know that the employers were very concerned about the administrative difficulties of paying into a multitude of different funds on employee demand. So the very model that you were offering—in the guise of freedom and choice and the other rhetoric you surround it with—is in fact employer choice.</para><para>I am gravely disappointed, Senator Kemp. The ongoing debate about superannuation has convinced Labor that, where an employee wants to opt out of a particular fund and it is administratively convenient for an employer, and the employee and the employer mutually agree—this is your approach—at a workplace, that is not a bad thing. This is reflected in the Labor amendments. So it is a grave disappointment to me that you have got uptight and upset. The numbers do not look good for you, although we will see how the cards fall in the Senate. But you have started pouting and blowing out your bottom lip.</para><para>We want this debate on choice. We want debate on the amendments that Labor is proposing that provide fundamental employee choice—worker rights. We welcome that debate, and we want to see our amendments, which improve your choice model, passed by this Senate. We are very gravely disappointed that, in your fit of pique, you have withdrawn it. That is a grave disappointment. But we would still like answers to the questions that were posed last night by me and my colleagues Senator Conroy and Senator Hogg. I think they were very relevant questions for this debate.</para><para>I will conclude by saying that this issue of employee choice of superannuation, which is effectively the deregulation of the retail market, is one of the most radical prescriptions—economic changes, fundamental changes—that your government has proposed. We will agree on that, I suspect. It is one of the most radical changes, that will affect millions of Australians. The overriding principle must be: will it generate a higher retirement income for Australians who have superannuation? That is the overwhelming principle. It is not whether it is in the best interests of banks, life agents, the money markets, financial managers or life companies. It is what is in the best interests of Australian consumers, millions of Australians who have superannuation, and fundamentally your model fails the test.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>3122</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Firstly, can I thank Senator Kemp for withdrawing schedule 5.

Today's papers are again pleading with the government to reconsider its choice regime—because it has not been initiated by employers; it certainly has not been initiated by employees. I would like to think it is not a 
 factor that you are struggling to get through your legislative program. I understand that MIB is also possibly not going to get before the chamber because of that legislative program. I really do hope that you are genuine when you say you would like consultations and you would like to try and find a choice regime that everybody in this chamber can support.

You have not been prepared to discuss those issues. You have not been prepared to come

We think there should be further discussions and we think that a compromise could be reached on this issue.' The sides are not really that far apart if Senator Kemp and the government is interested in achieving choice for employees—not achieving choice for employers, which is what this bill does. There is not that much between us. So I would hope that everybody will be willing to sit down in the next few weeks and have some discussions about that, Senator Kemp. I hope that that is the case.</para><para>As Senator Sherry said, the key here is whether we will see retirement incomes for ordinary working Australians improved through choice. That is the bottom line; those are the key tests that the government has to be prepared to demonstrate to the Senate and to the broader Australian community. How do we address that? How do we give choice to people who cannot read bus timetables? How do we help them to understand the issues so that they can pick up the key feature statements and look at the earning rates and the crediting rates. Most Australians would not know that there is a difference between an earning rate and a crediting rate—a very important issue.</para><para>Super funds of all complexions—I include industry funds in this—should not be able to highlight a crediting rate to disguise their earning rate. It is very important that Australians know how their superannuation fund is performing, not what they are being credited, not what reserve is being brought into play. It is important that they know whether money is being syphoned off in the good years to pad out the bad years. Those are very important issues.</para><para>I know we have a busy schedule and that there is plenty of legislation before the chamber but, hopefully, we will have time to discuss issues such as these. We need to ensure that there is full and proper disclosure, that there is no third line forcing, that there is 
 no capacity for spivs to approach employers and say, `Here's the package. Here's how we'll do this: you put all your employees into my little package. Maybe we can talk about the Chile situation where they have kickbacks.' Everything from brown paper envelopes to lotteries, to free mobile phones, to cheap loans have come into play in Chile.</para><para>We have seen the shocking outcomes in England where many people have been convinced to leave their super fund and join a new super fund, which is far inferior, and then have not been able to switch back to defined benefit funds. These are the sorts of issues in the government's legislation and they desperately need to be addressed and desperately need further discussion. I hope they will also be part of the debate and discussions that we are going to have in the next few weeks.</para><para>I leave that with Senator Kemp because I know he will want to move onto the savings rebate. I know he is looking forward to telling us about how the savings rebate is going to improve national savings, despite what Ted Evans the secretary of Treasury said. I know he is looking forward to doing that. I know Senator Cook is ready to ask a series of questions. I hope the government and Senator Kemp are genuine about discussing the choice regime, because I will certainly be involved. I absolutely object to the suggestion that we have been filibustering.</para><para>I am passionately committed on these issues; anybody in this chamber will tell you that. I am passionately committed to making sure that ordinary working Australians have decent retirement incomes and that they are not being dealt with in a mean minded manner.

In fact, I have never been in the chamber and seen people more keen to ask questions and less willing to receive answers. Senator Conroy chalked up about 30 questions, and he was backed up by Senator Bishop and Senator Hogg. They all came up with a fascinating series of questions. As we analysed them this morning, we noted the overlaps. Nonetheless, a lot of questions were put on notice, and I assume that at least some of them were put in with a degree of sincerity and want answers. Therefore, I shall respond to those that relate to the bill currently before the chamber.</para></talk.start><para>One of the issues raised—I think this was touched on by Senator Conroy and Senator Jacinta Collins—was how the mere distribution of moneys from a trust contribute to the national savings when the moneys received by the beneficiaries do not have to be saved. If we cut through a lot of the comments, we can see that the question asked by Senator Jacinta Collins was similar to the question asked by Senator Conroy.</para><para>In response to the general comments, the government has examined the available evidence on the provision of tax concessions for savings. A great deal of work has been done in looking at the various savings vehicles, and particularly international experiences where the concessions have been offered on savings and specific savings vehicles.</para><para>The evidence points to increased savings in the particular vehicles without necessarily resulting in a net increase in national savings in the countries concerned. The upshot of this is that the least distortionary approach was to provide a broad based concession, as the government proposes to do. Trust distributions may not have been saved by the beneficiary but this is not the point. The distributions result from earnings on particular investments that the trustee has made, which is a form of savings. A broad based incentive is in our view— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—It is not generating economic gain.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—Senator Conroy, you are not at a Labor Party conference or a faction meeting, you are in the Senate chamber.

If you can keep quiet for about three minutes, I will deal with the first part of the question that you asked.</para></talk.start></continue><para>A broad based incentive is the best way to encourage an increase in national savings; the government does not want to merely change the composition of Australian savings. If you put extra conditions on the incentive, for example, only new savings—and I think that was one of the issues—or savings held for a certain period, you would, by definition, attract less savings.</para><para>There will always be people who do not want to accept the condition, whatever it is. The group of people who are encouraged to change their behaviour would be smaller. A condition of `new savings' only encourages people to shift to so-called new savings. The point is that a savings rebate with any design limitations will thereby suffer limitations in its chances for success. Accordingly, the savings rebate has been deliberately designed to reward current savers and encourage new savers.</para><para>As I have said, that was a question asked by Senator Conroy. I am pleased that he has been able to keep quiet for a few seconds so that he could listen to the response.</para><para>Senator Sherry asked me to outline in detail what the precise addition to private and national savings of the savings rebate is. I think that is probably a fair summary, Senator Sherry, of the question that you put to me. I will try not to pout, Senator Sherry, in giving my response to you. Of all the things you said, Senator Sherry, a lot washes over one's shoulder, but that rather surprised me.</para><para>Projections by the retirement income modelling unit, RIM, indicate that the government's superannuation policies, including measures announced in the 1996-97 and 1997-98 budgets, will lead to an increase in net private 
 financial savings of 1.7 per cent of GDP by the year 2000-01, and 3.9 per cent of GDP by 2019-20; and an increase in national financial savings of 1.5 per cent of GDP by the year 2000-01, and 3.6 per cent of GDP by 2020. This projection assumes no behavioural response to the savings rebate.</para><para>If it is assumed that there is a 12 per cent increase in member superannuation contributions as a result of the savings rebate—for example, that is one-third of the response assumed for the former government's co-contribution policy—it would produce member contributions exceeding the cost of the savings rebate on undeducted member contributions alone. The potential increase in private savings is projected to be 0.1 per cent of GDP by 2000-01 and 0.2 per cent of GDP from 2019-20—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">CONROY</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—It is the net effect.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name></talker><para>—We have assumed no behavioural change, and now we are looking at making very modest assumptions.

National savings are projected to increase by a further 0.2 per cent of GDP by 2001, and 0.4 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. So these are some examples.</para><para>The projection of behavioural responses is very hard, as I think was discussed in Senate estimates hearings. I believe, Senator Conroy, you probably did not quite accurately quote Ted Evans's comments there because I think, resulting from an earlier intervention by you, he made some further comments—and I am sure that, if you want me to, we can read those to the chamber.</para><para>As I have said, the modelling by the retirement income modelling unit, referred to in my earlier response, takes account of the government's policy measures announced in both the 1996-97 and 1997-98 budgets, including choice of funds and opting out of

This referred to the discussion on page 3-11 of budget paper No. 1. It makes clear that the medium-term projection for private savings encompasses a number of factors. Some of these, such as the low and predictable rates of inflation and the superannuation guarantee, are already having an effect. Some of these, such as the savings rebate, will begin to take effect over the next one to two years. Some of these, such as demographic change, will take effect over the next decade or so. Perhaps that is not quite as simple as Senator Sherry might have assumed, but the medium term encompasses three, five and 10 years in looking forward.</para><para>I think another issue that Senator Sherry raised is how giving the savings rebate to self-funded retirees, who are people in the community most likely to dissave, is going to 
 encourage national savings. One of the great advantages of the savings rebate is that it does reward people for saving. Under the co-contribution, which I do not think Labor could have ever delivered—it certainly found it difficult to deliver while it had the levers of power—the savings rebate will reward those who have saved in the past, such as self-funded retirees, as well as providing an incentive to new savers.

You referred to my questioning the benefits of the saving rebate being given to retirees. I did not. What I did question—and it is in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> —was an issue on page 3- 
11 of the budget paper No. 1. In the commentary it refers to a suggestion of an improved outlook for private savings. I did express my surprise that demographic changes over the next decade or so were likely to see a rise in the proportion of the population in age groups which historically have been high savers and a decline in younger low saving age cohorts.</para></talk.start><para>The reason I asked that question which expressed surprise is that we have an ageing population, and people who are retiring are net dissavers. I would be very surprised if the rebate in the context of people who have already retired actually added to their saving levels. I would be very surprised. I would be very surprised if you claimed that the total level of saving amongst people who are retired will go up as a result of the rebate. The point is that it would seem to me that because of demographic changes there will be pressure towards a reduction in private saving because of demographic changes, not the reverse, which is claimed in budget paper No. 1. You might care to address that point at some stage in the debate.</para><para>The other question I was going to raise is that, when this measure was announced in the budget, I recall the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, being asked a day or two later in question time whether he was going to collect the rebate. As you would be aware, Senator Kemp, the rebate applies in respect of superannuation contributions, and I assume that is why the Prime Minister would be eligible for the rebate. I do not wish to know the Prime Minister's personal savings habits, but can you please explain to the chamber what is the latest position regarding the Prime Minister's acceptance of the rebate? It is an important question, because he did considerably undermine this measure and contribute to the lack of confidence in the rebate measure by declaring that he was not going to accept it.

We recently dealt with the bill to do with trafficking in trust losses. I am sure you remember it—it was quite controversial for those battlers in Brighton. The principle that the government advanced, which we supported, was that the individual that incurred the economic loss should not be allowed to transfer it to another individual who did not incur. It seems to me that the same principle, therefore, says that the economic gain of the income/savings should be incurred and the recipient should be the person who incurs it, not using that structure of a family trust to open a couple of bank accounts for your kids and have a distribution to them, because the kids clearly have not incurred the economic gain. They are not the recipients of the economic activity.</para></talk.start><para>When you talk about how proud you are of where you are at on the savings rebate, I am interested in trying to analyse whether or not the individual who actually earns the income that creates the ability to claim the rebate is then able to transfer the income to another party through that vehicle of the family trust, and therefore generate the capacity to make the claim. I am interested in trying to find the consistency between trafficking in trust losses and what is, in effect, trafficking in trust gains.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>3127</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—You are really

From memory, you found it very hard to fix a position on that issue, Senator Conroy. This is something entirely separate from this bill.

 savings. Then I went into some of the problems—the distortions if, say, you have a particular incentive for a particular savings vehicle. Senator, that was the point I was making. I suggest you read what I said.

The crux is whether or not the individual who is holding the asset—bearing the economic risk—is to be the beneficiary of the savings rebate or not. The key is: who is bearing the risk of the economic activity, holding the asset, and is that the person you are rewarding? If that is the case, then at least you are achieving what you are setting out to achieve—whether we agree with that or not. But it seems that there is an ability to distribute through the trust to individuals who have not borne the economic risk, and they are then the beneficiaries without having generated the economic activity, held the asset or borne the risk. That is the crux of the matter.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>3129</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Bearing the economic risk came into the debates we had in relation to franking credit trading and dividend streaming, and I recall it came into some of the debates on trust losses. The savings rebate that you are finding difficult is quite a distinctive measure; the other measures were the subject of other debates at other times. For example, in relation to the savings rebate, the distribution of trust income qualifies because the distributed income would have resulted from the investment of funds by the trust in various forms of savings, such as shares, bank deposits, other property or a business venture. In this sense, of course, trust distributions are no different from interest earned on bank accounts or income earned by a sole trader from his or her own investment in business.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Conroy, you are shaking your head. Your government put in place taxation measures which relate to trusts. We have taken some initiatives in relation to trusts, particularly relating to trust losses. But, as I have 
 said, the response to your question is that it is not whether the money is at risk. We have indicated that the savings rebate is widely available to most forms of savings. I think that is one of the merits of it; it is not a problem with it, as you seem to be implying. It is one of the pluses of the design of the savings rebate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>3129</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Honourable senators will have noticed that underneath the government's amendment No. 1 on sheet B98AF338.WB is a Greens (WA) amendment that amends the government's amendment. I move:</para></talk.start><para>(R1)	 Section 220AAF, omit "If a large remitter pays an amount other than by electronic transfer, the large remitter will be liable for a penalty under section 220AAW.".</para><para>In my speech during the second reading debate, I briefly alluded to the reason this amendment is being moved. It relates to the aspect of the bill that requires remittances by electronic means. The government have created this odd situation in an attempt to rationalise and streamline the system of remittance. It seems that they may have ignored a number of negative or unfair implications. They may have turned a blind eye to the implications for businesses of the changes.</para><para>Forwarding payments by cheque has previously been a perfectly legitimate form of commercial transaction in this country; now it is not even an option for large remitters. I know that just about every time I go to my own bank they attempt to get me to transfer money by some forms of electronic means or to make payments by electronic means, and I consistently say that I am not interested in that option. Maybe the banks have got to the government and suggested that what is cheapest for them is what they want consumers to do—and not just consumers. We have seen that they have certainly got to the government over the retirement savings allowance. I am just wondering whether the banks have got to the government and said, `Look, this is going to be cheaper for us if these transactions all take place by electronic transfer, and then we won't have to worry about processing cheques.' I do not really think the use of cheques should suddenly be outlawed by 
 governments, even if it is for a limited group of people.</para><para>Beyond the expensive and time consuming compliance measures that business is faced with, the government is making failure to pay electronically into an offence with a penalty. These fines can be downright unfair and misguided. They are not aimed at what they are trying to prevent, that is, preventing large payers from deferring payment because the cheque is not cleared for some days. These fines are an unfair penalty on large remitters.</para><para>The legislation proposed in section 220AAW does not seek to penalise late remitters; it seeks to penalise large remitters who choose to use some other form of payment. So they are not penalising a late payment; they are penalising people who would choose to use cheques. So even if a large firm pays by cheque and it is cleared before the due date, the firm is still subject to a penalty of either $500 or 16 per cent per annum on the principal amount for a period of seven days. Many people might think that is a drop in the ocean for a large firm but, considering that large remitters may potentially remit twice per week, the liability for cheque payment, even if they were all on time, could be $52,000 per year.</para><para>Will it stop there? I just wonder whether, in the end, like analogue telephones and analogue televisions, we will have corporations more and more requiring the parliament to legislate to reduce their costs, the parliament legislating to take away consumer choices. In this case, it might start with business choices and may well end up with the ability of ordinary regular consumers, who may choose still to use cheques, being told that their choices no longer exist. Whilst I would probably like to get rid of the whole section, our amendment removes the penalty from it—and quite rightly so.</para><para>If, in the end, the government has a sensible way of dealing with late remittances, please come and talk to the Senate about it. I urge the Senate to accept the amendment to that. I am not saying that I necessarily support the government's first amendment on B98AF338.WB but if the government's amendment does not get up, I will be happy 
 to move our original amendment, which is still on sheet 1001 and which does the same thing outside the context of the government's amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>3130</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What is before the chair at the moment is an amendment to the government's own amending bill to which the government has just provided an explanatory memorandum.

It is interesting to see the principles the council has set out in the report. On page 11 of the report, section 1 outlines `Principles for the assessment and practice of research in protected and environmentally sensitive areas'. Under the heading `Basis', the report talks about transparency principles. In section 1.2, the report talks about principles particularly relevant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' concerns.	 This is a most appropriate day to highlight this aspect of the report. The goal is, as the report says, to make:</para><para>Indigenous Australians confident that research in protected and environmentally sensitive areas:</para><para>.	 respects their values and customary obligations;</para><para>.	 benefits and empowers traditional owners—</para><para>and so on. The importance of having ethics in scientific research is that the disputes that occur about the environment are normally based on disputed facts rather than on principles. Everybody, whether they are timber gatherers or whether they are environmentalists, says they want to protect the environment or they want to provide work for people.</para><para>There is little dispute about the principles that underpin our concern for the environment. Little separates people in terms of the principles of getting jobs and developing industries. People want industries to develop. They want people to have jobs. They want to preserve the environment. People want all those things and, as a matter of principle, most people agree. But they disagree about the facts of the situation. Somebody will say about a particular piece of forest, `That's good forest. That's pristine forest. That's forest that must be preserved.' Other people looking at that particular piece of forest will say, `No, this is wasteland. This is timber that would best serve the country by being chipped.'</para><para>We want a system whereby a true assessment can be made of the actual facts of the matter. It is here that scientists are so important. What we tend to get in areas such as saving the dugong is one lot of scientists saying, `Yes, these provisions should be put into the requirements to preserve them.' Others say, `No, you don't need those provisions in the assignment to preserve them.' We need people who have the scientific ability to say whether that particular area of forest or that particular area in which dugongs live is good or bad.</para><para>Often people say that you can get whatever opinion you want from lawyers or accountants or from most professions. I think that is too cynical an appraisal; but, in so far as there is any truth in that, it is a bad thing. The only way we can get over that is for people to stand by the ethics of their profession. What this particular report deals with is the ethical standards of scientists that are looking at 
 environmentally sensitive areas. Our arguments about the environment can only be solved ultimately if the people who know about it, the scientists who go about researching a particular area, stick by ethics. That is why this is such an important report.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>3133</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The issue of ethics in the conduct of research in protected and environmentally sensitive areas is obviously absolutely important. It is probably more important right at the moment than it has been for some time, and I will give you the reason. There are extreme pressures in relation to the outcomes of environmental assessments. At the moment, in Western Australia we have a situation, I gather, where it has recently been announced that for environmental assessments for mining you will have someone called an approved assessor—and I will have to check the wording of that—who not only writes the report but also actually does their own assessment. The ability for such kinds of assessments not only to be wrong or misplaced but also to be ill-informed is enormous, where people may in fact be checking their own work.</para></talk.start><para>We have a situation with the environment in Western Australia whereby, for ordinary Department of the Environment assessments, you have private contractors assessing other private contractors, and there is nothing to say that the private contractors will not be assessing their own work.

If that government is not wanting environmentalists to be `standing on the hose of development', what does that mean in terms of the way that person will feel, if it is necessary for them to assess those projects?</para><para>There are other pressures as well. Those pressures relate to the impact of competition policy. When you have a situation where there is more and more pressure to take the lowest cost tender, what does it mean in terms of the ethics involved in environmental assessment, even in sensitive areas?

 needs a lot of research or has not been well researched, that a particular area can only be researched in certain seasons or may take two consecutive seasons to be researched, or that to do the research properly and present a report properly would take two years, but someone else says, `That's out of the question; it costs too much,' or when a consultant says the hours that they would have to put in to do the job properly, but someone else says, `I am prepared to do it in half the time,' that someone else is saying that because they know how competitive the tendering process is.</para><para>Where do ethics come into that? The ethics are that the person in this case who is honest may well be the person who misses out on the job. In the midst of all of this, we find people who charge very large amounts of money to be consultants for the government—we are not quite sure under what process—but who do not actually do the work. One example that I can quote is in relation to the Oakagee proposal. The consultant produced a report for the Department of Resources Development. The consultant said in the report, `There is going to be no impact on seagrass meadows, because there are no seagrass meadows.' Funnily enough, that may well have been the answer the proponent wanted, but was it true?</para><para>A group of other scientists were so angry at that slap-dash way of dealing with environmental assessment that they went to the proposed site at Oakagee, did the measurements, took the dives, took the transect measurements, used a global positioning system and basically quite clearly proved that what the consultant had said was untrue. They proved that what the consultant said was untrue because the consultant had not looked: it was apparently too rough that day, and so he had not done the dives but had apparently only looked at overhead maps and at fisheries reports.</para><para>So here we have a consultant being paid lots of money to present an environmental report but not doing the work. A group comes in and proves the report is untrue, and guess what? The government does not actually have to do anything about it. Not only are the ethics hugely important, but also governments 
 will have to lift their game, because no longer will people be fooled by that kind of shoddy process. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted;	debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Science and Technology Budget Statement</title><page.no>3134</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>3134</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>I wish to discuss the budget papers relating to science. Before I do so, I would like to acknowledge the comments made by Senators Cooney and Margetts in relation to ethics and science. I should put on the record that there is another important and valuable area of science where we should be evaluating and looking at the ethics of research. That, of course, is in relation to genetic technology. Gene technology and its benefits are dazzling, but there are also some difficult ethical and moral issues surrounding that particular technology, such as with human cloning, owning life forms and stealing cultural practices—and the list goes on.</para><para>I again put on record my concern and that of my party that our attempts to have a Senate committee to evaluate and investigate some of these ethical dilemmas were rejected by the two old parties. In relation to this year's science and technology budget statements, again this is a disappointment for Australia, a country that has really staked its future on innovation and creativity. Certainly, this government likes to rave on and on about innovation. Last year's Investing for Growth industry policy statement by the government had as its very foundation the notion of innovation. That is what we should be doing, and that is what we need to use the budget to create the chances for.</para><para>Recently I made an assessment of the government and how it had kept to, or not kept to, its election promises in relation to science. I published that in <inline font-style="italic">Australasian Science</inline>. In the conclusion, I gave the government about four out of 10 for positive rhetoric while failing to deliver in a few key areas, including its failure to restore infrastructure in 
 the research sector, and its declining support financially for higher education. These are major policy flaws which should have been addressed by this budget.</para><para>However, I will focus on this year's budget and the moves towards encouraging the private sector to undertake more research and development. This document reports a gross expenditure on RD for 1994-95 of $7.4 billion, up 5.5 per cent over the previous year. This was a contribution of approximately 47 per cent by business enterprises and made up about 1.61 per cent of GDP. More recent figures are not yet available. This document also shows that Commonwealth support for major science and innovation programs has increased from $3.6 billion in 1997-98 to $3.7 billion in 1998-99, which is actually a decrease in real terms of about 0.5 per cent. It is claimed that, excluding some capital works programs, it would show a 0.4 per cent increase in real terms.</para><para>Sadly, these claims are best interpreted as showing the budget expenditure on science and technology has stayed the same since 1996-97 and the policy reliance on innovation is not matched by budgetary commitment by the government. Perhaps the most telling aspect of this whole story was the dramatic cut in the 1996-97 budget, where there was a staggering 10.7 per cent decrease in Commonwealth funding in real terms. This cut has not been restored since. The report concludes:</para><para>Looking at the broad changes . . . Budget funding for the research agencies has remained static in real terms over the period from 1987-88 to 1998-99.</para><para>I believe this just undermines the government's so-called commitment to innovation.</para><para>It is also concerning that the figures are not yet in to show the effects of the government's decision to cut the 150 per cent RD tax concession down to 125 per cent, saving $2.4 billion over four years. The Academy of Science suggests that there is anecdotal evidence to suggest this single measure will have caused the excellent growth in business RD to falter. This is supported by the budget papers, which show that the uptake for the START program funds has been poor. Does this mean the government has, through its tax policy, stopped business investment in 
 RD in its tracks? I hope not, but I suspect so.</para><para>The conclusion from this document is the need to seriously re-examine the place of government funding for science and technology and to at least repair the damage of the 1996-97 budget cuts, and to re-examine incentives to encourage business to invest. I look forward to the commitment from the government in the near future to some of these areas. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties: Anti-Personnel Mines</title><page.no>3135</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>3135</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>This report is a national interest analysis, and it obviously includes in it some elements of the more positive approach that has been taken by government in recent times to anti-personnel landmines. But there are still some major issues that remain. I would like to take the opportunity at this point of acknowledging the work that has been done in Australia over time by Sister Patricia Pak Poy internationally but especially within Australia in increasing the knowledge on landmines. That work was in fact acknowledged and celebrated in the awarding of the ANZAC peace prize this year, and very well deserved it was.</para><para>The national interest analysis includes reasons for Australia to take the proposed treaty actions. I will read from it:</para><para>The past decade has witnessed a growing number of instances where anti-personnel mines have been used indiscriminately.</para><para>Of course, one of the arguments that have been used in relation to anti-personnel mines is that it is women, children and non-combatants who are most impacted on. But it is not entirely their use; it is the weapons themselves which are inherently dangerous. It is not a matter of whether you use them indiscriminately. In many cases people deliberately put landmines in places where women, children and non-combatants will encounter them. Whether that is meant indiscriminately I do not know, but in many countries those are the ways landmines are used.</para><para>So we should be dealing with the fact that not only do we see the majority of victims being non-combatants but that it is not just the indiscriminate use of landmines, it is the fact that the weapons themselves, wherever you use them, are inherently dangerous because most of them are meant to be not easily detected. The reality is that the danger of the landmines themselves becomes the problem and becomes the inhumane element of what we are dealing with. The report says:</para><para>In addition, the Convention also requires the states parties to destroy or ensure the destruction of stockpiles of anti-personnel mines within a period of four years after the entry into force of the Convention, with provision for the retention of a minimum number of anti-personnel mines for training.</para><para>We still do not know what this means in terms of numbers. We know in terms of the treaty but we do not know in terms of numbers for Australia. I guess it is unlikely that it is in the terms that each country will make its own decision. I might indicate that under `Costs' the report says:</para><para>Noting that final destruction methods and exact quantities for retention are still to be determined, initial indicative costs for destruction of the stockpile are $4.1 million, of which stock write-offs total $3.9 million.</para><para>Landmines themselves per item usually are not a terribly expensive commodity, so $3.9 million worth of landmines is a great many landmines. One wonders what Australia was ever proposing to do with that quantity of landmines, considering all the negotiations that have been going on in recent years.</para><para>Further on under implementation there is a section in the second last paragraph which reads:</para><para>The Government will consider on a case-by-case basis requests for assistance from other states parties within the framework of its overall policy response to the landmines issue. . . . receive assistance to the extent possible for mine clearance and related activities.</para><para>I guess the question is whether or not we assist those countries that have not signed the convention. That becomes, obviously, a very difficult question in terms of the humanity of the situation.</para><para>I am cruel enough to remind the Senate that in June 1995 I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, Senator Gareth Evans:</para><para>How can the government justify not supporting a complete ban on anti-personnel landmines, including their manufacture, given their appalling record as an indiscriminate destructive weapon which is mainly targeted at civilians in regions of conflict and whose effects are felt a long time after the conflict is over?</para><para>The response from Senator Evans at the time was that our position was `hopelessly utopian'. We were proved correct—the so-called `hopelessly utopian' position was much more achievable than the position the government was taking. Finally, the trip-wire grenades used as mines by the Australian military are still not banned under this provision. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>3136</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was recently in Angola and Mozambique—two countries that are blighted by war and the legacies of war. One of the legacies of war in both places is landmines, which were laid down in the millions—it seems a hard concept to take on board but that is literally so.</para></talk.start><para>In both Angola and Mozambique, Australia has much to be proud of. In Angola I went to a workshop where people made artificial legs to replace the natural ones that were blown off by mines. Australia has put funding into that and made it a successful undertaking. There is, for reasons I cannot go into now, some issue as to whether or not funding will continue to that particular undertaking in Angola. I take this opportunity to urge Australia and Australia's government to see to it that that undertaking is kept going because it does provide much needed aid to women and children, and men as well. Anyone who is injured is entitled to sympathy and to an artificial leg, I would say. Those people are entitled to the legs that they would otherwise be denied were funding withdrawn. Australia is not the only country that people can look to for funding, but certainly we are a compassionate nation and we need to look to that.</para><para>In Mozambique I witnessed the blowing up of a couple of mines around a particular village. I was with other Australians at the time. The crew that undertook the clearing of mines in Mozambique were trained by the 
 Australian Army. This is a proper time to acknowledge the work that the Australian Army does overseas in actions such as this where its personnel clear mines. It is a task that needs a lot of patience, training and concentration. Those elements have been put into the area by the Australian Army. They were directly in charge at one stage; now they are at the point where they have become advisers. I think that is something to be proud of. Major Peter McIntosh was on duty at the time I was there and I would like to acknowledge the great service he has given to Mozambique and to Australia. I acknowledge not only him but those who went before him and those who will come after him. It is a noble task.</para><para>Let me end this way, Madam Acting Deputy President: if you do get the chance, do urge the government to keep the undertaking going in Angola. Secondly, if you ever go to Mozambique go and see the mine clearing and make sure you give the Army personnel there great credit.

The erection of a 15-storey building that obscures a view of the Opera House from almost every part of the city is an absolute outrage. Not surprisingly, it has prompted a public outcry. A public meeting last week attracted 1,500 protesters, including the playwright David Williamson, scientist Dr Tim Flannery and broadcaster Margaret Throsby. The meeting heard estimates of the cost to get the site back ranging from $250 million to Premier Bob Carr's touted figure of $700 million.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>C16</name.id><name role="metadata">HEFFERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator Heffernan</name></talker><para>—He is trying to balance his budget.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>2M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name></talker><para>—Yes, he is trying to balance his budget. Regardless of the cost, the meeting was unanimous in its decision that the building, dubbed the `toaster', has to go and it has the support of international figures such as Robert Hughes and the architect of the Sydney Opera House, Joern Utzon.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The depth of feeling locally, nationally and internationally means action must be taken. East Circular Quay is a site of great significance to Australians, as it is home for the building which many regard as our national icon and symbol, the Opera House. It also incorporates other Sydney landmarks: the harbour, the quay and the botanic gardens. Sydneysiders have great pride in the city, and they will not allow this building to ruin its appearance and its reputation. At the moment, arriving at a solution to removing the `toaster' poses great difficulty, as the whole issue—perhaps appropriately, given the site—has become something of an operatic event. The debate must be allowed to return to sensible levels of dialogue; emotion must be contained.</para><para>The role of the New South Wales Labor government in the fiasco is to be condemned, as is Premier Bob Carr's attempted sidestep to avoid tackling the issue and taking any blame. The fact of the matter is that it was Bob Carr who signed the approval for this building. This was 10 years ago, when he was the New South Wales minister for planning. Not only did he approve the development, he approved it to be 20 storeys high. The present building is 15 storeys high so, if Mr Carr had his way, it would be a third higher than it is now.</para><para>His approval has allowed a building that blocks out a view of the Opera House from most parts of the city. What great vision this man had, and has, for his state. He signed on the dotted line to allow a building which overshadows the Opera House. His actions have turned what was envisaged as an area for the people into a high-rise accommodation tower which only the very wealthy can afford. Mr Carr's signature has allowed an elitist tower, owned and developed by overseas 
 interests, to spoil an unparalleled icon of our built heritage.</para><para>Even as minister for planning, Bob Carr exhibited the traits which are all too apparent now: lack of vision, lack of leadership and lack of commitment to the people of New South Wales. Now that the project to which he gave the nod has spun out of control, guess what? He is appealing to the federal government to bail him out. Based on press reports, there are indications that a solution could be brokered with the building's owners, Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels. Pressed about this, Mr Carr showed how diminished is his own party's confidence in him. Mr Carr mentioned a figure of $700 million being needed to buy the site back from its owners. Perhaps his own government does not keep him informed because it now emerges that Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels held private talks with the New South Wales government as recently as last year, at which they reportedly said that they would vacate the site for something in the order of $250 million.</para><para>The public meeting in Sydney heard that the Save East Circular Quay Committee had received word from an intermediary for the developer that it was prepared to sell the site for $300 million. The total value of the development has been put at $600 million. One thing that must be avoided is a Dutch auction with the owners to buy the site back. Very detailed examination must be made of the true value of the undertaking to the owners. In October last year the site was valued at $85.8 million by the Valuer-General. The fact that only 22 of the 237 apartments in this gross complex have been sold—and all of those before 1996—indicates that the project is something of a commercial dud. Obviously, at prices starting from $700,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to $5.5 million for a sub-penthouse, the owners have priced themselves out of the market and this may be behind their willingness to vacate.</para><para>Mr Carr and his government have consistently failed to listen to the people of Sydney on this matter and have only taken the cotton wool out of their ears in recent weeks. In the face of continuing protest—local, national and international—Mr Carr, using his $700 
 million figure, tried to insist that the building was too expensive to buy back and that the whole thing was just beyond his government to fix. Once again, he failed to recognise the values and pride Sydney people have for their city. They will not just turn away from what they regard as a travesty which was foisted upon them against their will.</para><para>They fought on and, only hours before the protest rally, it was learnt that the Hong Kong Shanghai Hotels had expressed a willingness to quit the site for something in the order now of $300 million. Having been caught out on the figures, Mr Carr has the unmitigated hide to turn to the federal government to come up with the readies to get the site back. Mr Carr's ineptitude in this matter has meant that the obstacles to resolving the problem have not been addressed.</para><para>A land swap might simply move the problem, not solve it. In the past, there has been justifiably strong resistance to the notion of swapping land next to the Opera House in return for land elsewhere, on the proviso that permission would be granted to exceed height restrictions in other locations. Given Bob Carr's previous penchant for a 20-storey building, such a scenario is a frightening possibility.</para><para>The government has control of much harbour and foreshore land and it must be stopped from doing any deal which compromises these sites. But there is no doubt that the East Circular Quay apartment building is out of character with the site, with the city and with the wishes of the people, so the problem cannot be left unresolved. The critical question is: where would the funds come from to get rid of it? One suggestion which seemed to have some merit was to start a new lottery to help raise some of the money needed. After all, this was how the Opera House was funded, so it would be appropriate to at least help return East Circular Quay to the way it was envisaged through similar means. But the New South Wales government has poured cold water on that idea.</para><para>Another suggestion was a one-off fee in New South Wales. Raising $300 million would represent a cost of $67 to each New South Wales resident over the age of 20. This 
 would be in keeping with the desires of the people after a recent <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> poll showed people were overwhelmingly opposed to the idea of using taxpayers' money to solve the issue. However, Bob Carr has turned to the federal government and wants money from the Federation Fund to be used to solve the problem. Not one solution has come forward from Bob Carr on his own account. Bob Carr obviously did not confer with his federal Labor Party colleagues on that one.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has gone on record saying:</para><para>There are many priorities confronting that Federation Fund and I'm not sure that would necessarily be the highest.</para><para>Effectively he has told Bob Carr to abandon the idea. For once I agree with Mr Beazley. The Federation Fund was, however, not established to help remedy Mr Carr's colossal errors of bad judgment. The billion dollar fund was set up in the 1997-98 budget to fund projects of national significance as part of the activities to celebrate this nation's centenary of Federation. Mr Howard made it very clear the funds belonged to everyone. Announcing the plan, he said:</para><para>Everybody will be treated equally because the centenary of Federation does not belong to one or other side of politics. It belongs to all Australians and this is a practical demonstration of that commitment.</para><para>Giving money to Bob Carr hardly fits that scenario.</para><para>The Federation Fund projects are ones of major cultural, economic and social significance. As part of Mr Carr's logic, he claims the coalition government is not giving enough money to New South Wales and he has conveniently ignored the fact that the Corowa bridge on the New South Wales-Victorian border is getting $12 million and that there is funding for the Opera House of $32 million and other money for the cathedral refurbishments and other projects.</para><para>Mr Carr ignores, in relation to the Federation Fund, that it is up to state governments to develop and to submit proposals for funding of major projects that would have the support of all Australians. Bob Carr has to 
 find his own way to clean up the mess that he allowed to be created at East Circular Quay.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment Services</title><page.no>3139</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>3139</page.no><name role="metadata">Reynolds, Sen Margaret</name><name role="display">Senator REYNOLDS</name><name.id>XI4</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I want to document the frustrations of one of my constituents who has been trying to make the adjustment from CES to working with Centrelink and Employment National.

Before I get to that subject, I must say that Senator Coonan's message regarding the Opera House could just as easily have been said about Jabiluka. The international condemnation and community concern that she talked about happen when you put a uranium mine slap-bang in the middle of a world heritage area. I also entreat her to add her voice to the call for the Sydney Opera House to be nominated for world heritage—this is something that Senator Hill has been most reluctant to pursue since coming to office.</para></talk.start><para>But on the subject of Jabiluka, last week the Northern Territory police, along with the Darwin based tactical response team, moved onto the scene of the new uranium mine at Jabiluka. They gave the peaceful protesters there 24 hours to clear the blockade site and told them that they would be arrested, that their materials would be confiscated, and that 
 road access to the site would be cleared for heavy duty construction works. The police and the tactical response group made it very clear that there would be a mass assault on those peaceful protesters.</para><para>Eighteen people were arrested on Tuesday of last week, including the Mirra senior traditional owner, Yvonne Margarula. She was arrested for being on the lease site, which is, of course, her own land. That very same day we saw protests in eight different countries around the world. Yesterday there was a pre-dawn raid at the site. The police arrived before the protesters had a chance to chain themselves to the blockade and there were a further nine arrests before 7.15 in the morning.</para><para>The police moved in with six police cars to block the road between Magela Creek and Jabiluka, and they stopped the protesters' vehicles attempting to go through by using the pretence of checking for defects. The protest will go on. There are many people still prepared to go to Jabiluka. These are the people who are carrying the flag for the majority of Australians and who do not want this country taking part in this deadly nuclear cycle.</para><para>When I was in Jabiluka a few weeks ago, the situation then was that the Northern Land Council had agreed to allow Energy Resources of Australia, the mining company, to proceed with the project in return for the sorts of promises that were made when the nearby Ranger mine began—promises which, by and large, have not been to the benefit of the local indigenous people and particularly not to the Mirra people.</para><para>ERA's announcement came with the advice that its consultation with Aboriginal people was complete but, of course, the question is: what Aboriginal people? The traditional owners were identified by Mr Justice Toohey in 1982 as the Mirra people. He said that the `Mirra are a local descent group who have common spiritual affiliations to sites on the land that place the group under a primary spiritual responsibility for the sites and the land.'</para><para>The Mirra people have held fast to their refusal to have a mine on their land. But the 
 decision has been made on their behalf and not by them. It is also fair to say that ERA has attempted to render the Mirra invisible with the language in its publicity that engages in post-Mabo analogies of terra nullius.</para><para>Clearly, the Mirra people are hampered in their fight by the fact that they live in a place far removed from the central business districts of the eastern seaboard which, of course, are where most of the mining industry cheer squad reside—that is, the finance managers, the major banks such as the National, the ANZ and Westpac, and of course the mining company publicity machines. The latter are helped along by some $333 million of government subsidies to the industry over a five-year period.</para><para>One of the Mirra people asked me to convey this message to the Senate:</para><para>Please ask them to think of our children, our children's children, our children's grandchildren; to imagine a world with healthy humans on it for another 60,000 years . . . And ask them to consider that no one is perfect, mistakes will always happen, and that we can't afford to play with such incredibly destructive technology . . . to remember Hiroshima/Nagasaki, Chernobyl . . . and the many other disasters whose repercussions we are already living with and can never take back.</para><para>Very few politicians have been up to see what it is that is being earmarked for destruction. Unfortunately, this trickle is not threatening to become any sort of steady flow either.</para><para>It was my first visit to Kakadu, and I must say that I was overwhelmed with the extraordinary beauty of the place—the vast green wetlands, framed by ancient rocky escarpments; diverse forests of paperbark, palm and sheoak. It is a place which is teeming with wildlife, particularly birds. Termite mounds, for instance, two metres high are an attraction to the many tourists who flow through the area. I saw places where barramundi leap out of very clear streams and others where crocodiles lie in wait. You can look at this place and say it is untouched by European-Australian endeavours.</para><para>But at the same time the signs of Aboriginal culture are everywhere to see. I was taken to Ubirr, which is very close to the Jabiluka mining lease. This is a place to which overseas visitors flock in order to look at rock 
 paintings which are thousands of years old. European and Asian tourists whom I saw while I was there were both alarmed and puzzled that anyone would want to set up a mine in this world heritage area. After they found out it was a uranium mine, they were even more incredulous—and I spoke with visitors who had decided to stay on to join the blockade.</para><para>I saw a group of houses alongside a river into which sometime earlier the effluent from the Ranger tailings dam had been released. A 35-year-old woman from this area had died a week previously. I was told that people who live in and around Jabiluka do not live much beyond the age of 40. People in this area use bore water instead of collecting rainwater from their rooftops; the reason is that the radon in the air is very dangerous. Jabiluka and the township of Jabiru may be very beautiful, but they are also very deadly places in which to live.</para><para>Most visitors do not get to see where Aboriginal people in this area actually live. The vast wealth which is dug from the ground has not brought many benefits to the Mirra people or other Aboriginal groups in the area. I saw a typical house; it was a small enclosure that looked much more like a chicken coop than a house in which you would put people. Nevertheless, these houses are crowded, and this is one of the reasons why scabies affects 90 per cent of the children in this community. Scabies is a Third World disease which has been eliminated from most places on the planet—but not here in Australia. And, of course, it is a disease which has long-term effects on these young bodies.</para><para>Jobs in the mine have largely gone to outsiders. The small amount of revenue from the mine flows on to ATSIC, to the land council, to tourism projects, and to fund services which we here in Canberra or Melbourne take for granted as being government services.</para><para>A few weeks ago wearing, I must say, a very small moral fig leaf, Minister Downer recalled our ambassador to India in protest at that country's nuclear tests. Australia however, I must say, is complicit in this lethal economy. The boundaries between the peace 
 ful use of uranium and the market that eventually produces nuclear weapons are, indeed, porous. Let us remember that the Australian government cannot guarantee that no uranium finds its way into weapons manufacture.</para><para>The mismanaged nuclear industry has been propped up with the collusion of governments and banks. An accident occurring at Dounreay a couple of weeks ago is the latest in a long line of disasters in the uranium business. In the meantime, safe and renewable alternatives, such as wind and solar energy, gain a toehold ever so slowly.</para><para>I do not think we can rely on our present leaders to engage in ideas of responsibility to the planet and to the people in other countries on this issue. For instance, a couple of weeks ago, the submission by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Senate Economics Committee argued that Australia would fall behind in its role in international nuclear policy if the proposed new reactor at Lucas Heights did not go ahead.</para><para>This logic says that, by consolidating our status as players in this deadly industry, Australia will somehow do a better job of ensuring safety standards at plants in Asia and in negotiating on nuclear non-proliferation issues. It seems that we need more nuclear prowess in order to stop other countries using theirs—a little like the justification India has come up with to defend its own nuclear tests.</para><para>It is remarkable then that, in this political climate, hundreds of dedicated Australians have travelled to Jabiluka to lend their support to the blockade, and we are not talking about a quick trip here. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>University of Western Sydney</title><page.no>3142</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>3142</page.no><name role="metadata">Payne, Sen Marise</name><name role="display">Senator PAYNE</name><name.id>M56</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to address an area of great interest in that part of Sydney in which I work, the area of Greater Western Sydney—and that is the ongoing success of the University of Western Sydney. Since entering the Senate last year, I have been pleased to firstly establish, and then pursue, an ongoing relationship with the university, and I am constantly impressed with both the staff and students alike.</para></talk.start><para>UWS, as it is locally known, has a long history and very complex structure. It began operating in 1989 as a federated university based on three existing colleges of advanced education in Greater Western Sydney: the Nepean College of Advanced Education, the Hawkesbury Agriculture College and the Macarthur Institute of Higher Education.</para><para>It continues to operate in that way—as a federated university with three separate and distinct parts: Macarthur, Hawkesbury and Nepean. Each of those parts has its own culture, offers to the students its own courses, and services a different area of Greater Western Sydney. In fact, it is highly diverse even in terms of its geography. Between Macarthur, Hawkesbury and Nepean, there are seven individual sites across western Sydney. But it is UWS Nepean on which I wish to focus tonight.</para><para>Nepean is the largest of the three elements of UWS and is primarily based in Penrith on three sites: Kingswood, Werrington North and Werrington South. I was taken on a tour of the Nepean campuses very early on in my time in this place by my very proud colleague the member for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly. In addition to the Penrith sites is the latest inclusion of the Parramatta campus, to which I will return. UWS Nepean offers courses in eight faculties, ranging from business to science and technology, to performance, fine arts and design. With total enrolment at UWS Nepean alone in excess of 10,000 students, the university has proved its popularity with students from both the Greater Western Sydney region and beyond.</para><para>The Nepean site occupies land on which relics 20,000 years old have been found, with further evidence of occupation in the area indicating the presence of indigenous Australians as long ago as 47,000 years. This heritage is acknowledged and continued through the existence and operation of the university's respected Durali Aboriginal Centre. Nepean itself is situated in one of Australia's most historic urban regions. Penrith is one of the earliest townships established in the colony and was responsible for much of the supply of grains and foods to the colony. Similarly, honourable senators would know that Parra 
 matta also has a rich heritage and is now one of the  major centres of Sydney.</para><para>The newest campus of UWS Nepean is the Parramatta campus. At the beginning of this year, the faculties of business, law, nursing and health studies and some departments of the faculty of science and technology moved to the new Parramatta campus, which is one of particular historical significance. It is situated on the site of the former female orphanage, Australia's first purpose built orphanage, on the banks of the Parramatta River. The campus is home to Australia's oldest three-story building, thus ensuring that UWS Nepean has the honour of the nation's oldest university site; an honour I am sure the University of Sydney previously imagined was well within its keeping.</para><para>The foundation stone of the orphanage was laid in 1813 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie and the building was completed in 1818 and then began operation. The building had a very varied history, later being incorporated as part of Rydalmere Hospital before it was purchased by UWS Nepean from the state government in March 1995. All the redevelopment carried out by the university has been subject to a stringent heritage plan. The use of the orphanage is therefore extremely limited, but there is an aim of full restoration and use as a major heritage site and a public focus for research and education.</para><para>The area known as the Vernon precinct is also part of the campus. It consists of buildings constructed in the early 1900s which were also a part of Rydalmere Hospital. They now house the university's commerce faculty and will be used for teaching and for staff accommodation. Late last year I was pleased to be able to tour that site, which is close to my office, with Deputy Vice-Chancellor and UWS Nepean President, Professor Chris Duke; Pro Vice-Chancellor, Professor Harry Irwin; and Michael Charlton, the head of UWS public relations. Wandering around the construction areas even then showed me that the site is truly impressive and will be a very attractive educational facility when fully completed. Whilst there is ongoing work to be completed, the campus is already operational, with courses commencing this year. I know 
 several students whose enthusiasm about their university and the new Parramatta campus is almost bordering on infectious.</para><para>UWS Nepean has been very successful at integrating with the community in which it is based. Already they have established a range of what they describe as cooperative programs which aim at involving local industry with the university. They have over 70 industry partners involved, and the programs are an enormous success. The first and perhaps one of the most successful is a student industry cooperative program called the cooperative education for enterprise development. It involves industry partners as diverse as the Australian Army, Hawker de Havilland, Barcode Solutions and the Sydney Church of England Grammar School.</para><para>The students are involved in a vast range of projects, with the 1996-97 graduates having participated in everything from creating an electronic bookshop to the development of a DNA based protocol for identification of native and introduced animals from hair samples. Incoming student projects are similarly as diverse, with projects such as a strategy development for youth and children's theatre in Parramatta and an evaluation of staff perceptions at Nepean Health.</para><para>The second cooperative program is a research program known as the Nepean summer research awards. It includes organisations such as the Olympic Coordination Authority, and those involved have described it as an invaluable two-way experience that provides us with fresh perspectives and solutions and also as a great opportunity for business to access enthusiastic and talented students. The final of the cooperative programs was introduced last year. The engineering summer placement program has benefited from the involvement of organisations such as Blacktown City Council and the Penrith Lakes Development Corporation, and it can only go upwards from there.</para><para>UWS also recently established the Western Sydney Research Institute, which is designed to coordinate research programs with regional industry and business groups. Aimed at ensuring integration between all three campuses—the Hawkesbury, the Nepean and the 
 Macarthur—the institute will be involved in three main areas: environmental management, regional development and planning, and urban, social and cultural development. All these areas are particularly important to the healthy growth and wellbeing of western Sydney, with the potential for a direct and positive impact on regional, economic and industrial planning. Already the Western Sydney Research Institute is planning its first project: the construction of an enormous geographic information system for Greater Western Sydney. The university has committed $1 million to this project and is now looking to funding from regional partners involved.</para><para>I think anyone who has followed the progress of UWS since the late 1980s agrees that it has been an enormous success in giving more Australians access to higher education. Statistics from the UWS Nepean's student intake survey of last year indicated that nearly 70 per cent of students who completed the survey were first generation students. That is, neither of their parents had obtained a degree. The survey also indicated that nearly 40 per cent of respondents lived within 24 kilometres of the university. What is significant about these statistics for the community of Greater Western Sydney is that it is a clear indication that UWS is offering opportunities to students who may never have taken up those opportunities at existing facilities elsewhere in the Sydney metropolitan area. UWS is obviously servicing an appreciative education market.</para><para>One of the most gratifying aspects from these statistics relates to the number of UWS graduates who are not only finding work but also finding it in the Greater Western Sydney region. In 1993 the graduate success rate of finding work was well in excess of 80 per cent of students in full-time or part-time work, and over half of those in the local region. That is a tremendous boost not only to the individual students but also to their families and to our region.</para><para>Finally, I am also pleased to say that the University of Western Sydney has become the latest Australian university to appoint a female vice-chancellor. Professor Janice Reid, formerly the Pro Vice-Chancellor of the Queensland University of Technology, was 
 appointed last year and took up her new posting earlier this year. UWS is an institution of crucial importance, not only as an important element of Australia's higher education system but also as one of the key providers of education and employment in western Sydney. All western Sydney residents, UWS staff, students and graduates are and  should be justly proud of the progress the university has made in such a relatively short amount of time.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>20:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>3145</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 8.00 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>3145</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>3145</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council Act—Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council—Report—Environmental research ethics: National principles and guidelines for the ethical conduct of research in protected and environmentally sensitive areas, May 1998.</para><para>Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act—Equal employment opportunity program—ANL Limited—Report for 1996-97.</para><para>Science and Technology budget statement 1998-99.</para><para>Treaties—Text, together with national interest analysis—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Bilateral—</inline></para><para>		 Agreement on Mutual Recognition in relation to Conformity Assessment, Certificates and Markings, between Australia and the European Community.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Multilateral</inline> —</para><para>		 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, done at Oslo on 18 September 1997.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>3145</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Australian Bureau of Statistics Act—Proposals Nos 9-11 of 1998.</para><para>Civil Aviation Act—Civil Aviation Regulations—Civil Aviation Orders—Directive—Part—</para><para>	 105, dated 22 [2], 24 [3], 27 [2], 29 and 30 April; and 1 [2], 4, 7 and 11 May 1998.</para><para>	 106, dated 20 and 30 [2] April; and 12 May 1998.

The Act and regulations provide a comprehensive and holistic environmental management regime in relation to air, water and land pollution, indigenous and heritage sites management and noise emissions.</para><para>An integral component of the environmental protection regime at Jandakot airport is the require ment for new Airport Lessee Companies to develop and implement environment strategies. These must be in place within 12 months of a new airport operator taking over a leased Federal airport, and cover a five year period.</para><para>Part 6 of the Act, and part 3 of the regulations set out the requirements of Airport Lessee Companies in relation to their environment strategies. In their environment strategy the Airport Lessee Company must identify objectives for environmental management of the airport, areas which are environmentally significant and possible sources of environmental impacts. In addition, the Airport Lessee Company is required to address any relevant recommendation of a body established in the State in which the airport is located, having responsibilities in relation to conservation of biota, habitat, heritage or kindred matters. Further, the strategy must be available for public comment for a period of 90 days prior to submission to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. The Airport Lessee Company must document and address in its strategy comments received through this process.</para><para>The regulations also implement a monitoring regime at the airport which promotes prevention of water pollution on the airport site. The regulations identify the forms pollution might take, acceptable standards and imposes a duty of care on all operators at the airport to prevent pollution as far as is reasonable and practicable. To monitor this duty, and if required enforce the regulations, the Department of Transport and Regional Development will appoint an Airport Environment Officer at Jandakot who will be responsible for the day-to-day administration of environmental controls.</para><para>(7) Yes. As previously outlined post-lease the airport will operate under the most rigorous and stringent environmental regime ever put in place at Australia's airports. The Commonwealth will retain regulatory control over land use planning, environment and building control at Jandakot airport through the Airports Act 1996 and the Airport (Environment Protection) Regulations.

The Ruling operates for years both before and after its date of issue.</para><para>(2) (a) The mutuality principle does not determine if a club or association is exempt from taxation. Exemption from taxation is governed by Division 50 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (the Act).</para><para>For a club or association to gain exemption under Division 50 of the Act, it must not be carried on for the profit or gain of its individual members and it must be established for purposes specified in the Division. As a member cannot personally share in the profits of such a club or association, the Government does not consider that a loophole exists in the taxation law. Rules and fees that apply to the obtaining of membership are matters for the club or association and are subject to laws other than the taxation law.</para><para>The mutuality principle can only have application to clubs and associations that are not exempt from tax under Division 50. The principle, which has long been a feature of the general law of England and Australia, recognises that the collective membership forms the legal entity that is a club or association and that the club or association can only be assessed on income received from non-members. Because of the principle, funds contributed by members to the club or association remain free of taxation because the contributions are no different 
 than an individual taxpayer paying money to him or her self.</para><para>(b) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that no action is required at this time.</para><para>(3) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that the `visitor register', which is required to be kept by all clubs and associations admitting non-members to their premises, forms the main instrument for determining the level of income received from non-members and subject to taxation. The Commissioner stated that clubs and associations are subject to audit activity in the same way as classes of other taxpayers. They are responsible for lodging correct returns under self assessment arrangements.  Where any tax return lodged by a club or association is found to be incorrect, appropriate penalties are imposed.</para><para>Several decided court cases challenging the exempt status of clubs or associations are indicative of the Commissioner's efforts in policing the tax requirements of this kind of instrument.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Small Business: Fair Trading Laws</title><page.no>3148</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1133)</subtitle><id.no>1133</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3148</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 8 April 1998:</para></talk.start><para>(1) With reference to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Act 1998, passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives, and the definition of small business specified by that legislation: can an estimate be provided of how many of the nearly one million small businesses, when applying the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition, in Australia will be included in that `$1 million' definition.</para><para>(2) In what circumstances could any of those nearly one million small businesses be excluded</para><para>(3) With reference to the $1 million threshold test: (a) would a liquor store with 7 part-time, full-time and casual employees, purchasing $1.1 million worth of liquor from a single supplier, be covered by the legislation, with regard to that customer/supplier contract; (b) would a service station with 15 casual, part-time and full-time employees, purchasing $1.1 million worth of fuel from a single supplier, be covered by the legislation, with regard to that customer/supplier contract; (c) would a manufacturer with 99 casual, part-time and full-time employees, and a 5 year plus 5 year lease, amounting to $1.1 million in rental, be covered by the legislation, with regard to that landlord/tenant contract; and (d) would a computer franchisee with 20 casual, part-time and full-time employees, purchasing $200,000 of goods a year on a 6 year

Rather, subsections 51AC(1) and (2) limit access to the provision to persons other than listed public companies, and subsections 51AC(7) and (7A) limit the provision to transactions of $1 million or less.</para><para>Access to the provisions of the legislation is not limited to businesses that have a turnover of $1 million or less. Hence, a business with a range of contracts, for the supply or acquisition of goods or services of more than $1 million in total, may seek relief from unconscionable conduct in respect of a transaction priced at $1 million or less.</para><para>Also, the $1 million threshold for a transaction may be increased by regulation. I have undertaken to monitor the operation of the new legislation in this regard.</para><para>(2) Consistent with the response to question (1) above, a small business would be excluded from the provision in respect of a transaction valued at more than $1 million, or where the business is a listed public company.</para><para>Generally, when considering this issue a court would have regard to how contracts are constructed. A court would look into all the circumstances of a contract, including whether it may have been aggregated deliberately to avoid the provision, for example, if a landlord used its position of power over small business tenants to force them to aggregate leases that would not normally be aggregated.</para><para>(3) As stated in responses to previous parts of this question on notice, the specific circumstances of each transaction will need to be considered to determine whether a particular transaction falls within the gamut of the $1 million transaction threshold. Generally, except where a court may be required to examine whether a group of transactions has been aggregated to avoid the provision, the amount of a contract is easily understandable. In this context, consideration is likely to be given, among other things, to the nature of the goods or services in question, and the arrangements for ordering, delivering or providing, and paying for the goods and services.</para><para></para></answer></subdebate.1></debate></answers.to.questions></debate></chamber.xscript></hansard>
