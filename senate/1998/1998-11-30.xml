I believe that it ought not go through without some debate. We are dealing with the cut-off motion in relation to the <inline ref="s146">National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1997 [1998]</inline> . While this bill was included in the list of legislation to be introduced during the spring sittings, the government did not indicate that it would be debated during these sittings. Consequently, my staff and the community groups and specialist advisers that we would normally consult on these issues are not prepared to debate the bill at this time.</para></talk.start><para>While the bill was examined by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee, it was a fairly speedy process. Submissions were called for before Christmas last year, and the closing date was just after the New Year. Not surprisingly, only three submissions were received by the closing date and, consequently, there were no public hearings.</para><para>This is an important bill which establishes part of the framework for handling environmental issues in this country. It would be preferable if this bill could be delayed until the broader framework in the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 (No. 2)  was considered in the Senate. I will not be supporting this motion by the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>819</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This objection by the Greens (WA) is 
 really quite remarkable. Bear in mind that it is only for what could be described as a technical reason that the cut-off clause comes into effect at all in this instance. The technical reason is that, as a result of the election and the standing orders of the House of Representatives, the bill has to be reintroduced into the House of Representatives before it comes here. The purpose of the cut-off provision was to enable senators to have adequate time to prepare themselves for debate so that there were no surprises.</para></talk.start><para>This bill was introduced into this chamber on 21 October 1997. It then went before a committee of the Senate, which reported on 12 March 1998. It was given category T status by the government then, demonstrating its urgency. Unfortunately, it did not get to be debated because of other bills that were regarded as even more urgent—so be it. The opportunity was lost when the election was called.</para><para>The history of this bill goes back to 1992 when the previous Labor government agreed on a national system for coordinating environment protection in Australia. The concept is a good one. My only criticism of the Labor Party is that, although it set up the council to administer it—and the Commonwealth chairs it—it did not get around to holding any meetings. So the scheme was put in place but it did not achieve outcomes.</para><para>Under this government, we have got the process moving and we have introduced a number of measures through the cooperative state-Commonwealth arrangement which will provide for consistent environmental protection standards across the country. We have done it in relation to the national pollutant inventory. We have done it in relation to ambient air quality. And, as I recall, we have done it in relation to transfer of hazardous wastes across state boundaries. We are working on a number of others at the moment, including one in relation to packaging waste. It is a good concept. It was approved in 1992. The apparatus was basically set up, but to be implemented it required—apart from having a Commonwealth minister who was prepared to do the job—complementary state and Commonwealth legislation. Every state has 
 passed its legislation. It is the Commonwealth that is now holding back the capacity to enforce, at both state and Commonwealth levels, these consistent national environmental standards.</para><para>It is extraordinary that the Greens come in here, claiming the constituency that they do, and argue that it should be even further delayed. If it was introduced into this place on 21 October 1997, that should be enough time for even the Australian Greens. There is no reason to delay further debate and, hopefully, passage of this bill so that the Commonwealth can meet its responsibility to the states and put into effect national standards of environment protection, which has to be in the interests of all Australians.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>820</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What a mess the minister has got himself into yet again. He says that he did not consider that this was an urgent piece of legislation before the election. He did not get it the priority before the election that he now says it has. He failed to get it in amongst the jostling for bills before the election, but suddenly it is the end of the year and he says that it is important. He goes back as far as 1992 to put his case.</para></talk.start><para>He is an inconsistent, vacillating minister who cannot make up his mind. He indicated to the Senate just a few weeks ago that this bill would be coming on next year—at least his office did—and suddenly he thinks it is urgent. I suppose somebody has given him a kick in the rump somewhere along the line and said, `Hey, we want this through. It is a piece of environmental legislation and we want it to get up.'</para><para>The problem for the minister is that it is an ancillary piece of legislation, if you like, to his general push to divest himself, this government and the Commonwealth of their national environmental responsibilities. It is generally part of the push to move to the lowest common denominator as far as the environment is concerned, to say that the only things that this government is interested in are those things where it can achieve agreement with all the states and territories.</para><para>We ought to be taking the other tack. The real debate here, which is not going to be 
 entertained in this process, is how the government is going to implement its powers under the constitution to protect the environment of this nation. Pushing through under these circumstances this sort of change to the rules to allow this piece of legislation to get through under the covers before Christmas is not something I am going to entertain as well. The minister has made a hash of his program. He has not been able to get it in order. What was not urgent a month or so ago is suddenly very urgent now. He is totally inconsistent. He does not know what he is doing. It is because he does not have a shred of reputation as far as the environment is concerned. Coming in here this morning and saying suddenly that this is urgent, that he wants the rules of the Senate to be changed and that on this occasion he sees it only as a technicality is not good enough. The minister has got to do better than that, and I will be joining Senator Margetts in voting against this.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>820</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition does have considerable criticisms of the way in which the government has handled its legislative program. However, I do note that the minister outlined the time lines on this particular measure. My understanding is that this bill was introduced into the parliament on 21 October 1997. It was referred to the Standing Committee on the Selection of Bills on 19 November 1997 and the committee reported on 12 March 1998.</para></talk.start><para>Nonetheless, there are considerable concerns about the way in which this bill has been developed. A number of interest groups and state governments have expressed significant concerns about the deficiencies and inconsistencies of the bill, in particular on the means by which the Commonwealth has sought to exempt the Commonwealth from the application of certain territory laws and on the particular measures of compliance.</para><para>There have also been concerns expressed about the degree to which this minister would be able to attract unfettered discretion in the consideration of environmental matters and at the way in which this bill seeks to concentrate on the enforcement mechanisms without necessarily seeking to ensure that there is actual compliance with environmental protec 
 tion measures. So there is a range of matters that the opposition has concerns about, and the way in which this bill has been structured is part of those concerns. We are concerned about questions of accountability and the degree to which transparency tests will apply to Commonwealth actions in this regard. However, we do not support the use of the cut-off motion in this regard for this particular bill, and therefore we will be supporting the exemption from the cut-off motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>821</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of the Democrats to echo some of the concerns and criticisms that have been put forward in response to the government's motion today.

It is in relation to the powers to grant a launch permit and the criteria that should be taken into account by the minister when making that particular grant. The Democrats consider the amendment before the chair to be a compromise amendment. It is adding a requirement that space objects should not contain radioactive or toxic materials if certain reporting arrangements or special considerations have not been satisfied.</para></talk.start><para>So this amendment does not prevent the granting of a launch permit to someone who seeks to put these substances into space, even though the Democrats have said repeatedly now that we would prefer a blanket ban on such substances. We are saying that it is up to the minister but we would like to see certain accountability provisions in place, and 
 that is that the minister has to table a risk and a hazard assessment. We think that that is the least that can be asked under such serious circumstances.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>822</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government is not inclined to accept this amendment. We believe that it involves an excessive degree of regulation that is unnecessary. The <inline ref="s177">Space Activities Bill 1998</inline>  clearly provides in 26(3)(e) that, in relation to a launch permit, the minister must be:</para></talk.start><para>. . . satisfied that the probability of the launch or launches, or any connected return, causing substantial harm to public health or public safety or causing substantial damage to property is sufficiently low . . . </para><para>The minister has to be satisfied of all those things before the permit can be granted. That clause will require the new Space Licensing and Safety Office to approve the payload and the launch vehicle fuel as part of the approval process for each launch. The launch permit will specify the nature of the payload.</para><para>I note that the fuels to be used in the launch vehicle will be part of the environmental impact statement process, which is the case with Kistler. We have difficulty with using the word `toxic' in relation to this, given the fact that the definition is so wide. `Toxic material' in the definition in the Democrats amendment is:</para><para>. . . any material which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death or harm to life forms.</para><para>What does `harm to life forms' mean? If an insect is harmed, is it toxic material when this thing is activated? It is incredibly wide in its scope. Kerosene and liquid oxygen, which are the main fuels, could, under this definition, come within it. That could mean that every single launch is caught up by this particular amendment.</para><para>We have, as other parties know, agreed to accept an opposition amendment providing that the space object:</para><para>. . . must not contain any fissionable material unless the Minister's written approval has first been obtained . . .  
</para><para>That is an additional safety measure which we are prepared to accept. So on that basis we do not believe there is any basis for introducing this Democrats amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>822</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are a number of issues in relation to safety in space and, of course, for launch procedures. We are finding that over time space is being seen to be, as the air and water are often seen to be, a commodity that can be used and abused to an endless extent. As we are going further into the satellite age, we are putting more and more satellites into the atmosphere. I believe there are something like 25,000 objects currently in orbit. I also believe that when there are explosions in the atmosphere a lot of those bodies can break up into something like 800 or so pieces.</para></talk.start><para>Putting satellites into space is actually getting to be a relatively dangerous thing. This harks back to the original proposal by the Australian Democrats in relation to liability. We actually have to consider, on a case-by-case basis, the toxicity of what we are putting into space, and what the growing likelihood might be of a collision in space. We have to consider what the likelihood is of the items on board, which might be toxic, radio-toxic or otherwise, somehow either getting into the atmosphere or causing a collision which will affect other satellites or objects in space.</para><para>We have to have a cumulative risk assessment. You probably have to adjust this risk assessment, based on the nature of each launch and the area into which it is launched. There was an explosion within about 25 kilometres of the Hubble space platform, and in space terms that is not very far away.</para><para>Like everyone else, we are impressed by what can be done with technology but we, as Australians, ought to be taking some responsibility for the potential problems that exist with the technology. We should consider what our responsibilities might be. I think that the Democrats amendment is worthy of support. I am concerned and disappointed that the government is not prepared to support it.</para><para>Amendment not agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>823</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move Democrats amendments (3) and (4):</para></talk.start><para>(3)	 Clause 26, page 19 (line 6), omit "of mass destruction".</para><para>(4)	 Clause 29, page 20 (line 24), omit "of mass destruction".</para><para>These amendments relate to the clause which provides the criteria which must be satisfied for the grant of a launch permit. From the Democrats' perspective, as I have outlined, radioactive material should not be sent into space, either where the material heads off into deep space beyond the Earth's orbit or where it orbits the Earth. In the latter circumstance the orbit decay means that the material will return to Earth. For low orbits this can be a matter of days and for very high orbits this can be over a thousand years.</para><para>The Democrats are particularly concerned that space should not be used as a place of war and that weapons should be excluded from space, so these amendments remove the words `of mass destruction' from both clauses (26) and (29) to exclude all weaponry. Although these amendments will not stop all defence space objects, they should at least stop Australia's commercial use of space for weapons. This is where our concern lies with this bill in general. We are not addressing the Commonwealth's powers to involve itself in defence; we are concerned here only with the commercial use of space.</para><para>The Democrats do not think a launch permit should be granted to launch weaponry into space commercially. For example, a private sector company in the United States can deliver, through a launch into space, what is called an `exo-atmospheric kill vehicle'—or EKV—weapon. It says that in space the `the EKVs will separate from their boosters, immediately detect attacking missiles, distinguish real targets from decoys and destroy them by hit-to-kill intercepts'. These are part of United States government contracts. My concern would be that a private sector company should not be allowed to launch such devices.</para><para>Under the present legislation it is possible such devices might be granted a launch 
 permit. These amendments would prevent this. The government would need to rely on other powers to launch such devices. The increasing power of the private sector—and its capacity to resource undertakings in space—means this is a valid concern for many Australians. All we are asking is that the private sector not be allowed to launch weapons into space without government involvement. Where the private sector is involved in defence, that should be outside the scope of this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>823</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I believe that we should not be setting up a new frontier for conflict and weapons. According to <inline font-style="italic">Reuters Business Briefing</inline>  of 26 August this year, entitled `USA—new space race', the US Department of Defense, despite paying out hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade its own satellite capabilities, is still only able to pass one-third of the data required to meet projected demand. With plans to spend a further $7.8 billion on refurbishing and on leasing commercial satellite time over the next years, it is under pressure to make more use of commercial satellites and commercial launch facilities.</para></talk.start><para>Is this why Australia's space industry is going to be relied on? Are we to be the United States military's low cost, offshore option? We believe the United States are our allies in many ways, but just how closely do we want to be integrated into the global military industrial network? Where has it gone in recent years? We have seen the Gulf War. Where now? In the aftermath of the Gulf War, we do not have the guts to stand up to America and say, `Enough is enough.' With regard to Iraq, where the Iraqi people are starving, we still have a situation where I believe, for commercial reasons in relation to oil, the United States are keeping up the blockade. It is not because of famine or drought or some other natural disaster but because of politics and the politics of a boycott.</para><para>The more we tie ourselves into this commercial military machine, which is building a multimillion dollar industry based on the needs of this military machine, the more difficult it will be for us to assert an independent position on issues like Iraq or on any 
 other issues for that matter. It is time for us in Australia to assert our real independence, to take a principled stand and to say no to war, no to the military uses of space and no to weapons of any kind in space. We are not talking about nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction but about all weapons. Who would we be shooting at in space?</para><para>This is an opportunity similar to the position taken by New Zealand in banning nuclear armed ships. It is a bit like that for us today. We could say that we are a small nation, one that could make a lot of money by joining in the war game. And, besides, someone else would do it if we did not. But we are prepared to give that up for a more important principle—the principle of space as a no-go area for weapons and space as a zone of peace.</para><para>The notion to take the ban on weapons one step further is one that recognises that we are not just part of the global military overkill—and I use that word advisedly—if we participate in a whole range of military activities in space, including targeting systems, command communications in the event of military strikes and military intelligence gathering. We do not necessarily want to stop Australian troops from using mobile phones or geopositioning technology, but there are other exemption conditions in this bill for defence and national security. It does not specify what it is to be used for.</para><para>Section 16 excludes the Commonwealth or a member of the Defence Force. We want to ban the use of Australia's commercial facilities for launches for other people's military purposes, such as spying by friendly nations, positioning of weapons and all other military uses. This again would send an important signal to the international community about Australia's determination to make space a weapons free zone and a zone of peace.</para><para>I urge the Senate to support this amendment. The amendments by the Greens (WA) seek to achieve the same end as those of the Democrats. Obviously we are fully supporting amendments which have a similar basis to our own. We do believe that we leave ourselves open to being involved in the commercial use of military technologies of quite unspecified 
 types as a result of the passing of this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>824</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition is not going to support amendments (3) and (4) moved by the Democrats or similar amendments moved by the Greens (WA) and Senator Margetts, Nos (2) and (5) on their sheet.

Senator Margetts even got down to satellites that are spying or collecting intelligence. These satellites are a part of the accepted verification systems that operate in the world today to ensure that we do not blow each other up.

Such intelligence gathering satellites have actually made the world a safer place. No matter what the leader of a country may have said, the leader of the other country that is potentially in conflict would know that what had been said could only be taken at face value, because they 
 would both know what they were really doing. Both sides would know in the end that they could not hide what they were doing. That made the world a safer place. Intelligence gathering satellites carried out the verification programs. To imply that these would be covered by the definition of weapons is of extreme concern. It is something I do not think we should embark upon in this particular bill. Our colleague, the shadow foreign affairs minister, would have a much bigger interest in this bill if that were the case in terms of the definition.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On the next area of weaponry I would have liked to have heard from Senator Stott Despoja in particular. Apart from nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, what are the other weapons that could be put on a satellite or in a space vehicle that would possibly be a threat? There may be some—I am not a technical person in this area—but I would like to have heard some examples of other weapons. I do not think having a revolver inside a space capsule is a great threat to Australia or to other citizens on the face of the earth, although it may be a threat to the other astronaut or cosmonaut inside the space station. I am not sure that you can operate many traditional and conventional weapons, machine guns and so on in existing satellites and with the technology we have at the moment. I may be wrong; I would be more than happy to hear some of that evidence.</para><para>As I said in the debate last week, this bill is our first attempt to regulate our involvement in space activities. I said the opposition does not see this as the ultimate end, as a perfect bill in any way, but experience will dictate to us what further amendments may be needed. Also, we have on the record, which I think is most important—and I raised this with the minister—that publicity given to any approval will be made public. He quite rightly said that he as a minister, and probably any other minister, to make political capital for the government of the day would be up there with drums beating saying that he had approved a rocket launch from Australia. I accept that completely.</para><para>If there is publicity and public debate about the approval, we are satisfied. If there is some 
 attempt to hide it we may have to come back and amend this bill to say, `Before the approval is given, you have to have a 30-day or two-month or whatever period when anybody can object and put evidence to the minister to say why he should reject the approval.' If it turns out that that is needed, let experience dictate it, but I do not want to tie it down at the moment. Though no-one wants to see development of weapons in space or space be turned into a new cold war or hot war field, I have to say I think the lack of definition, by both the Democrats and the Greens, means that on balance we certainly will not be supporting the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>825</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think Senator Schacht has very usefully and succinctly put the arguments against this amendment.

No exception should ever be allowed to the rule banning nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction, and no exception should be allowed on insurance issues either.

We were advised of problems with this and instead tried to achieve the same aim of encouraging a culture of safety in this industry by deleting the word `substantial'.

We do not support the amendments to clause 29 moved by the Greens. We believe that the first amendment, where she is deleting `except to the extent that the permit otherwise specifies', is a standard technical arrangement made in many regulations. Of course, the minister, if he were to use that clause, would have to publicise the fact and it would become a matter of public debate if he tried to rort it or overwhelmingly use it to get around other matters contained in the legislation, but you cannot be totally prescriptive in all the regulations you draw up in a piece of legislation. We believe that it is unnecessary and is not conducive to the good workings of the regime to remove that clause—to remove that ability of the government. Again, the proof will be in the eating of the pudding and, if it were rorted, the people and the parliament would expect it to be amended.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to hear what the minister has to say about Senator Margetts's amendment to clause 29, which deletes the word `substantial'. I believe that if you remove `substantial' then you have to provide a definition of what is `harm'. Someone could claim that when the rocket went off and lit up Tarcoola in the middle of night, they lost their sleep and suffered some harm, but I am not sure that that is real harm if the people of Tarcoola, which is a fair way still from Woomera launch site, were given fair warning that the launch would be taking place. If you remove the word `substantial', some people could get litigious about a few things, and you could find anything related to the launch could cause harm to somebody somewhere and make it very difficult for the launch to take place.</para><para>The final amendment is to insert after (b) a new clause:</para><para>(ba)	 the space object or objects must not be used for any military purpose;</para><para>I turn to the verification role of satellites. Satellites, which all sides use, could be claimed to be for a military purpose, yet they have been very successful in ensuring that for the last 50 years we have not had a nuclear 
 war in the world. They have also been used extensively at a conventional level for monitoring of military activity in Bosnia, which has helped the NATO forces try to conclude peace or a cease-fire. It has been published that the Americans used their satellites to identify the mass graves where war crimes had been committed in Bosnia. I suspect that it is a military satellite that provided that information, but it is also information that hopefully may lead one day to the people who perpetrated that awful atrocity—that massacre—being brought to justice and suffering the penalty accordingly.

 it has some oversight.

He was talking about how to define harm. `Harm' can be so open ended and difficult to define, but I am wondering what makes `substantial harm' any easier to define. According to the dictionary definition, `substantial' can be both real or actual. So the implication of some of Senator Schacht's comments is, if it is substantial harm, that it is real; it is not just peripheral.</para><para>On the general issue of definitions, I think `harm' is just as easy or hard to define as is `substantial harm'. As we have outlined, our concern is that, if any harm results or eventuates as a consequence of the launch or certain materials, this section, in particular, does not seek to prevent such launches.

To put this clause in means that could never ever occur—that would be completely and utterly prohibited. So there is a question there about national security.

 a satellite as part of that launch.

Because ships have to be lighter, it would be too difficult to have a nuclear reactor on board with the same level of safeguards—encasement and so on—as would be the case with a land-based reactor.

We believe they are adequate and appropriate—there is no evidence they will not be. If we are all wrong and that proves to be the case, of course parliament can amend the bill in due course.

We know that there are leaking monstrosities of nuclear reactors from the former Soviet Union. We know there are nuclear reactors leaking under the sea. We also know—as I have just given the example, and the minister did not bother to reply to that—that there are nuclear reactors leaking in space. Considering the Christmas Island example is actually using Russian space technology, if we are ticking off the potential for hurtling nuclear reactors into space, I wonder whether the Australian government is so confident with the technology that we are actually prepared to provide full liability. The answer from the earlier debate was no. So if we cannot provide that full liability, then we should not be sending enough fissionable material into space to form an independent explosion if something else happened to it.

This amendment proposes a mechanism for reporting to the parliament where an exemption certificate has been granted according to sections 11, 13 or 15—that is, for return certificates and licences for 
 launch facilities. I would not expect that there would be a huge number of these licences and certificates and, because the safety issues involved in launching and operating space vehicles are significant, it is reasonable to require reporting to parliament. Further, the possibility that the requirements for certificates and licences might be exempted suggests that increased parliamentary scrutiny is required.</para></talk.start><para>The safety issues here are central to this amendment, but I am also concerned that the opportunities for development and jobs may encourage the government of the day to be tempted to take some shortcuts. So I asked the minister—and I acknowledge once again the excellent assistance I have had from him, particularly his office and the department—in what circumstances the minister might issue exemption certificates. In the response the minister suggested that the circumstances were those where the risk to public health and safety were minimal and the launch was in the national interest or conferred a significant public benefit. This might include the acquisition of valuable scientific or meteorological data. The minister also suggested that a launch of an experimental project by an educational institution was another circumstance. This amendment would meet my concerns and would be unlikely to impede in any way the operations of the bill.</para><para>I seek clarification through you, Mr Chairman.

Part of the purpose of this bill is to share the liability, but there may be occasions when the Commonwealth believes it is appropriate to take on the liability.

It is not that he said it needed to be, but it seems to me that if there is going to be the potential for public money to be spent it ought to have the scrutiny of parliament, otherwise we might end up with something at a Senate estimates committee for which there is no actual announcement ahead of time—the money is spent and then basically we have no say in it because it has already happened.</para></talk.start><para>Some of these insurance requirements may involve a lot more than the government thinks.

We can get further research on that if you like, but it is really just to ensure that there is a mechanism by which, if circumstances arise that dictate the need for an exemption, that can occur. We think it appropriate; the minister is still bearing a considerable burden of responsibility and, in so doing, I would not have thought it would be done lightly at all.

That is not surprising, because the Australian people can remember Labor's term. They can remember home interest rates of 17 per cent. They can remember when small business was paying interest rates of over 20 per cent. They can remember credit card interest rates of 25 per cent under Labor. They can remember one million people being unemployed. They can remember that Labor left a massive domestic deficit of $10.3 billion. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Australian people decided to return a government with a demonstrated record of sound economic management, with all the benefits which flow from that to all Australians.</para></talk.start><para>What a contrast between what I have just said was the legacy of Labor and what the Australian people are getting under the coalition: record low inflation, so people keep the value of the dollar in their pockets; and record low interest rates of 6.7 per cent on a housing loan, down from 17 per cent under Labor. That is a saving of $320 a month on a $100,000 loan. People know that under the coalition there has been massive business investment, which translates into jobs for the future. In fact, 393,500 new jobs have been created since this government first came to office in March 1996. Notwithstanding the difficulties in Asia, the record of the Howard government in maintaining sound economic management is leading to material benefits for all Australians.</para><para>It is good that this continues to be seen today as we move into this new term. The Yellow Pages survey—which we remember Senator Schacht used to like to quote—last week said that 62 per cent of people surveyed are expecting an increase in sales, 60 per cent are expecting an increase in profitability, 63 per cent are confident about their prospects in 1999, and jobs growth was the strongest reported in two years. Interestingly, only 16 per cent of these people voted for Labor. Look at the employment surveys: the unemployment rate has now dropped to 7.7 per cent, the lowest since 1990; and skilled 
 vacancies rose again in November, which means they are 18½ per cent higher than they were in November 1997—the highest level since January 1990. So there is greater hope for the unemployed under the Howard government.</para><para>New private capital investment for the September quarter is 6.3 per cent higher than the 1997 figure. The estimate for private capital expenditure in 1998-99 is still strong at $45.4 billion. Profits are still coming in at good figures. Mining sector profits are up by six per cent to $18.5 billion in the last reports. The construction industry is again reporting strong figures. It is time that the Labor Party faced the reality that they were thrown out of government because they failed the Australian people on economic management. The coalition government is showing that you can take tough but fair decisions, get the fundamentals right, and give all these benefits back to Australians in more jobs, lower home interest rates, more chances for employment and benefits for small business. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>836</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

That is Senator Carr's contribution to the debate. The people of Australia might ask of the Labor Party: which way? I thought it was summed up well last week by a former Labor minister, Mr Johns. What did he say? He said that the opposition had better get used to the idea that they are not running the country. He said that Beazley's statement after the election that Howard had no mandate smacked of a sore loser. That is what the Labor Party is all about—it is a sore loser.

Just remember that in 1983 when they came to government 70 per cent of Australians had private health insurance. When they went out of government it had been reduced to 35 per cent. So they succeeded in halving the number of Australians in private health care. The cost of premiums under Labor went up by 12 per cent. Over a hundred thousand people were left on waiting lists. This was the legacy that the coalition government inherited and sought to do something about. It is a big job, and it is true that we brought in in the last term initiatives to try and support those who were in private health care and to encourage others to join. Why did we do that? Because we on this side of the chamber believe that private health care is an essential part of the total health package in this country. People are entitled to choice and are entitled to best quality care, and they are most likely to achieve that if you have both a strong public sector health system and a strong private health sector.</para></talk.start><para>Labor really succeeded in many ways, because they talked down the private health care sector as well. Remember Prime Minister Keating saying, `It is not necessary. They can go to the public health sector.' That is totally misunderstanding that Australians actually want choice and totally misunderstanding that if you have a healthy private health sector it takes pressure off the public health sector as well. It helps achieve the maximum outcome for any set number of dollars. That is what the coalition is about. If Senator Faulkner 
 wants us to apologise for coming in here and saying that we will introduce policies and seek to pass legislation to strengthen the private health sector and to strengthen the capacity of Australians to take out private health care, we are certainly not going to do so.</para><para>We have further initiatives that we announced in the last election to give a 30 per cent rebate to help support Australians in private health care, and to help encourage others to join, to start to redress the damage that Labor had done over 13 years. It is a policy that is sensible in the interest of a strong health care sector in Australia and the capacity of all Australians to benefit from that. So we make no apology about that. If anything, as I said, our mistake was that we underestimated the damage that Labor had done and we underestimated how much it would cost to get it right again. But that is our commitment, and we will achieve that commitment if we get a bit of cooperation in this place. But what is the response of the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats and so forth to our proposal, which reduces the cost of private health care for Australians? They say that they will vote against it. Why? They say that it is exclusive. Exclusivity and elitism—somebody wanting to take out private health care is elitist. That is what you say. We say that they are entitled to it and they are entitled to it at reasonable cost, and that is what we are seeking to give them. All the Labor Party is willing to do is to vote it down.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>837</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

If we are to assist that process then we need to remove the unnecessary burdens that are placed on it. This dramatic change in the taxation system that we successfully took to the last election will remove a raft of taxation imposts on the small business sector. Just as importantly, there are other burdens that do make a very significant difference. The unfair dismissals legislation is a classic example. I simply do not understand why their latest shadow minister will not take notice of his own wife, who has told him that this is a very significant impediment to small business—she is a small business person—being able to employ new people. She complained about the level of red tape and regulation. We all know that it is there, and so do 
 they. But they are not prepared to do anything about it.</para></talk.start><para>The Yellow Pages Small Business Index survey of October last found that Australia's small businesses still find it very difficult to hire new people because of Labor's unfair dismissal laws. Seventy-nine per cent of respondents thought they would be better off if exempted from unfair dismissal laws, 33 per cent would have been more likely in the past to recruit new employees, and 38 per cent would be more likely in the future to recruit new employees. COSBOA has estimated that some 50,000 jobs would be created if a small business exemption were introduced. So why is it that the Labor Party is opposed to these overwhelmingly sensible changes? We know from that same survey that only 16 per cent of Australia's small business proprietors voted for the ALP at the last election. According to that same survey, 61 per cent were very pleased at the election of a coalition government.</para><para>Why is it that Labor has got itself so fundamentally offside? Why is it not prepared to do anything about it? The answer lies in the usual place, and that is that Labor does not govern for small business, Labor does not govern for improving the economy and Labor does not govern to try to improve the level of employment in this country.

Of the 20 most recently arrived senators on the other side, 17 were paid trade union officials. It is an absolute disgrace. They are not interested in good

It is quite clear that if you are to get employment levels down in this country you have to focus on small business—not in the job destructing way that the Labor Party is proposing to do but in the sensible way that our taxation policy does, removing a whole raft of imposts.

As is well known, two-thirds of health care costs are incurred by people over the age of 65. So it is inevitable that premiums will increase given that, as a result of the measures that the Labor Party put in place, we had that precipitous fall from 70 per cent to 35 per cent and the fact that we have a community rating principle whereby the premiums are equal for young people and old people.

It is easy to take a snapshot of time and take three years out of it. What Senator West should have asked was: what was the profitability over the previous 15 years? There would have been an interesting answer to that. The reality in relation to business, which the other side would not understand, is that there are periods of time when profits are made and there are periods of time when losses are made. These balance out. Otherwise the private health insurance industry would go broke, which is what the Labor Party wants in any case. They have deliberately attempted to produce a system where there is no private health insurance available. They are obstructing what we are trying to do in giving people freedom of choice by bolstering the private health system.</para></talk.start><para>The Private Health Insurance Administration Council has recently released its annual report on the operations of the registered health funds for 1997-98. As usual, the Labor Party has focused on the increase in premium income collected and the fact that benefits paid have not increased by the same amount. It is disappointing that the media did not report what has occurred in the previous years. What needs to be said and understood is that over the past 15 years premiums collected have increased by 213 per cent, but during the same period benefits paid have risen by 235 per cent. Over the last five years, the relativities have been the same. Premiums collected have increased by 15.6 per cent and benefits paid have increased by 18.9 per cent. Even Senator Faulkner would understand the difference between 15.6 per cent and 18.9 per cent. If this is not pessimistic enough in terms of the future of the industry, let us also look at the industry reserves in 1997-98. They fell by 2.5 per cent. Net operating profit for the industry actually showed there was a loss of $6.6 million.</para><para>It is obvious that on the one hand we have superficial media reporting on the state of the private health insurance industry and on the other we have fact after fact showing that the industry has been performing so poorly that it has little chance for a long-term future.

You cannot guarantee that they will not rise, because we have an ageing population, people dropping out of private health insurance and the cost of the public sector patient is higher than the cost of the private sector patient. It is only for ideological reasons that the Labor Party is not supporting our proposal. We have to bolster the private health insurance industry. A parallel would be to close all the private schools of Australia and then dump the children on the public education system. That is what they are proposing to do; the similarities are there.

The rural transaction centres will help small business in regional Australia at a later stage by including videoconferencing, the Job Network, the Internet, private health insurance claims and Centrelink, and there will also be a range of federal, state and local government initiatives. These centres will be run by the local community or by small business in many of the very small centres. They will allow the pharmacy, the newsagent and the local corner store to add this range of services to their facilities.</para><para>Under Labor, banks closed down in the bush. Under Labor, many of the services that we in the regions used to accept as normal dissipated. We intend to encourage the banks and the credit unions to work with us, with local communities and, in many instances, with local government organisations to make sure that these services are available in rural and regional areas.</para><para>There will be benefits for small business. We are very keen to ensure that small business, particularly in rural and regional Australia, prospers because, as one of my colleagues mentioned earlier on, it is small business that provides all of the jobs in, and the bulk of exports from, rural and regional Australia. So we are very determined to make sure that they have the most appropriate form of assistance that is possible. The improved services will boost small business. Local business will be enabled to stay in the towns and will generate employment in rural industries. So it is a good news story for rural and regional business. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>847</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>NSW</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

What was revealed today in his answers was the creation of welfare dependency by private health insurance providers. That will be the impact of the government's measures as described by Senator Herron in response to the questions today.</para><para>The government's proposal to pour $1.4 billion of public funding into propping up private health insurance is a disgrace. It is welfare dependency at its worst. This private health insurance issue is a classic example of a government throwing money at a problem when it cannot come to grips with the problem. We have had a history in recent times of support measures for private health insurance, but numbers are continuing to fall and premiums are rising. The government has no idea how to control these increases in costs and the fall in private health insurance membership. So the answer is: throw more money at the problem. Throw $1.4 billion of taxpayer funds 
 to the 30 per cent of the population who still take out private health insurance.</para><para>When asked to justify this the government can provide no modelling, no performance indicators—nothing to justify this, other than that it will be very popular with the 30 per cent of private health insurance members in this country.</para><para>I accept that those people struggling to pay quite expensive premiums will regard the measure as being of assistance. They will, in the short term. But—as they well know—what happened with the last rebate and what has happened in the history of private health insurance is that any support they receive will get eaten up in higher premiums.</para><para>There is nothing in this measure about capping of fees. There is nothing in the measure about dealing with the increasing administrative costs of private health insurance funds. Last year, their income went up by seven per cent and the payment of benefits went up by one per cent—they had a $300 million bonanza. This is the problem the government is seeking to fix by throwing another $1.4 billion of public money at it—it just does not make any sense.</para><para>My opposition to this measure is not ideological, it is economic. There is no basis for throwing $1.4 billion of public funds at what they perceive to be the problem. Even the government cannot provide any rational answer as to why they think that might solve the issue.</para><para>They claim, on their own figures, that it might increase private health insurance membership from 30.3 per cent of the population to 33 per cent—a very meagre increase in the percentage of people taking out private health insurance. So there is no pretence that this is going to solve the problem. It is a complete waste of money.</para><para>Today, in answer to my question, the minister provided figures which indicated that by providing this rebate the government will, in fact, narrow the difference between the cost to the government of those who are insured versus those who are not. He now says that the cost to the government of someone who is not insured is about $1,041 per annum, 
 whereas with the rebate it will be only $814 for those who are insured. So the government is going to save $227 on costs per person if they are insured. But, on the government's own figures of the increased membership they expect to occur as a result of this measure, that will cost them $3,000 per head in government funds—to save $227. That is the economics of this measure—$3,000 per head of public funds wasted on a scheme to save the government $227 per annum per head, being the difference in cost between those who are insured and those who are not.</para><para>Those are the figures given by the minister today in response to my question. These are not my figures; they are his. As I say, this is not about the opposition's ideology; this is about the government's ideology. It is throwing public funds at a problem that they cannot define with a solution that they cannot explain. It is an absolute economic nonsense.</para><para>On top of that, the government seeks to maintain the effective one per cent less tax payable by high income earners who are insured. So they are going to provide a third subsidy by funding private health insurance for high income earners, who are also going to be given a one per cent tax concession at the other end. The effect of that measure is that the government is subsidising two-thirds of high income earners' private health insurance costs. The addition of the effective tax discount with the insurance rebate  means that people on over $100,000 a year will have two-thirds of the cost of their private health insurance met by the government.

The first is: what is the Labor Party planning to do about private health insurance? Is it simply opposing the government's measures with no plan in mind? Is it simply hoping that private health insurance will die? I know the shadow minister for health, Jenny Macklin, has absolutely no plan whatsoever other than a zero private health insurance policy. I think that is very sad because, on top of what the shadow minister has done, there is a 
 scaremongering process being undertaken today by the Labor Party, which is not at all healthy for the future of private health insurance.</para></talk.start><para>There is already talk about the funds increasing their premiums. The fact is that the Labor Party in government for over 13 years did not reject one request for a premium increase made by the funds. The difference is that when we came to government, we set up a formula and a procedure under which the funds had to apply for increases. At the moment, no fund has applied for a future premium increase. No premium adjustments will be considered before 1 May next year. If premium adjustments are necessary to maintain individual fund solvency—which is an equation that happens to be overlooked by the Labor Party—for the first time, they will be announced on a common day with no further increases for 12 months. As I said, the fact still remains that the Labor Party did not reject one request for a premium increase in their entire 13 years in government.</para><para>The fact of the matter remains also that funds will in future face a tougher regime for premium applications and the coalition is strengthening the power of the industry regulator and prudential supervisor, PHIAC.</para><para>The question still remains—what is the Labor Party policy? Do they simply want to abolish private health insurance? Do they want to make sure that it is tougher for the pensioners and low income earners to pay for their private health insurance? Because that is clearly what is going to be the result if the Labor Party and the minor parties oppose the legislation which will come before the Senate in the near future.</para><para>If the Senate rejects the rebate legislation, the funds will have to redraw their business plans and they will virtually have to increase their premiums. That would be as a direct consequence of the Labor Party policy. They do not seem to worry about that. They do not seem to worry that there are many low income earners who take out private health insurance.</para><para>Last week, we had the farce of the shadow minister suggesting some weird and wonderful way of calculating what would have to be 
 reimbursed to the states. She made a comment that it was only going to cost the Commonwealth an extra $830 million if there was no rebate available. We currently have just over 30 per cent of people insured and it is a recognised fact, even by the Labor Party, that in five years time there would only be 20 per cent of people insured if there is no rebate. And yet the shadow minister said that it would only cost the Commonwealth government an extra $830 million. Heavens above!: she cannot even do her maths. She does not understand the Commonwealth Medicare agreement with the states. If what she is forecasting were to be the case, the cost to the Commonwealth would be close on $2.5 billion—not $830 million.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—How much?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name></talker><para>—It would be $2.5 billion, Senator Calvert—that is how much it would cost the Commonwealth.

Allocating $1.4 billion to prop up the private health insurance scheme is absolutely outrageous. Senator Herron said that it is inevitable that these fees will rise, so a family with an income of less than $70,000 will be paying, within less than two years, exactly what they are paying now. So it is not going to benefit those people. Putting $1.4 billion into the public health system in this country would be far wiser than propping up private health insurance companies. After all, even if you have private health insurance, if something diabolical happens to you, such as a heart attack or a stroke, you do not get taken to a private hospital. The ambulance person does 
 not say, `Are you paying massive private health insurance fees? I'll take you to a private hospital.' No, you are taken to the public hospital because the public hospital has the facilities to cater for those things. The cost of the medicines and the equipment in the public hospitals is enormous. We need far more money in the public hospital system for the benefit of everybody in Australia.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Herron today just could not answer most of the questions—absolutely not.

That is the problem, you see. We used to have a very good hospital system in Australia where we had a nice balance of public and private hospitals. In 1983 the Labor Party, on an ideological high, introduced the Medicare system and set out to destroy the private hospital system and the private hospital industry.</para></talk.start></continue><para>So what we have today is a situation where we have imported to Australia a system very much like the British National Health Service, with all its failures. Whereas before people were able to be treated quickly and easily, today in Australia we have a situation where we have overcrowded public hospital waiting rooms and enormous waiting lists in public hospitals because people have dropped out of the private health system, and the public hospital system has shown that it is not able to cope with the workload.</para><para>Even Graham Richardson, the former Labor health minister, said that if private health membership dropped below a critical level there would be a crisis in the Australian health system. We face that crisis now: private health insurance membership is down to some 30 per cent, the public hospital system cannot cope and waiting lists are growing day by day. So the government has decided to take a measure which will take the pressure off the public hospitals and see the underutilised private hospital system reactivated and working more smoothly again.</para><para>The benefits of this 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance will mean that some 
 six million Australians will have an incentive to rejoin private health insurance funds.

He never answers questions. It is interesting to look at a few historical facts. Firstly, which current political leader was a member of a government that abolished universal health coverage in this country? Of course, it was the present Prime Minister, John Howard, 
 when he was a member of the Fraser government, which abolished Medibank.</para></talk.start><para>Medibank was established many years ago by a Labor government to provide universal coverage for all Australians so that they had an entitlement to decent health care in the public hospital system, but a coalition government abolished it. Which current political leader, when he was in opposition in the 1980s, swore that if he ever got back into power he would abolish Medicare? It was John Howard, of course, the current Prime Minister. He swore to abolish Medicare.</para><para>About two years prior to the 1996 election, John Howard, realising the error of his ways, said to the people, `I've changed my mind; I now support Medicare and I will do nothing to dismantle it.' But what happened after that election? Within 12 months his government brought in a budget that stripped $1.5 billion out of the public health system. They starved the states of vital health funds to run the public hospitals. We had the situation last year where every state premier and every state and territory health minister in this country was telling Dr Wooldridge and Mr Howard, `You are not putting enough money into the public health system.' They were telling this government, in the words of Jeff Kennett, that their private health insurance rebate scheme was a joke, that it was a mickey mouse scheme. That is what this government has done to health in this country.</para><para>When they were elected in 1996 they said they had the solution for private health insurance. They said they would bring in a scheme, take money out of the public hospitals—$1.5 billion—and pay an amount to private health fund members of about $450 a year and that that would increase the level of private health insurance. What happened? Membership went down by three per cent—and it is still going down.</para><para>These are the people who said they had the solution. What was Senator Herron's solution? It was to throw money at the problem. This is the same minister who says that the worst thing you could ever do to solve a problem in health in this country is to throw money at it. He lectures us time and time again. But that is what this government is proposing to do 
 now: throw more money at the problem. They are proposing to throw more vitally necessary public health funds at the problem by taking it out of the public health system and giving it as a subsidy, basically, to private health funds.</para><para>When you ask what impact this is going to have, they say, `We do not really know—who can tell?' Senator Herron said that today. Senator Herron could not answer any questions. In response to the interjections, Senator Herron was only able to say one thing about what will happen after they give this $1.4 billion subsidy to private health insurance: premiums will still rise. They are going to rise by the order of four per cent. This government accuses the Labor Party of having an ideological objection to private health insurance. That is not the case.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">LIGHTFOOT</name><name role="display">Senator Lightfoot</name></talker><para>—You want to destroy the private health system; you want to destroy choice.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name></talker><para>—We do not want to destroy choice, but we do have an ideological commitment to providing universal health cover for all Australians through the public health system.

While we believe that there is clearly a place for a private health system in this country—and I acknowledge that I am, and always have been, a member of a private health fund—our obligation in parliament and in government is to put the funds into the public health system for all Australians. We should not take those funds out of the public health system and give them as a subsidy to private health insurance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If we do that, we will end up with a dual system like the one in the United States. People in the United States have access to a very basic level of care in the public hospital system at a much lower standard than in this country, and if you want to get decent health care in the United States you have to pay thousands upon thousands of dollars.

That is known by all Australians. A number one issue for all Australian family households is the pressures and strains they are feeling in regard to health policy, and many are obviously at breaking point. Therefore, we went to the election with the policy of a 30 per cent rebate on private health cover. That policy was supported.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think the Labor Party must have a death wish not to support this tax rebate. What party other than the Labor Party in this parliament does not support tax rebates? They have an ideological bent against the private health insurance system. Senator Gibbs—who, by the way, is a self-confessed holder of private health insurance—talked about choice, yet she would deny that choice of access to private health to many other Australians.</para><para>As was said, over two million Australians who are in the private health system earn less than $30,000. They are under the greatest pressure to keep hold of their health insurance. They are the first to drop out of the system and be forced into the public health system, thus putting more pressures and strains on that system. The fall in participation in the private health system began in the Labor Party's term in 1983 when the private health system was at a healthy 60 per cent. By the time we got into office, it was around 
 34 per cent. We have halted that decline, but more must be done.</para><para>The first thing the Howard government implemented was the private health insurance scheme, which was the first genuine attempt in decades by any federal government to encourage people to go into the private health insurance system, giving them a greater freedom of choice between the private and public health systems. We followed that up with the extra one per cent Medicare levy for incomes over $50,000. I would say that that was about the only reason why the Senator Gibbs of this world took up private health cover.</para><para>We have put in place two initiatives to halt the collapse of the private health system. We now wish to bring in another initiative. It is calculated that for every one per cent of people who drop out of the private health system, some $83 million extra goes onto the states and territories to meet their health budgets. If the decline in private health insurance membership continues, it is calculated that by the turn of the century the federal government will have to find an extra $500 million for the states and territories each and every year just to keep the status quo.</para><para>Since we have been in government, we have increased spending on the public health system by over 18 per cent. We have not ripped the money out of the public health system; we have put more money into it, but we cannot continue putting money into it. It is far more economic and efficient to attend to the private health system.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

The Government does not consider that a patchwork of privacy regimes serves the interests of either consumers or business. In April 1997 the Prime Minister announced that the services of the Privacy Commissioner would be available to assist business to develop privacy codes and meet privacy standards. On 20 February 1998 the Privacy Commissioner issued her "National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information". These principles, developed specifically for the private sector by the Privacy Commissioner through consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, provide a benchmark for all businesses which handle personal information.

The 1996 national State of the Environment Report concluded that a main obstacle to achieving the goals of Ecologically Sustainable Development is structural impediments to the management of complex ecological systems across jurisdictional boundaries. This is particularly true of marine and coastal environments. To be effective, policy, management strategies and responses must occur at the level of catchment and biophysical regions and have a 
 cross-sectoral (multiple-use) approach. Most importantly there is a need for a unified approach from Commonwealth, State, Territory, and Local governments on environmental issues, standards and management.</para><para>In general, many of the issues covered by the recommendations of this Inquiry, including institutional arrangements for Australia's marine jurisdictions, are being considered in the context of the development of Australia's Oceans Policy and the Marine Science and Technology Plan. The Policy and the Plan will be finalised in mid-1998. As the policy development process is yet to be completed, including substantial consultation with stakeholders, any decision now on institutional arrangements or other mechanisms for improving cross-sectoral management will be premature. Broadly speaking, specific responses to committee's recommendations that will be addressed through the Oceans Policy and the Marine Science and Technology Plan cannot be detailed at this time.

The NWQMS is a joint initiative of the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) and the Agricultural and Resource Management 
 Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ). Its aim is `to achieve sustainable use of the nation's water resources by protecting and enhancing their quality while maintaining economic and social development'. The COAG Water Reform Framework recognises the role of the NWQMS in promoting improved water quality and requires State and Territory governments to support the development of the NWQMS through the adoption of a package of market-based and regulatory measures, including the establishment of appropriate water quality monitoring and catchment management policies and community consultation and awareness.</para><para>The NWQMS has published Guidelines for Sewerage Systems—Effluent Management, and Guidelines for Sewerage Systems—Acceptance of Trade Waste (Industrial Waste). It is also developing Guidelines for Sewerage Systems—Sludge (Biosolids) Management, and Guidelines for Sewerage Systems—Sewerage Systems Overflows. This series of Guidelines will address the quality of discharges into the marine environment through sewerage systems. These Guidelines provide a framework for a nationally consistent approach to the management of sewerage systems, including marine discharges, but are not legally enforceable.</para><para>It is the responsibility of State and Territory governments to implement the NWQMS Guidelines within their respective jurisdiction, for example as a basis for their own guidelines, or as a requirement of licence conditions. The Commonwealth government encourages the use of the Guidelines and notes that the implementation of the NWQMS is one of the COAG Water Reform Framework performance milestones linked to competition policy payments to State and Territory governments.</para><para>With respect to the development of clear, enforceable guidelines it is noted that Schedule 4 of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGAE) defines a guideline as providing "guidance on possible means of meeting desired environmental outcomes". Consequently, the nature of guidelines would suggest that it is inappropriate to make them legally enforceable. However a standard, defined by the IGAE as "a quantifiable characteristic of the environment against which environment quality is assessed" can be made legally enforceable.</para><para>The development of National Environment Protection Measures (NEPMs) by the National Environment Protection Council (NEPC) is a mechanism which allows the Commonwealth to participate in the development of legally enforceable standards for the protection of the environment. The Commonwealth National Environment Protection Council Act (1994), and the corresponding State and Territory acts, enables NEPMs (which may 
 include national environment protection standards, guidelines, goals and protocols) to be made. Measures are implemented by means of laws and other arrangements of the Commonwealth and the participating States and Territories. Thus it is through laws enacted by the participating jurisdictions, and not by means of NEPMs themselves, that national environment protection standards may be given legal force.</para><para>The government notes that the National Environment Protection Council can make NEPMs that relate to ambient marine, estuarine and fresh water quality. A proposal for a NEPM for ambient marine and estuarine water quality is to be considered by the NEPC in the second half of 1998. This will be an opportunity to consider whether a mandatory national environment protection standard for marine and estuarine ambient water quality should be developed, the enforcement of which will mean the quality of discharges into the marine environment will need to be addressed.</para><para>Recommendation 4</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government work with State and/or local authorities, as appropriate to amend the National Environment Protection Council legislation in order to give the Council wider powers to make National Environment Protection measures, and to pass the necessary legislation in each jurisdiction.</inline></para><para>Response</para><para>The government does not believe it would be appropriate to amend the National Environment Protection Council (NEPC) legislation at this stage, particularly given that only one National Environment Protection Measure has been finalised.

It will stimulate coastal and marine planning that combines social, economic and environmental factors. Multiple use management plans, arising out of the program, will be based on partnerships between communities, government, and the private sector. They will take into account and link with existing regional management strategies, including catchment management plans. This Commonwealth government initiative will fund the development of coherent and effective policies by regional and local authorities, whose statutory planning should include clear 
 guidelines and enforceable environmental standards for residential, commercial and industrial development. The key objectives of this program are to minimise the impacts of uncoordinated development in the coastal zone and minimise the impacts of land-based marine pollutants, particularly those arising from ad hoc development, stormwater, and sewage discharges on coastal and marine environments. The Coastal and Marine Planning Program will also contribute to Australia's international coastal and marine environmental obligations, including the implementation of the United Nations Environment Program's Global Program of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based Activities.</para><para>Coastcare is a community-based program that is a cornerstone of the Commonwealth's commitment to working with the coastal community. Coastcare encourages communities to become stewards of their local coastal areas as they are frequently the first to identify problems and often the best placed to identify solutions. The program promotes community and local government partnerships to undertake works principally on public land. The emphasis is on-ground works, including revegetation of dunes and wetlands, control of weeds and feral animals, protection and rehabilitation of coastal habitats and access control.</para><para>The Clean Seas Program assists better water management in coastal areas by supporting projects which have a direct effect on reducing pollution and degradation of the marine environment, particularly projects tackling discharges directly into estuaries or the sea. The program targets on-ground action and reform through promoting innovative management of wastewater and stormwater, including increased reuse and recycling, the development of new Australian technologies, the rehabilitation of polluted areas, the reduction of erosion and sediment discharge in runoff, as well as coastal urban design and development incorporating sustainable water management. Examples of projects that will be supported include innovative side entry pit collectors, stormwater pipe interceptors, constructed wetlands and package stormwater treatment devices for removing pollutants from stormwater, techniques for reducing sewage overflow contamination of stormwater systems or coastal waters from septic tanks and other on-site systems, and projects improving the removal of nutrients from sewage effluent, as well as strategies to increase water reuse and recharge of aquifers.</para><para>The Fisheries Action Program acts to protect fish habitats and ensure that commercial and recreational fishing practices are sustainable. It provides an opportunity for community groups, government and industry to make Australia's fisheries more productive while protecting the surrounding aquatic environment. Community and industry groups will 
 be able to replace depleted fish stocks, compile inventories of fish fauna and habitats, develop local education centres and programs and provide information on endangered species and ecologically sustainable fishing practices.</para><para>The well-being of the coast ultimately lies in the quality of the decisions made by a wide range of coastal managers in government, industry and the community. The Capacity Building Program provides opportunities for coastal and marine education, information exchange through the internet, the development of industry codes of practices and professional development and training. The Australian Coastal Atlas is being developed to provide up-to-date and interactive electronic information on the coastal and marine environments. This information is essential to allow coastal managers to make effective decisions and increase their own environmental awareness by providing information that can be manipulated for their own particular management needs.</para><para>The Coastal Monitoring Program aims to assist coastal managers and the wider community in identifying significant threats to key coastal environments and habitats and, over time, in assessing the effectiveness of policies designed to protect them. A regional monitoring network is being developed with pilot sites established in the Alligator Rivers region and at Jervis Bay. Further sites may be added as suitable locations are identified. A directory of Coastal and Marine Monitoring is being developed on the internet to provide coastal managers with information on what and who is doing monitoring in Australia. The major focus in 1998-99 will be to expand the range of information available in the directory and make it accessible to all internet users. The Coastal Monitoring Program will also fund a range of other projects through both a publicly advertised and Commonwealth component grant process. Indicative priorities for 1998-99 for the publicly advertised grants include seagrass loss, water quality in estuaries and coastal lakes, mangrove and saltmarsh loss in developed areas, eutrophication and coastal reefs.</para><para>The Marine Species Protection Program aids on-ground activities which identify and reduce threats to vulnerable marine mammals, seabirds, turtles and fish species (including sharks). It funds activities which address the adverse environmental impacts of commercial and recreational fishing, control the impact from other commercial and recreational activities, reduce the impact caused by habitat degradation, and address the effects of environmental changes on marine species and habitats from a whole-of-ecosystem perspective. The aim of the program is to ensure that community and industry groups, fisheries managers, marine management and research agencies, and governments work together 
 for the conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources.</para><para>The Introduced Marine Pests Program supports measures that either reduce the likelihood of exotic marine pests being introduced into or spread through Australian waters, or measures that reduce, manage and/or locally eradicate exotic marine pests that have already been introduced. The focus of the program is on evaluating and reducing the impacts on the marine environment of exotic pest species that have breached existing quarantine barriers. The program funds projects on activities such as the systematic detection of, and rapid response to, new exotic pest incursions, impact assessment programs of existing introduced marine pests, removal and eradication techniques for threatening exotic marine species and raising public and industry awareness to help prevent the introduction and spread of harmful exotic marine species.</para><para>The Marine Protected Areas Program supports the development of a National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas (NRSMPA) and sustainable multiple use of the marine environment in addition to declaration work to develop marine protected areas within Commonwealth Waters established under Commonwealth legislation. This program will support relevant State and Territory projects, including scientific research, to determine the basis for protected areas, public awareness and community consultation programs, as well as the development and implementation of strategic projects to help expand the existing system of marine parks and reserves. A bioregional planning framework has been established to help guide the identification of areas for inclusion in the NRSMPA and ensure that it is representative of the full range of Australia's marine environments.</para><para>The Commonwealth, States and the Northern Territory have been working together to develop automated databases—electronic coastal resource atlases—to identify what is most at risk from oil spills and maritime accidents. These atlases provide information on such things as biological resources, environmentally significant and sensitive areas, and ownership of potentially affected sites and infrastructure. The atlases will greatly assist in planning for contaminant spills, installing the most effective protection for our foreshores and deploying the most appropriate control and clean-up equipment for specific marine environments.</para><para>Recommendation 6</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government work with State and/or local authorities, as appropriate to oversee catchment management policies from the perspective of their eventual impact on the marine environment, and to develop strategies to ensure that catchment management committees are genuinely representative of catchment communities. 
</inline></para><para>Response</para><para>The government recognises and supports the adoption of an integrated approach to the conservation and ecologically sustainable management of Australia's land, water and biodiversity. The adoption of an integrated catchment management approach to water resource management is a key guiding principle of both the 1994 COAG Water Reform Framework and the National Landcare Plan. In addition, a key finding of the 1996 State of the Environment Report was the urgent need for integrated management approach for marine environments and catchment areas. The government, in partnership with State and Territory governments, is developing integrated catchment management policies through participation in such bodies as the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and the Lake Eyre Basin Catchment Management Committee. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is engaged in providing integrated management for the particularly sensitive marine environment of the Reef.</para><para>However, the primary responsibility for land and water management lies with the State and Territory governments. In its report to COAG of February 1994, the Working Group on Water Resource Policy noted that in some jurisdictions, integrated catchment management has not been introduced to the extent that it has elsewhere, and that there is a requirement for those jurisdictions where institutional arrangements of this nature have not yet been fully implemented, to consider doing so. (It should be noted that COAG does not include the Norfolk Island government.) Nevertheless, the Commonwealth recognises that it has a role in encouraging State, Territory and Local governments to develop catchment management policies which address potential impacts on the marine environment, (through the Coastal and Marine Planning Program, for instance) and to ensure that their catchment management committees genuinely represent the catchment community, including marine industries likely to be affected by decisions taken by the committee.</para><para>Recommendation 7</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government work with State and/or local authorities, as appropriate to address the issues of acid sulphate soils and their impact on the marine environment including the development of legislation and management strategies to control activities on areas affected and to rehabilitate those areas already disturbed.</inline></para><para>Response</para><para>The National Working Party on Acid Sulfate Soils has been established by the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management (SCARM) to develop a national strategy for the management

The NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST is aimed at stimulating significant improvement and greater integration of biodiversity conservation, land, water and vegetation management on public and private land.</para><para>The Commonwealth's approach to natural resource management through the NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST is to continuously improve the decision making practices of land and water managers. This has involved a number of elements including improving the awareness of managers of problems about the complex relationships involved and the management practices these require, assisting them to access information on the causes of problems, and encouraging them to acquire, as an ongoing process, the skills required to implement ecologically sustainable management practices.</para><para>The NATURAL HERITAGE TRUST's Landcare, Rivercare and <inline font-style="italic">Coasts and Clean Seas</inline>  Programs have been contributing to the improvement of water management for marine and coastal areas by part-funding project activities such as ecologically sustainable and economically viable re-use options for treated effluent and the demonstration of new, low cost or innovative approaches to water management and delivery of water services, as well as strategic and regional management, planning and monitoring.</para><para>Through the Great Barrier Marine Park Authority, the Commonwealth has supported a range of initiatives in partnership with State and Local governments to monitor and reduce the input of land based pollutants which are destroying seagrass beds. These include a flood monitoring program which investigates the impact of catchment management practices on the spatial and temporal dynamics of flood plumes and their entrained 
 contaminant loads to reef waters; an agricultural research and extension program which will document and demonstrate the impact of variable stocking rates of beef cattle in dryland savannah country on reducing soil and nutrient loss from grazing lands; and a long term water quality monitoring program which monitors chlorophyll concentrations at key sites along the length of the Great Barrier Reef to assess long term changes in the nutrient status of reef waters.</para><para>In addition, there is a research program which is developing nutrient and sediment budgets for reef waters from the major catchments draining into Great Barrier Reef waters; a monitoring program which investigates the concentrations of heavy metals and organochlorine compounds in nearshore sediments and seagrasses and in marine mammal populations; and a research program which investigates the impact of increased nutrient on coral reproduction.</para><para>Other initiatives include policy documents written in consultation with the Queensland Department of Environment to provide minimum standards for effluent and wastewaters discharged into World Heritage Area waters.

That said, standards and procedures relating to the control of oil spills are contained in the National Plan to Combat Oil Pollution of the Sea by Oil (NatPlan). NatPlan, administered by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), brings together the resources of the States, Northern Territory, the Commonwealth and industry to respond to oil pollution incidents in the marine environment including incidents caused by fishing vessels and small pleasure craft. Improvements to NatPlan over the last few years have enhanced Australia's preparation for a major spill by addressing review and reassessment of contingency plans, including coastal resource atlases, preparedness of equipment, the identification and appropriate training of personnel and the sourcing of additional personnel, equipment and resources.</para><para>The NatPlan has been regularly reviewed through both internal and external processes, including the High Level National Plan Review (1993), the Australian National Audit Office Performance Audit (1994); the 1995 Report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure; the Iron Baron Review (1995); the recommendations arising from the major exercise George Bass in Victoria (1996); and the Strategic Directions meeting of the National Plan Advisory Committee (1997).</para><para>A review of NatPlan training conducted by both government and industry is currently under way. The effectiveness of the plan is also reviewed automatically following exercises every two years and every major incident. Australia, through the International Maritime Organization, is coordinating many initiatives aimed at the prevention of oil spills. For example, Australia took an active part in the IMO developing draft regulations to improve the safety of new and existing bulk carriers. </para><para>Australia is also a leading proponent of the International Safety Management (ISM) Code which is intended to provide an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention by providing for safe practices in ship operation and a safe working environment; establishing safeguards against all identified risks; and continuously improving the safety management skills of personnel ashore and on-board ships, including preparing for emergencies relating both to safety and environmental protection.</para><para>Australia also seeks to prevent oil spills by promoting greater understanding and awareness of maritime issues within the general community and 
 industry, particularly for small vessels, as they relate to the marine environment. This area is a major focus in the National Marine Education Program and <inline font-style="italic">Coasts and Clean Seas</inline> . In 1997, the National Plan Advisory Committee completed a two year education program. The primary focus of this program was the development of an education resource kit and its circulation to several thousand schools, universities and libraries around Australia. Following a decision by the National Plan Advisory Committee in November 1997, a new three year program has commenced.</para><para>As previously mentioned, under <inline font-style="italic">Coasts and Clean Seas</inline> , the Commonwealth, States and the Northern Territory have been working together to develop automated databases—electronic coastal resource atlases—to identify what is most at risk from oil spills and maritime accidents. These atlases provide information on such things as biological resources, environmentally significant and sensitive areas, and ownership of potentially affected sites and infrastructure. The atlases will greatly assist in planning for contaminant spills, installing the most effective protection for our foreshores and deploying the most appropriate control and clean-up equipment for specific marine environments.</para><para>Recommendation 15</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government work with State and/or local authorities, as appropriate to develop uniform national standards and fee structures for the disposal of ships' waste and to incorporate waste reception fees into general port duties in order to discourage dumping of waste at sea to avoid waste reception fees.</inline></para><para>Response</para><para>Standards for the disposal of ships' wastes in Australia are based upon standards developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). These standards must be consistent with Australian quarantine measures and the requirements of our trading partners, as the majority of vessels using Australian ports operate in the international arena. IMO standards are effected through national, State and Territory legislation. This legislation provides for penalties to be levied if dumping of ships' wastes occurs.</para><para>The Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council's (ANZECC) National Strategy on Maritime Accidents and Pollution (the Seagull Report) is currently being implemented. ANZECC has developed a report providing information on mandatory and recommended approaches to improving waste reception facilities at ports, marinas and boat harbours, contained in the recently completed <inline font-style="italic">Best Practice Guidelines for the Provision of Waste Reception Facilities at Ports, Marinas and Boat Harbours in Australia and New 
 Zealand</inline> . The Guidelines aim to achieve best practice with regard to management of wastes in ports, marinas and boat harbours in Australia and New Zealand and to reduce marine pollution from shipping of all sizes. The Guidelines will be implemented by State and Local governments through licensing and approval processes for ports, boat harbours and marinas, and other measures for ensuring effective environmental management of these facilities. The Commonwealth government is also developing an auditing strategy for waste reception facilities. Under the MARPOL (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) 73/78 Convention, regulations, all vessels of over 400 grt must keep a garbage record book to record all waste disposal from 1 July 1998. These regulations will be implemented by State and Territory governments. The management of marine debris will be improved through a waste recording and audit system for small commercial coastal vessels not covered by current MARPOL regulations. A national monitoring program for marine debris and a community and industry awareness and needs survey is being developed to assist with the education of the community and industry about maritime and shipping issues, including the dumping of waste.</para><para>State and Territory governments are responsible for ports and have been moving to privatise or commercialise their ports and fully recover costs. Incorporating waste disposal costs into general port dues would not be consistent with port users' expectations that charges made by ports be transparent and reflect the nature of the business. Port authorities have responsibility for ensuring adequate waste reception facilities are available, but the provision of such services is usually provided by the waste disposal industry on a competitive commercial basis. Costs of waste disposal vary significantly from port to port depending on the waste disposal facilities available, on the vessel and cargo types handled and many other factors. A uniform national fee structure for ships' waste disposal would lead to cross subsidisation in some ports and would be inconsistent with competitive commercial practices.</para><para>Currently, quarantine requirements for disposal of galley refuse from vessels is by means of incineration, deep burial at marked sites or by heat treatment. In most ports this is undertaken by contractors who are monitored and audited by AQIS. The recent Nairn Report on quarantine, <inline font-style="italic">Australian Quarantine—A Shared Responsibility</inline> , recommended that auditing of this disposal be intensified. As these quality assurance arrangements for vessel waste are cost-recovered by AQIS, any review of waste reception fees and fee structures should take the AQIS requirements into account. 
</para><para>It should be noted that some jurisdictions have recently reclassified quarantine waste to the level of hazardous waste. As a result of this reclassification, there has been a steep rise in the costs of quarantine waste disposal. This issue should also be considered in the fee structure for waste disposal.</para><para>Recommendation 16</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government work with State and/or local authorities, as appropriate to negotiate an agreement on the domestic movement of ballast water and to explore with industry and other stakeholders the potential for legislation to implement the Australian Ballast Water Management Guidelines.</inline></para><para>Response</para><para>The issues of agreement on domestic movement of ballast water and mandatory observation of the Australian Ballast Water Management Guidelines are addressed by the current priorities within the Australian Ballast Water Management Strategy.

The Australian Ballast Water Management Advisory Council (ABWMAC), which includes representatives from each State, the Northern Territory and Commonwealth government agencies, finalised Guidelines for managing the domestic movement of ballast water in November 1996. The Council is administered by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and advises the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on ballast water issues. At its last meeting on 18 November 1997 the Council agreed to trial the Guidelines between three ports (Melbourne, Adelaide, Devonport) to develop nationally consistent procedures for the application of the Guidelines around Australia. The trial is being funded under <inline font-style="italic">Coasts and Clean Seas</inline> . The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy wrote to State and Northern Territory Ministers responsible for ballast water issues on 2 December 1997 seeking their agreement to the introduction of Coastal Guidelines and in reply the States and Northern Territory have agreed. Resourcing the management of Coastal Guidelines is an issue still under consideration.</para><para>In relation to legislation for implementation of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Ballast Water Management Guidelines</inline>  for international shipping visiting an Australian first port of call, initiatives are already underway to secure mandatory regulatory arrangements through the International Maritime Organization (IMO). <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Ballast Water Management Guidelines</inline> for international shipping were introduced in 1990 and are currently implemented on a voluntary basis, in line with a Resolution of the IMO. Legislation for ballast water management is likely following the adoption by the IMO of a mandatory ballast water Annex to MARPOL (the International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships), which is expected in the year 2000. Unilateral action to introduce legislation before this would be inconsistent with Australia's current approach to IMO conventions, and with Australia's stated position in the IMO.

The coordinating role undertaken in the past by the National Seastar Task Force in relation to the marine pest, the Northern Pacific Seastar (<inline font-style="italic">Asterias amurensis</inline> ), has to a large degree been subsumed by the CSIRO Centre for Research on Introduced Marine Pests (CRIMP). Continuation of funding for research on introduced marine pests should therefore relate to other research organisations, including CRIMP. The Introduced Marine Pests Program under <inline font-style="italic">Coasts and Clean Seas</inline>  will be an important source of support over 4 years from 1997-98 for targeted research and management programs to both assess and reduce the impact of harmful exotic species introduced to the Australian marine environment.</para><para>The establishment of an incursion response capability for new outbreaks of introduced marine pests is a priority under the Introduced Marine Pests Program.

Hence, it comprises a standard national approach that takes into account an ecosystem's unique characteristics to derive meaningful ecosystem specific guidelines (for example ambient nutrient concentrations in estuaries). This approach has been able to be progressed furthest for the natural physical and chemical stressors (such as Ph, salinity, turbidity and nutrients) and toxicants listed in the chapter on aquatic ecosystem protection.</para><para>The approach requires a greater understanding of the ecosystems being managed than the previous Guidelines and emphasises the need for efficient and effective monitoring programs that will enable environmental/ecosystem modelling approaches to be developed (including load based models). The Guidelines will therefore focus on managing issues and problems rather than individual water quality parameters, and promote a cooperative management approach involving all stakeholders. As part of this new approach, there is a greater emphasis on the use of biological indicators for the assessment of water quality within the wider context of ecosystem integrity, and environmental quality objectives that must be maintained or attained if the values of the water resource are to be protected. More attention has been given to nutrients and algal blooms in the revised guidelines and sediment quality guidelines have been included for the first time.</para><para>While implementation of these Guidelines is a matter for individual jurisdictions, the Commonwealth government encourages their use and notes

Coordination across all spheres of government, industry, academia and the general user community is progressing through the adoption of distributed Internet technologies as one of the major delivery mechanisms. The Commonwealth has a national leadership role to play in the long term dynamic assessment of the marine and coastal environment through the collection of the primary data, its analysis, the production of useable interpreted products, the provision of advice and the establishment of technical monitoring networks which specifically focus on biological indicators as well as water and sediment quality as indicators of environmental health.

The basic premise of such distributed systems is that the organisations or people who are best able to update and maintain the information are encouraged to do so in their role as primary custodians. The ACA specifically focuses on the coastal realm (200m isobath—100 km inland). It is envisaged that coastal monitoring programs will feed directly into the ACA.</para><para>The National Marine Information System (NatMIS) has helped establish a national network of marine and coastal agencies making their information available via a series of agency marine and coastal World Wide Web sites in a mutually supportive way via the Internet.

ASEAN, as senators would know, is an organisation with great potential to foster economic and political development in the South-East Asian region and it would be of greater benefit to those nations if indeed Australia was part of that organisation. It was my first trip overseas to attend any conference, and I was pleased that it was to attend the Inter-Parliamentary Organisation Conference in Kuala Lumpur.</para></talk.start><para>This meeting was of major benefit to me because of its potential, particularly, for those nations which have suffered in the Asian meltdown—Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and others that are caught up in the recession. It also was of great interest that I was able to meet during the conference with both a group of businessmen from Malaysia and, later, an expanded group of people from the eight or so countries that form ASEAN. Just why Australia should not be a member of the organisation and, say, Burma—or Myanmar— 
should is a question that ought to be directed to some of the senior members of ASEAN. I think that the organisation would be much better served if the economic powerhouse of the region—that is, Australia—was a full member, and I look forward to the day that that happens.</para><para>I also had a valuable meeting with the Indonesian delegation. They have delegated a minister to handle applications for investment in Indonesia and that vast archipelago. Of particular concern—seeing that Australia now spends most of its mining exploration dollars outside of Australia—was the effect that that may have on the mining industry in Australia. I have contacted the umbrella organisations in Australia and alerted them to that fact. I have also exchanged correspondence and telephone calls with the minister in Indonesia responsible for that. It is an indictment of the land tenure in Australia, as it exists at the moment, that exploration dollars are spent outside of the nation.</para><para>I also had meetings with the businessmen of Kuala Lumpur and with others that comprised most of the nations that attended AIPO. I was pleased to be able to reconfirm Australia's commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, particularly in light of the fact that India and Pakistan had recently exploded several nuclear devices within their respective boundaries.</para><para>By entering into a dialogue, and through the free exchange of information and ideas, our region will obviously be richer, but it will only be richer when Australia is able to take up a full and equitable membership of ASEAN. I think for this reason it is essential that Australia reaffirm its involvement and commitment to the region, even if we can only have observer status while we are at the conference. Notwithstanding all that, I think that the important role that forums such as the AIPO conference serve in this endeavour cannot be understated.</para><para>I will finish by making the point of expressing my sincere gratitude to those staff who made it possible, in particular staff at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Parliamentary Liaison Office, the Parlia 
 mentary Library and all our outposts in Kuala Lumpur and Port Moresby.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>884</page.no><name role="metadata">Quirke, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator QUIRKE</name><name.id>ZS6</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I was also a member of this particular delegation that went to the AIPO conference in Kuala Lumpur, and I think a number of issues need to be raised. Firstly, I think it is appropriate to thank those staff members from the Parliamentary Liaison Office who organised the delegation and managed to achieve a number of very difficult tasks, including the organisation of the next leg of the delegation, a bilateral visit to Papua New Guinea which was terminated on the day that the election was called which just happened to be the day that we arrived. No doubt that delegation will take place in the near future—I am not sure what the arrangement will be.</para></talk.start><para>I thank those members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who came down here to brief the various members of the delegation. I thank the High Commissioner and his staff in KL for their assistance to the delegation and for also hosting a very important meeting there with Australian trade and business representatives. I found it particularly useful. It provided me with a great deal of information about what was going on in Malaysia at that time, and it gave me a pretty good insight into the economy of Malaysia.</para><para>I have had a look at this report. The only real deficiency—and I guess I should have picked this out somewhat earlier—is that, if I were an observer reading this report, I would want to know if our representatives actually said anything about East Timor. One of our delegates—I think it might have been Mr Nugent—made the comment to the Indonesian delegates that East Timor was the cancer—I think was the word he used in the meeting we had with them—that was causing all sorts of problems with the relationship between Australia and Indonesia. In fact, I can confirm that our delegates and the Indonesian delegates had a fairly frank and open discussion about the problems associated with East Timor. I made the point myself that we were the only country, I believe, in the world that had recognised the inclusion of East Timor into the Indonesian republic and, as 
 such, we had a special interest in ensuring that, at least where East Timor is concerned, some of the problems which have emerged, particularly the recent movements there, are allowed to continue so that in fact we can see a lasting peace in that part of the world.</para><para>When I look through the report, I do not see a lot of talk of East Timor. That is something which I should have drawn to the attention of staff earlier in the piece because I think it would be wrong for anybody reading this report to come away with the conclusion that we had not addressed East Timor. In fact, we had. I would suggest it was one of the centrepieces of the discussions that we had with the Indonesian delegates—a position, I would say, which they understood quite clearly. They came back to us and made clear that they also harboured a desire for peace in East Timor, a just peace on a basis with which the East Timorese would be happy.</para><para>The rest of the conference came at a very interesting time in Malaysia. The media that week were being hyped up with a whole series of raids and things like that on friends of Anwar Ibrahim. It was not hard to see—and we picked up the intelligence as a group—that Anwar was on the ropes. In fact, quite clearly on the Monday when Anwar, as Deputy Prime Minister, opened the conference he read out a speech which, I presume, was the product of Dr Mahathir, or somebody close to him in that regime. That speech basically blamed the Jews for the problems of Malaysia—and I do not think we should walk away from that; that is exactly the proposition that was put to us—and said that Malaysia's problems were not of its own making, that they were everyone else's fault except their own. Anwar Ibrahim read that speech out quite dutifully. I do not know whether he agreed with it, but that is the nature of that particular regime. I want to make a few comments about that this afternoon because I think the events of the next 10 days leading to the arrest of Anwar Ibrahim were rather interesting.</para><para>Indeed, it was not hard to see why Malaysia had got itself into economic problems. I do not think it had much to do with international money lenders, only that maybe some of them 
 had been the instruments of providing free and loose cash to fund a property development the likes of which I could only see on television. If I were to turn on the Buck Rogers program and see the new Chicago four centuries from now, I would see the sorts of buildings that were being put up in Kuala Lumpur. In fact, commercial real estate in KL would obviously be well beyond the means of First World countries to develop. Quite frankly, in the last 10 to 12 years, KL has become addicted to large amounts of foreign money that has come in and bid up a commercial real estate market in that country which is just unsustainable.</para><para>From where the IPO proceedings were held, you could see some of the most expensive buildings in the world, some of which were unfinished—it would have been nice if they had been finished. The Hyatt Hotel was a clear example of that. The shell of the building was not even complete. On one day, one person would be walking around kicking the tyres on a truck; on another day there would be 200 blokes walking around kicking tyres on however many trucks were there, but not much was happening. It was obvious that it had come to a standstill.</para><para>A great amount of expenditure had been spent in KL in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games, which happened two to three weeks after we were there. A great deal of public infrastructure was built and when you see this I guess you can say that there will be some benefits to the Malaysian community through that infrastructure. But at the end of the day, there was a lot of expenditure on things there which did nothing more than just bid up to an unsustainably high level the price of commercial real estate in that country. I would suggest that a very large part of the problem that Malaysia finds itself in is exactly the same as that in Thailand, that is, there has been a binge on commercial real estate bid up by easy amounts of money that have flowed into that country but have suddenly terminated and, as they terminated, have caused all sorts of readjustment problems and all the rest of it.</para><para>Finally, I want to make a few remarks about the Mahathir regime. I think it has been 
 too long in this country that politicians and political parties have treated this regime with anything more than the most basic or base appeasement. That quite clearly shows through. This is a vicious and brutal regime and the way it is dealing with the former Deputy Prime Minister there, who had outlived his usefulness to Dr Mahathir, is a clear example of what we are dealing with. Australia will only hold its head up in this end of the world, not as my colleague Senator Lightfoot says when we get into ASEAN—I do not know whether or not that is a good idea;  I acknowledge that that was an issue he pushed over in KL—but when we call a spade a spade, sort out a few of these problems and make clear our displeasure at some of the antics of the Mahathir regime, which, make no bones about it, are aimed directly at us and through us to the rest of the Western word.</para><para>Our relationship with the ordinary Malay authorities and the Malay government is pretty good. I met a large number of people over there who were educated in Australian institutions. We had a lot in common. I believe 159,000 Malaysians were educated in Australia and the strength of the relationship at that level shows through. Unfortunately, at the top end it certainly does not.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>885</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title><page.no>885</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report: Government Response</title><page.no>885</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>885</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to move a motion in respect of the second report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That the Senate take note of the document.</para><para>The second report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on contracting out of government services is particularly important for the Senate to take note of, and indeed for the government to take note of, not only because of the growing concern with the detrimental effects of contracting out—we know what some of the good 
 effects are—but because of the recent problems emerging in the New South Wales parliament which are essentially a contest between the executive and the sovereign parliament over the right of the sovereign parliament to demand accountability.</para><para>The Democrats are not alone in this chamber in wishing to enforce appropriate accountability standards in the use by governments of private sector bodies and, in fact, in wishing to know as much about those matters as possible. With regard to that, the committee came up with a large number of very sound recommendations which I hope the government will not only take on board but respond to relatively quickly.</para><para>In general, the committee recommended a phased introduction of contracting out to allow government agencies to draw on their own and others' experience.

I think we are starting to see signs in government of ministers who early on were a bit afraid of criticism and took a fairly brittle line on these matters starting to accept that there are opportunities for progressive improvement.</para><para>Given the amount of public money at stake in the contracting out of services, the efficient and accountable conduct of the same should take clear priority over zeal to contract out as much as possible as quickly as possible. Further, we note that government agencies should seek information on the experience of other government agencies with a view to deciding not merely whether it could be done better but if it should be done at all. That is, substantial attention should be given to the question of whether contracting out is the most desirable option available in the light of the positives and the negatives of other agencies' experiences.</para><para>The committee focused on the tendering process which is absolutely core to proper accountability in contracting out. The committee recognised three objectives of the tendering process. Those were: continuing measurable benefits in value for money obtained on a whole of life basis, benefits in industry 
 development and in support of other specified policy objectives, and satisfaction in the supplier community with the operation of the Commonwealth's procurement system overall. The committee generally supported the use of in-house bids, provided that a successful in-house bidder is subject to the same accountability requirements as other bidders and, indeed, the same opportunities as other bidders.</para><para>The Australian Democrats agreed with the committee's recommendations, as did all other parties. They were unanimous. We advocate standard clauses in government procurement contracts ensuring contractors comply with good Australian government standards and policies regarding, for example, the promotion of Australian business, protecting the Australian environment, advancing the cause of indigenous peoples, affirmative action where appropriate, and general trade, foreign policy and Commonwealth-state priorities. Those provisions should, we believe, be incorporated in a government procurement act establishing and ensuring compliance by government agencies with process standards for the tendering stage.</para><para>In terms of the World Trade Organisation's agreement on government procurement, the Democrats felt that we should advocate Australia becoming a party to the agreement and/or bringing Australian government procurement practices into line with international agreement. But that implementation should be codified via a government procurement act laying out standards and requirements.</para><para>The Finance and Public Administration References Committee also focused on managing contracts. The committee recognised that the success or otherwise of a contract will depend on its efficient and effective management. That may seem an ordinary thing to say but, really, unless there is focus on the enforceability of contracts, the capacity of the Public Service to manage contracts effectively and the need to recognise the importance of process as well as outcomes, then contracting out will be fatally flawed and fatally harmed.</para><para>The Democrats agree that we should advocate standard contract clauses providing for liquidated damages or structured payments 
 linked to performance. Standard clauses tailored to a particular contract should specify certain targets which have to be met by the contractor before the government agency is obliged to make any payment. The Democrats also emphasise the necessity for training the staff of government agencies in contract management, for the recruitment of new, experienced staff, and we believe that there should be adequate funding with government to ensure effective training and/or recruitment.</para><para>In terms of accountability, the committee recommended that portfolio agencies on behalf of the minister should monitor the operations of the outsourced services so that all reasonable parliamentary questions on process or outcomes can be handled. In the early stages of this government's tenure in the last parliament, it was occasionally the case that government ministers were very defensive about their outsourced services without acknowledging that the Senate as a whole has a right—indeed, a duty—to pursue accountability in these matters. The Finance and Public Administration References Committee also recommended the use of probity auditors and/or acquisition councils for contracts over a certain monetary figure so that the process is fully documented and responsibility for the decision is unequivocal.</para><para>The committee emphasised that reporting by government agencies is vital and that current annual reporting requirements may need to be modified to ensure that reporting of contracted out services to ministers provides sufficient information to the parliament as well.</para><para>The committee noted that no provision has been made in the Auditor-General Act 1997 for access to the records of contractors by the Auditor-General, and recommended that standard contract clauses be used to provide audit access to relevant third party information and records. That is a particularly important recommendation because, unless the Auditor-General is actively involved in contracting out agreements, he or she cannot appropriately fulfil the accountability duty that is laid upon him or her by this parliament. The Auditor-General's office is our watchdog in these matters.</para><para>The Finance and Public Administration References Committee recommended that, as an interim measure, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's jurisdiction should be extended to private sector contracts on a case by case basis for sensitive areas of service delivery. The committee asserted that the Freedom of Information Act 1982 should not be weakened in an outsourced environment. Service recipients should be able to access sufficient information to ascertain whether contractors were acting within the terms of their contract in dealing with them, or to obtain evidence of service delivery problems. The committee recommended that there be an amendment to the FOI Act deeming documents in the possession of the contractor, that relate directly to the performance of the contractor's contractual operations, to be in the possession of a government agency and hence FOIable, if that is not too strange a word—able to be accessed under the Freedom of Information regime.</para><para>The committee also recommended that, if parliament insisted on a right to know legitimately commercially confidential information, the most appropriate course to achieve this would be the appointment of an independent arbiter, such as the Auditor-General, to look on its behalf. This means that, where the government is saying material is commercially in confidence, the Auditor-General would at least have access in cases where ministers were able to prove that it was legitimate for them to withhold the material from the Senate. At the moment, there is no such right by the Senate or the Auditor-General.</para><para>The Democrats believe that a government procurement act, such as we outlined earlier, should require government agencies to report to parliament about contracted out services. Current reporting requirements need to be made more onerous to ensure that parliament has the information it requires to satisfy itself that public money has been properly expended. The Democrats recognise that contracting out distances the parliament from oversight of the service to be provided by government. The task of this Senate, in relation to the contracting out of government services, should be to neither oppose nor advocate the practice, but to ensure that each proposal is 
 subject to an adequate accountability regime and is evaluated for its positives and its negatives relative to the particular contract concerned. This will require government agencies to properly justify any decision to contract out a service and govern the fundamental terms upon which contractual relations are entered into. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>888</page.no><id.no>r640</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r639</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE) BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r638</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r603</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1998</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>r602</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>888</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bills received from the House of Representatives.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>888</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together.

What this effectively means is that for the majority of Australians, private health insurance will once again become tax deductible.</para><para>This is one of the simplest, most effective and most important changes that could be made to restore balance in our health system by working to slow the drop-out from private health insurance.</para><para>The proposed cut in the cost of private health insurance will help the private sector, take pressure off public hospitals and help restore much needed balance to our health care system.</para><para>For the last two and a half years, my office has been virtually deluged with letters from people saying they wanted to maintain their private health insurance but couldn't afford to keep it. Particularly from older Australians, the comments I have heard time and time again is we can't afford to have it but we can't afford to be without it.</para><para>We set about tackling this virtual haemorrhaging of the private sector in health by spending about one-twentieth of what we spend in the Commonwealth's annual health budget and about one thirtieth of overall health spending in Australia in the Private Health Insurances Incentives Scheme.</para><para>It was an investment that did achieve some important successes in slowing down the drop out rate for people who have private health insurance</para><para>According to the Australian Health Insurance Association, there are now some 200,000 Australians with private health insurance who would otherwise have dropped out without the help of the Incentives scheme.</para><para>It's certainly better than doing nothing—which is the only solution proposed by the Opposition. If anything, the continued but slower drop out is proof of need for further action.</para><para>Making private health insurance 30 per cent cheaper for the 700,000 or so policy-holders on annual incomes of less than $20,000 is a policy of which I am proud.</para><para>The rebate upholds people's choice and will relieve some of the burden of their financial sacrifice as they pay extra for a doctor of their choosing, a hospital of their choice and an operation when they need it. 
</para><para>The Government's 30 per cent rebate is both entirely reasonable and necessary, when you consider that one third of total health finding one third of total health funding comes from health funds and from individuals.</para><para>More than one in every three operations—and one in four bed-days—are provided in private sector.</para><para>In recent years private hospitals have been shouldering more of the burden as public hospitals—mostly consciously—have treated fewer people who are privately insured. In 1991 27 per cent of privately-insured people were treated in public hospitals; this is now around 15 per cent.</para><para>In some specialties—for example, complex knee surgery—more than half of all operations conducted in any one year are provided in private sector.</para><para>These services are mostly financed by private health insurance funds—that is, by pooled contribution income from almost six million Australians who, despite the significant cost, choose to be privately insured.</para><para>Each year the premiums paid by these people to their health funds, and paid from the funds to hospitals and other providers, makes a larger contribution to our overall health bill in Australia than the Medicare levy funded by almost every Australian taxpayer. Health funds contribute $4.5 billion; the Medicare levy about $3.6 billion.</para><para>Although the public and private sectors are sometimes seen as competing foes, notably on the left of politics, it is important to note that private health funds contribute around $400 million a year into our public hospital budgets.</para><para>People who ignore or disregard this major contribution by the private sector will find that the pressure on the public purse and public hospitals will only increase.</para><para>Supporting private health insurance restores some much needed equilibrium in Australia's health system.</para><para>To do this is to put balance back into the health system and help relieve the greatest source of pressure on the public sector in health.</para><para>Certainly, I believe that high quality health care should be provided to every Australian and am fully committed to Medicare as a universal health care system and to our public hospital system.</para><para>A record $31.34 billion dollars of funding for public hospitals—which represents a 17.6 per cent increase in funding in the next five years compared to the last five years—is a clear sign that the Commonwealth is more than playing its part in supporting the public hospital system. That is a substantially greater increase than what was achieved under the last negotiation by the previous Labor Health Minister, Graham Richardson. 
</para><para>Yet, this additional funding for public hospitals will only be stop gap if nothing further is done to support the viability of the private health sector and to address the reasons for dropout from private health insurance in the first place.</para><para>The truth is we know the principal reason why people are dropping private health cover and that is the overwhelming problem of cost.</para><para>In fact, to fail to do anything to address these crucial issues would be unreasonable—and simply short sighted.</para><para>To do nothing could well spell the end of the private sector and only lead to increasing and intolerable strains on the public sector.</para><para>That's why it would be a serious mistake if this legislation were blocked or delayed.</para><para>It would also be a serious miscalculation to assume that the same amount of money would be spent elsewhere in the public hospital system.</para><para>Australians value a mixed system of public and private health care. The balance has contributed to the high quality system that we have in place today. Australians value choice, and this Government recognises the contribution Australians wish to make to their own health care.</para><para>We don't believe this choice is in any way "contentious", as the Member for Jagajaga wrote some years ago in her National Health Strategy.</para><para>Those views are flawed because they haven't taken into account that, in fact, in the latest health care agreements recently signed, every time health insurance levels drop one percent, the extra cost on the States, at a marginal rate, is estimated to be $83 million. This is what the Commonwealth has undertaken to pay the states for continuing to decline private health Insurance.</para><para>Given that those who argue against this rebate are not proposing to do anything and will simply put private health insurance on the back-burner, we can safely assume that the dropout rate from private health insurance will follow the long term trend of two percent a year.</para><para>So by July 2001, if we do nothing, the Government would have to find exactly $500 million extra to the states each and every year correspondingly just to stay standing still.</para><para>In other brilliant words, in three years time, we will be where we are now—possibly even worse, will have failed to address one of the root causes of the problem.</para><para>This 30 per cent cut in the cost of private health insurance will make a genuine and lasting difference and will preserve the integrity of our health care system, of Medicare and of the public hospitals.  
</para><para>This bill and the accompanying bills—the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998 and the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance) Bill 1998—introduce the private health insurance initiative announced in the Government's tax reform package, <inline font-style="italic">Not a New Tax, a New Tax System.</inline></para><para>The benefit will assist families and individuals with the cost of private health insurance by providing a 30 per cent cut in that cost of premiums from 1 January 1999. It will not be means tested and will cover premiums for all hospital and ancillary cover.</para><para>Those with health cover will be able to collect the benefit in one of three ways—either as a tax rebate, or as a direct payment or as a premium reduction from their health fund. This</para><para>approach provides maximum flexibility for those who pay health insurance premiums and those who are, therefore, able to collect the benefit. They will be able to choose which of the methods best suits their needs.</para><para>This initiative builds on and replaces the existing private health insurance incentives scheme.</para><para>It is a welcome move as is evidence from recent comments of AMA Federal President, Dr David Brand, coming from an organisation that is not always complimentary of the Government.</para><para>It is clear from those comments that the AMA understands that this measure is critical to the future of both public and private health in Australia.</para><para>In a submission to non-government parliamentarians, the AMA has also referred to the strong support from the community for this initiative.</para><para>According to a Morgan Research, that submission quotes, nearly 70 per cent of Australians support the idea of a rebate for private health insurance.</para><para>Another point made in the submission is the claim that there are more than 180,000 jobs directly involved in the private health sector and many more in related services.</para><para>These jobs are at risk if the Labor Party allows private insurance to collapse or if we continue to merely put it on the back-burner.</para><para>The viability of our public hospital system is very seriously threatened by the continuing decline of private cover. At worst, the submission claims, governments would have to provide an additional 25,000 hospital beds in the public system at a current cost of $3 billion a year.</para><para>It is clear that those who understand the health care system, as Dr Brand does, also understand this 30 per cent cut in the cost of private health insurance is critical to the private health sector, and is critical to the future of the public system.</para><para></para><para>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>This bill amends the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1997.</para><para>The amendments provide for the transition arrangements for the move from the existing incentives scheme to the Government's private health insurance benefit. This new benefit is introduced in the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1998 which I have just given in the second reading speech.</para><para>The new arrangements will provide a benefit of 30 per cent of health insurance premiums to all Australians who have private health cover.</para><para>The incentives scheme will be repealed on 1 July 1999.</para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE) BILL 1998</para><para>This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide for a tax offset, otherwise known as a tax rebate, to encourage people to take out or maintain private health insurance.</para><para>The tax offset is complementary to the benefits available under the Private Health Insurance Incentive Bill 1998 which can be obtained either as a direct payment from the Government or a premium reduction.</para><para>ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION BILL 1998</para><para>The Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Bill 1998 will give effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (the Ottawa Convention) and will provide a legislative basis for the Convention's national implementation.</para><para>I take great personal pleasure in introducing a bill which represents an important step towards a goal this Government is committed to: that is, a future world without landmines.</para><para>The scourge of landmines—the senseless, random taking and blighting of innocent lives—is a peculiarly vicious, late twentieth century form of terror which all responsible peoples and governments must strive to end—everywhere and forever. The appalling dimensions of the humanitarian and economic crisis being faced by so many countries, including in Australia's region, require this.</para><para>It was for this reason—because we understood that bold steps were required to address the global landmines problem—that this Government as one of its first acts on assuming office announced its 
 support for a global ban on landmines and—pending the achievement of this—declared an indefinite national moratorium on the use of landmines by the Australian Defence Force—notwithstanding the fact that the ADF has had no association with the indiscriminate or irresponsible use of landmines. This was a significant break with the caveated policies of the past and underlined our absolute determination to end the human suffering caused by a weapon incapable of distinguishing soldier from civilian.</para><para>Since that time, Australia has played a leading role in international efforts to find a comprehensive and lasting solution to the global landmines crisis. Indeed, building international support for an effective, global landmines ban has been—and remains—one of the Government's key arms control objectives.</para><para>It was therefore with considerable pleasure and great pride that I signed the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (the Anti-Personnel Mines Convention) on behalf of Australia when it was opened for signature in Ottawa on 3 December last year. In so doing, Australia joined over 120 other countries—well over half the community of nations—forswearing the use, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines and undertook to destroy its stockpile of anti-personnel mines, consistent with the provisions of the Convention.</para><para>Signing the Ottawa Convention was the quickest, most absolute way for a government to commit itself to this objective, and it was right that Australia, with its strong humanitarian record, took this stand in support of a global landmines ban. For us, the bottom line was that because landmines are so commonplace, so deadly, and have been so widely and insidiously misused over recent decades, the only sane, humane response is to eliminate them.</para><para>I am proud of that decision.</para><para>Of course, the global battle against landmines is not yet over and now is certainly not the time for complacency. The international community must now build on the norm established by the Ottawa Convention. We owe it to the victims of landmines past, present and future to continue working through all possible avenues to ensure that major traditional producers and exporters of landmines which remain outside the Ottawa Convention are brought into the process of finding a lasting, effective solution to the landmines problem. The next step will be to get negotiations underway as soon as possible in the Conference on Disarmament on an agreement to ban transfers of landmines as a way of complementing the Ottawa Treaty and tightening the clamps on the global supply of landmines. Australia is leading the way on this 
 front and we will continue to work hard on this long after the issue has left the media headlines.</para><para>Neither will we lose sight of the ongoing urgent need to do something concrete and compassionate about the millions of landmines which are already in the ground and which continue to claim innocent victims on a daily basis. We will continue to lead the way in assisting countries such as Cambodia to rid themselves of the continuing deadly legacy of landmines, drawing not only on our financial resources but also on the experience and courage of our deminers and the talent and innovative thought which our scientists and our engineers have applied to the technological challenge which these silent killers continue to pose.</para><para>The bill before the House gives life to Australia's obligations under the Convention. Part 2 of the bill makes it an offence to engage in activities prohibited under the Convention and provides appropriately severe penalties of ten years imprisonment for offences committed under clause 8 relating to the Convention prohibitions.</para><para>Part 2 of the bill creates offences relating to placement, possession, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines by Australian citizens or members of the Australian Defence Force or on territory under Australian jurisdiction or control. The offence would be punishable by either imprisonment for 10 years or a fine of $66 000 (or both) for an individual; or a fine of $1 100 000 for a corporation.</para><para>Part 2 of the bill also provides a specific exemption to this obligation, namely for the retention or transfer of a minimum number of anti-personnel mines necessary for the development of, and training in, mine detection, mine clearance, or mine destruction techniques. The bill authorises the Minister for Defence to grant permission to place, possess, produce or acquire, stockpile or move anti-personnel mines for the purposes of the development of, or training in, mine detection, mine clearance, mine destruction or mine deactivation. This is fully consistent with the Convention (Article 3) and would ensure that Australia's skills base in mine detection, mine clearance and mine destruction techniques is not inadvertently compromised.</para><para>Part 3 of the bill deals with the powers of fact-finding missions which may be mandated under the Convention to assess whether Australia is in compliance with provisions of the Convention.</para><para>Part 4 of the bill provides for information gathering necessary to ensure full compliance with the obligations and reporting responsibilities contained in the Convention.</para><para>I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para><para></para><para>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1998</para><para>The bill is being reintroduced with amendments to the bill that was debated and passed by the House of Representatives on 1 December 1997.</para><para>The bill gives effect to a number of important measures previously announced by the Government to protect the integrity of the income tax base, to make some technical changes and to seek to act on the recommendations of the Small Business Deregulation Taskforce to reduce the compliance burdens faced by small business across Australia.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Base Protection and Technical Changes</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Denial of certain capital losses</inline></para><para>Under the existing law, corporate groups may multiply capital losses through manipulation of the capital gains tax provisions.

It repeals the provisions of the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 which require the Commonwealth to retain two thirds of the equity in the company. The bill provides for the transition to full private ownership to occur in stages and incorporates significant social bonus benefits flowing from the next sale of Commonwealth equity.</para><para>This bill is part of a legislative package which will clearly separate regulation of the telecommunications industry from ownership of Telstra. 
</para><para>This bill contains most of the provisions of the Telstra (Transition to Full Public Ownership) Bill 1998 which was introduced into the previous Parliament. However, there are some significant variations which reflect the Government's response to issues raised during public and Parliamentary discussion of the previous bill.</para><para>The bill now provides that Telstra must meet prescribed criteria for service performance for a designated period of at least six months before the Commonwealth can relinquish majority ownership. The evaluation of Telstra's performance in metropolitan, rural and remote areas will be undertaken by an independent inquiry. The inquiry must issue a certificate confirming that Telstra has met the prescribed service standards and provide it to the Minister. The Minister must arrange for the certificate to be published in the Commonwealth Gazette, with the publication date—called the Inquiry Certificate Day—being the trigger mechanism that permits the Commonwealth's sale of the majority of the Commonwealth's equity.</para><para>The Telstra Corporation Act is amended by the bill to require Telstra to ensure that at least 2 of its directors have knowledge of, or experience in, the communications needs of regional areas of Australia.</para><para>Social Bonus</para><para>The Government has included in the bill its election commitments regarding the social bonus from the first tranche of the further sale. The social bonus funding is automatically allocated from the proceeds of the next partial sale when those proceeds reach $671 million, which is the total cost of the social bonus elements. The individual components which are being legislated are as follow.</para><para>The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act 1997 is amended by the bill to increase the Trust's Reserve fund by $250 million. Enhancement of the Natural Heritage Trust's funding base builds further on what is already the largest environment fund in Commonwealth history.</para><para>Up to $70 million is made available over 5 years to establish Rural Transaction Centres in country towns to provide services such as personal banking, postal services, Medicare Easyclaim facilities and telephone and facsimile services.</para><para>Up to $150 million is to be allocated over 3 years for the abolition of Telstra's pastoral call rate and to provide access to untimed local calls in extended zones. The funds will be used to upgrade the telecommunications network in remote Australia.</para><para>An additional $81 million over three years will be provided to the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, which was established from the proceeds of the one third sale of Telstra. $20 million of these additional funds are for enhancing 
 telecommunications in remote and isolated island communities such as the Torres Strait, the Cocos (Keeling) group; Christmas, King, Norfolk, Flinders, Kangaroo and other Islands; and the Australian Antarctic Territories. $36 million is for Internet service delivery in regional and rural Australia, with the aim of providing all Australians with local call access to the Internet. The remaining $25 million will provide 100 per cent continuous mobile phone coverage on key major national highways.</para><para>$120 million is to be allocated over 5 years to establish a Television Fund. The Television Fund will be used to extend SBS Television to transmission areas with more than 10,000 people and to eradicate up to 250 television reception "black spots". $2 million of the Fund will be used to establish a New Media Unit within the SBS.</para><para>These measures will deliver real and lasting benefits to the community.</para><para>Sale Provisions</para><para>The sale provisions of the bill are substantially the same as those which proved effective and robust for the sale of one third of Telstra. The sale process is, however, subject to the Inquiry Certificate Day trigger mechanism before the Commonwealth can relinquish majority ownership.</para><para>Shareholder Oversight</para><para>The bill retains the special provisions which permit the Government to obtain financial and other information from Telstra because of its shareholding, for as long as the Commonwealth holds a majority interest in the company.</para><para>The Ministerial power to direct Telstra in section 9 of the Telstra Corporation Act will be retained until the Commonwealth relinquishes its majority interest. This direction power is inappropriate for a privately owned company. Telstra will be subject to a range of appropriate regulatory powers, including Ministerial direction powers, under other legislation, to protect consumers and competitors. This will complete the proper separation of regulation from ownership of the company.</para><para>Australian Control Assured</para><para>The bill amends the foreign ownership provisions of the Telstra Corporation Act to ensure that the existing 35 per cent total and 5 per cent individual foreign ownership limits continue to apply to the proportion of non-Commonwealth shares following the sale of each tranche. That is, the limits will continue to apply no matter how subsequent share sales are structured.</para><para>The requirement for Telstra's headquarters, Chairman and majority of directors to be Australian will be retained irrespective of the ownership of Telstra. 
</para><para>Transitional Provisions—Telstra Employees</para><para>The accrued rights of Telstra employees under Commonwealth legislation, such as long service leave, maternity leave and certain retirement benefits, are preserved under the bill's transitional provisions when Telstra ceases to be Commonwealth controlled.</para><para>Conclusion</para><para>This bill provides an opportunity for Australians to invest further in Telstra, building on the enthusiasm and interest demonstrated by the public during the one third sale.</para><para>It ensures that service quality is a precondition for relinquishment of Government majority ownership.</para><para>And it guarantees that the social bonus will be delivered, while also enabling further retirement of public debt.</para><para>TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill is the third of five bills which the Government is introducing to improve the operation of the Australian telecommunications industry.</para><para>The focus of this bill is the enhancement of the existing pro-competitive regulatory regime for telecommunications. The bill also makes amendments to ACCC and industry requirements to improve two safeguards for consumers.</para><para>In introducing legislation in relation to the further privatisation of Telstra, the Government is taking the opportunity to enhance the pro-competitive arrangements. The amendments respond to recommendations in the report of the Senate Committee inquiry into the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill and other issues identified through our monitoring of the operation of the regime and consultation with industry and consumers.</para><para>These are sensible enhancements to the competition regime in their own right and are appropriate regardless of the ownership arrangements applying to Telstra.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Main provisions of the Bill</inline></para><para>The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 will enhance competition regulation by enabling the ACCC to codify certain carrier information and consultation requirements; giving a private right of injunctive action for breach of the Part XIB competition rule; enabling the disclosure of specific carrier information, including costs; quarantining specified information acquired from competitors; broadening the ACCC's powers to direct parties to negotiate in good faith; and empowering the ACCC to mediate in access negotiations.   
</para><para>Consistent with the Government's election commitments, the bill contains new provisions requiring the ACCC to provide regular, impartial, public reports on pricing, market share and other competition-related data across a range of specified services. Publicly available data will better inform the market, make competition more transparent and be of clear value in evaluating and promoting the Government's telecommunications reforms and further developing policy. Details of the reporting regime will be set out in Ministerial determinations.</para><para>The bill also improves safeguards for consumers by:</para><para>.	 requiring the ACCC to monitor and report on compliance by Telstra and universal service providers with price controls applying to them under the proposed Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act; and</para><para>.	 requiring the Australian Communications Authority to make a determination about the extent to which carriage service providers must inform consumers about the terms and conditions governing the supply of goods and services under standard forms of agreement.</para><para>The bill contains amendments consequential upon the enactment of the proposed Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act, principally changing references to the Telecommunications Act to references to the proposed new act.</para><para>The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill will make valuable enhancements to the competition and consumer safeguards in telecommunications.</para><para>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (UNIVERSAL SERVICE LEVY) AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>The Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Act 1997 imposes a levy on telecommunications carriers with a view to funding losses incurred by universal service providers in fulfilling the Universal Service Obligation.</para><para>This bill amends the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Act to replace references to several provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1997 with references to the corresponding provisions of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1998 consequential upon the enactment of that act.</para><para>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Legislation package</inline></para><para>In 1997 the Government introduced a new regulatory regime which introduced full and open competition and reinforced and reinvigorated consumer 
 protection arrangements. In general this regime has been working well.</para><para>However, the Government acknowledges that in response to its previously announced intention to move to full privatisation of Telstra there was concern in the community about the possible effect of privatisation on service levels.</para><para>Public ownership of Telstra will not, of itself, ensure reasonable service levels across Australia. However, in view of the concerns, and to strengthen the customer safeguards available, the Government has decided to adopt a staged approach to the further sale of its shares in Telstra. This package of legislation gives effect to that approach.</para><para>The Government is bringing together in this Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Bill 1998, the consumer and service safeguards so that Australians can readily know what protections are available to them.</para><para>The legislation will also strengthen these safeguards where necessary and will provide a Ministerial power of direction over Telstra with regard to compliance with the service standards specified under the legislation.</para><para>In a competitive market Government ownership is not an effective means to influence behaviour. The Government's role is to ensure that it has in place a comprehensive telecommunications regulatory regime which contains safeguards in relation to service to customers and measures to ensure that consumers gain the benefits of an open competitive market. The regime the Government currently has in place provides regulation that is transparent and applies to all industry players, not just the one that is Government-owned. The regime also provides greater certainty to the Australian community that its interests are clearly established in law.</para><para>In summary, the Government does not need to own Telstra to achieve the desired outcomes for society and consumers. In fact, contemporary experience indicates that government pursuit of competitive and consumer benefits can be hindered by ownership responsibilities and obligations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">Major provisions of the Bill</inline></para><para>The legislative package will continue to provide a world class consumer protection framework. The Government recognises that, while competition will, in most cases, provide a good outcome for consumers, there is a need for safety nets to ensure that in all cases consumers have a guarantee of certain basic levels of service.</para><para>I now turn to the major provisions of this bill.</para><para>The Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards Bill 1998 brings together the consumer protection measures that were contained in the Telecommunications Act 1997 to provide greater visibility and clarity. It is essentially a transparency measure drawing together the full 
 range of consumer safeguards in a single bill making it easier for consumers to access information about their rights. It does not diminish the substance of any of these obligations and indeed, some minor amendments and additions are proposed which clarify and enhance certain existing provisions.</para><para>At the core of the community obligations of the telecommunications industry is the universal service obligation (USO). The Government continues to be firmly committed to maintaining a general obligation on the industry to ensure that all people in Australia have reasonable access to the standard telephone service (including customer equipment), payphones, and prescribed additional carriage services on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business—and a supporting obligation to supply those services on request. The universal service provisions in this bill maintain those protections previously provided in the Telecommunications Act 1997.</para><para>The measures currently included in the Telecommunications Act 1997 to be incorporated into this bill are those relating to:</para><para>.	 the universal service regime and the national relay service (including funding provisions);</para><para>.	 the right to continued access to untimed local voice calls for business, charity and residential customers, and the right to untimed data calls for residential and charity customers;</para><para>.	 the Customer Service Guarantee (CSG) which ensures that phone users are compensated for inadequate service;</para><para>.	 protection for residential consumers against failure of service providers to provide services;</para><para>.	 provision of direct access, free of charge, to emergency call services;</para><para>.	 the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman Scheme (TIO) for investigation of service complaints; and</para><para>.	 the price control arrangements on Telstra to ensure that the benefits of competition and technological change are shared by all Australians.</para><para>The bill also includes amendments to some of these provisions to strengthen them. In addition, it includes a new provision giving the Minister the power to direct Telstra in relation to matters contained in this bill.</para><para>An amendment will give the Australian Communications Authority (ACA) the power to direct a telephone company to redress systemic problems in relation to the Customer Service Guarantee. This will enable the ACA to look proactively into systemic problems (eg consistent faults in a certain geographic area) and direct a carriage service provider about the things it should do to ensure those problems do not recur. 
</para><para>The objective of the proposed amendment is to provide a substantial incentive to the carriage service providers to identify and solve recurring problems which have resulted in their not being able to meet the CSG Standards on a regular basis. The threat of a substantial fine, up to $10 million for failure to comply with an ACA direction, will place a significant incentive on the carriage service provider concerned to improve its performance.</para><para>The bill continues the existing obligation that all carriage service providers must enter into the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) scheme. A minor amendment is intended to remove any perceived ambiguity in the Telecommunications Act 1997 and ensure that there is only one TIO scheme.</para><para>In addition to the retention of the price controls currently incorporated in the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 applying to Telstra there are two minor amendments to the price control arrangements. These amendments are the insertion of:</para><para>.	 a provision making it clear that Telstra-specific price cap arrangements and other price control arrangements may relate to charges for untimed local calls in particular areas; and</para><para>.	 a provision making it clear that Telstra must comply with any determination setting out price control arrangements.</para><para>There is also an amendment to the Trade Practices Act 1974 making it explicit that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is responsible for monitoring and reporting each financial year to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on Telstra's compliance with its price control arrangements, and the Universal Service Provider's (USP) compliance with any price controls in relation to the provision of the universal service.</para><para>These amendments will reduce regulatory uncertainty and provide Telstra and any other USPs in the future with appropriate incentives to comply with the price control arrangements.</para><para>The price cap arrangements are currently under review. However, the Government has indicated that price controls will continue.</para><para>This bill contains a new provision which provides that the Minister may direct Telstra to comply with this new consumer act. This will provide a targeted Ministerial power of direction over Telstra that relates specifically to the safeguards in the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Bill 1998. It is a specific power of direction which will address community concerns by targeting the service standards and consumer safeguards which are clearly related to the Minister's regulatory responsibilities and in no way related to ownership. This provision adds to the existing powers of the regulators to seek compli 
 ance and further strengthens the consumer safeguards regime.</para><para>NRS LEVY IMPOSITION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</para><para>The NRS Levy Imposition Act 1998 imposes a levy on participating telecommunications carriers which is used to fund the National Relay Service.</para><para>This bill amends the NRS Levy Imposition Act to replace a reference to a provision of the Telecommunications Act 1997 with a reference to the corresponding provision of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1998 consequential upon the enactment of that act.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Quirke</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ACTS INTERPRETATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>897</page.no><id.no>r632</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>897</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Minchin</inline>) agreed to:</para><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>897</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>897</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table a revised explanatory memorandum and move:</para></talk.start><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> .</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>This bill makes amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to address the implications of a recent decision of the Federal Court in <inline font-style="italic">Foster v Attorney-General </inline> 12 October 1998, which has serious implications for government administration.</para><para>In that case the Court found that section 19 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 does not enable the Attorney-General to authorise the Minister for Justice to exercise statutory powers for and on his behalf. This decision has significant ramifications for other authorisations made under section 19 of the act.</para><para>The result of the case is that section 19 cannot be used to authorise junior portfolio Ministers, or another Minister, to exercise statutory powers vested in the holder of a specific ministerial office. 
 Decisions by portfolio Ministers in relation to statutory powers conferred upon the `Minister' are not affected as section 19A of the Acts Interpretation Act provides that such references are effectively taken to mean all Ministers appointed to administer the relevant department. The decision also means that section 19 cannot be used to authorise Parliamentary Secretaries to exercise statutory ministerial powers.</para><para>The proposed amendments will provide for a Minister to authorise a non-portfolio Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary to act on his or her behalf.</para><para>The Government has taken note of concerns raised that if oral authorisations were permitted the paper trail of government decisions may be difficult to follow. In light of these concerns the bill provides that authorisations given to both Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries must be in writing. This will ensure that it is easier to ascertain the decision maker when seeking to review or challenge an administrative decision.</para><para>The amendments also validate past authorisations that have been made in reliance on section 19 to the extent that they may be invalid. The amendments provide that any purported past authorisation, whether in writing or oral, is taken to have been validly given. This ensures that decisions made in reliance on those authorisations are not subject of further legal challenge.</para><para>The bill also amends section 19A to ensure that all Ministers within a portfolio, where appropriate, can exercise the statutory powers of the portfolio Minister.</para><para>The bill also makes related amendments to section 19BA to ensure that an order can be made by the Governor-General under that section whenever there is any change to the administration of government business and validates past orders made under section 19BA to the extent that they may be invalid.</para><para>In the Foster decision Spender J recognised that both Cabinet and the Prime Minister have traditionally been able to appoint a Minister or member of the Executive Council to exercise a statutory power vested in another Minister for and on behalf of that other Minister. In particular, His Honour noted that Cabinet or the Prime Minister may make an appointment of that kind where the other Minister is unable to exercise the relevant power through illness, absence or more generally. Section 19 of the act is being retained to ensure that Cabinet and the Prime Minister retain the powers of appointment recognised in the Foster decision.</para><para>An appeal has been lodged in the Foster case. However, because of the implications of the decision it is appropriate that urgent legislative action be taken to clarify the position and to validate past authorisations made in reliance of section 19 of the act.

 restore the law to the position that was reasonably thought to have existed prior to the decision in the Foster case.</para><para>The bill will not have a significant financial impact.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Quirke</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>898</page.no><id.no>s177</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>898</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—Order!

My particular concern, firstly, was the amount of information that we put into delegated legislation—the amount of information we leave out of legislation and put into regulations. I note that this is an increasing practice before the Senate. The Democrats do not believe it is necessarily an appropriate practice. We believe that legislation should be considered as a whole. We are debating the complete package, including some essential elements which are to be set aside and put into regulations. I gave an example before question time of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority amendment bills, to name just one legislation package. But I think there are a couple of others, even this morning, Senator Margetts, that we have been made aware of in a committee hearing.</para></talk.start><para>More importantly, it is the consequences of this practice which my colleagues and I find most unsatisfactory. Legislation before the Senate in the form of a bill can be debated and amended. We can seek clarification and, in many instances, resolve and improve the bills. Regulations, on the other hand, are before us for 15 days, and we only have the opportunity to accept or reject the whole package. Where the regulations deal with incidental issues in the executive, this is appropriate. However, when they deal with 
 substantive issues this is not appropriate. We should not be forced to either accept or reject the package—and in many instances our review function is being undermined.</para><para>Having said this, I do not consider this bill a major offender, although I do believe a number of provisions referring are not entirely satisfactory. In the provisions we are now considering, I would like to have known how the maximum probable loss was to be calculated. In clause 46, I would like to have known what sorts of factors the minister was taking into account when issuing exemption certificates for launches, launch facilities and returns. In clause 18, which deals with the grant of space licences covering a particular facility and launch vehicle, I would like to have known what the criteria are in the minister's determination. In both these clauses, those criteria which are left to regulations are central to our review of whether the minister is in fact taking relevant matters into account. For example, will the ministers seek appropriate consultation with relevant industry and community groups? Without a complete package before us, we are not fulfilling our function of review as best we might.</para><para>Finally, I understand some of this insurance information may be considered to be commercial-in-confidence. I do accept this argument in a number of cases. However, where there is  need to be accountable to the parliament, in the remote possibility of an accident and even the even more remote possibility of damage, I think we as a parliament have responsibility to make sure that the insurance coverage is adequate. This is particularly important here, because the consequences of the minister's decision will otherwise be unaccountable until there has been a terrible accident. And we do not consider that good enough.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>899</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Stott Despoja—that is, amendment No. 6. I agree that there is a growing list of legislation, the majority of which is being handled by delegated legislation—that is, there is no real means of parliamentary scrutiny. The Senate has the chance of an all-or-nothing approach. I guess we are 
 well aware of that, having been in a public hearing this morning where the very same thing is happening in relation to the ARPANSA proposed legislation. We have seen it happen in this chamber with child-care legislation. We have seen it happen with the common youth allowance. We have seen it happen with a number of major and important pieces of legislation—that the guts of the legislation is actually coming through by way of unaccountable delegated legislation. That is not a good sign. It means that the government and its departments are gradually looking for ways of hiding from parliamentary scrutiny—and in that sense hiding from public scrutiny. I will be supporting the amendment as moved.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>899</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Industry, Science and Resources</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government cannot accept this amendment. I point out that the bill already covers the question of insurance in two respects. In relation to the granting of a launch permit, the minister can do so only if satisfied that the insurance financial requirements in division 7 will be satisfied for the launch or launcher and any connected return. Clause 29 says that standard launch permit conditions include that `the holder of the permit must satisfy the insurance/financial requirements in division 7 for each launch and each return, conducted under the permit.' This amendment would require the minister at the end of each financial year to cause a report to be prepared setting out details of insurance cover for each launch conducted during that financial year.</para></talk.start><para>What you are really asking is that the detailed insurance contract between the insurance company and the launcher be required to be tabled in the parliament—that is for every instance of a launch in the previous financial year. As far as I can tell, that is an absolutely unprecedented imposition on industry. I do not know of any instance where any other industry in this country is required to have tabled in this parliament what would otherwise be commercial arrangements between an insurance company and a private company. </para><para>I do not see the basis on which such an unprecedented action should be taken or why this industry should be singled out for such extraordinary behaviour. I am not aware that, for example, we require the tabling in this parliament of insurance arrangements entered into by Qantas or Ansett in relation to their coverage of the millions of people they fly around this country every year; therefore, to impose such a requirement in this first attempt by this nation to set up a framework for a commercial space industry seems to me quite unnecessary, quite unreasonable, and unprecedented.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>900</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition opposes this amendment, very much for the reasons that the minister has outlined.

In my time as minister responsible for space activities—you might want to say they were non-existent, but we tried hard—I went to a conference for people interested in space-related activities.

That will actually bring jobs. Not only will it bring the capacity to insure, but also I suspect the skill level will grow in our financial institutions in one form or another to actually be willing to invest in Australian companies that may be wanting to get involved in space-related activities.</para><para>I cannot remember the name of the person or the organisation, but they said the opportunities were considerable.

The penalties that apply in the bill for failure to comply with the instructions of the launch safety officer are quite inadequate for the range of possible adverse affects of failure to comply. They do not actually fill us with confidence that the government is serious about giving the community confidence that it is serious about what it is doing.</para><para>For example, if you have instructions relating to the storage of fuel—and I can think of quite substantial examples that we have seen in the oil industry in Australia, where instructions have to be followed to the letter because they are just so important—the 
 potential for enormous worker safety issues and environmental damage exists out of proportion to the available fine. The instructions relating to access to computer programs on hypothetical accident scenarios, for instance, are that at present the launch safety officer has to ask permission to get access to a launch facility. There is no capacity for the launch safety officer to get a warrant if access is refused.</para><para>The LSO can always call off a launch, but this is a drastic measure, with enormous pressure involved. Imagine the minister giving instructions to proceed when the launch safety officer's only reason for holding up the launch is not having had access to a computer program. If the launch safety officer's direction to the licence holder carries the weight of a substantial penalty, that problem may be averted. So we are hogtying the launch safety officer. We are saying that if the company—that is, the individual—decide they are going to thumb their nose at the instructions of the launch safety officer, the penalty will be $1,100. We have heard a lot from the minister in relation to the money the government hopes to make in relation to launches, but it is not going to help as much if the companies, the individuals, involved can thumb their nose at instructions and be prepared simply to cop the fine at the end, leaving the community with little or no confidence in the process.</para><para>As I say, 100 penalty units equal $1,100. That is a relatively small amount for a corporation to pay for an offence that could have serious consequences. We would like it to be a more serious figure for a more serious offence—that is, $220,000—because it more accurately reflects the sorts of risks involved in a refusal or failure to comply with the instructions of a launch safety officer. Suppose the launch safety officer ordered an additional safety measure to be taken and was ignored and the launch went ahead. The potential for injury and damage to property is enormous. You should not be leaving a community with just the necessity to take civil action; it should be built in.</para><para>Remember, we are dealing with dangerous fuels, mixed payloads, high-technology equipment and stuff that hurtles through the 
 sky at a great speed. We have to create a culture of safety around this industry. The government has to be seen to be serious and not to have a gung-ho approach to making money as fast as it can. Anyone guilty of an offence should be aware that the penalties will fit the offence. That $1,100 is only a rap over the knuckles for people who have put that much money into it and want things to go their way rather than, perhaps, in a safer way. That might be appropriate for minor matters but, where major safety issues are concerned, it needs to be much more realistic.

You are proposing to increase the penalty for failing to comply with the direction of a safety officer from $11,000 to $220,000 for a person, and from $55,000 to $1.1 million for a corporation. That is completely out of proportion. What is prescribed is a criminal not a civil offence—you are guilty of a criminal offence if you fail to comply. Those penalties are at the top end of criminal penalties in Commonwealth legislation. They are way in excess of what is provided for in other legislation relating to public safety.</para></talk.start></continue><para>For example, if you do not assist an authorised officer in relation to the Imported Food Control Act—and that is a pretty serious act—the penalty is $3,000.

 therefore, under either the Crimes Act or something else, we're going to charge you with manslaughter or some other serious offence.'

I am advised that the usual term of a limitations period is six years, so the amendment proposes to insert the period of six years.</para><para>In response to my questions to the minister, I am informed that the 12-month rule reflects the terms of the liability convention.

I will plead guilty to the fact that I am a dedicated supporter of Australia having a space industry, because not only is it in our national interest to have it but it will also provide good jobs and add to the wealth of this country in the long term.

We may philosophically disagree with being involved in space related activities, but I am extremely serious about why Australia should have a space industry and undertake space related activities. I always will be. I have argued for that since I came to this place in 1987 and I will continue to do so.

I think it would be excellent for the government to consider the Californian situation if it could be seen that it is working well there and is leading to an arrangement where, more often than in the Australian circumstance, both parents have a joint and equal role in the upbringing of their children.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>911</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will certainly follow up the suggestion. Although it is perhaps not kindly towards my own profession, I would also suggest that, at least in this country, the administration of the Family Law Act has become so legalistic, so adversarial in many cases—which it was not intended to be—that I think it makes it harder for parents, at a time of emotional turmoil, to come to the best decisions about their children's future. They are not always getting advice which goes to the long-term good of all the parties, and particularly the children. That may be a harsh judgment on my profession, but I fear that it has become very, very far away from what was originally intended by the government of Gough Whitlam.

For those who followed the debate, they would realise that they were the result of a discussion that evolved from the opposition moving amendments to seek to insert fringe benefits as part of assessable income for both custodial and non-custodial parents into the <inline ref="r631">Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998</inline> .</para></talk.start><para>We had some resistance from the government initially on the grounds that they sought to deal with that matter as part of the tax package and did not want it inserted in the child support legislation at this stage. But, following a debate around the chamber, there seemed to be a deal of support for our legislative thrust, which was to include fringe benefits for both custodial and non-custodial parents in their assessable income.</para><para>I am pleased to say that, as a result of that debate being adjourned, the government has gone away and drafted the amendments before us today, which reflect the view that emerged around the chamber. It was our hope that fringe benefits would be included in the assessable income from next year, but the government has maintained that for a range of administrative reasons it would be better that it not occur until 1 July 2000. While I still have some doubts about that issue, the opposition is prepared, in the spirit of compromise 
 and a good public policy outcome, to accept that approach. So we think, and we hope, that the government's amendments accurately reflect the expressed objective of including fringe benefits in the child support legislation for the purposes of defining income. We are pleased to support them.</para><para>I might also say that we are very pleased to see that it might be possible to choose which aspects of the tax package we wish to support and which aspects we cannot. We hope this is a precedent for when we deal with the tax package later on, because the opposition will wish to support some aspects of it and to oppose other aspects—the GST being the primary one. We are pleased with and we appreciate the minister's efforts to better draft the amendments that reflect the legislative intent we are seeking and we will be supporting those amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>913</page.no><name role="metadata">Newman, Sen Jocelyn</name><name role="display">Senator NEWMAN</name><name.id>BE4</name.id><electorate>TAS</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Family and Community Services; Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I presume then from the senator's words that we shall expect to see the opposition supporting the GST on the grounds that it is going to the premiers, all of whom are very keen to receive their money under the GST.

Investment over the last 30 years appears to be bearing fruit in a number of states. Growth is apparent in New South Wales, as evidenced by Fox Studios investment and the location of 
 major work into that state. I am advised that studios recently built and expanded in New South Wales are booked out until the year 2002. There has been ongoing investment in Queensland in major films with large budgets using the many facilities also built in recent times in that state.</para><para>A number of Australian films are having both critical and commercial success in offshore markets, to mention but a few topical films of recent days: <inline font-style="italic">LA Confidential</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Shine</inline>, and <inline font-style="italic">Babe</inline>. More importantly for our own purposes, a lot of the higher value work is being sourced these days in Australia: technicians, animators, trades persons, computer operators, graphic and design people, script writers, directors and producers. These are all pleasing developments. When one looks at the bare statistics, they show a similar story or confirm the anecdotal reports from industry and press reports. The ABS shows audiovisual production worth $1.3 billion in the last financial year. Employment figures show over 40,000 persons are employed in the industry.</para><para>Films and allied entertainment are industries of the future, based on intellectual property and creativity, requiring education, training and the ongoing development of skills, industries that are developing, which we welcome, and offer long-term and rewarding career prospects to those persons who choose to enter the relevant areas. The government's attitude in recent times has been, not to appear too churlish, somewhat disappointing. In light of the above growth and success, it is difficult to understand the government's actions in recent years. Last year's budget reduced government assistance from $97 million to $70 million. A 30 per cent cut in the outyear forecasts shows no improvement. There have been massive cuts in government support for the ABC, a critical institution for innovation, creativity and training in Australia. It has always been an important source of film and TV production and the capacity to continue that incubator role is restricted by more recent budget cuts.</para><para>When this bill was being discussed in the lower house, the ALP mentioned a number of reservations. In particular, the member for Denison expressed reservations. Basically, he 
 criticised the government for withdrawing a substantial amount of support for the film industry in recent years. Mr Kerr went on to make a number of points. Firstly, he sought an ongoing commitment to the Film Finance Corporation which, forward estimates show, is not funded past the current triennium. We repeat our support on the basis that it is a trial supplement to current funding arrangements which should remain undisturbed. We will ask the minister to formally respond to that issue in due course.</para><para>Secondly, Mr Kerr entered a caveat concerning the Senate's report. The Senate report has been down for some days now and fundamentally addresses three issues: the adequacy of the level of the proposed tax deduction, whether the capital gains tax provisions could act as a disincentive to investment and whether the scheme would be effective in attracting more investment in Australian films.</para><para>Turning to the adequacy of the level of the proposed tax deduction, most submissions to the Senate inquiry made the following points. The Gonski recommendation was for a tax deduction of 120 per cent and anything less than that was not adequate because of the high risk nature of this industry. Doubts were expressed about investment being attracted if the figure was set at no more than 100 per cent. In this context, the submission was repeated on a number of occasions that the changes being introduced by this bill were not an improvement in that context.</para><para>In respect of the capital gains tax, most submissions argued that a zero cost base of 100 per cent of sale price of shares which would be subject to CGT would also be a disincentive to investors. Many industries, one should note in passing, make the same point. In the recent industry policy inquiry conducted by the Senate Economics References Committee, many investors made the point that the capital gains tax regime in Australia appeared to inhibit investment and needed review.</para><para>The Senate report addressed whether the scheme would be effective in attracting more investment. Submissions argued that the cap of $20 million tax concession per year limited the potential for the film industry to expand. 
 FACTS argued against clause 25 of the bill which prevents FLIC from investing in a film developed or produced by commercial broadcasters. Both these objections were discussed by the Senate committee at pages 5 and 6.</para><para>I have two minor points to make in concluding. The first point I wish to address concerns clause 3.33—extending the end date of the scheme from 30 June 2002 to 30 June 2003. It is not necessarily a bad thing, and it is probably caused by delay in the passage of the bill occasioned by the recent election. This, however, should not necessarily extend the time before the scheme can be reviewed. It would be beneficial to all parties, particularly industry participants and investors, to understand the progress of the trial scheme and any potential problems or abuses foreseen or unforeseen. So we would commend to the government an earlier assessment of the scheme at 30 June 2002.</para><para>The second point I wish to address is that when the bill was first introduced in May 1998 it was thought necessary to allow up to two years to raise the total amount of concession or capital. Apparently, that is not the case now. To significantly reduce the time in which capital may be raised could have two consequences. Firstly, the failure to raise a target amount could save the government some tax concessions and moneys otherwise allocated. Secondly, there could be a rush by investors to throw money at projects without proper consideration. Either development would be unwelcome and would  defeat the purpose of the bill and the government's stated intention. If the pilot scheme opportunity to trial is based upon a more diverse set of investors, a higher level of investment and a broader base of private investment in this film industry, narrow time lines should not get in the way of its eventual success.</para><para>In summary, in the lower house the opposition did not oppose the legislation. We cooperated with the Senate inquiry process and, now that the Senate report is delivered, we voice no objection of any great substance, subject to my earlier comments about dates and time lines. The opposition will watch the progress of this trial scheme with interest and look forward to the review documents in due 
 course. As this industry appears to be developing well, we support this scheme as a vehicle to raise additional finance, to develop new projects and to expand the horizon of this influential industry in Australia. The opposition does not oppose passage of this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>916</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats welcome the FLIC Scheme, albeit with some reservations. There are, I think, many unanswered questions about how it will operate. It is, I am told, without precedent. The <inline ref="r622">Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 1998 </inline> falls well short of the recommendations of the Gonski report, and I think that raises concerns about the scheme's viability.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats are committed to the idea of numerous doors to funding, and we concur with the organisations which made submissions to the committee on this issue. FLIC should not replace either direct funding through the Film Corporation or 10BA. Twenty-seven million dollars has been cut from the industry over the last three years and our industry would, I think, be in dire trouble if this occurred. The last thing we need is an industry which is even more beholden than it currently is to the bean counters.</para><para>We are particularly concerned that the number of licences to be awarded is not stipulated in the legislation. We are extremely wary of one player dominating the scheme. Cultural diversity and risk taking are never served by a monopoly. We also believe that putting all our eggs in one basket will give a distorted picture of the success or lack thereof of the scheme. The Democrats will urge the minister to allocate more than one FLIC should there be a number of companies each demonstrating an ability to fulfil the criteria. We are aware that the viability of the scheme is reduced as the number of licences increases. The $40 million cap has been a major impediment to what we would see as a primary aim of ensuring diversity.</para><para>Industry groups are worried about a vertically integrated company or companies dominating the process to the point that independent and emerging film makers are locked out. So FLIC, as the legislation cur 
 rently stands, looks like an improbable vehicle if we have that goal of diversity in mind.</para><para>The exclusion of projects developed or produced by the television networks is, the Democrats think, a good start. However, this does not mean that independents and new film makers will get a look-in. At present, we do not see how the government intends to address this issue, and we eagerly await raising this during the committee stage. As usual, the government has hidden in regulations the most important information about what it intends to do.</para><para>If this means we see the same old actors and the same old formulas, then I think it will have failed. We need to see more films like <inline font-style="italic">Shine</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Head On</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Priscilla</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Boys</inline>—films that buck the complacent myths about ourselves as Australians.</para><para>As I said, we support the bill, but with some reservations, and we will seek to amend it during the committee stage.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>916</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The <inline ref="r622">Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 1998</inline> , together with the <inline ref="r629">Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Licensed Investment Company) Bill 1998</inline> , essentially provide a trial mechanism to encourage investment in the Australian film industry by providing tax deductions as an incentive. The bills authorise the minister to approve film licence investment companies that will be able to offer tax deductions for investors who acquire shares in film licence investment companies or FLIC. The scheme is to run for two years until 30 June 2000. This initiative sprang from the Gonski report that reviewed funding to the film industry and which was released in January 1997.</para></talk.start><para>I guess we can only wonder what would happen if we did sign up to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. Maybe it would mean that the same tax deduction cannot distinguish between Australian films and films made overseas.</para><para>The Greens position is to support the general thrust of the initiative. As the Gonski report recognised, there are significant benefits that can be gained. They include: administrative simplicity; providing a foundation for 
 funding by moving away from project-oriented funding; certainty as to the amount of loss of revenue; the amalgamation of film production experts and experts in risk capital management; and transparency in monitoring outcomes and abuse minimisation.</para><para>The Greens are supportive of trialling creative initiatives to provide additional financial support to this vibrant industry. Film and television have become an integral part of Australian life at the end of this century. As the Gonski report noted, film and television are probably the most accessible of all cultural activities for all types of people in all parts of the world.</para><para>The film industry makes a significant economic contribution to the economy of around $1.2 billion a year, as well as employing around 40,000 people. But all Australians are winners when the film industry is on a high. Making films in Australia is not just an excellent way of showcasing the country to the world; it has a vast array of spin off benefits for our film industry, our tourism industry and for all Australians. Home-grown films make a huge contribution to expressing Australia's diverse cultural identity and engendering debate around cultural issues and current issues. It is an accessible medium for exploring diversity and promoting a more imaginative, inquiring and thoughtful society. Aussie films carry these diverse messages both domestically and internationally, and often provide springboards for young aspiring actors to break into the international scene. And, of course, there is a sense of pride generated when our films and actors win international awards.</para><para>Let us look at the elements of the Greens (WA) position on this bill. First, we are supportive of trialling initiatives. We note that the government has taken on board concerns expressed in the industry, and fashioned this initiative as a trial running parallel with current tax concessions provided for in divisions 1OBA and lOB of part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This is a positive measure that will ensure this initiative achieves desired outcomes without undercutting current funding processes</para><para>Secondly, the Greens (WA) are supportive of additional funding support for the film industry. We do not support a shift in funding responsibility from the public to the private purse. We recognise that there is significant scope for private funding in this industry. However, it is crucial to be mindful of the importance of retaining a mix of both public and private funding sources for the purposes of diversity.</para><para>The Gonski review made this point very clearly. Gonski was unambiguously in favour of continuing direct government assistance to provide a solid production slate and to counteract the capricious nature of the industry. The Gonski report stated:</para><para>The Review believes that the Commonwealth assistance has been critical to the building and development of the industry to this current level of expertise and quality.</para><para>The Gonski review quite clearly did not advocate replacement of direct government funding with indirect assistance available through tax concessions. In fact, the Gonski report quite specifically advocated direct funding to continue to be the principal mechanism for funding. One of the Gonski recommendations was:</para><para>that the Government recognise that to achieve its cultural objectives within a commercially driven Australian film and television industry, there will be a continuing need for Government assistance and non-commercial rates of return.</para><para>This view has been echoed in the submissions by Southern Star Entertainment to the Senate standing committee on environment, recreation and the arts.</para><para>The Greens (WA) have some significant concerns about the government's long-term intentions for public funding in this industry. The record of the last term in government shows that the coalitions commitment to properly funding the film industry is questionable. It is consistent with the governments short-term slash and burn budgetary behaviour that they have withdrawn substantial support from the Australian film industry.</para><para>The government provides substantial assistance to the industry through the Australian Film Finance Corporation Limited. The FFC has made a substantial contribution to the 
 industry. Although it has not had a 100 per cent success rate, it has invested in many successful productions. The government has not shown a very serious commitment to the continuing success of this dynamic industry. Since coming to office, the coalition has made budget cuts of $27 million. Funding has gone from $97 million to just $70 million. That is a huge chunk of funding that the government has retracted from the industry—nearly 30 per cent. And that is only the money directly allocated to the film industry.</para><para>Of course, there have also been enormous cuts to the ABC. The ABC has proved to be a creative birthplace for innovative and informative film and television production. However, their ability to continue the volume and quality has been seriously undermined by the government pulling on the purse strings.</para><para>In light of these slashes in funding, the Greens (WA) share the concerns of the Australian Writers Guild that this initiative may give the impression that large additional benefits have been bestowed on the film industry. Clearly this is not the case. The estimated cost of this trial is around $20 million, which does not even replace the money ripped directly out of the film budget.</para><para>While the Greens (WA) will be supporting this bill, there have been a number of concerns expressed by the industry and I would like to put them on the record. The first concern relates to the adequacy of the measure. Amongst others, the Screen Producers Association, the Australian Writers Guild, the New South Wales Film and Television Office, Southern Star Entertainment and the Australian Screen Directors Association have questioned whether the FLIC proposal is sufficiently attractive to be a viable basis for private funding. There is concern the initiative falls too far short of the original Gonski proposal that gave allowances and consideration for the inherently risky and volatile nature of the investment in the film industry.</para><para>Firstly, the 100 per cent tax concession falls short of the suggested l20 per cent in the Gonksi report. The Gonski report specifically envisaged that the deduction would be over 100 per cent to provide appropriate incentives; and secondly, the capital gains tax 
 treatment of the resale of shares is significantly more harsh than that recommended by Mr Gonski. He recommended that there be an adjustment on capital gains so that the gains are not taxed from the first dollar.</para><para>There are also important concerns expressed that the measure would not be of benefit to film-makers outside Sydney and Melbourne and, in particular, small independent film-makers. The aim is that FLIC would benefit investors by enabling investors to invest in a FLIC and minimise their risks, as they would be spread over a number of projects rather than a single investment.</para><para>However, this enables the FLIC to control the investment in films, and there is an anxiety that they would favour the large established film makers in Sydney and Melbourne who have an advantage in attracting investors—they are obviously making a number of films all together.</para><para>Government or targeted funding is even more important in South Australia, Queensland and my own state of Western Australia, because the bulk of production is centralised in Victoria and New South Wales. More funding in these other areas would give a lot more film makers opportunities they would not normally get unless they are moved to Sydney or Melbourne. Good films do come out of these areas. <inline font-style="italic">Shine</inline> is an obvious example—its production was based in Adelaide.</para><para>So the possible reduction in diversity is a huge concern, and I hope this is one which the government has a clear eye on when the two-year trial is up for evaluation. Certainly, the Greens will keep an eye on the government budgetary allocation, along with the other valid concerns expressed by the industry, to ensure that this initiative is not a mere smokescreen to reduce further public spending for the film industry in the future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>918</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank all honourable senators who have contributed to this debate.

In relation to section 22 where the Democrats have proposed an amendment on sheet 1182—and I am sure the opposition and the Democrats would like this clarification—in the provision I am referring to, section 22 headed `Conditions in a disallowable instrument', it is quite clear in (1) that:</para></talk.start><para>The Minister may determine in writing conditions that are to apply to all FLICS under the scheme.</para><para>Then there is a note saying:</para><para>A determination is a disallowable instrument.</para><para>It then refers you to section 43. Part (2) gives the minister power to make a revocation or a variation to these conditions. I think that the Democrat amendment seeks to ensure that action by the minister under part (2) of 22 is also a disallowable instrument. My advice is—and I assure the Senate—that action by the minister under part (2), a revocation or a variation, needs to be done by way of a determination and is therefore a disallowable instrument. I know that might put the Labor Party's minds at rest, and I would certainly hope it might put the Democrats' minds at rest.</para><para>Since we had discussions with your adviser, Senator Bishop, we have had a look at parts (2) and (3) of the Democrats' amendment, 
 and I think that they were probably drawn up on the basis of the explanation I have just made and are probably unnecessary as well. They are certainly—to anticipate a question I will probably get—in conflict with the Acts Interpretation Act.</para><para>They are also contradictory in some parts. For example, under one provision a determination would not have effect until the day after tabling of the determination, but part (6) at the bottom of the second page of the circulated amendments would say that `a determination takes effect immediately following the last day on which a resolution disallowing the determination could have been passed.' So there is actually a quite clear conflict there. The government wants to ensure that these determinations, revocations and variations are disallowable. We believe that the bill as currently drafted achieves that. We commend the bill in its current form without amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>919</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am happy to take that advice.

In January the scheme would be advertised nationally, calling for formal applications. In March 1999 the selection advisory panel would consider applications and make recommendations to the minister, and the minister would then announce the successful FLIC. Capital raising, which I think goes to the nub of your question, Senator Allison, would not commence until April 1999. In fact, as we all know from our discussions last week, the parliament will be sitting from 19 April 1999. In 1999-2000 investment in film and television projects will commence. On 30 June the capital raising period ends. It then goes on into the new millennium.

On 20 March last year, 1997, with great fanfare, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, announced a range of what he called significant changes that government would make to refugee and immigration decision making and the review systems. Here we are tonight, some 18 months later, dealing with what was then described as urgent legislation. </para></talk.start><para>With the fanfare that accompanied the minister's legislation at the time, an uninformed person in the community would have thought that the wheels of government were standing still in order for this legislation to pass. Of course, they did not. The legislation 
 was hastily prepared and the government itself had to make some very significant changes to its own legislation. The bill, introduced as No. 4 of 1997, contained a privative clause that we, the Labor Party, in opposition bitterly opposed and will continue to oppose. The minister, in his wisdom—one has to commend him for this—accepted that that opposition was in existence and agreed to remove that particular clause from No. 4 bill and put it in a separate bill, No. 5, so that No. 4 bill could proceed.</para><para>No. 4 bill, dealing with the amalgamation of the various review tribunals, the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Migration Internal Review Office, was referred by the Senate Standing Committee on the Selection of Bills on 4 September 1997 to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 20 October 1997. A very short reporting period was given to the committee to conduct its inquiry, but the committee did proceed with its inquiry and held hearings in Melbourne on 16 September 1997 and on 9 October 1997. The committee also received some 20 submissions from organisations and members of the community.</para><para>The majority of the committee put in a report on the bill with conclusions that the bill essentially should be passed in its current form. I may be misrepresenting the committee slightly. They did have some conclusions, but the recommendation that the majority of the committee put forward was that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) be passed without amendments. Earlier in the report there was also a recommendation about bill No. 4. It was exactly the same recommendation on bill No. 4 that I have just read out dealing with bill No. 5.</para><para>The bill did not pass. The legislation actually sat on the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> all through the first half of this year. It was in the government's control to press the bill forward should it choose to do so, but the government chose not to do so. Part of the reason that the government chose not to proceed with its own bill was the minority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, a minority report that was put in by 
 Senator Bolkus and me on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and Senator Andrew Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats.</para><para>May I take the opportunity to praise the processes of the Senate committee system. We are witnessing here, as we debate this bill, the merits of such a committee system. Despite the very short period of time that the committee had to scrutinise the bill and take evidence from the community, from the public, the minority of the committee did come up with very reasoned and very considered recommendations. I am very pleased to report that the government has taken these into account. It has taken them into account in the new bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998, that is before the chamber tonight. That is a classic example of how a committee can contribute to good legislation in this country. It is a credit to the minister and to the department that that should happen. Indeed, some credit has to be given on this side of the parliament as well, that we in turn put in the effort in a very considered way to arrive where we are today. I am dealing with bill No. 4 and not what was bill No. 5.</para><para>The changes that are proposed in the merging of MIRO with the Immigration Review Tribunal were not something that we in the opposition, in the Labor Party, supported, but we did recognise that the government had a brief for this particular merger. We are not convinced at this time that merging them into the Migration Review Tribunal will better serve the community than the current system does. There are some problems, admittedly, with the current system as MIRO stands and as it moves on to the Immigration Review Tribunal, but they are not insurmountable. But I do not want to go back and revisit that debate and the informal dialogue that took place between the parties on this matter. It is the will of the government that the merger take place and the MRT be established, and we will now go along with that, but we will be watching its progress very carefully as it pans through.</para><para>The new structure, the new system, might serve the minister's ideals, though we have 
 some doubts that it will meet all of the ideals. But the more important question that one has to ask oneself in this matter is: will it serve the community interest? That is what we will be particularly watching as the new system comes into play.</para><para>I put on the record the gratitude of those on this side of the Senate to the minister for the fruitful negotiations that have led to a more reasoned starting time for the new tribunal. There are persons currently holding office on the present Immigration Review Tribunal who, if the new tribunal had been set up in the time frame that the minister first announced last year, would have found themselves in some difficult circumstances because the life plan they had knocked out for themselves had taken into account their appointment period. That could have been thrown into some jeopardy. With the flexibility in the start-up time of this Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) that problem will be alleviated in the main for those members, most of whom have given long and very dedicated service to the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Migration Internal Review Office. It is less of a problem for the officers of the MIRO than it is for the officers of the Immigration Review Tribunal.</para><para>We still have some concerns about where the offices of the new MRT will be located. During the committee hearings the difficulties for somebody living in Perth, for example, on the other side of the continent, were stressed. The concern was over how available the tribunal would be to them were they wishing to have a personal hearing in front of the tribunal. There is a fear, and it is probably going to be confirmed during the committee stage of this bill, that the IRT office in Perth will not be continued under the new regime of the MRT. And that is probably the case with some of the other MRT offices—if those decisions have yet been made. They had not been made at the time the department appeared before the committee at its first hearing in Melbourne last year. One would hope that those decisions have now been made and the community can be informed.</para><para>We are aware that it is not always necessary to have a tribunal member placed in the 
 capital cities. As travel has become more accessible and widespread and even cheaper there is a flexibility for tribunal members, as is the case with the Refugee Review Tribunal, which has offices only in Sydney and Melbourne. They quite frequently travel to Perth and further afield—even as far as Port Headland from time to time—to hold their hearings. So we do understand that a certain degree of flexibility is available.</para><para>In the minority report, we expressed some concerns about the matter of videoconferencing. I am pleased to see that the minister has read that minority report. In a number of speeches he has given since the report was delivered he has made reference to the fact that we are seen to be in opposition to video conferencing. It is something that is much more widespread than it used to be. We still have some concerns about video conferencing. There will be cases before the tribunal where it will not be appropriate for a whole host of reasons, be they cultural or the personality of the individual. With a camera put in front of them, a person may not necessarily be able to respond during a video conference. One would hope that the department and the tribunal, when this matter is put to them, will treat it with a great deal of caution and will make decisions that will be to the ease of the applicant who is appearing before the tribunal.</para><para>Although the IRT in its present form tries to be as user-friendly as possible—and I commend the tribunal members for that effort—there is, nevertheless, and has to be, a certain degree of formality about tribunal proceedings. That can be and is daunting to many of the applicants before it. However, individuals are as relaxed as they can be when they appear before the tribunal. But it is not going to be so easy to bring about that relaxation while a television camera is pointed at them and their voice is being recorded. So whilst we do not have an outright objection to the use of videoconferencing in these matters, we do have some concerns that it should be taken into account.</para><para>I have been very guarded in my comments tonight on this particular bill, after the events of last week. I digress very briefly from the bill. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will 
 recall that, together with my colleagues Senator Schacht and the previous speaker, Senator Cooney, I made impassioned pleas that a visa ought to be granted to Mr Gerry Adams MP so he could visit Australia. My speech was made on the Wednesday afternoon and within 48 hours the minister, Mr Ruddock, granted that visa. I do not want to take all the credit for that. I would like to give some of the credit to Senator Patterson, who was sitting in the minister's chair when other senators and I made the plea.</para><para>In her response in the second reading debate she said that she would make representations to the minister. So we have to give Senator Patterson some credit for bringing this matter to a very speedy and sensible conclusion. I am grateful. I am also grateful to the minister himself. He was the one who signed the visa. For that reason we are all grateful. It is a good decision and I do not have a problem, standing here in opposition, commending good decisions when they are made. It is not the first time—I am not breaking the ice in doing this—and hopefully it will not be the last time. This may be in one particular portfolio area. I do not see it happening in other portfolio areas. Certainly with some of the speeches that I am currently preparing I cannot see it happening. But that is a digression from the particular bill before us at the moment.</para><para>I now return to it and conclude with comments about credit being given to the scrutiny that bills are subjected to by the Senate committee system. Again we see in this particular set of legislation the merits of such a scrutiny. One of the drawbacks in this instance was that the committee had a very short reporting date, an unrealistic reporting date, with something like six weeks from the initial reference to reporting back. With the passage of time and the benefit of hindsight, it seems the committee could have been allowed a lot more time to undertake its inquiry and perhaps even taken evidence in parts of Australia other than Sydney and Melbourne. That might have helped the process even more than the short, sharp inquiry that the bill was subjected to.</para><para>The second creditable thing is the fact that a report and a minority report were submitted to the parliament, because the minority report has proved to be of value. It has only been of value to the government because the government, in turn, has studied the content of the minority report, seen sense, and taken account of the objections raised by the minority when drafting and preparing the new bill that is before us tonight. With those words I commend the processes that I have spoken about. I again express my gratitude to my colleagues, Senator Patterson and the minister, for the very good decision to grant a visa to Mr Gerry Adams.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>925</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>QLD</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Senate is addressing the <inline ref="s183">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998</inline>  which follows through on the government's decision of early 1997 to merge the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Migration Internal Review Office, within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, to form a new tribunal. This legislation is, as Senator McKiernan said, a slightly improved version of what was known as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) from the previous parliament. It is probably worth noting, from my perspective, that that bill has actually been around in this chamber longer than I have. That gives some indication of how long it has languished.</para></talk.start><para>A Senate committee reported on the bill on 20 October last year, a few days before my entry into this chamber. It is probably worth mentioning the frequent problem that Senate legislation committees have with the very tight time frames that they have to operate within. If we are having to rush through inquiries into legislation and then those bills hang around for 12 months or more, that does make one wonder whether or not it might be appropriate to enable the Senate committees to have a little bit more time to look into legislation. This is particularly so, given that this case is an example where some of the suggestions from the minority report and some of the evidence that came forth during the course of the inquiry have been taken on board by the government and have produced improved legislation, which—as Senator 
 McKiernan quite rightly said—is one of the major benefits of the Senate performing its role as a mechanism for parliamentary scrutiny of legislation proposed by the government.</para><para>The Democrats recognise the improvements made to this bill compared with the original version. The concerns that we had with the original, the then No. 4 amendment bill, were outlined in the minority report from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which was done by my colleague Senator Andrew Murray on behalf of the Democrats. One of the concerns which we highlighted in that minority report is an ongoing issue. It does not impact one way or the other, in a sense, on the content of this bill but it impacts on the implementation of, and the operation of, the new tribunal in the same way as it is a concern in relation to existing tribunals and courts.</para><para>I refer to the ongoing attacks and expressions of concern by the government and the minister, which can certainly be perceived as trying to influence the independence of these tribunals. There was another piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> today, by Fiona Carruthers and Bernard Lane, reporting an attack by the immigration minister on judges for `allowing their personal views to interfere with legal decisions on migration matters'. I know that similar concerns and annoyance have been expressed by the immigration minister in relation to the actions and the decisions of various tribunal members.</para><para>There have been concerns from the point of view of people dealing with tribunals—from the consumer end—that the independence of those tribunal members who are appointed through the minister can be impacted if they feel that they need to bring down decisions that are more in favour with what the minister believes is appropriate. That is an ongoing concern which applies to all tribunals and to the courts, to a lesser extent in general, and the Democrats will be keeping an eye on it. We highlighted that concern in the minority report.</para><para>The crucial aspect of tribunals such as these is their ability to deliver justice and a fair outcome to the Australian public and to the 
 people that appeal to these tribunals. Other issues involved are accessibility, which is another concern that was raised by Senator McKiernan, particularly in terms of whether people outside the major capital cities will be able to access tribunal services readily. There are also the cost of appealing to tribunals, which is another ongoing concern, and the speediness of decisions.</para><para>For elaboration, I will highlight a little of the actual work of the existing Immigration Review Tribunal which will be merged with the MIRO into the new Migration Review Tribunal. Its most recent annual report highlights the importance of the work of the tribunal. The amount of government appropriations that went into the tribunal last year was over $6 million. Nearly 2,700 separate cases were lodged in the last financial year.</para><para>The major issue, which is one that needs ongoing examination, is the age of the various cases and the amount of time that it takes for cases to be finalised. The annual report from last year highlights 16 per cent of cases that were more than one year old. There are a range of other statistics in there, which I will not go into in detail, but certainly getting those times down is an issue of great importance whether you are speaking from the point of view of the people who are applying to the tribunal or who are appealing, or from the point of view of the government in terms of ensuring that determinations are made one way or the other as speedily as possible.</para><para>Whilst it is not specifically in this bill, it is also worth mentioning, as the previous speaker outlined, that in the early stages of the initial No. 4 legislation the government's proposal was to restrict access of people to appeal to the courts via a privative clause. This was also considered by the Senate legislation committee over 12 months ago in what was known as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5). Thankfully that was not brought on by the government, although in some ways it might have been better if it had because they would have seen it voted down and given the fate it deserved.</para><para>It is a matter of great concern to the Democrats that the Prime Minister has again raised his intention to reintroduce this legislation. I 
 cannot understand why the government seems to want to continue to pursue that measure. The Senate committee of inquiry not only showed that this was an unfair measure, which may or may not be of concern to the government, but it also showed it was quite clearly unworkable and quite probably unconstitutional. It seems a strange thing for the government to put any effort at all into trying to reintroduce such completely unacceptable legislation on all of those grounds. Whilst I guess it is always a very dangerous practice to predict Senate decisions on particular legislation, I would be extremely surprised if that one were to be passed by this chamber. I would suggest it would be highly irresponsible of the Senate to do so.</para><para>I note the Prime Minister's remarks when he did formally announce that he was planning to reintroduce legislation to restrict access to the judicial review in all but `exceptional circumstances', which was part of his keynote address to the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia, held in Brisbane on 20 November this year. It does seem puzzling why the Prime Minister (1) is still going down this path and (2) why he seemed to think it would be helpful to announce that at a Federation of Ethnic Community Councils conference, given the outcome of the federal election and the clear rejection by the Australian electorate of the unfair and discriminatory policies put forward by parties such as One Nation. Why the Prime Minister still feels the need to highlight legislation which can really only be seen as an unfair attack on potential migrants is puzzling to me. I do wonder what the motivation is behind it.</para><para>I also note that, when the Prime Minister made those remarks, he talked about reintroducing this legislation and said that it had been `delayed in the Senate'. I think this is part of an ongoing campaign, and quite a dishonest one, on the part of at least some in the government to try to paint the Senate as a house of obstruction—as something that holds up legislation and that unnecessarily obstructs and obfuscates just for the hell of it. Clearly, in this case, this is a piece of legislation that was not delayed by the Senate; it 
 was delayed by the government, for what reasons I do not know. It was clearly most misleading on the part of the Prime Minister in that speech to accuse the Senate of being the body responsible for this legislation taking so long to pass.</para><para>As we can see from the speeches already made, this legislation will not be opposed by this chamber. It will not be opposed by the ALP and it will not be opposed by the Democrats. When there is such a widespread degree of support or at least a willingness to pass this legislation, it is completely unacceptable to try to blame the Senate for holding up this legislation.</para><para>In conclusion I would like to reinforce the remarks of the previous speaker by indicating how pleasing it is to see a minister who is willing to take on board concerns that arise from Senate inquiry processes and concerns expressed by various parties when they are considering legislation. I hope it is something that is taken on board by a larger number of ministers. Nonetheless, the Democrats will be watching the operations of the new Migration Review Tribunal with interest to make sure that it does deliver more fully on those key issues of providing a fair mechanism to people who are appealing to the tribunal, as well as an inexpensive, an accessible and a quick mechanism for providing determinations. It is on those key issues that the success or otherwise of this particular government initiative will be judged.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>927</page.no><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name><name.id>4J4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of the opposition. As has already been indicated by the previous speaker, my colleague Senator McKiernan, the opposition supports this <inline ref="s183">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998</inline> . I want to pay tribute to Senator McKiernan and to my colleague Senator Bolkus for the work they put in on the Senate committee when it dealt with this in the last parliament. Also, my colleague Senator Barney Cooney, who will speak shortly, has always had a very strong interest in what you would call the human rights arrangement issues relating to anything to do with the right of people to appeal in the judicial process. Senator Cooney's views on this matter are 
 extremely consistent and have been for all the time he has been in this parliament.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition has no objection to this bill as it is now proposed although we would point out that we did have some objections which were indicated in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report of October last year, now 13 months ago. The issues we raised in there, we are pleased to say, generally have been picked up by the government in the amendments they have now accepted in the bill they have introduced back into the parliament since the election.</para><para>There are three areas in which the bill has been changed and which the opposition finds acceptable, and as a result we will support the bill. The first change the government has adopted will allow the Migration Review Tribunal to commence operation at a time to be set by proclamation. This will allow time for administrative arrangements to be put in place. The government indicates that, nevertheless, the new tribunal will be in operation within six months of the bill receiving royal assent. The second change provides that the migration refugee review tribunals are to formally hand down the decisions in cases where there has not been an oral decision and the applicant is not in immigration detention. Finally, there are further changes for certainty in relation to the dispatch of documents from the tribunals.</para><para>The thrust of the government's proposal is that the present two-tiered structure of review is cumbersome, time consuming and expensive. I have to say from the evidence before the committee and in the government's own second reading speech that by any normal judgment of commonsense by ordinary citizens the delay in the handling of these review matters—it can be up to nearly two years—is too great. The cost, as indicated in the committee's report on evidence from the department, I think was $15 million for the Refugee Review Tribunal per annum and the Migration Independent Review Tribunal was running at around $3 million or $4 million. Whichever way you look at it that is a large whack of money.</para><para>The cost of justice is high but, as one who has argued that the cost of justice in Australia 
 has been far too high for far too long, I do accept that that argument cannot be ignored, and $15 million for the Refugee Review Tribunal is a very large amount of money. So I do accept that is a legitimate reason for the government to look at this. I can imagine the finance minister driving Mr Ruddock, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, mad at what are called the preliminary discussions in the ERC and the face to face discussions—and I can imagine there is some bureaucrat in the finance department saying $15 million is too much and we are going to slash $3 million or $4 million off it. I will bet you that was put on the document somewhere. The officials are smiling—they should not smile, I know—but I suspect that is somewhere close to the mark. I have had some experience of that myself.</para><para>Finance says it is expensive but, on the humanitarian side, we have to be very careful for the sake of our international reputation as well as for ethical reasons and the international arrangements we have to handle refugees. In one sense we might say $15 million is cheap at the price if we get it right about people having the right to come to Australia as refugees and having their appeals heard because, as we all know, if we get the decision wrong and send someone back who told us at the appeal that they had a justifiable fear of persecution if they returned home, if we reject that and they do go home and are persecuted, detained, beaten up, tortured or, in extreme cases, lose their lives, that is a decision that weighs heavily in any of these matters. No-one wants to see that happen to any citizen, particularly from a country like ours where we hold the issues of democracy and human rights so very highly.</para><para>I have to say that on this matter I give the present minister top marks for being a consistent proponent of human rights in this parliament since I have been here—and he has been here a lot longer than I have. I accept that he is genuine in his support for human rights. As a backbencher, long before he was a minister, he was consistently arguing those cases as an active member of Amnesty International. I have to say I suspect that on a number of occasions he was out of step with the majority 
 view of his own coalition parties. But he has always held those views. As the first person to invite me to go to Cambodia, way back in 1988, I accept that Phil Ruddock is genuine about this. On balance, I do not think he would be moving these proposals without weighing up his own experience, not to say that he would not have been under some pressure from the finance department, Treasury and a few other recalcitrants who do not want anything to do with migrants or refugees in Australia.</para><para>The issue that he raises is whether the new proposals—and this is the centre of the debate—do afford protection under the review arrangements for somebody to claim they are being harshly treated and should be allowed to stay in Australia, particularly in the refugee case. I think that the proposals here—and the opposition has this view—on balance seem to be able to work. However, as I said only last week on another bill, no-one is ever going to get it 100 per cent perfectly correct about the review procedures in immigration or tribunal matters. They are dealing with so many different cases there will always be arguments about someone who has been harshly dealt with.</para><para>The balance here again between the right of the individual and the collective right of society to establish its own rules to ensure that it is protected as well and is not open to abuse by individuals using legal devices to get around the collective view of the society is always a fine balance. We give the benefit of the doubt here. We believe the amendments the government has accepted from the opposition as a result of the committee's work have meant that we can support this bill. It will be a different matter when the next the bill, which in the old parliament was called Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5), comes up. I suppose in this parliament it will be called Migration Legislation Amendment Bill No. 2.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1I4</name.id><name role="metadata">McKIERNAN</name><name role="display">Senator McKiernan</name></talker><para>—Or No. 10.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—Or No. 10.

Years ago, he was the person that suggested that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee undertake that task of looking at the cost adjusters, and I think much has flowed from that, not only through the Senate but generally throughout the law. As was said in the second reading speech and indeed in the explanatory memorandum, the idea is to get justice at as reasonable a price as possible. That is an important matter that has been weighed in the balance now for quite some time, going back to those times when Senator Schacht suggested we undertake an examination of this area.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition supports this  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 , but there are some problems with it which I want to talk about—not so much about the bill but more about the attitude that is adopted by those presenting the bill. Under `Financial impact statement', paragraph 5 of the overview of the explanatory memorandum illustrates what I mean. It says:</para><para>The primary aim of the changes being introduced to the RRT is to produce faster decision making.</para><para>That sends out a message that what this is all about is to expeditiously get some sort of decision. I am sure the parliamentary secretary, who is in the chamber, would not go along with what might follow from that because she is a person who is dedicated—as indeed is the minister—to the issue of justice, but the message that comes out from that statement is a worrying one. I will repeat it:</para><para>The primary aim of the changes being introduced to the RRT is to produce faster decision making.</para><para>I would have hoped that the primary aim of the changes was to ensure that—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">SCHACHT</name><name role="display">Senator Schacht</name></talker><para>—Justice was done.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—That justice was done, as the shadow minister said. There are some other signs that the approach taken by those preparing this legislation is not so much concerned with giving people a fair hearing 
 but concerned more with saving money or having some sort of hearing—whether that hearing has substance or not being an irrelevant issue. In other words, you can have a situation where you have an illusion of justice, where what is applied is a form rather than a substance, with the person presiding over the hearing being directed and being under all sorts of restraints and not able, therefore, to bring forth justice in the way that is needed. The second reading speech says:</para></talk.start></continue><para>Taken together, these changes mean that people with bona fide review applications will be given a decision more quickly and a better decision if the initial decision is wrong. Those persons intent on fraud, deception or delay will not have the benefits of a delayed decision.</para><para>What is the point of saying that? What is the point of making that sort of statement about a process? If a person has a reason for delay—and courts are delayed at times—that is legitimate, why should that person be a person who is intent on fraud or deception? Why does it follow? Where is the evidence for making what is quite a vicious statement, without the evidence being put forward in the second reading speech?</para><para>Another statement in the second reading speech says:</para><para>Migration Review Tribunal members will be independent decision makers, able to reach their own conclusions on a decision under review, in accordance with the law. However, this independence does not amount to non-accountability.</para><para>What does that mean, and how does that fit with the sorts of things that the Chief Justice of the High Court says? At a colloquium about courts in the future, held at Surfers Paradise on 8 November, the Chief Justice gave a talk called `The future state of the judicature'. He said:</para><para>The development and enforcement of standards of competence and diligence is a difficult issue with which courts and legislatures have to grapple. The requirements of independence and accountability are not mutually inconsistent but they can, in some circumstances, conflict. The resolution of such conflict will be a pre-occupation of those concerned with the governance of the courts over the next decade.</para><para>You have the Chief Justice of the High Court struggling with this concept of measuring accountability against the issue of the way the 
 courts ought to go about their business, yet the people who wrote this second reading speech seem to have had no difficulty in saying that that is a fairly simple issue to resolve. The other thing that worries me about this second reading speech is that in the paragraph immediately above the one I have just read, it has this to say:</para><para>The Tribunal's Principal Member will have clear authority to apply efficient processing practices. This may include the introduction of a case management system where much of the preliminary research and investigative work would be undertaken by administrative staff of the Tribunal. Tribunal members would be responsible for directing any further investigation be undertaken, and for the final decision.</para><para>You have people who are not even legally qualified, but are administrative people, doing preliminary research. What is going to be the quality of the decision if we are going to have people who have no general idea of how the law should run making decisions that determine people's lives. These are big decisions that are being made in this matter. His Honour, in that speech I was talking about, also has this to say:</para><para>Litigants are frequently unrepresented by lawyers and conduct their cases in person, and an over enthusiastic or unthinking application of some of the principles of modern case management to disputes of this kind can be counter productive.</para><para>This second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum seem to have been written without taking into account these high principles of justice. What the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum seem to be intent upon is getting the form of a hearing despatched with as cheaply as possible. That is the language that is used, compared with the language that the Chief Justice is talking about. Again, the thrust of what is put forward in the second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum is that there has to be efficiency—indeed, I think the act talks about efficiency—and the need to get things done—the language of the economist, the language of the economic theorist who says that the big thing is to produce decisions as quickly as possible and as cheaply as possible. What about a bit of justice in there? Again in this speech, His Honour says:</para><para>It is impossible to measure the effectiveness of the judiciary as an institution, or to attempt to predict the extent to which such effectiveness may, in the future, wax or wane, without having a reasonably clear idea of the functions historically, and currently, performed by the judiciary as an institution.</para><para>But in the way this bill has been presented to this chamber, there is no flavour of the historical background to the judiciary as an institution. Indeed, one of the great problems about this legislation—of course, it is not confined to this legislation; it is a problem which more and more legislation has—is this: people are appointed for a limited time. Under this legislation you can have part-time people and you can have full-time people who are appointed on a time basis, and that provides a very dangerous basis upon which these people can make decisions against government.</para><para>One of the flaws in more and more legislation coming before more and more parliaments is the fact that these tribunals are set up to decide issues between people and governments and the decision makers are in a very precarious position. It would be interesting to go through—perhaps the minister at the table can do this—the number of people who have not been reappointed over the years, to see what sort of decisions they made in the terms of the act that they administered. Again in this context, I will quote what His Honour Justice Gleeson has to say about that:</para><para>In this area also, the way in which the courts go about their business reflects, and affects, society's values. For example, the amenability of governments to civil process, the capacity of the courts to intervene in disputes between citizens and governments, the power of judges to make orders binding governments, and the way in which courts handle cases involving claims against government, reflect an ideal of equality before the law which is relatively modern, and which is certainly not universal. It is not an ideal which is likely to be displaced in the foreseeable future. Governments will continue to be active litigants, frequently as defendants. The functions of the courts in dealing with complaints against governments is likely to expand rather than contract, and that function, in turn, will constantly remind the public of the need for an independent judiciary. The expectations and assumptions made by the public that a citizen engaged in a civil or criminal dispute with the government will receive even-handed justice constitute a vital, but often neglected test of what is sometimes called satisfac 
 tion with the performance of the courts. In fact, I can think of no more important test.</para><para>I ask: was that test applied when this legislation was being drawn up? It certainly does not appear from the second reading speech or from the explanatory memorandum that it was. Perhaps that is an illustration of where we should stop having tribunals that are appointed for a limited time and go to a magistracy.</para><para>I know one of the things the present Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Williams, has been advocating is that we have a federal magistracy that can handle matters like this and that will be protected from the onslaughts that governments might make upon it by two things: firstly, the magistracy would have tenure—they would have their positions until they are 70—and, secondly, the magistracy would have a pension. The present situation where decisions in the migration area are reviewed by people who have not got permanency of position, who have insecurity of tenure, is a real problem. It is a problem that is growing, and it is a problem that we ought to do something about.</para><para>The issue is this: is this legislation and the legislation which came before it—this idea of a tribunal of limited tenure is not new—sufficient to give justice to people who come before this new tribunal? Will it be sufficient to stand up against government and give the decisions it ought to, particularly when you look at the sorts of words that have been written in the explanatory memorandum and the sorts of words that have been used in the second reading speech? Will it be able to stand up against government when we have a department whose disposition is to treat people that appeal its decisions as suspect or as fraudulent? The words used are very interesting: `Intent upon fraud, deception or delay'.</para><para>This is not the right sort of attitude, you would have thought, to bring to legislation like this. This is a department which thinks in terms of economy rather than in terms of justice, fairness and full hearings. It wants to get this thing up and away rather than allow the culture of the judiciary, the culture of the fair go, to carry the day. Rather, the culture 
 of the economy, the culture of getting things done quickly, is what prevails here.</para><para>This is a piece of legislation that will go through—it has been agreed upon—but it comes to this chamber in a context which is in many respects unattractive. Perhaps it is not so much that the legislation ought to change, but that the people who will administer it ought to realise that not only are they enforcing legislation, not only are they regulators, but also they should be facilitators, in the proper circumstances. The people they deal with—migrants and people who have, say, made claims for refugee status which have been refused—are nevertheless people with the sorts of feelings and emotions that we all have.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>931</page.no><name role="metadata">Margetts, Sen Dee</name><name role="display">Senator MARGETTS</name><name.id>DX5</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>G(WA)</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—To start with, I would like to point out the fact that the <inline ref="s183">Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998</inline>  is amongst those that should not necessarily be on the list for debate right now. It is not one of the ones on the list that was asterisked; that is, it is not one of the bills the government said was urgent in this session of parliament. Perhaps the government wants to keep talking about recalcitrants in the Senate and, at the same time, bring on bills that have not been notified to the Senate but are urgent for this session. We had a debate this morning about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill (No. 2) 1998. It looks like that bill is going to be rushed on as well. Perhaps the general idea is that you bring on a bill so that the rest of the chamber is not able to give its full attention to it because you have not told them it is coming on in this particular session of parliament.</para></talk.start><para>Essentially, the  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  does two major things. Firstly, the bill merges the two-tier review process for non-refugee visa decisions—departmental review and review by the independent Immigration Review Tribunal—into a single review by the newly created external review body, the Migration Review Tribunal. Secondly, it provides a range of new procedures for the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal, including empowering the principal member of the 
 Refugee Review Tribunal to issue general directions to tribunal members granting both principal members the power to reconstitute a tribunal during a hearing in specific circumstances.</para><para>Let us look at the background and ideology of this bill. The bill was introduced in May 1997 as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Philip Ruddock. That bill, as it was introduced, reflected the majority of the provisions of the current bill. However, it also provided for a privative clause in relation to immigration decisions aimed at narrowing the possibility of judicial review of relevant tribunal decisions by the Federal Court and the High Court.</para><para>We have seen that part of this has been split off. The ideology behind this privative clause was that there was a huge number of rorts in the immigration sector. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> outlines the immense flaws in this argument. While considerable media and other attention is given to people who arrive in Australia in boats without any authorisation—that is, boat people—the actual effects such people have on overall programs is relatively minor. Between the start of 1989-90 and the end of 1995-96, 2,508 boat people arrived in Australia without authorisation. Of these, 1,755 have been removed from Australia—and you can only wonder with what justice all of them were removed. During 1995-96, 589 boat people arrived in 14 boats. Of these, 413 have been removed—once again, with what justice?—with an average time before removal of 17 days. In 1997-98, 13 boats carrying 159 people arrived in Australia without authorisation.</para><para>In this ideological context, we can see that we are blaming refugees for just about everything. This bill is problematic and represents further erosions for refugees. We can only wonder whether it is another attempt to appeal to the populist scapegoating mentality, that is, there are lots of things happening, the government and the opposition have been involved in quite a lot of them, but let us draw attention away from the real issues in Australia—economic rationalism and the impacts of 
 massive economic and social changes—concentrate on refugees and see if we can get some populist support for doing so, perhaps through talkback radio and so on.</para><para>The Greens have some serious concerns about this Bill. Primarily, we share the concerns that were identified during the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee consideration of this bill. Unfortunately, these issues have not been adequately addressed by the government's amendments, and the Greens are extremely disappointed that the ALP are not moving amendments to deal with the substantive issues that they themselves have raised. I notice Senator Cooney mentioned a number of them.</para><para>These concerns include: the erosion of the independence of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal and the lack of requirements to provide adverse information to applicants—that is, the concern that adverse information is to be based on the individual alone and not the group. Often the situational plight faced by the group is crucial information and it is often impossible to appreciate the risk without taking into account evidence that relates to the group—but here we have left it to the individual.</para><para>Personal appearances before the Refugee Review Tribunal by telephone or television are possibly the thin edge of the wedge—the beginning of an `efficiency dividend' to actually reduce the number of tribunals and problems. There was evidence that there are problems here in relation to legal representation and language, if this results in people not getting equal access under the law.</para><para>There are also concerns with the changed discretion regarding the publication of decisions—that is, it may lead to problems in transparency, in general development of jurisprudence in this area and in scrutiny of decisions, especially those which may be criticised. You may have a situation where controversial decisions are not publicised.</para><para>We had a situation where two Refugee Review Tribunal members were subjected to pressure by the principal member to not consider specific refugee cases dealing with East Timorese asylum seekers. Consequently, we have a minister's office requesting a halt 
 on such cases, pending formulation of government policy. We can but wonder whether or not this is one of the driving forces in that area. Also, in December 1996, the minister publicly criticised members of a tribunal that granted refugee status to a woman on the ground of domestic violence. This may be seen by some to be another ideological reason in relation to refugee status.</para><para>In relation to the adverse information, it may well be, as Mr Robert Gotterson QC said, in his submission to the committee, that:</para><para>information before the tribunal about an association's or group's conduct, practices etc. is slanted, biased or quite wrong in fact. If the exception in paragraph (a) stands—</para><para>there will not be a balance, if I can paraphrase the end of the sentence. There are situations where people are judged on the activities of a group and they should also be able to give evidence on their own behalf.</para><para>In relation to personal appearances, I am certainly one of those in favour of the ability to attend hearings by telephone—although I have to say there is a lot of work still to be done in Parliament House to get a decent reception from the telephone. We often get a better reception in a country hall in Northern Queensland than we do in Parliament House.</para><para>But in the case of the law and equality before the law, it may be that the chase for the lowest dollars means that there is not equal representation before the law. Trying to deal with applications by telephone—given the court system and a difficult and emotional situation—may mean that people who are subject to that situation may not receive equal justice. It is considered by Mr Robyn Creyke, a lecturer in law at the Australian National University, to be:</para><para>not ideal when veracity is at issue, where there are language difficulties, or interpreters need to be employed.</para><para>That is obviously an issue that needs to be taken into consideration before cost cutting considerations come to the fore.</para><para>In relation to the ability of the principal member to publish a decision, it could well be that publication of all decisions is the right thing to do, unless there is a specific, very good reason under law why something does 
 not get published. But equality under the law would indicate that all decisions should be published so that people know the basis upon which decisions were made.</para><para>There was a minority report issued by Senators Bolkus, McKiernan and Murray with five key concerns. As far as we can see, those concerns have not necessarily been taken up. Evidence in the minority report also stated that the proposals to cancel visas in relation to possible non-compliance with specifications on a previous visa may be harsh and unwarranted, because non-intentional errors by third parties were not taken into proper consideration.</para><para>There is a lot that is problematic in this bill. The rush to put it through to fill the gap in the legislation program is likely to result in people's rights unavoidably and, I think, unfairly being cut—simply by dint of rush, and that is not the way we should be pursuing a legislation program.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>933</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. Before turning to some of the specific issues raised, I would like to remind all senators of the government's policy objectives for this bill. Maybe I should say, before I actually get on to those comments, that we really ought to be looking at this bill in the context of it being a bill which amends a whole Act. I will speak about that in a moment when I talk about Senator Cooney's contribution.</para></talk.start><para>The bill continues the government's work in restoring community credibility in the management of immigration matters. The major change is a streamlining of the current two-tier review process for non-refugee visa decisions into a single review by the Migration Review Tribunal. The new Migration Review Tribunal will be an independent review agency. It will provide fair, impartial, expeditious and efficient review of migration.</para><para>This will be done through the introduction of more streamlined and flexible review decision making processes. The bill provides enhanced powers for principal members of 
 both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal to apply efficient review processing practices. I want to discuss that in more detail later too. The changes provided for by this bill will give principal members the power to ensure that the tribunals meet their statutory obligations, and these obligations are to provide review processes which are fair, just, informal, economical and quick. Again, I will refer to that later.</para><para>Principal members will not, however, be able to influence other members on the merits of particular cases, and these enhanced powers relate only—and I emphasis only—to review procedures. The principal members will be the chief executive officers of the tribunals and will be responsible to the parliament through the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Again, I would like to point out to all senators that the bill is a part of the continuing process adopted by this government to ensure the integrity of the migration program. This and others—the one that has just been before the parliament and others before the parliament—are designed to restore community confidence in immigration decision making.</para><para>I wish to now comment on a couple of the comments made by various senators who have contributed to the debate. I regret that sometimes these debates are not the sorts of debates that are on television, that we have question time on television and that the general public cannot see the sorts of comments that were made by honourable senators in the opposition about the minister, about his commitment to human rights over a very long period of time, and also about his integrity in those issues. If we said those sorts of things about each other from time to time—maybe more often than time to time—the general public would not have such a poor opinion of us. I appreciate the generosity of spirit that was shown tonight by members of the opposition in making those comments, because I think the minister has made a very great attempt to address those issues and has had a history of doing that.</para><para>I would also like to say that maybe we ought to exercise our minds a little about why this bill is able to go through the Senate a 
 little faster than might otherwise have been the case. The committee addressed issues in this bill and in the one we heard the other night, but then an election intervened, so the minister was able to take into account the comments of the committee and to address those in the bill. Amendments are often made on the run—sometimes by an opposition that has very limited resources and with assistance from clerks who are equally under stress. Maybe that is not the best way to make law. Honourable senators should address the issue of why this has been an opportunity for the bill to be amended, given the contribution made by all members of the committee, and think about ways and means that that could be replicated to assist the procedures of this house.</para><para>I want to also address the issue of concern about the location of offices. That of course will be the decision of the minister, and he will no doubt take into account the issues that people raised. One of the reasons for having a provision to allow for teleconferencing is to try to address that issue. I know some honourable senators raised concerns about it, but for as many concerns that can be raised there are positive points—that people in rural or remote areas will have more easy access, or it may be the case that some members may specialise. Currently, we have members dealing with approximately 30 visa classes. It means that they have to be on top of all of that. If some members were able to specialise, you may in fact get a more consistent decision making process within a visa class and across the country. Also, you may get a more timely response because the person is more familiar. There are advantages in that process of videoconferencing. I am sure the minister, in deciding where those offices will be located, will take into account the need for people to have access but also the need for decisions to be as uniform as possible, and as consistent and speedy as possible.</para><para>Senator Bartlett mentioned the non-reviewability of conclusive certificates. The government of Australia has the right and responsibility to exclude or remove from Australia persons whose presence would be prejudicial to Australia's security, defence or 
 international relations. In some circumstances, merits review may need to be excluded for the same reasons. The Migration Act currently provides the minister with the power to exclude merits review by the IRT, RRT and AAT to safeguard Australia's security, defence and international obligations.</para><para>This power has been rarely used. I have been advised that you can count on one hand the decisions made by ministers of both sides of politics using this power. But it remains an essential power. The proposed section 339 merely recognises that this power should continue to be available if needed in relation to MRT reviews. The circumstances in which the power is available are very specific and limited. In such circumstances, Australia's national interest must be placed above the merits review rights of one person. From the evidence I have just given about how rarely it has been used, I think that that speaks for itself.</para><para>Senator Schacht again tonight mentioned the fine balance between the rights of the individual and rights of the collective view of society. I think that there is also an issue of balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of individuals who are in the legitimate stream waiting to be processed as refugees. If somebody is not playing the game, if somebody is using means which are less than legitimate, they are denying the rights of those individuals who are waiting to be processed in the correct way in the normal course of events.	So it is not only a balance between the right of the individual and the right of society, it is also the rights of different individuals to be considered for refugee status in Australia.</para><para>Senator Cooney commented that the EM took primarily an economic approach. He mentioned that at No. 5 in the overview of the EM the primary aim of the changes being introduced to the RRT is to produce faster decision making. In all fairness, that was in the financial impact statement section. Also in all fairness, as I mentioned earlier, it should be taken in the context of the whole act. Section 353 (1) of the act states:</para><para>The Tribunal shall, in carrying out its functions under this Act, pursue the objective of providing a 
 mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick.</para><para>We need to take in context that what we are looking at with this bill in particular is the emphasis on the `economical' and the `quick'. That is not to downplay or disregard the aspect of the act that refers to being `fair' and `just'. I think Senator Cooney was a little harsh in saying that the EM and the bill were emphasising that particular aspect. In fact if there are delays associated with the administration and delays based on members not making decisions, that is not fair and just. So, again, there is a balance in making sure that people do not have to wait for decisions to be made.</para><para>Senator Cooney also raised the question of the independence of tribunals. The new provisions in relation to the MRT and RRT do not alter the independence of the tribunals in any way. All existing review rights for applicants are preserved. The changes are about reducing the time taken to finalise review applications. Migration is one of the few areas of administrative law where there is a positive advantage to applicants delaying proceedings as long as possible. The delays allow some applicants to prolong their stay in Australia, regardless of the merits of their case.</para><para>The new provisions provide a statutory obligation that reviews conducted by the tribunals be, as I said before, fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Speedier decision making will benefit all genuine applicants and discourage those who do not have any legitimate claims. The new Migration Review Tribunal is expected to be able to complete most reviews in at least half the time of that currently taken in the existing two-tier system. The average processing time will be cut from 16 months in 1996-97 to something like six to eight months.</para><para>The bill demonstrates a clear intention that the enhanced powers of principal members are not to be used to attempt to issue directions on merit related issues. Senator Cooney referred to the role of the principal member. I again reiterate that the principal member cannot direct the members, but some of the delay has been associated with administrative 
 issues, and the principal member is able to direct staff. That is why it is appropriate that some of these administrative matters be dealt with by staff so that they can be facilitated and expedited more efficiently. Anything that can actually speed up that process and reduce delay is important. I think that needed to be clarified.</para><para>Senator Margetts talked about the boat people. I think there was an implication in what she said that all of these people are legitimate refugees. We all know that is not the case, that there are some people who arrive who are not legitimate refugees. There is a process for assessing whether these people are refugees. If they are refused, they have access to the current process. I think that was an important point that should have been made. I feel that Senator Margetts did not hit the spot with her comment.</para><para>I would like to thank all honourable senators for their contributions. The debate has taken place over a long period of time. I commend the work of the committee and the suggestions they have made. I also thank honourable senators for their positive comments about the minister.</para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>936</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The bill.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>936</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen James</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have only one question, and I preface it by saying that I am disappointed we are not being given the information as to the geographical locations of the MRT offices. To a certain extent I can understand why the decision has not yet been made, because the bill, as it is passed into amending the act, will not come into effect until promulgation, and there is some flexibility on that.</para></talk.start><para>However, let me just stress that, apart from what I said in my second reading contribution about the accessibility by applicants to the tribunal, I also have concerns about the employment aspects of this merger. There are MIRO offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. These of course will be amalgamated with IRT offices to form the MRT. The MRT, as at 30 June 1996, had 35 members, one 
 principal member, five senior members, 12 full-time members and 17 part-time members. There are also 40 administrative staff and eight temporary staff. They are also located at registries across Australia. Apart from the principal location here in Canberra, there are registries situated in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.</para><para>I would hope that an early decision can be made on the geographical location of the MRT so that individuals whose lives and livelihoods depend upon their continued employment within the tribunal, be it as tribunal members on a full- or part-time basis or as administrative staff, can be advised at the earliest possible opportunity so that they can organise their lives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>936</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>VIC</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator McKiernan asked a question about the current staff. Currently, approximately 100 APS staff are employed in IRT and MIRO offices. The government anticipates that around the same number of staff will be employed in the MRT. It is therefore expected that the majority of the IRT and MIRO staff will find employment with the MRT. In the case of any such officers not employed by the MRT, the department has indicated that it will endeavour to find them employment in other areas. The department has an excellent record of placing officers in suitable positions after a major change of function. I think those issues have been taken into consideration. I asked questions about it in a briefing and I was given what I thought was a very adequate response.</para></talk.start><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>936</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>) read a third time.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>936</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Presentation</title><page.no>936</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—by leave—at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knowles</inline> , to move, on the next day of sitting:</para></talk.start><para>That the time for the presentation of the report of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee on the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Bill 1998 and 2 related bills be extended to 2 December 1998.</para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title><type>Address in Reply</type><page.no>937</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Address-in-Reply</title><page.no>937</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 26 November, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline>:</para><para>That the following Address-in-Reply be agreed to:</para><para><inline font-style="italic">To His Excellency the Governor-General</inline></para><para>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY—</para><para>We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>937</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>SA</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I might have been better able to make this last part of my contribution if I had had time to go to my office to get my copious notes. If the Senate will give me some leeway—which I am sure it will—I would like to pick up on the point I was making the last time I was speaking in the address-in-reply. I was highlighting the problems confronting the Australian community with the total fiasco of the Job Network. I think I was at the point of reminding people that the government fails to publicly admit that the Job Network is a disaster.</para></talk.start><para>It is curious that if it is not a disaster you would bother finding $50 million in the weeks just before an election to fix it. You said, `It's just to help; it's just to assist people to get out of difficulty.' Fifty million dollars is a fairly large chunk of money to find at short notice to assist with something that is not problematic.</para><para>It is important for the government to face up to the significant difficulties in the Job Network. As I have already said, the mistakes in the tendering process, the way Centrelink failed for some eight weeks to pass across any referrals to many of the network providers, and the fact that the Employment Network was charging employers $250 for people coming to find work in their organisations were disastrous things which were a very big negative. </para><para>If we are serious about helping the unemployed, firstly, we will not do it by creating a situation where half the providers—dedicated and wonderful people working in the community, many with long years of experience—have gone to the wall. Some are going to close and some have already closed. What kind of situation is that? Secondly, you do not help unemployed people by having Job Network provisions which require them to register with Centrelink but then front up to a Job Network organisation.</para><para>They can nominate some, but many people who came before our committee of inquiry into regional unemployment pointed out that the Job Network office available to them was nowhere near where they lived. Having registered with Centrelink, they then had the cost of travel, which for many was almost a make or break problem. If you are trying to manage on unemployment benefits or a pension, it is very difficult to find $7 each way for transport costs—as we were told at a number of hearings. Finally, when employers have to pay for a service that was previously free, they are not amused. As I pointed out, a lot of people were putting signs in their windows saying `Vacancy: inquire within'. Many had also advertised jobs, and that was one of the contributing factors to the large increase in the number of advertisements of job vacancies.</para><para>It will be interesting to see what the new ministerial duo do with Job Network. I understand that Mr Reith and Mr Abbott are working away assiduously to come up with some way to address the monstrous failure that is Job Network. It has let down employers, providers and, in particular, the unemployed. It has to be rearranged. It has already been allocated a $50 million bonus issue in the run-up to the election. It will be interesting to see how that is spent. I believe that with better arrangements in the tendering process, a lot of that extra money would not have been necessary and a lot of the organisations that are going to the wall would not have gone to the wall.</para><para>My closing remarks on the Job Network are that I am very concerned that much of this is now regarded as commercial-in-confidence 
 and we are therefore denied a lot of access to the data through the estimates process. I have sought information and advice from the clerks and from previous Senate inquiries as to what constitutes commercial-in-confidence. I think it is very important to note that much of what is sometimes claimed as commercial-in-confidence—`we can say no more'—is not justified. It is necessary, I believe, for the Senate to make it clear to people who want to give that sort of answer that they are going to have to justify which, if any, parts of the answer are able to be legitimately restrained under commercial-in-confidence, and the rest must be provided to the parliament. These are, after all, precious taxpayers' dollars, and it is proper that the parliament follows exactly where they go and how they are spent.</para><para>I do believe that, if we are not going to see that made clear in the committees, that kind of argument and debate will have to be brought into this place. A thorough clarification of what is allowed to be withheld under commercial-in-confidence needs to put this beyond doubt for the whole parliament. We cannot have the process that we have had up to this point in some of the committees. In our own committee at the last estimates we had a farcical answer from the head of Employment National, who refused to say what his salary was with the response, `I'm not going to tell you. I don't have to tell you, and anyway it will be made public in the annual report that is coming out in a month's time.' What an absolute farce. Of course he should have told the committee; he had no right not to tell the committee.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5F4</name.id><name role="metadata">CALVERT</name><name role="display">Senator Calvert</name></talker><para>—When we were trying to find out the relationship between Mr Keating and the Commonwealth Bank, they wouldn't tell us either.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name></talker><para>—I don't know about that at all, Senator.

We have had some very strange contributions to the health debate. I think it is absolutely critical, in the address-in-reply, to say that this government plans to legislate for a 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance for those people above $70,000 income because that is the cut-off for the means test. As this 30 per cent rebate, as I understand it, builds on the previous rebate, which was means tested, what this new allocation of some $1.4 billion means is that the people at the top end of town will be getting a full 30 per cent of their $2,000 or $3,000 a year health premiums. For some families that will be a $1,000 rebate on their health insurance premium, while people on low incomes will be getting only a top up. They will be getting $50 to $150, not up to $1,000. That is the first injustice, that the people who are at the lower end of the scale will get much less out of this than the people on the top incomes.</para><para>Secondly, if any government had $1.4 billion to spend in health, you would not spend it by giving a tax rebate to people whose health premiums are only going to rise as a result of this handout, precisely as has happened before with the first round of rebate handouts. It has done absolutely nothing to restrain health costs, it has done absolutely nothing to provide increased services and it has done absolutely nothing to reduce the health bills that people get when they finally make a claim against their private health insurance. If the government were serious about the best way to spend that money and to assist people in this community with their health costs, that money would be allocated directly to the provision of services, in particular through our public hospitals.</para><para>One of my staff had occasion, on behalf of a constituent, just the other day to discover that there are, I think, 98,000 people waiting for acute dental services in South Australia through the dental hospital there. Many of them will wait up to two years. The government had money to assist with the rebate for dental insurance premiums, that is, under 
 extras. It was prepared to spend $200 million assisting with the premiums for extras to help people at the top end of town cope. But why wouldn't it, instead of that, spend only $100 million to restore the dental services to what they were before and dramatically reduce the waiting times for the provision of urgent services for those people, particularly those on low incomes, who have to queue up at the dental health services? It is an extraordinary argument from the so-called whiz-kid economists opposite that you would want to chase $200 million, after pushing up the cost of dental health services, rather than spending $100 million, a restrained cost amount, to dramatically reduce the waiting lists and the waiting times for very necessary dental services.</para><para>In both employment services and health services we have got a government which have got it completely wrong. They are not here to help strengthen community, they are not here to assist the people across the income scale—they are here to make sure that people who are very well off get even more assistance. People who don't need it are being assisted, and the cost of that is that people across the community pay, particularly people on the low income end of the scale. Costs of services and waiting times go up and the provision of those services goes down, and the people who suffer most are those people on low incomes. How anyone could justify this rebate for private health insurance, I do not know. It is a joke. It is very bad economics and it is very bad health care. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>939</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>NT</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak tonight in the address-in-reply and seek to put on the public record my response to a number of issues that were raised in the Governor-General's speech. I want to highlight the implications for the federal government from the result of the recent election as seen from the Northern Territory's point of view. One thing is evident about the result on 3 October, and that is that the people of the Northern Territory have clearly rejected the policies of the Liberal and National parties. Voters returned the Northern Territory electorate to the Australian Labor 
 Party representative. For those who may not know, Northern Territory voters had the opportunity in the recent election to elect two senators and one member for the House of Representatives. Out of three parliamentary representatives, Territory voters have sent two ALP members, one senator and one House of Representatives member, to represent their interests.</para></talk.start><para>So let me place on record that I am very pleased that my ALP colleague Warren Snowdon has once again been returned to Canberra. Voters for both houses realised that the coalition policies offered nothing for people living in the Northern Territory. My colleagues opposite stand up and talk about having won back the heart of rural and regional Australia. They did not win back people in the Northern Territory. They could not convince people in the Northern Territory that what they had to offer was going to provide them with any substantial benefits. The outcome proves that people living in rural and remote Australia have little faith in the policies of this government.</para><para>It has to be said that the Northern Territory is an expensive place to live. Voters rejected the coalition's proposed GST. They know that the high prices they already pay for essentials will increase. There was nothing offered by the coalition during the election campaign which was going to reassure them. For example, we know that in the last quarter the cost of an average basket of goods in the Northern Territory, particularly in places like Darwin and Alice Springs, was 40 per cent higher than what you would pay for a similar shopping basket of goods if you shopped in Melbourne or Sydney.</para><para>When you consider the 40 per cent higher cost of goods in the rural and remote Territory, people did not have any of their concerns allayed by coalition counterparts campaigning in the Territory that Territorians were going to be better off under these policies. A lot of people, many of whom would probably have normally been supporters of the coalition's policies, indicated that while they may well have voted for the coalition in the House of Representatives they certainly were not going to vote that way in the Senate, 
 because they wanted to ensure that the Senate conducted an inquiry into the impact of the GST, particularly as it affected them.</para><para>In the last seven days we have seen the GST Senate committees established. In the coming weeks we will develop their itinerary to travel around this country to talk to, consult with and hear from people. I have a concern, which the Labor Party will be addressing, and it is the so-called `northern line'—the line that you might draw from the top of Brisbane to the top of Perth. The Labor Party will guarantee to the people of Australia that this will not be an eastern seaboard inquiry. It will be an inquiry that endeavours to send the committees around the country, out to rural and regional Australia, so that those people can also have their voices heard and their concerns addressed.</para><para>The full privatisation of Telstra is another issue of concern to the people of the Northern Territory. It is no secret that access to reliable and affordable telecommunications services is becoming increasingly important in overcoming some of the tyrannies of distance faced by people living in remote and regional areas of Australia. This access to technology in the information age is vital for education, business and often health purposes. During the Territory's wet season many people in remote communities are cut off for weeks at a time by flood or stormwaters, making them even more reliant on telecommunications services. In places like Port Keats, there are limited telephone lines into houses. We still have places in this country where people are waiting for telephones to be put into their homes. We still have places in this country where it takes 20 minutes to download a page from the Internet. Telstra's community service obligation is essential to ensure that people in regional Australia have access to telecommunications at an affordable price.</para><para>Telstra is also an important employer in communities outside Darwin. The reduction of Telstra staff now living in small communities will have a major economic impact on those communities. People living in remote parts of Australia have already noticed a drop in the quality of service delivery. The Territory is no different. Proper provision for the 
 ongoing maintenance of telecommunications services is essential if people are to have reliable service delivery.</para><para>In referring to our future generation, the government has said that it will support a quality teacher program to improve teacher skills and lift the status of teaching in schools. In part of his speech, the Governor-General made specific reference to the quality teacher program and to improving the quality of teachers in our schools. Is the response in the Governor-General's speech finally the government's response to the inquiry into the status of the teaching profession, <inline font-style="italic">A Class Act</inline>? Is there finally recognition that the status of teachers needs improving, although only given a cursory mention in the address? The Northern Territory government has recently acknowledged the low morale of teachers and the need for the bureaucracy to change to support better teaching and learning.</para><para>But this commitment is just not good enough, and still does not address the crisis facing the education system in this country—the crucial shortage of teachers for our education system. This government needs to give a commitment to recognise this and to fund a national recruitment campaign designed to attract high quality applicants to the teaching profession, but more importantly to ensure that they stay there and that there are adequate incentives to keep them in the profession. The government statement does not go far enough and still implies that the low status amongst the profession is linked to the skills of these people rather than to the inadequacies of the system and its lack of recognition to address related problems.</para><para>The most important area in reply to the Governor-General's speech relates to the issue of our indigenous Australians, in particular our Aboriginal people. The election result in the Northern Territory sends an important and vital message that the coalition government needs to come to terms with and recognise. It is important that this comment is put on the public record: Aboriginal people living in remote communities in the Northern Territory overwhelmingly oppose the coalition's policies on Aboriginal issues. In the Senate, Aboriginal voters in Northern Territory 
 remote communities voted eight to one for the Australian Labor Party. Of 11,790 votes that were cast in remote communities where the population is overwhelmingly Aboriginal, 8,056 gave their first preference vote to the Australian Labor Party. The coalition received only 1,891 votes. Aboriginal people voted overwhelmingly for the Australian Labor Party.</para><para>In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on Wednesday, 4 November, Maria Ceresa explains:</para><para>. . . results in the seats of the Northern Territory, Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, Leichhardt on Queensland's Cape York and Grey in South Australia provide some indication of how bush Aborigines feel.</para><para>Taking in isolation the remote booths with a high percentage of indigenous voters, this is what happened:</para><para>In the Territory, successful ALP candidate Warren Snowdon won an 8 per cent swing—</para><para>this is out bush—</para><para>and 80 per cent of the vote on a two-party preferred basis.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>In his new spirit of reconciliation, John Howard claims that Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron has the support of "grassroots" indigenous people.</para><para>. . .              . . .             . . .</para><para>However, there is little evidence to support the claim of broad-based support for the Government from ordinary Aborigines. Indeed, the election result graphically demonstrates the shallowness of such a contention.</para><para>Who can blame Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory for not trusting this federal government? The Reeves review of the land rights act is perceived by many Aboriginal people as being a means of undermining the power of the two mainland councils. The proposal to break up the land councils by establishing 18 regional land councils is seen by many to be the land councils' punishment for being too effective an opposition to the federal and territory governments on a wide range of issues of concern to their constituents. It is not unexpected that the CLP government has waged war against the land councils; they have proven themselves to be a vindictive lot.</para><para>It should be remembered that land councils are statutory authorities given their powers under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Section 23 of the act lists the functions of the land councils. Under the act, the land councils have a legal responsibility to protect the interests of Aboriginal traditional owners. They should not be punished for doing their job properly.</para><para>In fact, in the weeks leading up to the election I travelled out bush to remote communities. As you would be aware, voting started one week before 3 October, the date of the federal election. When we went to remote booths, particularly along the top of north-east Arnhem Land, we saw signs that had been put up by the Country Liberal Party that said, `If you vote for Nick Dondas, we will give you your own land council.' That was absolutely deceptive and misleading, but Aboriginal people knew that. Aboriginal people were not to be deceived; they understood exactly what this government was on about and they did not fall for it.</para><para>I should turn to the matter of reconciliation. The Prime Minister has nominated this as one of the priorities for his second term. On that Tuesday, the day of the Governor-General's speech, there was little more than two sentences on the matter and only an undertaking that the government would  work to achieve the goal of reconciliation over the next two years. Where is the apology to the stolen generation, evidence that this government has really changed? Where is that one word from the Prime Minister that would usher in an apology to the many Aboriginal people in this country who have been emotionally affected and hurt by the policies of previous governments? All the Prime Minister needs to do is apologise and move on, but it seems to be too big an ask.</para><para>It is true that David Buckingham, the Executive Director of the Business Council of Australia, has recently delivered a statement about reconciliation that goes much further than any member of the government has committed to. I refer to a summary of his article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on Tuesday, 10 November. He said it was vital to understand what reconciliation was, that it 
 was not just a matter of granting Aborigines full citizenship rights such as adequate health, education and other services, and that, ultimately, reconciliation was about indigenous rights and issues of indigenous laws and customs. Until the community embraced the meaning and existence of indigenous rights, the reconciliation process would not be complete.</para><para>Gatjil Djerrkura, a personal friend and somebody whom I lived with on the Gove Peninsula, went on to declare that he cannot see how the government will advance the Prime Minister's agenda if it has Minister Ruddock moving around the country, talking about reconciliation, with Senator Herron travelling behind him preaching recrimination. We should remember that Senator Herron recently said that a generation of indigenous leaders `who had been around forever' should hand on leadership to people more interested in getting on with promoting the future. That is the greatest indictment I have heard coming from a minister for Aboriginal affairs.</para><para>You must understand that the traditional owners and indigenous leaders hold the knowledge and hold the power in their communities. They do not, in fact, move on when they get tired to make way for people who are more interested in getting on with promoting the future. That is not Aboriginal custom, that is not Aboriginal law, and it is a sad indictment that the federal minister for Aboriginal affairs does not understand that basic tenet of the way in which Aboriginal people operate. The Executive Director of the Kimberley Land Council, Peter Yu, called for the Prime Minister to give an indication of direction on indigenous affairs policies. He went on to say that reconciliation must be about maintaining their law and their culture.</para><para>It is clear that the election result has sent a message to the federal government that it has much work to do if reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia is to move beyond simple platitudes. Constantly trying to undermine the work of the land councils is not the way to go about the change that is needed. Nor is changing the joint management arrangements for the Kakadu and Uluru Kata Tjuta national parks 
 without the support of Aboriginal traditional owners the way to develop good relationships between the federal government and Aboriginal Territorians. The way in which the government intends to do that has yet to be announced.</para><para>Territory voters in the recent federal election made an informed choice in returning the territory to the Australian Labor Party. In doing so, they sent a very clear message to the federal government. But the statements and sentiments mentioned in the Governor-General's speech on that Tuesday show that the government has really not got it, and that very little is likely to change in the next few years.</para><para>In closing, I would like to make a few remarks about the proposed 30 per cent health rebate system. Something that I have not heard espoused by the federal government in the last week in either the House of Representatives or this chamber is a knowledge and understanding of private health in relation to people who live in rural, regional and, more particularly, remote Australia. There are 51,000 people in the Northern Territory who take out private health insurance. I do not know the figures as to how many are Aboriginal people, but I guess there would not be too many. In fact, I would say there are probably none.</para><para>If you live in any of the five regional centres outside of Darwin, there is no private hospital. There is no access to private doctors or to private services. In Darwin there is one private hospital, which offers a limited range of specialist services and a limited range of facilities. Most times you find that if you need any elective surgery or you need emergency surgery, despite the fact that you pay private health insurance, the private hospital does not provide it. So you have no choice; you end up in the public hospital anyway.</para><para>The Governor-General's speech talks about addressing the huge disparity in the health of our indigenous people and how it will continue to be a priority for the government. Where is the disparity in offering people a 30 per cent Medicare rebate? If you are an Aboriginal person living at Milingimbi, the disparity is widened. This government should 
 be looking at putting that money into providing better services in those communities and providing those people with better primary health care services at a level that is more commensurate with their high level of health need. There will be very few Aboriginal people in the Territory—probably none—who will benefit from this proposal. If the proposal were not successful and if it were not pursued by this federal government, there would be many Aboriginal people in the Territory who would benefit from an injection of over $1 billion worth of funds into the health system.</para><para>Most people in the Northern Territory that I speak to about their private health insurance say that it is not that they want more of a tax rebate; they want the problems in the system fixed up. They do not want to go to a physiotherapist and pay $40 and only get $15 back. They do not want to be told that they can only claim $600 a year back for orthodontist fees for their kids' teeth when it cost them $2,000. They want to be told that the gap is lessened and that they are not wasting their money on private health insurance. I think many people in the Territory do a few basic sums and work out that the money they could save on private health insurance would be better put in their own pocket, and they could just pay for whatever services they could not get in the public system.</para><para>There are many disadvantages in terms of a 30 per cent rebate in the tax system for people in the Northern Territory. In particular this government has failed to recognise that there is probably little access to private services in the Territory when it comes to health. There is little benefit in having private health insurance in the Northern Territory and there is little that these policies will do for people who live in the Northern Territory. </para><para>Even though this government has been returned, people in the Northern Territory, in particular Aboriginal voters, have overwhelmingly not supported this government. The result clearly shows that. I do not think this government can stand on a mandate of having won back rural and regional Australia, certainly not when it comes to the Northern Territory. If the policies and legislation that we have seen in the last couple of weeks 
 continue to unfold in the next three years, we are certain to enjoy the return of Warren Snowdon after the next election as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>943</page.no><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name><name.id>WP6</name.id><electorate>WA</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I came down as a rather impromptu fill-in tonight, but I am rather glad that I have after listening to Senator Crossin's contribution to the address-in-reply.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—That's how you got here.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name></talker><para>—Because I was speaking I did not hear what would normally be a very good interjection by Senator Forshaw, who I learnt quite recently was a man of letters. He studied literature at one of the universities in Australia. I always thought that English was his second language. So there you go; you can be quite mistaken about different people. I do appreciate your contribution by way of interjection, Senator Forshaw.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I was going to offer, in my contribution to the address in reply, the subject of health and those matters that are peripheral to that. Having lived in and worked in an environment very similar to what Senator Crossin spoke about, I think that I am reasonably equipped with both the experience and the theory of having lived there to reply to and rebut in the course of my delivery some of those things that she said.</para><para>Senator Crossin said that there is little benefit in having private health insurance. That may suit the Northern Territory but the fact is that the more that people take out private health insurance, the less pressure there is on public hospitals. And the less pressure there is on public hospitals, the less there are the queues that people on this other side so often speak about.</para><para>What they do not speak about on the other side is the fact that $16 billion was poured into Aboriginal health, among other things, during the 13 years of Labor. What have we seen with respect to the health of Aboriginal people? Have we seen the longevity of male or female rise? No. Have we seen the appalling child mortality rate decrease after the spending of that $16,000 million on Aboriginal people? No, the child mortality rate is 
 excessively high. Have we seen generally the health of Aboriginal people improve? No. Have we seen the rate of alcoholism and other health problems associated with Aboriginal people—they apply as well to other Australians, but I am talking specifically about Aboriginal people—reduce after the spending of that $16 billion? No, we have not seen it reduce.</para><para>The Labor Party want to play the part of the spoiler with respect to the 30 per cent rebate that was, as part of the Howard government mandate, to come in on 1 January 1999—just a few weeks away if this bill had been passed. It is not designed for wealthy people. In fact, 700,000 Australians are figured to have private health cover, yet earn $20,000 per annum or less.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">FORSHAW</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—It is designed for the Aborigines, is it?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Phillip</name><name role="display">Senator LIGHTFOOT</name></talker><para>—Yes, of course it is designed for the Aborigines. What I am saying, Senator Forshaw—I do thank you for that interjection to allow me to clear that point up—is that, if you alleviate the pressure on the public system, you make the queues shorter and you have waiting times reduced whether for elective or non-elective surgery. That is the whole point about it. You should not act as the spoiler in health; health is far too important for Australian people. It is not up to you to act as the spoiler. If you had a genuine case, yes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we are saying is that you can reduce the queue. You do help Aboriginal people if more people take out private health cover. You would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that for every one per cent of people who drop out of the private health system there is an increase in the collective states responsibilities of $82 million. We can make a mathematical equation of this: by next year, when it is expected that our 30 per cent rebate would come in, that would be 20 per cent that have dropped out of the private health system since 1990.</para><para>Quite obviously, that cannot be allowed to continue. Anyone who uses this Senate to spoil something as beneficial to Australians that impacts upon their health deserves some sort of punishment. I am not suggesting 
 anything other than that the polls should punish them. I guess the people of Australia will remember that the people on the other side had the opportunity to reduce those waiting queues in the public sector and they chose to play the part of the spoiler, to play with the health of Australians and to put at risk the young, old, rich and poor.</para><para>Let me get back to what I intended to speak about and that is health in the state of Western Australia. Western Australia—an area of 2.6 million square kilometres or one million square miles in the old system, which is still used largely across rural Australia—has special needs with respect to health. Not only do we have a large indigenous population, or people who choose to call themselves indigenous, but we also have a large outback population that obviously has, because of its geographical isolation, special health problems. We have people in rural areas who have special health problems. You heard Senator Crossin talk about the special needs of people where there are no hospitals, where there is no first aid. They must be catered for. Every Australian, regardless of where that person lives, deserves and must have adequate health cover and a system that is allowed to serve them.</para><para>In Western Australia we do have an excellent Royal Flying Doctor service, one that was initiated I think by Flynn of the Inland, who was born at Moliagul in Victoria. I remember reading about the first operation that was conducted over the old pedalsets in the early part of this century. A jackaroo on one of the Kimberley stations where I have spent some time had a ruptured appendix. He was operated on with a pocket knife with the assistance of the RFDS over a pedalset. History records that it was not only painful for this poor devil but also unsuccessful and he died some days later.</para><para>That has gone, but what has not gone is the tyranny of distance with respect to health in Western Australia. If health is worked out on a per capita grant basis across the states, then Western Australia is left wanting, and I think unreasonably so. There must be some assistance for the Northern Territory, Western 
 Australia and the northern part of Queensland, because of the isolation.</para><para>The area where I have spent most of my life, in the eastern and northern goldfields and the southern part of the Pilbara, does not have hospitals that one could describe as general hospitals. Fairly rich towns like Leonora, Leinster, Laverton, Meekatharra, Mt Magnet, Cue, Mt Newman and many of the mining towns such as Telfer do not have general hospitals, yet, in aggregate, they have a lot of people. Very little consideration is given to those towns with respect to their health needs. Most of those towns, with very few exceptions that I mentioned, have large Aboriginal populations. They do at least have an Aboriginal health system that caters for Aboriginal people, and others use it from time to time in emergencies. They do have the RFDS that can call on them, but Western Australia has special and particular needs with respect to health.</para><para>It is not as if Western Australia does not contribute to the financial wellbeing and financial health, if I could use that term, of the rest of Australia. We are, by any measure, the greatest contributor per capita of funds of any state in the nation. It has been figured that Western Australians contribute about double the average of people in the eastern states. Last year, for instance, there was a $5 billion record sale of gold, up from under $4 billion the previous fiscal year. It is these things that make me put a special case for Western Australia. The tyranny of distance that Aeneas Gunn wrote about many years ago in her famous book <inline font-style="italic">We of the Never Never</inline> describes that.</para><para>Western Australians in some areas are still going through this—38 per cent of that 2.6 million square kilometres that I spoke about is, in fact, pastoral leases. Those people, and any people in areas of isolation, have special causes that I would hope everyone in this room would think about and give some consideration to when the tripartite bills on health and the 30 per cent rebate come here shortly from the other place.</para><para>There is no question that the government was re-elected on a mandate, amongst other things, for a 30 per cent rebate in private 
 health cover contributions. We know now that that will give a return to an average family of $750 a year. We also know that that will alleviate the pressure on the public hospital system. We also know that there are people on that side of the chamber who want to act as spoilers, just as they want to act as spoilers with respect to the goods and services tax that everyone who is honest knows will alleviate and make workable what is unworkable at the moment. Everyone knows that we have an unworkable tax act. Everyone knows that it is so complex that not even the most specialist of accountants will give you a clear and concise answer to some questions.</para><para>Everyone knows that the sale of Telstra would have a great social benefit to people of Australia but, once again, that side of the chamber—the Labor Party and others—are acting as spoilers and are not going to let Australian people participate in that vast social benefit.</para><para>But we have something very special with respect to health. Health and education flow on and have the effect of uplifting every other area in the state or in the nation. It is no good wanting to destroy the health system in order to rebuild it—the phoenix will not rise out of the ashes like you think it will. If this 30 per cent rebate is not passed—for which a mandate was given at the election on 3 October—you will destroy the private health system. As one of your own—the former Senator Richardson, who was a former Minister for Health—said, the private health system will not function below 30 per cent.</para><para>We know now that it is there—or beyond that. We also know that it is falling two per cent per year, and we also know that the states cannot pick up that significant area of shortfall every time one per cent of the people drop out of private health. In Western Australia we pick up nearly $9 million a year. Over 10 years that is $90 million. It does not take too much of a mathematical genius to work out that over the ensuing period it will be significantly more than that and increasing at a greater rate.</para><para>I want to read into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a letter from the Australian Medical Association which, I assume, has been delivered to all members in 
 this place. The letter is over the signature of Dr Sandra Hacker, Vice President of that august body. In a salient part of the letter to me, she says on behalf of her association:</para><para>We believe the rebate will be an effective method of attracting additional people into private cover. Some 30% of lapsed health fund members said the rebate would encourage them to resume their cover and 32% of those who have never had private cover said they would be encouraged to take it out.</para><para>The Australian electorate is strongly in favour of the proposal. A Morgan Research survey showed that nearly 70% of Australians support the idea of a rebate for private health insurance.</para><para>The AMA is the peak body of doctors and general practitioners in Australia. Their figures are not manufactured, like some of those from the other side often are when quoted  in  statistics.  They  are  figures  that </para><para>clearly support the coalition's mandate, given on 3 October, for a 30 per cent rebate in private health cover.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><adjournment><adjournmentinfo><time.stamp>21:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>946</page.no></adjournmentinfo><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 9.50 p.m.</inline></para></adjournment><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>946</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>946</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><para>Civil Aviation Act—Civil Aviation Regulations—Civil Aviation Orders—Exemption No. CASA 43/1998.</para><para>Corporations Act—Accounting Standard AASB 1038—Life Insurance Business.</para><para>Currency Act—Currency Determination No. 7 of 1998.</para><para>Fishing Levy Act and Fisheries Management Act—Regulations—Statutory Rules 1998 No. 314.</para><para></para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript></hansard>
